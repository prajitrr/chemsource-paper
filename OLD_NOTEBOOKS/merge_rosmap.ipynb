         "Histidine (symbol His or H) is an essential amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated –NH3+ form under biological conditions), a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated –COO− form under biological conditions), and an imidazole side chain (which is partially protonated), classifying it as a positively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Initially thought essential only for infants, it has now been shown in longer-term studies to be essential for adults also. It is encoded by the codons CAU and CAC. Histidine was first isolated by Albrecht Kossel and Sven Gustaf Hedin in 1896. The name stems from its discovery in tissue, from ἱστός histós \"tissue\". It is also a precursor to histamine, a vital inflammatory agent in immune responses. The acyl radical is histidyl. == Properties of the imidazole side chain == The conjugate acid (protonated form) of the imidazole side chain in histidine has a pKa of approximately 6.0. Thus, below a pH of 6, the imidazole ring is mostly protonated (as described by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation). The resulting imidazolium ring bears two NH bonds and has a positive charge. The positive charge is equally distributed between both nitrogens and can be represented with two equally important resonance structures. Sometimes, the symbol Hip is used for this protonated form instead of the usual His. Above pH 6, one of the two protons is lost. The remaining proton of the imidazole ring can reside on either nitrogen, giving rise to what are known as the N3-H or N1-H tautomers. The N3-H tautomer is shown in the figure above. In the N1-H tautomer, the NH is nearer the backbone. These neutral tautomers, also referred to as Nε (or Nτ) and Nδ (or Nπ), are sometimes referred to with symbols Hie and Hid, respectively. The imidazole/imidazolium ring of histidine is aromatic at all pH values. Under certain conditions, all three ion-forming groups of histidine can be charged forming the histidinium cation. The acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain are relevant to the catalytic mechanism of many enzymes. In catalytic triads, the basic nitrogen of histidine abstracts a proton from serine, threonine, or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. In carbonic anhydrases, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a zinc-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme. In helices E and F of hemoglobin, histidine influences binding of dioxygen as well as carbon monoxide. This interaction enhances the affinity of Fe(II) for O2 but destabilizes the binding of CO, which binds only 200 times stronger in hemoglobin, compared to 20,000 times stronger in free heme. The tautomerism and acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain has been characterized by 15N NMR spectroscopy. The two 15N chemical shifts are similar (about 200 ppm, relative to nitric acid on the sigma scale, on which increased shielding corresponds to increased chemical shift). NMR spectral measurements shows that the chemical shift of N1-H drops slightly, whereas the chemical shift of N3-H drops considerably (about 190 vs. 145 ppm). This change indicates that the N1-H tautomer is preferred, possibly due to hydrogen bonding to the neighboring ammonium. The shielding at N3 is substantially reduced due to the second-order paramagnetic effect, which involves a symmetry-allowed interaction between the nitrogen lone pair and the excited π* states of the aromatic ring. At pH > 9, the chemical shifts of N1 and N3 are approximately 185 and 170 ppm. === Ligand === Histidine forms complexes with many metal ions. The imidazole sidechain of the histidine residue commonly serves as a ligand in metalloproteins. One example is the axial base attached to Fe in myoglobin and hemoglobin. Poly-histidine tags (of six or more consecutive H residues) are utilized for protein purification by binding to columns with nickel or cobalt, with micromolar affinity. Natural poly-histidine peptides, found in the venom of the viper Atheris squamigera have been shown to bind Zn(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) and affect the function of venom metalloproteases. N-terminal histidines are known to function as bidentate ligands, with a metal (generally copper) bound to both the amine of the N-terminus and the Nε of the histidine; the Nδ is often methylated. Although recently discovered, this \"histidine brace\" motif is critical in biogeochemical cycles: it functions as the active site of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which break down unreactive polysaccharides such as cellulose. It is proposed that the evolution of these enzymes in fungi corresponds to the first widespread ability to decompose woody plant mass, leading to the end of the Carboniferous era and its mass accumulation of coal deposits. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === l-Histidine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized de novo in humans. Humans and other animals must ingest histidine or histidine-containing proteins. The biosynthesis of histidine has been widely studied in prokaryotes such as E. coli. Histidine synthesis in E. coli involves eight gene products (His1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and it occurs in ten steps. This is possible because a single gene product has the ability to catalyze more than one reaction. For example, as shown in the pathway, His4 catalyzes 4 different steps in the pathway. Histidine is synthesized from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is made from ribose-5-phosphate by ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase in the pentose phosphate pathway. The first reaction of histidine biosynthesis is the condensation of PRPP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the enzyme ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase. ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is indicated by His1 in the image. His4 gene product then hydrolyzes the product of the condensation, phosphoribosyl-ATP, producing phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP), which is an irreversible step. His4 then catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylformiminoAICAR-phosphate, which is then converted to phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P by the His6 gene product. His7 splits phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P to form d-erythro-imidazole-glycerol-phosphate. After, His3 forms imidazole acetol-phosphate releasing water. His5 then makes l-histidinol-phosphate, which is then hydrolyzed by His2 making histidinol. His4 catalyzes the oxidation of l-histidinol to form l-histidinal, an amino aldehyde. In the last step, l-histidinal is converted to l-histidine. The histidine biosynthesis pathway has been studied in the fungus Neurospora crassa, and a gene (His-3) encoding a multienzyme complex was found that was similar to the His4 gene of the bacterium E. coli. A genetic study of N. crassa histidine mutants indicated that the individual activities of the multienzyme complex occur in discrete, contiguous sections of the His-3 genetic map, suggesting that the different activities of the multienzyme complex are encoded separately from each other. However, mutants were also found that lacked all three activities simultaneously, suggesting that some mutations cause loss of function of the complex as a whole. Just like animals and microorganisms, plants need histidine for their growth and development. Microorganisms and plants are similar in that they can synthesize histidine. Both synthesize histidine from the biochemical intermediate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. In general, the histidine biosynthesis is very similar in plants and microorganisms. ==== Regulation of biosynthesis ==== This pathway requires energy in order to occur therefore, the presence of ATP activates the first enzyme of the pathway, ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase (shown as His1 in the image on the right). ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is the rate determining enzyme, which is regulated through feedback inhibition meaning that it is inhibited in the presence of the product, histidine. === Degradation === Histidine is one of the amino acids that can be converted to intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle). Histidine, along with other amino acids such as proline and arginine, takes part in deamination, a process in which its amino group is removed. In prokaryotes, histidine is first converted to urocanate by histidase. Then, urocanase converts urocanate to 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. Imidazolonepropionase catalyzes the reaction to form formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) from 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. The formimino group is transferred to tetrahydrofolate, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate. Overall, these reactions result in the formation of glutamate and ammonia. Glutamate can then be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form α-ketoglutarate. === Conversion to other biologically active amines === The histidine amino acid is a precursor for histamine, an amine produced in the body necessary for inflammation. The enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase converts histidine into ammonia and urocanic acid. A deficiency in this enzyme is present in the rare metabolic disorder histidinemia, producing urocanic aciduria as a key diagnostic finding. Histidine can be converted to 3-methylhistidine, which serves as a biomarker for skeletal muscle damage, by certain methyltransferase enzymes. Histidine is also a precursor for carnosine biosynthesis, which is a dipeptide found in skeletal muscle. In Actinomycetota and filamentous fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, histidine can be converted into the antioxidant ergothioneine. == Requirements == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For histidine, for adults 19 years and older, 14 mg/kg body weight/day. Supplemental histidine is being investigated for use in a variety of different conditions, including neurological disorders, atopic dermatitis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, uraemic anaemia, ulcers, inflammatory bowel diseases, malignancies, and muscle performance during strenuous exercise. == See also == Carnosinemia Beta-Alanine Diphthamide Pauly reaction == References == == External links == Histidine MS Spectrum",

         " Two experiments were conducted to investigate the production effects of N-acetyl-l-methionine (NALM; experiment 1) and to estimate its bioavailability (BA) and rumen escape (RE; experiment 2), respectively, in lactating dairy cows. In experiment 1, 18 multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated, 3 × 3 Latin square design experiment with three 28-d periods. Treatments were (1) basal diet estimated to supply 45 g/d digestible Met (dMet) or 1.47% of metabolizable protein (MP; control), (2) basal diet top-dressed with 32 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.2% of MP, and (3) basal diet top-dressed with 56 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.6% of MP. The NALM treatments supplied estimated 17 and 29 g/d dMet from NALM, respectively, based on manufacturer's specifications. In experiment 2, 4 rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment with four 12-d periods. A 12-d period for baseline data collection and 4 d for determination of RE of NALM preceded the Latin square experiment. For determination of RE, 30 g of NALM were dosed into the rumen simultaneously with Cr-EDTA (used as a rumen fluid kinetics marker) and samples of ruminal contents were collected at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Rumen escape of NALM was calculated using the estimated passage rate based on the measured Cr rate of disappearance. Bioavailability of abomasally dosed NALM was determined using the area under the curve of plasma Met concentration technique. Two doses of l-Met (providing 7.5 and 15 g of dMet) and 2 doses of NALM (11.2 and 14.4 g of dMet) were separately pulse-dosed into the abomasum of the cows and blood was collected from the jugular vein for Met concentration analysis at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Supplementation of NALM did not affect DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, or milk protein and lactose concentrations and yields in experiment 1. Milk fat concentration and energy-corrected milk yield decreased linearly with NALM dose. Plasma Met concentration was not affected by NALM dose. The estimated relative BA of abomasally dosed NALM (experiment 2) was 50% when dosed at 14.4 g/cow (11.2 g/d dMet from NALM) and 24% when dosed at 28.8 g/cow (14.4 g/d dMet from NALM). The estimated RE of NALM was 19% based on the measured k Neutral amino acids can be delivered into cells through the l-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1), which is a sodium independent transporter. The LAT1 protein is expressed in different tissues, including kidney, blood brain barrier and intestinal wall hence LAT1 can be used as a target in diseases associated with its overexpression. In-silico interactions between different ligands, including methionine (Met), N-acetyl-l-methionine (AcMet), hyaluronic acid (HA), grafted hyaluronic-acid l-methionine (HA-ADH-Met) and a novel grafted hyaluronic acid-N-acetyl-l-methionine (HA-ADH-AcMet), which are at the active site of the LAT1 transporter, were studied and the binding energies calculated. The HA-ADH-AcMet complex demonstrated binding energy and solvation energy of -74.84 and 81.46 kcal/mol, respectively, thus validating its potential to be synthesized. The structural conformation of the HA-ADH-AcMet was confirmed using  Methionine plays a vital role in protein synthesis, and regulation of antioxidant response in ruminants. This study aimed to assess the effects of dietary supplementation with N-acetyl-l-methionine (NALM), which serves a source of rumen-protected methionine, on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and oxidative stability. Sixty Angus heifers (initial body weight = 408 ± 51.2 kg, 15-18 months) were stratified by body weight and randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: a control group (0% NALM), and experimental groups receiving diets containing 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.50% NALM (dry matter (DM) basis), respectively. The experiment included a 2-week adaptation and a 22-week data and sample collection period. Results indicated that blood urea nitrogen in the plasma of the 0.25% NALM group was lower compared to the control and the 0.50% NALM groups (P = 0.02). The plasma methionine (P = 0.04), proline (P < 0.01), and tryptophan (P = 0.05) were higher in the 0.25% and 0.50% NALM groups, as well as the methionine and proline in the muscle of the 0.25% NALM group (P < 0.01). The muscle pH (P < 0.01) was increased by supplementing 0.25% and 0.50% NALM in diets but decreased the lactate (P < 0.01). The 0.25% NALM group also increased a* (P = 0.05), decreased L* (P = 0.05), drip loss (P = 0.01), and glycolytic potential in the muscle (P < 0.01). The total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione in muscle of 0.25% NALM group were higher than that of the control (P < 0.01), and the malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were lower (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the dietary supplement with NALM improves meat quality by enhancing the antioxidant effect of lipids and proteins.",

         "Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar used in the treatment of constipation and hepatic encephalopathy. It is administered orally for constipation, and either orally or rectally for hepatic encephalopathy. It generally begins working after 8–12 hours, but may take up to 2 days to improve constipation. Common side effects include abdominal bloating and cramps. A potential exists for electrolyte problems as a result of the diarrhea it produces. No evidence of harm to the fetus has been found when used during pregnancy. It is generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding. It is classified as an osmotic laxative. Lactulose was first made in 1929, and has been used medically since the 1950s. Lactulose is made from the milk sugar lactose, which is composed of two simple sugars, galactose and glucose. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 267th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Constipation === Lactulose is used in the treatment of chronic constipation in patients of all ages as a long-term treatment. The dosage of lactulose for chronic idiopathic constipation is adjusted depending on the constipation severity and desired effect, from a mild stool softener to causing diarrhea. Lactulose is contraindicated in case of galactosemia, as most preparations contain the monosaccharide galactose due to its synthesis process. Lactulose may be used to counter the constipating effects of opioids, and in the symptomatic treatment of hemorrhoids as a stool softener. Lactulose is commonly prescribed for children who develop fear of their bowel movements and are withholders. This is because lactulose, when dosed in the proper amount, causes a bowel movement that is impossible to retain for very long. Lactulose is also used for the elderly because of its gentle and consistent results. === Hyperammonemia === Lactulose is useful in treating hyperammonemia (high blood ammonia), which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose helps trap the ammonia (NH3) in the colon and bind to it. It does this by using gut flora to acidify the colon, transforming the freely diffusible ammonia into ammonium ions (NH+4), which can no longer diffuse back into the blood. It is also useful for preventing hyperammonemia caused as a side effect of administration of valproic acid. === Small intestine bacterial overgrowth === Lactulose is used as a test of small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Recently, the reliability of it for diagnosing SIBO has been seriously questioned. A large amount of it is given with subsequent testing of molecular hydrogen gas in the breath. The test is positive if an increase in exhaled hydrogen occurs before that which would be expected by normal digestion by the normal gut flora in the colon. An earlier result has been hypothesized to indicate digestion occurring within the small intestine. An alternate explanation for differences in results is the variance in small bowel transit time among tested subjects. === Pregnancy === No evidence of harm to the fetus has been found when used during pregnancy. It is generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding. == Side effects == Common side effects of lactulose are abdominal cramping, borborygmus, and flatulence. In normal individuals, overdose is considered uncomfortable, but not life-threatening. Uncommon side effects are nausea and vomiting. In sensitive individuals, such as the elderly or people with reduced kidney function, excess lactulose dosage can result in dehydration and electrolyte disturbances such as low magnesium levels. Ingestion of lactulose does not cause a weight gain because it is not digestible, with no nutritional value. Although lactulose is less likely to cause dental caries than sucrose, as a sugar, a potential for this exists, which is relevant when taken by people with a high susceptibility to this condition. == Mechanism of action == Lactulose is not absorbed in the small intestine nor broken down by human enzymes, thus stays in the digestive bolus through most of its course, causing retention of water through osmosis leading to softer, easier-to-pass stool. It has a secondary laxative effect in the colon, where it is fermented by the gut flora, producing metabolites which have osmotic powers and peristalsis-stimulating effects (such as acetate), but also methane associated with flatulence. Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by bacterial flora into short-chain fatty acids, including lactic acid and acetic acid. These partially dissociate, acidifying the colonic contents (increasing the H+ concentration in the gut). This favors the formation of the nonabsorbable NH+4 from NH3, trapping NH3 in the colon and effectively reducing plasma NH3 concentrations. Lactulose is therefore effective in treating hepatic encephalopathy. Specifically, it is effective as secondary prevention of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis. Moreover, research showed improved cognitive functions and health-related quality of life in people with cirrhosis with minimal hepatic encephalopathy treated with lactulose. == Chemistry == Lactulose is a disaccharide formed from one molecule each of the simple sugars (monosaccharides) fructose and galactose. Lactulose is not normally present in raw milk, but is a product of heat processes: the greater the heat, the greater amount of this substance (from 3.5 mg/L in low-temperature pasteurized milk to 744 mg/L in in-container sterilized milk). Lactulose is produced commercially by isomerization of lactose. A variety of reaction conditions and catalysts can be used. == Society and culture == === Name === Lactulose is its international nonproprietary name (INN). It is sold under various brand names. === Availability === Lactulose is available as a generic medication. It is available without prescription in most countries, but a prescription is required in the United States, Philippines, and Austria. === Food additive === In some countries where lactulose may be obtained without a prescription, lactulose is commonly used as a food additive to improve taste and promote intestinal transit. == Veterinary use == Lactulose is used in veterinary medicine. == References == == External links ==",

         "Phenylacetylglutamine is a product formed by the conjugation of phenylacetate and glutamine. It is a common metabolite that occurs naturally in human urine. The highly-nitrogenous compound is most commonly encountered in human subjects with urea cycle disorders,. These conditions, such as uremia or hyperammonemia, tend to cause high levels of nitrogen in the form of ammonia in the blood. Uremic conditions are a result of defects in enzymes that convert ammonia to urea, the primary nitrogenous waste metabolite in the urea cycle. == Metabolism == Phenylacetylglutamine is the primary metabolite of the degradation of phenylacetate when in the presence of glutamine in the liver. It is also produced in higher concentrations in the body through the metabolic degradation pathway of the pharmaceutical compounds sodium phenylbutyrate, glycerol phenylbutyrate, and sodium phenylacetate, considered more toxic, that are used as treatments for the physiological dysfunction in urea cycling. Phenylbutyrate is beta-oxidized into phenylacetate which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and excreted by the kidney. Phenylacetylglutamine is the product of uremic conditions that require an alternative pathway to the urea cycle for nitrogen waste removal. This process produces comparable levels of phenylacetylglutamine in urine in relation to urea levels in a properly functioning urea cycle. In 24 hours 80-100% of a dose of phenylbutyrate is excreted in the urine as phenylacetylglutamine. The metabolism and conjugation of phenylacetate with glutamine in the liver involves amino acid acetylation carried out by the enzyme phenylacetyltranferase or glutamine N-acetyl transferase. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction of the substrates phenylacetyl-CoA and L-glutamine to produce CoA and alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine and phenylacetic acid. The catalytic enzyme has been isolated in the human liver mitochondria. Furthermore, phenylacetylglutamine has been found in human urine, but not in the excretory material of rats, dogs, cats, monkeys, sheep, or horses. Throughout the metabolic process, phenylacetylglutamine is bound and conjugated by free-plasma in the kidney to remove excess nitrogen through its excretion in the urine. == As a biomarker == Elevated levels of nitrogen in the blood increase the amount of glutamine, the primary, non-toxic carrier of ammonia in the blood, within patients with hyperammonemia and inborn errors in urea synthesis. Phenylacetylglutamine levels in the urine serves as a more effective biomarker for the excretion of nitrogenous waste than measures of blood plasma, which fluctuate and are a less effective therapeutic monitor of waste nitrogen levels. A 24-hour metabolic urine test of phenylacetylglutamine provides a non-invasive biomarker of waste nitrogen that most consistently reflects the dose of phenylbutyric acid or glycerol phenylbutyrate used to treat patients with urea-cycle disorders. Phenylacetylglutamine isotopically labeled with 14C also serves more broadly to characterize relative rates of cellular reactions and functions as a general, non-invasive biomarker for gluconeogenesis and citric acid cycle intermediates in the liver. == Chronic kidney disorder == High levels of phenylacetylglutamine in the urine following metabolism by the gut microbiota may also indicate early renal decline associated with kidney dysfunction and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD, phenylacetylglutamine is considered a uremic toxin which is taken up, circulated and retained in the blood after microbial fermentation of certain proteins and amino acids in the gut. Blood serum levels of phenylacetylglutamine in CKD are used as a mortality determinant. Blood plasma levels of phenylacetylglutamine increase with exposure to cigarette smoke, in patients with ischemic heart failure, with cardiovascular risk or hypertension, in the development of renal disease, and in patients with type 2 diabetes. == See also == Glycerol phenylbutyrate Sodium phenylacetate Sodium phenylbutyrate == References ==",

         "('Carbamazepine', 'Tegretol', 'Carbamazepen', 'Biston', 'Finlepsin')",
         "Carbamazepine, sold under the brand name Tegretol among others, is an anticonvulsant medication used in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. It is used as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia along with other medications and as a second-line agent in bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine appears to work as well as phenytoin and valproate for focal and generalized seizures. It is not effective for absence or myoclonic seizures. Carbamazepine was discovered in 1953 by Swiss chemist Walter Schindler. It was first marketed in 1962. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was the 185th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. Photoswitchable analogues of carbamazepine have been developed to control its pharmacological activity locally and on demand using light (photopharmacology), with the purpose of reducing the adverse systemic effects of the drug. One of these light-regulated compounds (carbadiazocine, based on a bridged azobenzene or diazocine) has been shown to produce analgesia with noninvasive illumination in vivo in a rat model of neuropathic pain. == Medical uses == Carbamazepine is typically used for the treatment of seizure disorders and neuropathic pain. It is used off-label as a second-line treatment for bipolar disorder and in combination with an antipsychotic in some cases of schizophrenia when treatment with a conventional antipsychotic alone has failed. However, evidence does not support its usage for schizophrenia. It is not effective for absence seizures or myoclonic seizures. Although carbamazepine may have a similar effectiveness (as measured by people continuing to use a medication) and efficacy (as measured by the medicine reducing seizure recurrence and improving remission) when compared to phenytoin and valproate, choice of medication should be evaluated on an individual basis as further research is needed to determine which medication is most helpful for people with newly-onset seizures. In the United States, carbamazepine is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy (including partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and mixed seizures), and trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine is the only medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. As of 2014, a controlled release formulation was available for which there is tentative evidence showing fewer side effects and unclear evidence with regard to whether there is a difference in efficacy. It has also been shown to improve symptoms of \"typewriter tinnitus\", a type of tinnitus caused by the neurovascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve. == Adverse effects == In the US, the label for carbamazepine contains warnings concerning: effects on the body's production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets: rarely, there are major effects of aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis reported and more commonly, there are minor changes such as decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, but these do not progress to more serious problems. increased risks of suicide increased risks of hyponatremia and SIADH risk of seizures, if the person stops taking the drug abruptly risks to the fetus in women who are pregnant, specifically congenital malformations like spina bifida, and developmental disorders. Pancreatitis Hepatitis Dizziness Bone marrow suppression Stevens–Johnson syndrome Common adverse effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and migraines, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and/or constipation. Alcohol use while taking carbamazepine may lead to enhanced depression of the central nervous system. Less common side effects may include increased risk of seizures in people with mixed seizure disorders, abnormal heart rhythms, blurry or double vision. Also, rare case reports of an auditory side effect have been made, whereby patients perceive sounds about a semitone lower than previously; this unusual side effect is usually not noticed by most people, and disappears after the person stops taking carbamazepine. === Pharmacogenetics === Serious skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) due to carbamazepine therapy are more common in people with a particular human leukocyte antigen gene-variant (allele), HLA-B*1502. Odds ratios for the development of SJS or TEN in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele has been shown to be a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions, such as the DRESS form of severe cutaneous reactions, to carbamazepine among Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Europeans. It is suggested that carbamazepine acts as a potent antigen that binds to the antigen-presenting area of HLA-B*1502 alike, triggering an everlasting activation signal on immature CD8-T cells, thus resulting in widespread cytotoxic reactions like SJS/TEN. == Interactions == Carbamazepine has a potential for drug interactions. Drugs that decrease breaking down of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include erythromycin, cimetidine, propoxyphene, and calcium channel blockers. Grapefruit juice raises the bioavailability of carbamazepine by inhibiting the enzyme CYP3A4 in the gut wall and in the liver. Lower levels of carbamazepine are seen when administered with phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone, which can result in breakthrough seizure activity. Valproic acid and valnoctamide both inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide into inactive metabolites. By inhibiting mEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a build-up of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion. Carbamazepine, as an inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, may increase clearance of many drugs, decreasing their concentration in the blood to subtherapeutic levels and reducing their desired effects. Drugs that are more rapidly metabolized with carbamazepine include warfarin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, theophylline, valproic acid, many benzodiazepines, and methadone. Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in birth control pills and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Carbamazepine is a sodium channel blocker. It binds preferentially to voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive conformation, which prevents repetitive and sustained firing of an action potential. Carbamazepine has effects on serotonin systems but the relevance to its antiseizure effects is uncertain. There is evidence that it is a serotonin releasing agent and possibly even a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It has been suggested that carbamazepine can also block voltage-gated calcium channels, which will reduce neurotransmitter release. === Pharmacokinetics === Carbamazepine is relatively slowly but practically completely absorbed after administration by mouth. Highest concentrations in the blood plasma are reached after 4 to 24 hours depending on the dosage form. Slow release tablets result in about 15% lower absorption and 25% lower peak plasma concentrations than ordinary tablets, as well as in less fluctuation of the concentration, but not in significantly lower minimum concentrations. In the circulation, carbamazepine itself comprises 20 to 30% of total residues. The remainder is in the form of metabolites; 70 to 80% of residues is bound to plasma proteins. Concentrations in breast milk are 25 to 60% of those in the blood plasma. Carbamazepine itself is not pharmacologically active. It is activated, mainly by CYP3A4, to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, which is solely responsible for the drug's anticonvulsant effects. The epoxide is then inactivated by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) to carbamazepine-trans-10,11-diol and further to its glucuronides. Other metabolites include various hydroxyl derivatives and carbamazepine-N-glucuronide. The plasma half-life is about 35 to 40 hours when carbamazepine is given as single dose, but it is a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and the plasma half-life shortens to about 12 to 17 hours when it is given repeatedly. The half-life can be further shortened to 9–10 hours by other enzyme inducers such as phenytoin or phenobarbital. About 70% are excreted via the urine, almost exclusively in form of its metabolites, and 30% via the faeces. == History == Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of Novartis) in Basel, Switzerland, in 1953. It was first marketed as a drug to treat epilepsy in Switzerland in 1963 under the brand name Tegretol; its use for trigeminal neuralgia (formerly known as tic douloureux) was introduced at the same time. It has been used as an anticonvulsant and antiepileptic in the United Kingdom since 1965, and has been approved in the United States since 1968. Carbamazepine was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s. == Society and culture == === Environmental impact === Carbamazepine and its bio-transformation products have been detected in wastewater treatment plant effluent: 224 and in streams receiving treated wastewater. Field and laboratory studies have been conducted to understand the accumulation of carbamazepine in food plants grown in soil treated with sludge, which vary with respect to the concentrations of carbamazepine present in sludge and in the concentrations of sludge in the soil. Taking into account only studies that used concentrations commonly found in the environment, a 2014 review concluded that \"the accumulation of carbamazepine into plants grown in soil amended with biosolids poses a de minimis risk to human health according to the approach.\": 227 === Brand names === Carbamazepine is available worldwide under many brand names including Tegretol. == Research == == References == == Further reading == == External links == \"Carbamazepine\".

         " Microorganisms produce a large number of pharmacologically and biotechnologically important peptides by using nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Due to their modular arrangement and their domain organization NRPSs are particularly suitable for engineering recombinant proteins for the production of novel peptides with interesting properties. In order to compare different strategies of domain assembling and module fusions we focused on the selective construction of a set of peptide synthetases that catalyze the formation of the dipeptide alpha-l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine (Asp-Phe), the precursor of the high-intensity sweetener alpha-l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester (aspartame). The de novo design of six different Asp-Phe synthetases was achieved by fusion of Asp and Phe activating modules comprising adenylation, peptidyl carrier protein and condensation domains. Product release was ensured by a C-terminally fused thioesterase domains and quantified by HPLC/MS analysis. Significant differences of enzyme activity caused by the fusion strategies were observed. Two forms of the Asp-Phe dipeptide were detected, the expected alpha-Asp-Phe and the by-product beta-Asp-Phe. Dependent on the turnover rates ranging from 0.01-0.7 min-1, the amount of alpha-Asp-Phe was between 75 and 100% of overall product, indicating a direct correlation between the turnover numbers and the ratios of alpha-Asp-Phe to beta-Asp-Phe. Taken together these results provide useful guidelines for the rational construction of hybrid peptide synthetases. Cross-linked polyurethane (PU) was prepared for entrapping thermolysin. Using the immobilized thermolysin (IT), Z-L-aspartic acid (ZA) was reacted with -Lphenylalanine methyl ester (L-PM) in water-saturated ethyl acetate to give only alpha-Z-L-aspartylL-phenylalanine methyl ester (alpha-ZAPM). Ninety-four percent conversion of alpha-ZAPM was obtained for 30 h of reaction at 40 degrees C when 46 mg of enzyme was entrapped. PU support prepared from polypropylene glycol (#2000) showed better properties than from polypropylene (#1000) and polyethylene (#1000). Addition of polyol could increase the gel fraction of PU. The IT PU-ll-G-3, prepared from 1/2 mole ratio of PPG (#2000)/glycerin, gave the highest gel fraction and best swelling, and 89.0% of residual activity was obtained after four times of reuse (72 h). The stability of immobilized thermolysin was good; the activity loss resulting from degradatin and leak of enzyme in each time of reuse were found only about 2%. The kinetics of immobilized thermolysin-catalyzed condensation reaction of ZA with L-PM in water-saturated ethyl acetate was found to be first order in L-PM and the Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/V against 1/[ZA] yields a straight line, showing that the reaction involves consecutive reactions of ZA and L-PM with the immobilized enzyme and with the ZA-immobilized enzyme complex, with the second reaction being the rate determining step.",

         " Depression is a severe mental illness affecting patient's physical and mental health. However, long-term effects of existing therapeutic modalities for depression are not satisfactory. Geniposide is an iridoid compound highly expressed in gardenia jasminoides for removing annoyance. The activity of geniposide against depression has been widely studied while most studies concentrated on the expression levels of gene and protein. Herein, the aim of the present study was to employ non-target metabolomic platform of serum to investigate metabolic changes of depression mice and further verify in hippocampus for analyzing the antidepressant mechanism of geniposide. Then we discovered that 9 metabolites of serum were significantly increased in depressive group (prostaglandin E2, leukotriene C4, arachidonic acid, phosphatidylcholine (PC, 16:0/16:0), LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/0:0), phosphatidylethanolamine (14:0/16:0), creatine, oleamide and aminomalonic acid) and 6 metabolites were decreased (indoxylsulfuric acid, testosterone, lactic acid, glucose 6-phosphate, leucine and valine). The levels of arachidonic acid, LysoPC, lactic acid and glucose 6-phosphate in hippocampus were consistent change with serum in depression mice. Most of them showed significant tendencies to be normal by geniposide treatment. Metabolic pathway analysis indicated that arachidonic acid metabolism and glucose metabolism were the main pathogenesis for the antidepressant effect of geniposide. In addition, the levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 were increased in depressive mice and reversed after geniposide treatment. This study revealed that abnormal metabolism of inflammatory response and glucose metabolism of the serum and hippocampus involved in the occurrence of depressive disorder and antidepressant effect of geniposide. To explore the metabolic differences of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) by metabonomics, to find potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of FTC, and to explore the pathogenesis and diagnosis and treatment strategies of FTC. The metabonomics of 15 patients with FTC and 15 patients with follicular thyroid nodules(FTN) treated in Henan Cancer Hospital were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The analysis showed that the metabolite profiles of FTC tissues could be well distinguished from those of control tissues, and 6 kinds of lipids were identified respectively, including lysophosphatidic acid(LysoPA) [LysoPA(0:0/18:0),LysoPA(0:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)],LysoPA[20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/0:0)]; phosphatidic acid(PA) [PA(20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/0:0),PA(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/0:0),PA(20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/0:0)]; lysophosphatidylcholine(LPC) [LPC(18:1),LPC(16:0),LPC[16:1(9Z)/0:0],LPC(17:0),LPC[22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z),LPC(20:2(11Z,14Z); phosphatidylcholine(PC)(PC(14:0/0:0),PC(16:0/0:0); sphingomyelin(SM) (d18:0/12:0); fatty acid(FA)(18:1(OH3)]. There are 2 kinds of amino acids, including L-glutamate,L-glutamine.There are 3 other metabolites, including retinol,flavin adenine dinucleotide,androsterone glucuronide.Lipid metabolites are the main metabolites in these metabolites.The metabolic pathways related to FTC were analyzed by KEGG and HMDB, and 9 metabolic pathways were found, including 4 amino acid related metabolic pathways, 1 lipid metabolic pathways and 4 other related pathways. There are significant differences in many metabonomic characteristics between FTC and FTN, suggesting that these metabolites can be used as potential biomarkers. Further study found that LysoPA and its analogues can be used as biomarkers in the early diagnosis of FTC.It may be related to the abnormal metabolism of phospholipase D (PLD), the key enzyme of LysoPA synthesis caused by RAS pathway. At the same time, it was found that the metabolic pathway of amino acids and lipids was the main metabolic pathway of FTC. The abnormality of LysoPA may be the cause of follicular tumor carcinogenesis caused by lipid metabolic pathway. Our aim was to identify changes in the metabolome in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well as to construct a metabolic diagnostic model for DCM. We utilized non-targeted metabolomics with a cross-sectional cohort of age- and sex-matched DCM patients and controls. Metabolomics data were analyzed using orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and pathway analysis. It was validated in combination with transcriptome sequencing data from public databases. Machine learning models were used for the diagnosis of DCM. Using multiple analytical techniques, 130 metabolite alterations were identified in DCM compared to healthy controls. Perturbations in glycerophospholipid metabolism (GPL) were identified and validated as a characteristic metabolic pathway in DCM. Through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we identified the 7 most important GPL metabolites, including LysoPA (16:0/0:0), LysoPA (18:1(9Z)/0:0), PC (20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/20:1(11Z)), PC (20:0/14:0), LysoPC (16:0), PS(15:0/18:0), and PE(16:0/20:4 (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)). The machine learning models based on the seven metabolites all had good accuracy in distinguishing DCM [All area under the curve (AUC) > 0.900], and the artificial neural network (ANN) model performed the most consistently (AUC: 0.919 ± 0.075). This study demonstrates that GPL metabolism may play a contributing role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of DCM. The 7-GPL metabolite model may help for early diagnosis of DCM.",

         " Novel Val-Val dipeptide-benzenesulfonamide conjugates were reported in this study. These were achieved by a condensation reaction of p-substituted benzenesulfonamoyl alkanamides with 2-amino-4-methyl-N-substituted phenyl butanamide using classical peptide-coupling reagents. The compounds were characterized using Fourier transform infrared,  Fumaric acid esters (FAE) are beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis. However, about a third of psoriasis patients do not respond to FAE. We aimed to determine whether glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTP1 polymorphisms are associated with treatment outcome in psoriasis patients treated with FAE. We studied 84 psoriasis patients who were treated with FAE for 3 months. FAE nonresponders were defined as having psoriasis area and severity improvement index less than 50% after 3-month therapy. GSTM1 genotyping for gene deletion and GSTP1 exon 5 105 Ile→Val polymorphisms were assessed using a high-resolution melting analysis. A dropout rate of 23.8% (20/84) was found; 25% (16/64) were FAE nonresponders. We observed 42 (84/50%) patients with G 9STM1*0 homozygous alleles and 42 (84/50%) patients with one or two active GSTM1 alleles. The Ile/Ile GSTP1 genotype was observed in 37 (84/44%), the Ile/Val GSTP1 genotype in 38 (84/45.2%) patients and the Val/Val GSTP1 genotype in nine (84/10.7%) patients. There was no significant (P>0.05) association between the GST genotypes assessed and the frequency FAE responder status, except for the Val/Val GSTP1 polymorphism, which was a significant (overall model fit; P=0.0012) predictor for nonresponders with an odds ratio of 43.4 (95% confidence interval: 4.2-511.1). The coefficient of regression was 3.9, with a SE of 1.2 as assessed by logistic regression analysis (P=0.0017). The Val/Val GSTP1 polymorphism predicts nonresponders in FAE treatment of psoriasis patients and may therefore serve as a biomarker that enables a laboratory-based pretreatment selection of patients. Val-Val-Tyr-Pro (VVYP) peptide is one of the main active components of Globin digest (GD). Our previous studies indicated that VVYP could protect against acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver failure in mice and decrease blood lipid level. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of VVYP in the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) have not been discovered. Our present study was designed to investigate the preventive effect of VVYP on NASH and its underlying specific mechanisms. We found that VVYP inhibited the cytotoxicity and lipid accumulation in L-02 cells that were exposed to a mixture of free fatty acid (FFA). VVYP effectively alleviated the liver injury induced by methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet, demonstrated by reducing the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/triglycerides (TG)/non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and improving liver histology. VVYP decreased expression levels of lipid synthesis-related genes and reduced levels of the proinflammation cytokines in the liver of mice fed by MCD diet. Moreover, VVYP inhibited the increased level of LPS and reversed the liver mitochondria dysfunction induced by MCD diet. Meanwhile, VVYP significantly increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Eubacteriaceae, coriobacteriacease, Desulfovibrionaceae, S24-7 and Bacteroidia in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, however, VVYP reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus. Moreover, VVYP conferred the protective effect of intestinal barrier via promoting the expression of the mucins and tight junction (TJ)-associated genes and inhibited subsequent liver inflammatory responses. These results indicated that the protective role of VVYP on NASH is mediated by modulating gut microbiota imbalance and related gut-liver axis activation. VVYP might be a promising drug candidate for NASH.",

         " The structural and vibrational properties of the glycyl-L-phenylalanine dipeptide were investigated using vibrational spectroscopy (Raman and infrared) and first-principle calculations. Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed between 100 and 3200 cm Glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap), a cathepsin C substrate, induces an increase of the free and unsedimentable activities of this enzyme when incubated with a total mitochondrial fraction of rat liver. 1 mM-ZnSO4 considerably inhibits the cathepsin C total activity, measured with Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap as the substrate, in the presence of Triton X-100. The inhibition is markedly less pronounced when the free activity is determined; a high activity remains that depends on the integrity of the lysosomes; it decreases as the free activity of N-acetylglucosaminidase increases when lysosomes are subjected to treatments able to disrupt their membrane. Cathepsin C activity is reduced when thioethylamine hydrochloride is omitted from the incubation medium. Under these conditions at 37 degrees C, the free activity equals the total activity, although the lysosomes are intact, as indicated by the low free activity of N-acetylglucosaminidase. 1 mM-ZnSO4 strikingly inhibits the total activity, whereas more than 80% of the free activity remains. These observations are presented as evidence that Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap can possibly cause a disruption of the lysosomes as a result of its hydrolysis inside these organelles. In the presence of ZnSO4, intralysosomal hydrolysis becomes apparent, owing to a preferential inhibition by Zn2+ of extralysosomal hydrolysis; in the absence of thioethylamine hydrochloride, it is measurable because the disruption of lysosomes by Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap is delayed as a result of a slow-down of the reaction. The usefulness of Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap and related dipeptidyl naphthylamides in lysosomal-membrane-permeability studies is emphasized. The release by glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap) of endocytosed invertase associated with the MLP fraction (sum of the M, L and P fractions [de Duve, Pressman, Gianetto, Wattiaux & Appelmans (1955) Biochem. J. 63, 604-617]) of rat liver was investigated and compared with the release of cathepsin C. The percentage of invertase released increases with time after the enzyme injection, whereas the release of cathepsin C is not influenced by this treatment and corresponds to 85-90% of the total activity of the enzyme. It takes about 2h to attain a similar release of both enzymes. The quantity of invertase releasable or not by Gly-L-Phe-2-NNap was plotted against the time after the injection. Results agree well with the hypothesis that unreleasable invertase is associated with a pre-lysosomal compartment, whereas releasable invertase is present in lysosomes. A kinetic analysis indicates that invertase enters the pre-lysosomal compartment with a zero-order rate constant of 0.48 unit/min per g fresh wt., and leaves this compartment with a first-order rate constant of 0.042 min-1.",

Hecht found in 1937 that the body temperature of rabbits, cats and guinea pigs were lowered by 1 to 2 degrees after he gave them adenylthiomethylpentose at a dose of 0.2 g/kg.

         "Catechin is a flavan-3-ol, a type of secondary metabolite providing antioxidant roles in plants. It belongs to the subgroup of polyphenols called flavonoids. The name of the catechin chemical family derives from catechu, which is the tannic juice or boiled extract of Mimosa catechu (Acacia catechu L.f.). == Chemistry == Catechin possesses two benzene rings (called the A and B rings) and a dihydropyran heterocycle (the C ring) with a hydroxyl group on carbon 3. The A ring is similar to a resorcinol moiety while the B ring is similar to a catechol moiety. There are two chiral centers on the molecule on carbons 2 and 3. Therefore, it has four diastereoisomers. Two of the isomers are in trans configuration and are called catechin and the other two are in cis configuration and are called epicatechin. The most common catechin isomer is (+)-catechin. The other stereoisomer is (−)-catechin or ent-catechin. The most common epicatechin isomer is (−)-epicatechin (also known under the names L-epicatechin, epicatechol, (−)-epicatechol, L-acacatechin, L-epicatechol, epicatechin, 2,3-cis-epicatechin or (2R,3R)-(−)-epicatechin). The different epimers can be separated using chiral column chromatography. Making reference to no particular isomer, the molecule can just be called catechin. Mixtures of the different enantiomers can be called (±)-catechin or DL-catechin and (±)-epicatechin or DL-epicatechin. Catechin and epicatechin are the building blocks of the proanthocyanidins, a type of condensed tannin. Diastereoisomers gallery Moreover, the flexibility of the C-ring allows for two conformation isomers, putting the B-ring either in a pseudoequatorial position (E conformer) or in a pseudoaxial position (A conformer). Studies confirmed that (+)-catechin adopts a mixture of A- and E-conformers in aqueous solution and their conformational equilibrium has been evaluated to be 33:67. As flavonoids, catechins can act as antioxidants when in high concentration in vitro, but compared with other flavonoids, their antioxidant potential is low. The ability to quench singlet oxygen seems to be in relation with the chemical structure of catechin, with the presence of the catechol moiety on ring B and the presence of a hydroxyl group activating the double bond on ring C. === Oxidation === Electrochemical experiments show that (+)-catechin oxidation mechanism proceeds in sequential steps, related with the catechol and resorcinol groups and the oxidation is pH-dependent. The oxidation of the catechol 3′,4′-dihydroxyl electron-donating groups occurs first, at very low positive potentials, and is a reversible reaction. The hydroxyl groups of the resorcinol moiety oxidised afterwards were shown to undergo an irreversible oxidation reaction. The laccase–ABTS system oxidizes (+)-catechin to oligomeric products of which proanthocyanidin A2 is a dimer. === Spectral data === == Natural occurrences == (+)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin as well as their gallic acid conjugates are ubiquitous constituents of vascular plants, and frequent components of traditional herbal remedies, such as Uncaria rhynchophylla. The two isomers are mostly found as cacao and tea constituents, as well as in Vitis vinifera grapes. === In food === The main dietary sources of catechins in Europe and the United States are tea and pome fruits. Catechins and epicatechins are found in cocoa, which, according to one database, has the highest content (108 mg/100 g) of catechins among foods analyzed, followed by prune juice (25 mg/100 ml) and broad bean pod (16 mg/100 g). Açaí oil, obtained from the fruit of the açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea), contains (+)-catechins (67 mg/kg). Catechins are diverse among foods, from peaches to green tea and vinegar. Catechins are found in barley grain, where they are the main phenolic compound responsible for dough discoloration. The taste associated with monomeric (+)-catechin or (−)-epicatechin is described as slightly astringent, but not bitter. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of catechin begins with ma 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA starter unit which undergoes chain extension by the addition of three malonyl-CoAs through a PKSIII pathway. 4-Hydroxycinnamoyl CoA is biosynthesized from L-phenylalanine through the Shikimate pathway. L-Phenylalanine is first deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) forming cinnamic acid which is then oxidized to 4-hydroxycinnamic acid by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase. Chalcone synthase then catalyzes the condensation of 4-hydroxycinnamoyl CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA to form chalcone. Chalcone is then isomerized to naringenin by chalcone isomerase which is oxidized to eriodictyol by flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase and further oxidized to taxifolin by flavanone 3-hydroxylase. Taxifolin is then reduced by dihydroflavanol 4-reductase and leucoanthocyanidin reductase to yield catechin. The biosynthesis of catechin is shown below Leucocyanidin reductase (LCR) uses 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin to produce (+)-catechin and is the first enzyme in the proanthocyanidin (PA) specific pathway. Its activity has been measured in leaves, flowers, and seeds of the legumes Medicago sativa, Lotus japonicus, Lotus uliginosus, Hedysarum sulfurescens, and Robinia pseudoacacia. The enzyme is also present in Vitis vinifera (grape). === Biodegradation === Catechin oxygenase, a key enzyme in the degradation of catechin, is present in fungi and bacteria. Among bacteria, degradation of (+)-catechin can be achieved by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Catechin is metabolized to protocatechuic acid (PCA) and phloroglucinol carboxylic acid (PGCA). It is also degraded by Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Phloroglucinol carboxylic acid is further decarboxylated to phloroglucinol, which is dehydroxylated to resorcinol. Resorcinol is hydroxylated to hydroxyquinol. Protocatechuic acid and hydroxyquinol undergo intradiol cleavage through protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase to form β-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid and maleyl acetate. Among fungi, degradation of catechin can be achieved by Chaetomium cupreum. === Metabolism in humans === Catechins are metabolised upon uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, in particular the jejunum, and in the liver, resulting in so-called structurally related epicatechin metabolites (SREM). The main metabolic pathways for SREMs are glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation of the catechol group by catechol-O-methyl transferase, with only small amounts detected in plasma. The majority of dietary catechins are however metabolised by the colonic microbiome to gamma-valerolactones and hippuric acids which undergo further biotransformation, glucuronidation, sulfation and methylation in the liver. The stereochemical configuration of catechins has a strong impact on their uptake and metabolism as uptake is highest for (−)-epicatechin and lowest for (−)-catechin. === Biotransformation === Biotransformation of (+)-catechin into taxifolin by a two-step oxidation can be achieved by Burkholderia sp. (+)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin are transformed by the endophytic filamentous fungus Diaporthe sp. into the 3,4-cis-dihydroxyflavan derivatives, (+)-(2R,3S,4S)-3,4,5,7,3′,4′-hexahydroxyflavan (leucocyanidin) and (−)-(2R,3R,4R)-3,4,5,7,3′,4′-hexahydroxyflavan, respectively, whereas (−)-catechin and (+)-epicatechin with a (2S)-phenyl group resisted the biooxidation. Leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) uses (2R,3S)-catechin, NADP+ and H2O to produce 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin, NADPH, and H+. Its gene expression has been studied in developing grape berries and grapevine leaves. === Glycosides === (2R,3S)-Catechin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside can be isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and malt. Epigeoside (catechin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1–4)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1–6)-β-D-glucopyranoside) can be isolated from the rhizomes of Epigynum auritum. == Research == === Vascular function === Only limited evidence from dietary studies indicates that catechins may affect endothelium-dependent vasodilation which could contribute to normal blood flow regulation in humans. Green tea catechins may improve blood pressure, especially when systolic blood pressure is above 130 mmHg. Due to extensive metabolism during digestion, the fate and activity of catechin metabolites responsible for this effect on blood vessels, as well as the actual mode of action, are unknown. === Adverse events === Catechin and its metabolites can bind tightly to red blood cells and thereby induce the development of autoantibodies, resulting in haemolytic anaemia and renal failure. This resulted in the withdrawal of the catechin-containing drug Catergen, used to treat viral hepatitis, from market in 1985. Catechins from green tea can be hepatotoxic and the European Food Safety Authority has recommended not to exceed 800 mg per day. === Other === One limited meta-analysis showed that increasing consumption of green tea and its catechins to seven cups per day provided a small reduction in prostate cancer. Nanoparticle methods are under preliminary research as potential delivery systems of catechins. == Botanical effects == Catechins released into the ground by some plants may hinder the growth of their neighbors, a form of allelopathy. Centaurea maculosa, the spotted knapweed often studied for this behavior, releases catechin isomers into the ground through its roots, potentially having effects as an antibiotic or herbicide. One hypothesis is that it causes a reactive oxygen species wave through the target plant's root to kill root cells by apoptosis. Most plants in the European ecosystem have defenses against catechin, but few plants are protected against it in the North American ecosystem where Centaurea maculosa is an invasive, uncontrolled weed. Catechin acts as an infection-inhibiting factor in strawberry leaves. Epicatechin and catechin may prevent coffee berry disease by inhibiting appressorial melanization of Colletotrichum kahawae. == References == == External links == Media related to (+)-Catechin at Wikimedia Commons",

         " Ethanolic gastric mucosal impairment is one of the most common disorders in the gastrointestinal system. In this study, we investigated the potential alleviating effects of sea cucumber peptides on Ges-1 impairment caused by ethanol and the associated mechanisms. The sea cucumber peptide VLLY could promote the proliferation and migration of healthy Ges-1 cells. After ethanol injury, VLLY peptide treatment could greatly promote the migration of Ges-1 cells, scavenge intracellular and mitochondrial ROS, reverse mitochondrial fission and F-actin depolymerization, and improve mitochondrial respiration. VLLY peptide restored mitochondrial dynamics by downregulating Drp1 and Fis1 and upregulating Mfn2 against excessive mitochondrial fission. In addition, the VLLY peptide maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential, ablated the leakage of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm, upregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-XL, decreased the expression of the proapoptotic factors of Bax, BAD, and cleaved caspase-3, and finally blocked the mitochondria-related apoptotic pathway. These findings strongly suggested that sea cucumber peptides could promote proliferation and migration of healthy Ges-1 cells and reverse ethanol-induced excess mitochondrial fission and maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through the Fis1/Bax pathway, thereby improving ethanol-induced apoptosis. VLLY offers a new perspective for improving the ethanolic gastric mucosal epithelial cell injury. Bifidobacterium species are known to fulfill important functions within the human colon. Thus, stimulating the activity of bifidobacteria is important to maintain host health. We revealed that culture supernatants of Bacillus subtilis C-3102 (referred to as C-3102) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium species. In this study, we isolated and identified six bifidogenic growth factors, which were cyclo (D-Val-D-Ile), cyclo (L-Val-D-Ile), cyclo (D-Val-L-Ile), cyclo (L-Val-L-Ile), cyclo (D-Val-L-Leu) and cyclo (L-Val-L-Leu). These six cyclic dipeptides increased the growth of Bifidobacterium species and had no effect on potentially harmful gut organisms. Moreover, supplementation with a mixture of these six cyclic dipeptides significantly increased the abundance of microorganisms related to the genus Bifidobacterium in a human colonic microbiota model culture system, although supplementation with a single type of dipeptide had no effect. These results show that cyclic dipeptides containing Val-Leu and Val-Ile produced by C-3102 could serve as bifidogenic growth factors in the gut microbial community. Kokumi is a beneficial feeling for the evaluation of food quality, and thus, preparing and understanding the taste properties of kokumi compounds are important for the flavor of food. N-acetyl-Val/Leu/Ile/Met/Phe/Trp/Tyr is a type of kokumi compound found in food and usually prepared by chemical reagents. In this study, we first prepared these six kokumi compounds using transglutaminase and protease A2SD in aqueous solution by using amino acids and acetic acid as substrates and evaluated their kokumi characteristics. HPLC and LC-MS were used to identify quantitative N-acetyl amino acids. Using Phe and acetic acid as substrates, transglutaminase and protease A2SD showed the highest yields for N-acetyl-Phe of 22.75 and 42.21%, respectively, under the optimal conditions. For N-acetyl-Val/Leu/Ile/Met/Trp/Tyr, these two enzymes showed the synthesis yield in the ranges of 2.22-20.12 and 0.75-12.91%, respectively. Six N-acetyl-amino acids were succesully enriched by ethyl acetate with a recovery over 50% and purity over 95%. Sensory evaluation found that N-acetyl-Val/Leu/Ile/Met/Phe are kokumi compounds that enhance sweet, umami, and salt tastes in 5% sucrose, 0.3% NaCl, and 0.5% sodium glutamate, especially N-acetyl-Val, with the salt- and umami-enhancing threshold values of 0.63 and 1.25 g/L, respectively. Therefore, transglutaminase and protease A2SD for the synthesis of partial N-acetyl amino acid might have the potential to be applied in food as a kokumi compound.",

         " Lipid hydroperoxides are the primary reaction products of lipid oxidation, a natural outcome of life under oxygen. While playing a major role in cell metabolism, the microscopic origins of the effects of lipid hydroperoxidation on biomembranes remain elusive. Here we probe the polar structure of partially to fully hydroperoxidized bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) by a combination of environment-sensitive fluorescent probes and coarse-grained Martini numerical simulations. We find that the inserted organic hydroperoxide group -OOH migrates preferentially to the surface for bilayers with small fractions of hydroperoxidized lipids, but populates also significantly the bilayer interior for larger fractions. Our findings suggest that by modifying the intimate polarity of biomembranes, lipid peroxidation will have a significant impact on the activity of transmembrane proteins and on the bio-medical efficiency of membrane active molecules such as cell-penetrating and antimicrobial peptides. We have investigated the adsorption of the amyloid-forming protein α-Synuclein (αSyn) onto small unilamellar vesicles composed of a mixture of zwitterionic POPC and anionic POPS lipids. αSyn monomers adsorb onto the anionic lipid vesicles where they adopt an α-helical secondary structure. The degree of adsorption depends on the fraction of anionic lipid in the mixed lipid membrane, but one needs to consider the electrostatic shift of the serine p Conformational states of phospholipid chains in ternary mixtures of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), deuterated 1,2-dipalmitoyl-d62-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC",

         "Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate, diisooctyl phthalate, DEHP; incorrectly — dioctyl phthalate, DIOP) is an organic compound with the formula C6H4(CO2C8H17)2. DEHP is the most common member of the class of phthalates, which are used as plasticizers. It is the diester of phthalic acid and the branched-chain 2-ethylhexanol. This colorless viscous liquid is soluble in oil, but not in water. == Production == Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate is produced commercially by the reaction of excess 2-ethylhexanol with phthalic anhydride in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid or para-toluenesulfonic acid. It was first produced in commercial quantities in Japan circa 1933 and in the United States in 1939. DEHP has two stereocenters, located at the carbon atoms carrying the ethyl groups. As a result, it has three distinct stereoisomers, consisting of an (R,R) form, an (S,S) form (diastereomers), and a meso (R, S) form. As most 2-ethylhexanol is produced as a racemic mixture, commercially-produced DEHP is therefore racemic as well, and consists of a 1:1:2 statistical mixture of stereoisomers. == Use == Due to its suitable properties and the low cost, DEHP is widely used as a plasticizer in manufacturing of articles made of PVC. Plastics may contain 1% to 40% of DEHP. It is also used as a hydraulic fluid and as a dielectric fluid in capacitors. DEHP also finds use as a solvent in glowsticks. Approximately three million tonnes are produced and used annually worldwide. Manufacturers of flexible PVC articles can choose among several alternative plasticizers offering similar technical properties as DEHP. These alternatives include other phthalates such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-2-propyl heptyl phthalate (DPHP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), and non-phthalates such as 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH), dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP), and citrate esters. == Environmental exposure == DEHP is a component of many household items, including tablecloths, floor tiles, shower curtains, garden hoses, rainwear, dolls, toys, shoes, medical tubing, furniture upholstery, and swimming pool liners. DEHP is an indoor air pollutant in homes and schools. Common exposures come from the use of DEHP as a fragrance carrier in cosmetics, personal care products, laundry detergents, colognes, scented candles, and air fresheners. The most common exposure to DEHP comes through food with an average consumption of 0.25 milligrams per day. It can also leach into a liquid that comes in contact with the plastic; it extracts faster into nonpolar solvents (e.g. oils and fats in foods packed in PVC). Fatty foods that are packaged in plastics that contain DEHP are more likely to have higher concentrations such as milk products, fish or seafood, and oils. The US FDA therefore permits use of DEHP-containing packaging only for foods that primarily contain water. DEHP can leach into drinking water from discharges from rubber and chemical factories; The US EPA limits for DEHP in drinking water is 6 ppb. It is also commonly found in bottled water, but unlike tap water, the EPA does not regulate levels in bottled water. DEHP levels in some European samples of milk, were found at 2000 times higher than the EPA Safe Drinking Water limits (12,000 ppb). Levels of DEHP in some European cheeses and creams were even higher, up to 200,000 ppb, in 1994. Additionally, workers in factories that utilize DEHP in production experience greater exposure. The U.S. agency OSHA's limit for occupational exposure is 5 mg/m3 of air. === Use in medical devices === DEHP is the most common phthalate plasticizer in medical devices such as intravenous tubing and bags, IV catheters, nasogastric tubes, dialysis bags and tubing, blood bags and transfusion tubing, and air tubes. DEHP makes these plastics softer and more flexible and was first introduced in the 1940s in blood bags. For this reason, concern has been expressed about leachates of DEHP transported into the patient, especially for those requiring extensive infusions or those who are at the highest risk of developmental abnormalities, e.g. newborns in intensive care nursery settings, hemophiliacs, kidney dialysis patients, neonates, premature babies, lactating, and pregnant women. According to the European Commission Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), exposure to DEHP may exceed the tolerable daily intake in some specific population groups, namely people exposed through medical procedures such as kidney dialysis. The American Academy of Pediatrics has advocated not to use medical devices that can leach DEHP into patients and, instead, to resort to DEHP-free alternatives. In July 2002, the U.S. FDA issued a Public Health Notification on DEHP, stating in part, \"We recommend considering such alternatives when these high-risk procedures are to be performed on male neonates, pregnant women who are carrying male fetuses, and peripubertal males\" noting that the alternatives were to look for non-DEHP exposure solutions; they mention a database of alternatives. The CBC documentary The Disappearing Male raised concerns about sexual development in male fetal development, miscarriage, and as a cause of dramatically lower sperm counts in men. A review article in 2010 in the Journal of Transfusion Medicine showed a consensus that the benefits of lifesaving treatments with these devices far outweigh the risks of DEHP leaching out of these devices. Although more research is needed to develop alternatives to DEHP that gives the same benefits of being soft and flexible, which are required for most medical procedures, if a procedure requires one of these devices and if patient is at high risk to suffer from DEHP then a DEHP alternative should be considered if medically safe. === Metabolism === DEHP hydrolyzes to mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and subsequently to phthalate salts. The released alcohol is susceptible to oxidation to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid. == Effects on living organisms == === Toxicity === The acute toxicity of DEHP is low in animal models: 30 g/kg in rats (oral) and 24 g/kg in rabbits (dermal). Concerns instead focus on its potential as an endocrine disruptor. === Endocrine disruption === DEHP, along with other phthalates, is believed to cause endocrine disruption in males, through its action as an androgen antagonist, and may have lasting effects on reproductive function, for both childhood and adult exposures. Prenatal phthalate exposure has been shown to be associated with lower levels of reproductive function in adolescent males. In another study, airborne concentrations of DEHP at a PVC pellet plant were significantly associated with a reduction in sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity. Additionally, the authors noted the daily intake estimates for DEHP were comparable to the general population, indicating a \"high percentage of men are exposed to levels of DEHP that may affect sperm motility and chromatin DNA integrity\". The claims have received support by a study using dogs as a \"sentinel species to approximate human exposure to a selection of chemical mixtures present in the environment\". The authors analyzed the concentration of DEHP and other common chemicals such as PCBs in testes from dogs from five different world regions. The results showed that regional differences in concentration of the chemicals are reflected in dog testes and that pathologies such as tubule atrophy and germ cells were more prevalent in testes of dogs from regions with higher concentrations. === Development === Numerous studies of DEHP have shown changes in sexual function and development in mice and rats. DEHP exposure during pregnancy has been shown to disrupt placental growth and development in mice, resulting in higher rates of low birthweight, premature birth, and fetal loss. In a separate study, exposure of neonatal mice to DEHP through lactation caused hypertrophy of the adrenal glands and higher levels of anxiety during puberty. In another study, pubertal administration of higher-dose DEHP delayed puberty in rats, reduced testosterone production, and inhibited androgen-dependent development; low doses showed no effect. === Obesity === When DEHP is ingested intestinal lipases convert it to MEHP, which then is absorbed. MEHP is suspected to have an obesogenic effect. Rodent studies and human studies have shown DEHP to be a possible disruptor of thyroid function, which plays a key role in energy balance and metabolism. Exposure to DEHP has been associated with lower plasma thyroxine levels and decreased uptake of iodine in thyroid follicular cells. Previous studies have shown that slight changes in thyroxine levels can have dramatic effects on resting energy expenditure, similar to that of patients with hypothyroidism, which has been shown to cause increased weight gain in those study populations. === Cardiotoxicity === Even at relatively low doses of DEHP, cardiovascular reactivity was significantly affected in mice. A clinically relevant dose and duration of exposure to DEHP has been shown to have a significant impact on the behavior of cardiac cells in culture. This includes an uncoupling effect that leads to irregular rhythms in vitro. Untreated cells had fast conduction velocity, along with homogenous activation wave fronts and synchronized beating. Cells treated with DEHP exhibited fractured wave fronts with slow propagation speeds. This is observed in conjunction with a significant decrease in the amount of expression and instability of gap junctional connexin proteins, specifically connexin-43, in cardiomyocytes treated with DEHP. The decrease in expression and instability of connexin-43 may be due to the down regulation of tubulin and kinesin genes, and the alteration of microtubule structure, caused by DEHP; all of which are responsible for the transport of protein products. Also, DEHP caused down regulation of several growth factors, such as angiotensinogen, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor C and A, and endothelial-1. The DEHP-induced down regulation of these growth factors may also contribute to the reduced expression and instability of connexin-43. DEHP has also been shown, in vitro using cardiac muscle cells, to cause activation of PPAR-alpha gene, which is a key regulator in lipid metabolism and peroxisome proliferation; both of which can be involved in atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia, which are precursors of cardiovascular disease. Once metabolized into MEHP, the molecule has been shown to lengthen action potential duration and slow epicardial conduction velocity in Langendorff perfused rodent hearts. === Other health effects === Studies in mice have shown other adverse health effects due to DEHP exposure. Ingestion of 0.01% DEHP caused damage to the blood-testis barrier as well as induction of experimental autoimmune orchitis. There is also a correlation between DEHP plasma levels in women and endometriosis. DEHP is also a possible cancer causing agent in humans, although human studies remain inconclusive, due to the exposure of multiple elements and limited research. In vitro and rodent studies indicate that DEHP is involved in many molecular events, including increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, oxidative damage, and selective clonal expansion of the initiated cells; all of which take place in multiple sites of the human body. == Government and industry response == === Taiwan === In October 2009, Consumers' Foundation, Taiwan (CFCT) published test results that found 5 out of the sampled 12 shoes contained over 0.1% of phthalate plasticizer content, including DEHP, which exceeds the government's Toy Safety Standard (CNS 4797). CFCT recommend that users should first wear socks to avoid direct skin contact. In May 2011, the illegal use of the plasticizer DEHP in clouding agents for use in food and beverages has been reported in Taiwan. An inspection of products initially discovered the presence of plasticizers. As more products were tested, inspectors found more manufacturers using DEHP and DINP. The Department of Health confirmed that contaminated food and beverages had been exported to other countries and regions, which reveals the widespread prevalence of toxic plasticizers. === European Union === Concerns about chemicals ingested by children when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission to order a temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of which is based on an opinion by the Commission's Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other phthalates (DBP, BBP, DINP, DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of phthalates (DINP, DIDP, and DNOP) \"in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children\". Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including musk xylene, MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015. In 2012, Danish Environment Minister Ida Auken announced the ban of DEHP, DBP, DIBP and BBP, pushing Denmark ahead of the European Union which has already started a process of phasing out phthalates. However, it was postponed by two years and would take effect in 2015 and not in December 2013, which was the initial plan. The reason is that the four phthalates are far more common than expected and that producers cannot phase out phthalates as fast as the Ministry of Environment requested. In 2012, France became the first country in the EU to ban the use of DEHP in pediatrics, neonatal, and maternity wards in hospitals. DEHP has now been classified as a Category 1B reprotoxin, and is now on the Annex XIV of the European Union's REACH legislation. DEHP has been phased out in Europe under REACH and can only be used in specific cases if an authorization has been granted. Authorizations are granted by the European Commission, after obtaining the opinion of the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) and the Committee for Socio-economic Analysis (SEAC) of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). === California === DEHP is classified as a \"chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm\" (in this case, both) under the terms of Proposition 65. == References == == Further reading == Maradonna, Francesca; Evangelisti, Matteo; Gioacchini, Giorgia; et al.

         "Raffinose is a trisaccharide composed of galactose, glucose, and fructose. It can be found in beans, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, other vegetables, and whole grains. Raffinose can be hydrolyzed to D-galactose and sucrose by the enzyme α-galactosidase (α-GAL), an enzyme synthesized by bacteria found in the large intestine. α-GAL also hydrolyzes other α-galactosides such as stachyose, verbascose, and galactinol, if present. In plants, raffinose plays a significant role in stress responses, particularly temperature sensitivity, seed vigour, resistance to pathogens, and desiccation. == Chemical properties == The raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) are α-galactosyl derivatives of sucrose, the most common being the trisaccharide raffinose, the tetrasaccharide stachyose, and the pentasaccharide verbascose. RFOs are almost ubiquitous across the plant kingdom, being found in a large variety of seeds from many different families. They rank second only to sucrose in abundance as soluble carbohydrates. Raffinose typically crystallises as a pentahydrate white crystalline powder. It is odorless and has a sweet taste approximately 10% that of sucrose. == Biochemical properties == === Energy source === It is non-digestible in humans and other monogastric animals (pigs and poultry) who do not possess the α-GAL enzyme to break down RFOs. These oligosaccharides pass undigested through the stomach and small intestine. In the large intestine, they are fermented by bacteria that do possess the α-GAL enzyme and make short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)(acetic, propionic, butyric acids), as well as the flatulence commonly associated with eating beans and other vegetables. These SCFAs have been recently found to impart a number of health benefits. α-GAL is present in digestive aids such as the product Beano. === Plant Health === Cases of abiotic stress such as temperature, drought, and salinity have shown to increase RFO levels, especially raffinose, in plants. The functional role raffinose plays in abiotic stress tolerance is not well known, but its presence as a positive regulator of these stresses is established. Galactinol synthase (GolS) is an enzyme key in the synthesis of RFOs. Studies which modify the expression of GolS have been done to understand the role of RFOs in stress response. GolS has been found to induce salicylic acid signalling pathways and expression of defence-related genes, showing RFOs to have a role in pathogen resistance. RFOs have been seen to assist in seed germination. They are used as a source of energy and carbon for germination, and protect the seed from desiccation during the maturation process. One proposed mechanism of RFOs working against desiccation details the hydroxyl groups replacing water to maintain hydrophilicity ion the cell, which stabilizes the membrane structure and macromolecules needed for cellular function. Another mechanism, called \"vitrification\", has the cell taking on a highly viscous form, like that of a plastic solid. This maintains cellular stability and hydrogen bonding in the cell, and prevents cellular collapse. In many plants, RFOs have been seen to act as an alternative to sucrose for sugar storage and transport. == Disease relevance == Research has shown that the differential ability to utilize raffinose by strains of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae impacts their ability to cause disease and the nature of the disease. == Uses == Procedures concerning cryopreservation have used raffinose to provide hypertonicity for cell desiccation prior to freezing. Either raffinose or sucrose is used as a base substance for sucralose. Raffinose is also used in: skin moisturizers and cosmetics prebiotics (it promotes growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) food or drinks additive chiral stationary phase in HPLC == See also == Raffinose—raffinose alpha-galactosyltransferase Raphanin == Further reading == D(+)-Raffinose pentahydrate, Chemical Books == References ==",

In particular, islet-associated CD8 The conformational preferences of peptides are strongly determined by hydrogen bonding interactions. Intermolecular solute-solvent interactions compete with intramolecular interactions, which typically stabilize the secondary structure of the peptide. The analysis of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra can give insights into solvation-induced changes in the conformational distribution of small peptides. Here we describe the VCD spectroscopic characterization of the model peptide Boc-Val-Phe- In this study, we evaluated the stability/bioavailability and in vivo antihypertensive activity of the tripeptide, Ala-Val-Phe, that was recently purified from insect protein (Spodoptera littoralis; Lepidoptera) and that showed in vitro angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. This tripeptide is partly hydrolyzed by mucosal peptidases to Val-Phe, a more potent in vitro ACE inhibitor. In organ bath experiments using rat aorta, Val-Phe showed ACE inhibition, while Ala-Val-Phe did not. Single oral administration (5mg/kg body weight) to spontaneously hypertensive rats led to a significant decrease in blood pressure for both peptides. Docking experiments indicated an active character for Val-Phe and an inactive character for Ala-Val-Phe as potential inhibitors of human ACE. From our results, it can be suggested that after oral administration of Ala-Val-Phe, Val-Phe is released by in vivo peptidases and is responsible for in vivo activity of Ala-Val-Phe. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of in vivo antihypertensive activity of peptides derived from insect protein.",

         "Paroxetine, sold under the brand name Paxil among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It has also been used in the treatment of premature ejaculation, and hot flashes due to menopause. It is taken orally (by mouth). Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, trouble sleeping, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. It is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of the chemical serotonin by neurons in the brain. Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. In 2018, it was in the top 10 of most prescribed antidepressants in the United States. == Medical uses == Paroxetine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It is also occasionally used for agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and menopausal hot flashes. === Depression === A variety of meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of paroxetine in depression. They have variously concluded that paroxetine is superior or equivalent to placebo and that it is equivalent to other antidepressants. Despite this, there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any point in time. === Anxiety disorders === Paroxetine was the first antidepressant approved in the United States for the treatment of panic disorder. Several studies have concluded that paroxetine is superior to placebo in the treatment of panic disorder. Paroxetine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults and children. It is also beneficial for people with co-occurring social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. It appears to be similar to a number of other SSRIs. Paroxetine is used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparative efficacy of paroxetine is equivalent to that of clomipramine and venlafaxine. Paroxetine is also effective for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Paroxetine is approved for the treatment of PTSD in the United States, Japan, and Europe. In the United States, it is approved for short-term use. Paroxetine is also FDA-approved for generalized anxiety disorder. === Menopausal hot flashes === In 2013, low-dose paroxetine was approved in the US for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause. At the low dose used for menopausal hot flashes, side effects are similar to placebo and dose tapering is not required for discontinuation. === Fibromyalgia === Studies have also shown paroxetine \"appears to be well-tolerated and improve the overall symptomatology in patients with fibromyalgia\", but is less robust in helping with the pain involved. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndromes may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. Paroxetine shares many of the common adverse effects of SSRIs, including (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%) diarrhea 12% (8%) constipation 14% (9%) dry mouth 18% (12%) somnolence 23% (9%) insomnia 13% (6%) headache 18% (17%) hypomania 1% (0.3%) blurred vision 4% (1%) loss of appetite 6% (2%) nervousness 5% (3%) paraesthesia 4% (2%) dizziness 13% (6%) asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)) tremor 8% (2%) sweating 11% (2%) sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, but a higher incidence of anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain. Due to reports of adverse withdrawal reactions upon terminating treatment, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use at the European Medicines Agency recommends gradually reducing over several weeks or months if the decision to withdraw is made. See also Discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal). Mania or hypomania may occur in 1% of patients with depression and up to 12% of patients with bipolar disorder. This side effect can occur in individuals with no history of mania, but it may be more likely to occur in those with bipolar disorder or with a family history of mania. Paroxetine is described as a 'hepatoxic agent' and has been associated with hepatoxicity and jaundice. === Suicide === Like other antidepressants, paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in people under the age of 25. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 and found an increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. In 2015, a paper published in The BMJ that reanalysed the original case notes argued that in Study 329, assessing paroxetine and imipramine against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for paroxetine. === Sexual dysfunction === Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, anorgasmia, lack of vaginal lubrication, and erectile dysfunction, is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with paroxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is higher than 70%. Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional. === Pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including paroxetine) is associated with shorter duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g or 2.6 oz), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that for pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, paroxetine \"be avoided, if possible\", as it may be associated with increased risk of birth defects. Babies born to women who used paroxetine during the first trimester have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations, primarily ventricular and atrial septal defects. Unless the benefits of paroxetine justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to stopping or switching to another antidepressant. Paroxetine use during pregnancy is associated with about 1.5– to 1.7-fold increase in congenital birth defects, in particular, heart defects, cleft lip and palate, clubbed feet, or any birth defects. === Discontinuation syndrome === Many psychoactive medications can cause withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation from administration. Paroxetine has among the highest incidence rates and severity of withdrawal syndrome of any medication of its class. Common withdrawal symptoms for paroxetine include nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo; insomnia, nightmares, and vivid dreams; feelings of electricity in the body, as well as rebound depression and anxiety. A liquid formulation of paroxetine is available and allows a very gradual decrease of the dose, which may prevent discontinuation syndrome. Another recommendation is to temporarily switch to fluoxetine, which has a longer half-life and thus decreases the severity of discontinuation syndrome. In 2002, the U.S. FDA published a warning regarding \"severe\" discontinuation symptoms among those terminating paroxetine treatment, including paraesthesia, nightmares, and dizziness. The agency also warned of case reports describing agitation, sweating, and nausea. In connection with a Glaxo spokesperson's statement that withdrawal reactions occur only in 0.2% of patients and are \"mild and short-lived\", the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations said GSK had breached two of the federation's codes of practice. Paroxetine prescribing information posted at GlaxoSmithKline has been updated related to the occurrence of a discontinuation syndrome, including serious discontinuation symptoms. == Overdose == Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia, and seizures. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of paroxetine may be measured to monitor therapeutic administration, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Plasma paroxetine concentrations are generally in a range of 40–400 μg/L in persons receiving daily therapeutic doses and 200–2,000 μg/L in poisoned patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 1–4 mg/L in acute lethal overdose situations. Along with the other SSRIs, sertraline and fluoxetine, paroxetine is considered a low-risk drug in cases of overdose. == Interactions == Interactions with other drugs acting on the serotonin system or impairing the metabolism of serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reaction. Such reactions have been observed with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, but particularly with concurrent use of triptans, MAO inhibitors, antipsychotics, or other dopamine antagonists. The prescribing information states that paroxetine should \"not be used in combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI\", and should not be used in combination with pimozide, thioridazine, tryptophan, or warfarin. Paroxetine interacts with the following cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP2D6 for which it is both a substrate and a potent inhibitor. CYP2B6 (strong) inhibitor. CYP3A4 (weak) inhibitor. CYP1A2 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C9 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C19 (weak) inhibitor. Paroxetine has been shown to be an inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Paroxetine is the most potent and one of the most specific selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It also binds to the allosteric site of the serotonin transporter, similarly to escitalopram, though less potently so. Paroxetine also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine to a lesser extent (<50 nmol/L). Based on evidence from four weeks of administration in rats, the equivalent of 20 mg paroxetine taken once daily occupies approximately 88% of serotonin transporters in the prefrontal cortex. Paroxetine is a phenylpiperidine and might have some affinity for opioid receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Paroxetine is well-absorbed following oral administration. It has an absolute bioavailability of about 50%, with evidence of a saturable first pass effect. When taken orally, it achieves maximum concentration in about 6–10 hours and reaches steady-state in 7–14 days. Paroxetine exhibits significant interindividual variations in volume of distribution and clearance. Less than 2% of an oral dose is excreted in urine unchanged. Paroxetine is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2D6. == Society and culture == Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. GlaxoSmithKline has paid substantial fines, paid settlements in class-action lawsuits, and become the subject of several highly critical books about its marketing of paroxetine, in particular, the off-label marketing of paroxetine for children, the suppression of negative research results relating to its use in children, and allegations that it failed to warn consumers of substantial withdrawal effects associated with the use of the drug. === Marketing === In 2004, GSK agreed to settle charges of consumer fraud for $2.5 million. The legal discovery process also uncovered evidence of deliberate, systematic suppression of unfavorable Paxil research results. One of GSK's internal documents read, \"It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy [in children] had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine\". In 2012, the United States Department of Justice fined GlaxoSmithKline $3 billion for withholding data, unlawfully promoting use in those under 18, and preparing an article that misleadingly reported the effects of paroxetine in adolescents with depression following its clinical trial study 329. In February 2016, the UK Competition and Markets Authority imposed record fines of £45 million on companies that were found to have infringed European Union and UK Competition law by entering into agreements to delay the market entry of generic versions of the drug in the UK. GlaxoSmithKline received the bulk of the fines, being fined £37,600,757. Other companies that produce generics were issued fines which collectively total £7,384,146. UK public health services are likely to claim damages for being overcharged in the period where the generic versions of the drug were illegally blocked from the market, as the generics are over 70% less expensive. GlaxoSmithKline may also face actions from other generic manufacturers who incurred losses as a result of the anticompetitive conduct. In April 2016, appeals were lodged with the Competition Appeal Tribunal by the companies which were fined. GSK marketed paroxetine through television advertisements in the 1990s and 2000s. Commercials also aired for the CR version of the drug beginning in 2003. === Economics === In 2007, paroxetine was ranked 94th on the list of bestselling drugs, with over $1 billion in sales. In 2006, paroxetine was the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. retail market, with more than 19.7 million prescriptions. In 2007, sales had dropped slightly to 18.1 million but paroxetine remained the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. === Brand names === Brand names include Aropax, Paretin, Brisdelle, Deroxat, Paxil, Pexeva, Paxtine, Paxetin, Paroxat, Paraxyl, Sereupin, Daparox and Seroxat. == Research == Several studies have suggested that paroxetine can be used in the treatment of premature ejaculation. In particular, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was found to increase 6- to 13-fold, which was somewhat longer than the delay achieved by the treatment with other SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram). However, paroxetine taken acutely (\"on demand\") 3–10 hours before coitus resulted only in a \"clinically irrelevant and sexually unsatisfactory\" 1.5-fold delay of ejaculation and was inferior to clomipramine, which induced a fourfold delay. There is also evidence that paroxetine may be effective in the treatment of compulsive gambling and hot flashes. Benefits of paroxetine prescription for diabetic neuropathy or chronic tension headache are uncertain. Although the evidence is conflicting, paroxetine may be effective for the treatment of dysthymia, a chronic disorder involving depressive symptoms for most days of the year. There is evidence to support that paroxetine selectively binds to and inhibits G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in mice with heart failure. Since GRK2 regulates the activity of the beta adrenergic receptor, which becomes desensitized in cases of heart failure, paroxetine (or a paroxetine derivative) could be used as a heart failure treatment in the future. Paroxetine has been identified as a potential disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug. == Veterinary use == Paroxetine may be useful in the treatment of canine or feline behavioral diagnoses and is effective in the treatment of social anxiety, depression, and agitation associated with depression. == Other organisms == Paroxetine is a common finding in wastewater. It is highly toxic to the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (syn. Raphidocelis subcapitata). It also is toxic to the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Alberca et al., 2016 found that paroxetine acts as a trypanocide against T. cruzi. Alberca et al., 2016 finds a leishmanicide effect. Alberca finds that paroxetine produces cell death of the promastigotes of L. infantum. The mechanism of action remains unknown. Various types of bacteria can break down paroxetine in the environment. These include, for example Pseudomonas sp., Bosea sp., Shewanella sp., Species of Chitinophagaceae and Acinetobacter sp. == References == == External links == Media related to Paroxetine at Wikimedia Commons",

         " The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family consists of three receptor subtypes (FPR1–FPR3) (1). These G-protein–coupled receptors are found on leukocytes. FPR1 is highly expressed on neutrophils under inflammatory conditions for their emigration to the sites of injury and infection (2). However, collateral damage may occur, which can cause pain, edema, fever, and swelling. The peptide antagonist cinnamoyl-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-Lys-NH Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) maps information about tissues spatially and functionally. Protons (hydrogen nuclei) are widely used in imaging because of their abundance in water molecules. Water comprises ~80% of most soft tissue. The contrast of proton MRI depends primarily on the density of the nucleus (proton spins), the relaxation times of the nuclear magnetization (T1, longitudinal; T2, transverse), the magnetic environment of the tissues, and the blood flow to the tissues. However, insufficient contrast between normal and diseased tissues requires the development of contrast agents. Most contrast agents affect the T1 and T2 relaxation times of the surrounding nuclei, mainly the protons of water. T2* is the spin–spin relaxation time composed of variations from molecular interactions and intrinsic magnetic heterogeneities of tissues in the magnetic field (1). Cross-linked iron oxide nanoparticles and other iron oxide formulations affect T2 primarily and lead to decreased signals. On the other hand, paramagnetic T1 agents, such as gadolinium (Gd White blood cells radiolabeled with indium (as ",

         "Amitriptyline, sold under the brand name Elavil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, and a variety of pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, migraine and tension headaches. Due to the frequency and prominence of side effects, amitriptyline is generally considered a second-line therapy for these indications. The most common side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain. Glaucoma, liver toxicity and abnormal heart rhythms are rare but serious side effects. Blood levels of amitriptyline vary significantly from one person to another, and amitriptyline interacts with many other medications potentially aggravating its side effects. Amitriptyline was discovered in the late 1950s by scientists at Merck and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 87th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amitriptyline is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder, neuropathic pain, and for the prevention of migraine and chronic tension headache. It can be used for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children older than 6 after other treatments have failed. === Depression === Amitriptyline is effective for depression, but it is rarely used as a first-line antidepressant due to its higher toxicity in overdose and generally poorer tolerability. It can be tried for depression as a second-line therapy, after the failure of other treatments. For treatment-resistant adolescent depression or for cancer-related depression amitriptyline is no better than placebo; however, the number of treated patients in both studies was small. It is sometimes used for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease, but supporting evidence for that is lacking. === Pain === Amitriptyline alleviates painful diabetic neuropathy. It is recommended by a variety of guidelines as a first or second-line treatment. It is as effective for this indication as gabapentin or pregabalin but less well tolerated. Amitriptyline is as effective at relieving pain as duloxetine. Combination treatment of amitriptyline and pregabalin offers additional pain relief for people whose pain is not adequately controlled with one medication and is usually safe. Amitriptyline in certain formulations may also induce the level of sciatic-nerve blockade needed for local anesthesia therein. Here, it has been demonstrated to be of superior potency to bupivacaine, a customary long-acting local anesthetic. Low doses of amitriptyline moderately improve sleep disturbances and reduce pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. It is recommended for fibromyalgia accompanied by depression by Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and as a second-line option for fibromyalgia, with exercise being the first line option, by European League Against Rheumatism. Combinations of amitriptyline and fluoxetine or melatonin may reduce fibromyalgia pain better than either medication alone. There is some (low-quality) evidence that amitriptyline may reduce pain in cancer patients. It is recommended only as a second-line therapy for non-chemotherapy-induced neuropathic or mixed neuropathic pain if opioids did not provide the desired effect. Moderate evidence exists in favor of amitriptyline use for atypical facial pain. Amitriptyline is ineffective for HIV-associated neuropathy. In multiple sclerosis, it is frequently used to treat painful paresthesias in the arms and legs (e.g., burning sensations, pins and needles, stabbing pains) caused by damage to the pain-regulating pathways of the brain and spinal cord. === Headache === Amitriptyline is probably effective for the prevention of periodic migraine in adults. Amitriptyline is similar in efficacy to venlafaxine and topiramate but carries a higher burden of adverse effects than topiramate. For many patients, even very small doses of amitriptyline are helpful, which may allow for minimization of side effects. Amitriptyline is not significantly different from placebo when used for the prevention of migraine in children. Amitriptyline may reduce the frequency and duration of chronic tension headache, but it is associated with worse adverse effects than mirtazapine. Overall, amitriptyline is recommended for tension headache prophylaxis, along with lifestyle advice, which should include avoidance of analgesia and caffeine. === Other indications === Amitriptyline is effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome; however, because of its side effects, it should be reserved for select patients for whom other agents do not work. There is insufficient evidence to support its use for abdominal pain in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes. Amitriptyline, as the most commonly used of them, is recommended as a first-line agent for its therapy. Amitriptyline may improve pain and urgency intensity associated with bladder pain syndrome and can be used in the management of this syndrome. Amitriptyline can be used in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children. However, its effect is not sustained after the treatment ends. Alarm therapy gives better short- and long-term results. In the US, amitriptyline is commonly used in children with ADHD as an adjunct to stimulant medications without any evidence or guideline supporting this practice. Many physicians in the UK (and the US also) commonly prescribe amitriptyline for insomnia; however, Cochrane reviewers were not able to find any randomized controlled studies that would support or refute this practice. Similarly, a major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of amitriptyline for insomnia. The well-known sedating effects of amitriptyline, however, bear understanding on and arguable justification for this practice. It may function similarly to doxepin in this regard, although the evidence for doxepin is more robust. Trimipramine may be a more novel alternative given its tendency to not suppress but brighten R.E.M. sleep. == Contraindications and precautions == The known contraindications of amitriptyline are: Amitriptyline should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy, impaired liver function, pheochromocytoma, urinary retention, prostate enlargement, hyperthyroidism, and pyloric stenosis. In patients with the rare condition of shallow anterior chamber of eyeball and narrow anterior chamber angle, amitriptyline may provoke attacks of acute glaucoma due to dilation of the pupil. It may aggravate psychosis, if used for depression with schizophrenia. It may precipitate the switch to mania in those with bipolar disorder. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should avoid amitriptyline due to increased side effects. If it is necessary to use it, half dose is recommended. Amitriptyline can be used during pregnancy and lactation when SSRIs have been shown not to work. == Side effects == The most frequent side effects, occurring in 20% or more of users, are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain (on average 1.8 kg). Other common side effects are headache problems (amblyopia, blurred vision), tachycardia, increased appetite, tremor, fatigue/asthenia/feeling slowed down, and dyspepsia. A less common side effect of amitriptyline is urination problems (8.7%). Amitriptyline can increase suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under the age of 24 and the US FDA required a boxed warning to be added to the prescription label. Amitriptyline-associated sexual dysfunction (occurring at a frequency of 6.9%) seems to be mostly confined to males with depression and is expressed predominantly as erectile dysfunction and low libido disorder, with lesser frequency of ejaculatory and orgasmic problems. The rate of sexual dysfunction in males treated for indications other than depression and in females is not significantly different from placebo. Liver test abnormalities occur in 10–12% of patients on amitriptyline, but are usually mild, asymptomatic, and transient, with consistently elevated alanine transaminase in 3% of all patients. The increases of the enzymes above the 3-fold threshold of liver toxicity are uncommon, and cases of clinically apparent liver toxicity are rare; nevertheless, amitriptyline is placed in the group of antidepressants with greater risks of hepatic toxicity. Amitriptyline prolongs the QT interval. This prolongation is relatively small at therapeutic doses but becomes severe in overdose. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The British National Formulary notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose, thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. The treatment of overdose is mostly supportive as no specific antidote for amitriptyline overdose is available. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption if given within 1–2 hours of ingestion. If the affected person is unconscious or has an impaired gag reflex, a nasogastric tube may be used to deliver the activated charcoal into the stomach. ECG monitoring for cardiac conduction abnormalities is essential and if one is found close monitoring of cardiac function is advised. Body temperature should be regulated with measures such as heating blankets if necessary. Cardiac monitoring is advised for at least five days after the overdose. Benzodiazepines are recommended to control seizures. Dialysis is of no use due to the high degree of protein binding with amitriptyline. == Interactions == Since amitriptyline and its active metabolite nortriptyline are primarily metabolized by cytochromes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 (see its pharmacology), the inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to exhibit pharmacokinetic interactions with amitriptyline. According to the prescribing information, the interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the plasma level of amitriptyline. However, the results in the other literature are inconsistent: the co-administration of amitriptyline with a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine does increase the plasma levels of amitriptyline two-fold and of the main active metabolite nortriptyline 1.5-fold, but combination with less potent CYP2D6 inhibitors thioridazine or levomepromazine does not affect the levels of amitriptyline and increases nortriptyline by about 1.5-fold; A case of clinically significant interaction with potent CYP2D6 inhibitor terbinafine has been reported. A potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes fluvoxamine increases the level of amitriptyline two-fold while slightly decreasing the level of nortriptyline. Similar changes occur with a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes cimetidine: amitriptyline level increases by about 70%, while nortriptyline decreases by 50%. CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole elevates amitriptyline level by about a quarter. On the other hand, cytochrome P450 inducers such as carbamazepine and St. John's Wort decrease the levels of both amitriptyline and nortriptyline Oral contraceptives may increase the blood level of amitriptyline by as high as 90%. Valproate moderately increases the levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline through an unclear mechanism. The prescribing information warns that the combination of amitriptyline with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may cause potentially lethal serotonin syndrome; however, this has been disputed. The prescribing information cautions that some patients may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate. However, other literature states that there is little or no interaction: in a pharmacokinetic study topiramate only increased the level of amitriptyline by 20% and nortriptyline by 33%. Amitriptyline counteracts the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. When given with amitriptyline, other anticholinergic agents may result in hyperpyrexia or paralytic ileus. Co-administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram is not recommended due to the potential for the development of toxic delirium. Amitriptyline causes an unusual type of interaction with the anticoagulant phenprocoumon during which great fluctuations of the prothrombin time have been observed. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a stronger norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, further augmenting amitriptyline's effects on norepinephrine reuptake (see table in this section). Amitriptyline additionally acts as a potent inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, the α1A-adrenergic, the histamine H1 and the M1-M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see table in this section). Amitriptyline is a non-selective blocker of multiple ion channels, in particular, voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.3, Nav1.5, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8, voltage-gated potassium channels Kv7.2/ Kv7.3, Kv7.1, Kv7.1/KCNE1, and hERG. === Mechanism of action === Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters by amitriptyline results in interference with neuronal reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Since the reuptake process is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity, this action may potentiate or prolong the activity of serotonergic and adrenergic neurons and is believed to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline. Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake leads to an increased concentration of norepinephrine in the posterior gray column of the spinal cord appears to be mostly responsible for the analgesic action of amitriptyline. Increased level of norepinephrine increases the basal activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which mediate an analgesic effect by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission among spinal interneurons. The blocking effect of amitriptyline on sodium channels may also contribute to its efficacy in pain conditions. === Pharmacokinetics === Amitriptyline is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (90–95%). Absorption is gradual with the peak concentration in blood plasma reached after about 4 hours. Extensive metabolism on the first pass through the liver leads to average bioavailability of about 50% (45%-53%). Amitriptyline is metabolized mostly by CYP2C19 into nortriptyline and by CYP2D6 leading to a variety of hydroxylated metabolites, with the principal one among them being (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline (see metabolism scheme), and to a lesser degree, by CYP3A4. Nortriptyline, the main active metabolite of amitriptyline, is an antidepressant on its own right. Nortriptyline reaches 10% higher level in the blood plasma than the parent drug amitriptyline and 40% greater area under the curve, and its action is an important part of the overall action of amitriptyline. Another active metabolite is (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline, which is a norepinephrine uptake inhibitor four times weaker than nortriptyline. (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline blood level is comparable to that of nortriptyline, but its cerebrospinal fluid level, which is a close proxy of the brain concentration of a drug, is twice higher than nortriptyline's. Based on this, (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline was suggested to significantly contribute to the antidepressant effects of amitriptyline. Blood levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline and pharmacokinetics of amitriptyline in general, with clearance difference of up to 10-fold, vary widely between individuals. Variability of the area under the curve in steady state is also high, which makes a slow upward titration of the dose necessary. In the blood, amitriptyline is 96% bound to plasma proteins; nortriptyline is 93–95% bound, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline is about 60% bound. Amitriptyline has an elimination half life of 21 hours, nortriptyline – 23–31 hours, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline − 8–10 hours. Within 48 hours, 12−80% of amitriptyline is eliminated in the urine, mostly as metabolites. 2% of the unchanged drug is excreted in the urine. Elimination in the feces, apparently, have not been studied. Therapeutic levels of amitriptyline range from 75 to 175 ng/mL (270–631 nM), or 80–250 ng/mL of both amitriptyline and its metabolite nortriptyline. === Pharmacogenetics === Since amitriptyline is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, genetic variations within the genes coding for these enzymes can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of amitriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have \"normal\" metabolism of amitriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use amitriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 in patients who are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in the starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If the use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. == Chemistry == Amitriptyline is a highly lipophilic molecule having an octanol-water partition coefficient (pH 7.4) of 3.0, while the log P of the free base was reported as 4.92. Solubility of the free base amitriptyline in water is 14 mg/L. Amitriptyline is prepared by reacting dibenzosuberane with 3-(dimethylamino)propylmagnesium chloride and then heating the resulting intermediate product with hydrochloric acid to eliminate water. == History == Amitriptyline was first developed by the American pharmaceutical company Merck in the late 1950s. In 1958, Merck approached several clinical investigators proposing to conduct clinical trials of amitriptyline for schizophrenia. One of these researchers, Frank Ayd, instead, suggested using amitriptyline for depression. Ayd treated 130 patients and, in 1960, reported that amitriptyline had antidepressant properties similar to another, and the only known at the time, tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. Following this, the US Food and Drug Administration approved amitriptyline for depression in 1961. In Europe, due to a quirk of the patent law at the time allowing patents only on the chemical synthesis but not on the drug itself, Roche and Lundbeck were able to independently develop and market amitriptyline in the early 1960s. According to research by a historian of psychopharmacology David Healy, amitriptyline became a much bigger selling drug than its precursor imipramine because of two factors. First, amitriptyline has a much stronger anxiolytic effect. Second, Merck conducted a marketing campaign raising clinicians' awareness of depression as a clinical entity. == Society and culture == In the 2021 film The Many Saints of Newark, amitriptyline (referred to by the brand name Elavil) is part of the plot line of the movie. === Names === Amitriptyline is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while amitriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are amitriptilina, in German is Amitriptylin, and in Latin is amitriptylinum. The embonate salt is known as amitriptyline embonate, which is its BANM, or as amitriptyline pamoate unofficially. === Prescription trends === Between 1998 and 2017, along with imipramine, amitriptyline was the most commonly prescribed first antidepressant for children aged 5–11 years in England. It was also the most prescribed antidepressant (along with fluoxetine) for 12- to 17-year-olds. == Research == The few randomized controlled trials investigating amitriptyline efficacy in eating disorder have been discouraging. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == Further reading == Dean L (March 2017). \"Amitriptyline Therapy and CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotype\".

         "Metoclopramide is a medication used to treat nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is also used to treat migraine headaches. Common side effects include feeling tired, diarrhea, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. More serious side effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome and depression. It is thus rarely recommended that people take the medication for longer than twelve weeks. No evidence of harm has been found after being taken by many pregnant women. It belongs to the group of medications known as dopamine-receptor antagonists and works as a prokinetic. In 2012, metoclopramide was one of the top 100 most prescribed medications in the United States. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 245th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Nausea === Metoclopramide is commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with conditions such as uremia, radiation sickness, cancer and the effects of chemotherapy, labor, infection, and emetogenic drugs. As a perioperative anti-emetic, the effective dose is usually 25 to 50 mg (compared to the usual 10 mg dose). It is also used in pregnancy as a second choice for treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum (severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy). It is also used preventatively by some EMS providers when transporting people who are conscious and spinally immobilized. === Migraine === In migraine headaches, metoclopramide may be used in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or in combination with aspirin. === Gastroparesis === Evidence also supports its use for gastroparesis, a condition that causes the stomach to empty poorly, and as of 2010 it was the only drug approved by the FDA for that condition. It is also used in gastroesophageal reflux disease. === Lactation === While metoclopramide is used to increase breast milk production, evidence for its effectiveness for this indication is poor. Its safety for this use is also unclear. === Procedures === Intravenous metoclopramide is used in small-bowel follow-through, small-bowel enema, and radionuclide gastric-emptying studies to reduce the time taken for the barium to go through the intestines, thus reducing the total time needed for the procedures. Metoclopramide also prevents vomiting after oral ingestion of barium. == Contraindications == Metoclopramide is contraindicated in pheochromocytoma. It should be used with caution in Parkinson's disease since, as a dopamine antagonist, it may worsen symptoms. Long-term use should be avoided in people with clinical depression, as it may worsen one's mental state. It is contraindicated for people with a suspected bowel obstruction, in epilepsy, if a stomach operation has been performed in the previous three or four days, perforation or blockage of the stomach, and in newborn babies. The European Medicines Agency reviewed the drug's safety in 2011, which determined that it should not be prescribed in high doses, for periods of more than five days, or given to children below 1 year of age. They suggested its use in older children should be restricted to treating post-chemotherapy or post-surgery nausea and vomiting, and even then only for patients where other treatments have failed. For adults, they recommended its use be restricted to treating migraines and post-chemotherapy or post-surgery patients. === Pregnancy === Metoclopramide has long been used in all stages of pregnancy with no evidence of harm to the mother or foetus. A large cohort study of babies born to Israeli women exposed to metoclopramide during pregnancy found no evidence that the drug increases the risk of congenital malformations, low birth weight, preterm birth, or perinatal mortality. A large cohort study in Denmark found, in addition, no association between metoclopramide exposure and miscarriage. Metoclopramide is excreted into milk. === Infants === A systematic review found a wide range of reported outcomes for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in infants rating the evidence as \"poor\" and \"inconclusive\" for safety and efficacy for the treatment of GERD in infants. == Side effects == Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with metoclopramide therapy include restlessness (akathisia), and focal dystonia. Infrequent ADRs include hypertension, hypotension, hyperprolactinaemia leading to galactorrhea, headache, and extrapyramidal effects such as oculogyric crisis. Metoclopramide may be the most common cause of drug-induced movement disorders. The risk of extrapyramidal effects is increased in people under 20 years of age, and with high-dose or prolonged therapy. Tardive dyskinesia may be persistent and irreversible in some people. The majority of reports of tardive dyskinesia occur in people who have used metoclopramide for more than three months. Consequently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that metoclopramide be used for short-term treatment, preferably less than 12 weeks. In 2009, the FDA required all manufacturers of metoclopramide to issue a black box warning regarding the risk of tardive dyskinesia with chronic or high-dose use of the drug. Dystonic reactions may be treated with benzatropine, diphenhydramine, trihexyphenidyl, or procyclidine. Symptoms usually subside with intramuscularly injected diphenhydramine. Agents in the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be helpful, but benefits are usually modest, and the side effects of sedation and weakness can be problematic. In some cases, the akathisia effects of metoclopramide are directly related to the infusion rate when the drug is administered intravenously. Side effects were usually seen in the first 15 minutes after administering the dose of metoclopramide. Withdrawal effects were reported for a female taking metoclopramide for about six months. The adverse symptoms oscillated between akinesian and akathisian, including amenorrhea, and appeared like secondary parkinsonism. Adverse effects remained a year after the metoclopramide had been gradually withdrawn. === Rare side effects === Diabetes, age, and female gender are risk factors that increase the likelihood of experiencing a neuropsychiatric side effect of metoclopramide. Panic disorder Major depressive disorder Agoraphobia Agranulocytosis, supraventricular tachycardia, hyperaldosteronism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, akathisia and tardive dyskinesia. Methaemoglobinaemia* == Pharmacology == Metoclopramide appears to bind to dopamine D2 receptors with nanomolar affinity (Ki = 28.8 nM), where it is a receptor antagonist, and is also a mixed 5-HT3 receptor antagonist/5-HT4 receptor agonist. === Mechanism of action === The antiemetic action of metoclopramide is due to its antagonist activity at D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain — this action prevents nausea and vomiting triggered by most stimuli. At higher doses, 5-HT3 antagonist activity may also contribute to the antiemetic effect. The gastroprokinetic activity of metoclopramide is mediated by muscarinic activity, D2 receptor antagonist activity, and 5-HT4 receptor agonist activity. The gastroprokinetic effect itself may also contribute to the antiemetic effect. Metoclopramide also increases the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. Metoclopramide might influence mood because of its antagonistic blockade on 5-HT3 and agonistic (activating) action on 5-HT4. While muscarinic receptors affect gastrointestinal motility, metoclopramide’s prokinetic effects are not primarily due to direct muscarinic receptor activity. Instead, they result from its actions on 5-HT4 and D2 receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === CYP2D6 metabolizes metoclopramide, a reversible inhibitor, but not inactivator, of CYP2D6. The major metabolites of metoclopramide are N-hydroxylation and N-deethylation by all common CYP enzymes. == Chemistry == Metoclopramide is a substituted benzamide; cisapride and mosapride are structurally related. == History == Metoclopramide was first described by Louis Justin-Besançon and Charles Laville in 1964, while working to improve the anti-dysrhythmic properties of procainamide. That research project also produced the product sulpiride. The first clinical trials were published by Tourneu et al. in 1964 and by Boisson and Albot in 1966. Justin-Besançon and Laville worked for Laboratoires Delagrange and that company introduced the drug Primperan in 1964. Laboratoires Delagrange was acquired by Synthelabo in 1991 which eventually became part of Sanofi. A.H. Robins introduced the drug in the US under the brand name Reglan in 1979 as an injectable and an oral form was approved in 1980. in 1989 A.H. Robins was acquired by American Home Products, which changed its name to Wyeth in 2002. The drugs were initially used to control nausea for people with severe headaches or migraines, and later used for nausea caused by radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and later yet for treating nausea caused by anesthesia. In the US the injectable form was labelled for chemotherapy-induced nausea and the oral form was eventually labelled for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It became widely used in the 1980s, becoming the most commonly used drug to treat anesthesia-induced nausea and for treating gastritis in emergency rooms. The first generics were introduced in 1985. In the early 1980s signs began to emerge in pharmacovigilance studies from Sweden that the drug was causing tardive dyskinesia in some patients. The FDA required a warning about tardive dyskinesia to be added to the drug label in 1985 stating that: \"tardive dyskinesia . . . may develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,” and warned against use longer than 12 weeks, as that was how long the drug has been tested. In 2009 the FDA required that a black box warning be added to the label. The emergence of this severe side effect led to a wave of product liability litigation against generic manufacturers as well as Wyeth. The litigation was complicated since there was a lack of clarity in jurisdiction between state laws, where product liability is determined, and federal law, which determines how drugs are labelled, as well as between generics companies, which had no control over labelling, and the originator company, which did. The litigation yielded at least two important cases. In Conte v. Wyeth in the California state courts, the claims of the plaintiff against the generic companies Pliva, Teva, and Purepac that had sold the drugs that the plaintiff actually took, and the claims against Wyeth, whose product the plaintiff never took, were all dismissed by the trial court, but the case was appealed, and in 2008 the appellate court upheld the dismissal of the cases against the generic companies, but reversed on Wyeth, allowing the case against Wyeth to proceed. This established an \"innovator liability\" or \"pioneer liability\" for pharmaceutical companies. The precedent was not widely followed in California nor in other states. Litigation over the same issues related to metoclopramide also reached the US Supreme Court in Pliva, Inc. v. Mensing, in which the court held in 2011 that generic companies cannot be held liable for information, or the lack of information, on the originator's label. As of August 2015 there were about 5000 suits pending across the US and efforts to consolidate them into a class action had failed. Shortly following the Pliva decision, the FDA proposed a rule change that would allow generics manufacturers to update the label if the originating drug had been withdrawn from the market for reasons other than safety. As of May 2016 the rule, which turned out to be controversial since it would open generic companies to product liability suits, was still not finalized, and the FDA had stated the final rule would be issued in April 2017. The FDA issued a draft guidance for generic companies to update labels in July 2016. == Society and culture == === Brand names === == Veterinary use == Metoclopramide is commonly used to prevent vomiting in cats and dogs.

         "Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ or SMX) is an antibiotic. It is used for bacterial infections such as urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and prostatitis and is effective against both gram negative and positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and skin rashes. It is a sulfonamide and bacteriostatic. It resembles a component of folic acid. It prevents folic acid synthesis in the bacteria that must synthesize their own folic acid. Mammalian cells, and some bacteria, do not synthesize but require preformed folic acid (vitamin B9); they are therefore insensitive to sulfamethoxazole. It was introduced to the United States in 1961. It is now mostly used in combination with trimethoprim (abbreviated SMX-TMP). The SMX-TMP combination is on the WHO Model List of Essential medicines as a first-choice treatment for urinary tract infections. Other names include: sulfamethalazole and sulfisomezole. == Side effects == The most common side effects of sulfamethoxazole are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria). There have been rare instances where severe adverse reactions have resulted in fatalities. These include Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Allergic reactions to Sulfonamides have been shown to include the entire Gel-Coombs spectrum of hyperactivity reactions. Type 1 reactions include immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. In contrast, non-type 1 hypersensitivities are believed to be caused by metabolites of sulfonamides. Therefore, the liver and kidney are the determining factors of these other hypersensitivity reactions; alterations in kidney or liver functions may increase or decrease the frequencies of these reactions. One study has shown the allergic reaction rate to be about 3.0% over 359 courses of therapy. Of the allergic reactions, skin rashes, eosinophilia and drug fever were the most common, while serious reactions were less common. Sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated in people with a known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides. == Mechanism of action == Sulfamethoxazole, a sulfanilamide, is a structural analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). They compete with PABA to bind to dihydropteroate synthetase and inhibit conversion of PABA and dihydropteroate diphosphate to dihydrofolic acid, or dihydrofolate. Inhibiting the production of dihydrofolate intermediate interferes with the normal bacterial synthesis of folic acid (folate). Folate is an essential metabolite for bacterial growth and replication because it is used in DNA synthesis, primarily at thymidylate and purine biosynthesis, and amino acids synthesis, including serine, glycine and methionine. Hence, blockage of folate production inhibits the folate-dependent metabolic processes for bacterial growth. Since it inhibits bacterial growth, sulfamethoxazole is considered a bacteriostatic antibiotic. Sulfonamides are selective against bacteria because they interfere with the synthesis of folate, a process which does not occur in humans. Humans do not synthesize folate, and must acquire it through diet. == Pharmacokinetics == Absorption Sulfamethoxazole is well-absorbed when administered topically. It is rapidly absorbed when it is orally administered. Distribution Sulfamethoxazole distributes into most body tissues as well as into sputum, vaginal fluid, and middle ear fluid. It also crosses the placenta. About 70% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. Its Tmax (or time to reach maximum drug concentration in plasma) occurs 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-life of sulfamethoxazole is 10 hours. However, the half-life of the drug noticeably increases in people with creatinine clearance rates equal to or less than 30 mL/minute. A half-life of 22–50 hours has been reported for people with creatinine clearances of less than 10 mL/minute. Metabolism Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in the human liver to at least 5 metabolites. These metabolites are the N4-acetyl-, N4-hydroxy-, 5-methylhydroxy-, N4-acetyl-5-methylhydroxy-sulfamethoxazole metabolites, and an N-glucuronide conjugate. The CYP2C9 enzyme is responsible for the formation of the N4-hydroxy metabolite. In vitro studies suggest sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of the P-glycoprotein transporter. Excretion Sulfamethoxazole is primarily renally excreted via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. About 20% of the sulfamethoxazole in urine is the unchanged drug, about 15–20% is the N-glucuronide conjugate, and about 50–70 % is the acetylated metabolite. Sulfamethoxazole is also excreted in human milk. == See also == Sulfisoxazole List of cytochrome P450 modulators == Notes == == External links ==",

         " Somatostatin (SST) is an inhibitor of the release of somatotropin, glucagon, insulin, gastrointestinal hormones, and other secretory proteins (1). SST is also known as somatotropin release-inhibiting factor (SRIF). SST is a cyclic polypeptide with two biologically active isoforms, SRIF-14 and SRIF-28, of 14 and 28 amino acids, respectively. SRIF has a short plasma half-life of <3 min (2).

Regulation of protein synthesis via AA occurs at least in part by alterations in the phosphorylation status of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway proteins. Although the ideal profile of Lys:Met to promote milk protein synthesis during established lactation in dairy cows has been proposed to be 3:1, aside from being the most-limiting AA for milk protein synthesis, the role of Met in other key biologic pathways such as methylation is not well characterized in the bovine. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of increasing supplemental Met, based on the ideal 3:1 ratio of Lys to Met, on intracellular metabolism related to protein synthesis and mTOR pathway phosphorylation status. MAC-T cells, an immortalized bovine mammary epithelial cell line, were incubated (n = 5 replicates/treatment) for 12 h with 3 incremental doses of Met while holding Lys concentration constant to achieve the following: Lys:Met 2.9:1 (ideal AA ratio; IPAA), Lys:Met 2.5:1 (LM2.5), and Lys:Met 2.0:1 (LM2.0). The ratios of Thr:Phe (1.05:1), Lys:Thr (1.8:1), Lys:His (2.38:1), and Lys:Val (1.23:1) were the same across the 3 treatments. Applying gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics revealed distinct clusters of differentially concentrated metabolites in response to Lys:Met. Lower Phe, branched-chain AA, and putrescine concentrations were observed with LM2.5 compared with IPAA. Apart from greater intracellular Met concentrations, further elevations in Met level (LM2.0) led to greater intracellular concentrations of nonessential AA (Pro, Glu, Gln, and Gly) compared with IPAA and greater essential AA (EAA; Met, Ile, and Leu) and nonessential AA (Pro, Gly, Ala, Gln, and Glu) compared with LM2.5. However, compared with IPAA, mRNA expression of β-casein and AA transporters (SLC7A5, SLC36A1, SLC38A2, SLC38A9, and SLC43A1) and mTOR phosphorylation were lower in response to LM2.5 and LM2.0. Overall, the results of this study provide evidence that increasing Met while Lys and the ratios of Phe, Thr, His, and Val relative to Lys were held constant could increase the concentration and utilization of intracellular EAA, in particular branched-chain AA, potentially through improving the activity of AA transporters partly controlled by mTOR signaling. Because EAA likely are metabolized by other tissues upon absorption, a question for future in vivo studies is whether formulating diets for optimal ratios of EAA in the metabolizable protein is sufficient to provide the desired levels of these AA to the mammary cells.",

         "Nortriptyline, sold under the brand name Aventyl, among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant. This medicine is also sometimes used for neuropathic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), smoking cessation and anxiety. Its use for young people with depression and other psychiatric disorders may be limited due to increased suicidality in the 18–24 population initiating treatment. Nortriptyline is not a preferred treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or smoking cessation. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurry vision, sleepiness, low blood pressure with standing, and weakness. Serious side effects may include seizures, an increased risk of suicide in those less than 25 years of age, urinary retention, glaucoma, mania, and a number of heart issues. Nortriptyline may cause problems if taken during pregnancy. Use during breastfeeding appears to be relatively safe. It is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and is believed to work by altering levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Nortriptyline was approved for medical use in the United States in 1964. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 191st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Nortriptyline is used to treat depression. A level between 50 and 150 ng/mL of nortriptyline in the blood generally corresponds with an antidepressant effect. It is also used off-label for the treatment of panic disorder, ADHD, irritable bowel syndrome, tobacco-cessation, migraine prophylaxis and chronic pain or neuralgia modification, particularly temporomandibular joint disorder. === Irritable bowel syndrome === Nortriptyline has also been used as an off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). == Contraindications == Nortriptyline should not be used in the acute recovery phase after myocardial infarction (heart attack). Use of tricyclic antidepressants along with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), linezolid, or IV methylene blue are contraindicated as it can cause an increased risk of developing serotonin syndrome. Closer monitoring is required for those with a history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, glaucoma, or seizures, as well as in persons with hyperthyroidism or receiving thyroid hormones. == Side effects == The most common side effects include dry mouth, sedation, constipation, increased appetite, blurred vision and tinnitus. An occasional side effect is a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Alcohol may exacerbate some of its side effects. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are generally the same as for the other tricyclic antidepressants, including anticholinergic effects, serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. TCAs, particularly nortriptyline, have a relatively narrow therapeutic index, which increase the chance of an overdose (both accidental and intentional). Symptoms of overdose include: irregular heartbeat, seizures, coma, confusion, hallucination, widened pupils, drowsiness, agitation, fever, low body temperature, stiff muscles and vomiting. == Interactions == Excessive consumption of alcohol in combination with nortriptyline therapy may have a potentiating effect, which may lead to the danger of increased suicidal attempts or overdosage, especially in patients with histories of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation. It may interact with the following drugs: heart rhythm medications such as flecainide (Tambocor), propafenone (Rhythmol), or quinidine (Cardioquin, Quinidex, Quinaglute) cimetidine guanethidine reserpine == Pharmacology == Nortriptyline is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and a moderate serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Additionally, nortriptyline inhibits the activity of histamine and acetylcholine. Its pharmacologic profile is as the table shows with (inhibition or antagonism of all sites). === Pharmacodynamics === Nortriptyline is an active metabolite of amitriptyline by demethylation in the liver. Chemically, it is a secondary amine dibenzocycloheptene and pharmacologically it is classed as a first-generation antidepressant. Nortriptyline may also have a sleep-improving effect due to antagonism of the H1 and 5-HT2A receptors. In the short term, however, nortriptyline may disturb sleep due to its activating effect. In one study, nortriptyline had the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter among the tricyclic antidepressants (KD = 1,140 nM) besides amineptine (a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor), although its affinity for this transporter was still 261- and 63-fold lower than for the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters (KD = 4.37 and 18 nM, respectively). === Pharmacogenetics === Nortriptyline is metabolized in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, and genetic variations within the gene coding for this enzyme can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of nortriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have \"normal\" metabolism of nortriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use nortriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding nortriptyline in persons who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. If use of nortriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommends reducing the dose of nortriptyline in CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or increasing the dose in ultrarapid metabolizers. == Chemistry == Nortriptyline is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene tricyclic antidepressants include amitriptyline (N-methylnortriptyline), protriptyline, and butriptyline. Nortriptyline is a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant, with its N-methylated parent amitriptyline being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants include desipramine and protriptyline. The chemical name of nortriptyline is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl-1-propanamine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21N1 with a molecular weight of 263.384 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 72-69-5 and of the hydrochloride is 894-71-3. == History == Nortriptyline was developed by Geigy. It first appeared in the literature in 1962 and was patented the same year. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in 1963. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Nortriptyline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while nortriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are nortriptilina, in German is nortriptylin, and in Latin is nortriptylinum. === Brand names === Brand names of nortriptyline include Allegron, Aventyl, Noritren, Norpress, Nortrilen, Norventyl, Norzepine, Pamelor, and Sensival, among many others. == Research == Although not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neuropathic pain, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants for the treatment of this condition in both depressed and non-depressed individuals. In 2010, an evidence-based guideline sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Pain recommended nortriptyline as a first-line medication for neuropathic pain. However, in a 2015 Cochrane systematic review the authors did not recommend nortriptyline as a first-line agent for neuropathic pain. It may be effective in the treatment of tobacco-cessation. == References ==",

         "Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. It was discovered in 1965 in analysis of RNA transferase. Inosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs. Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism. Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMD) inhibition. == Reactions == Adenine is converted to adenosine or inosine monophosphate (IMP), either of which, in turn, is converted into inosine (I), which pairs with adenine (A), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase intraconverts inosine and hypoxanthine. Inosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotide reactions required for muscle movements. == Clinical significance == Subsequent studies in humans suggest that inosine supplementation has no effect on athletic performance. Animal studies have suggested that inosine has neuroprotective properties. It has been proposed for spinal cord injury and for administration after stroke, because observation suggests that inosine induces axonal rewiring. After ingestion, inosine is metabolized into uric acid, which has been suggested to be a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenger with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Peroxynitrite has been correlated with axon degeneration In 2003, a study was initiated at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center to determine whether raising the levels of uric acid by the administration of inosine would slow the progression of MS. The study was completed in 2006 but the results were not reported to NIH. A subsequent publication hinted at potential benefits but the sample size (16 patients) was too small for a definitive conclusion. In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in four of 16 patients. With phase II trials for Parkinson's disease completed, inosine will continue to phase III trials. Earlier trials suggested that patients with the highest serum urate levels had slower progression of Parkinson's symptoms. The trial uses inosine to raise urate levels in those with levels lower than the population mean (6 mg/dL). Alseres Pharmaceuticals (named Boston Life Sciences when patent was granted) patented the use of inosine to treat stroke and was investigating the drug in the MS setting. In the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, it is classified as an antiviral. == Binding == Inosine is a natural ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA A receptor. == Biotechnology == When designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it can pair with any natural base. This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer's annealing efficiency. However, inosine pairs preferentially with cytosine (C) and its introduction to RNA, e.g. by the action of ADARs, thereby destabilizes double-stranded RNA by changing AU base-pairs to IU mismatches. == Fitness == Despite lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements. == Feeding stimulant == Inosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some species of farmed fish. For example, inosine and inosine 5-monophosphate have been reported as specific feeding stimulants for turbot fry, (Scophthalmus maximus) and Japanese amberjack, (Seriola quinqueradiata). The main problem of using inosine and/or inosine-5-monophosphate as feeding attractants is their high cost. However, their use may be economically justified within larval feeds for marine fish larvae during the early weaning period, since the total quantity of feed consumed is relatively small. == See also == Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase Inosine pranobex Nucleobase == References == == External links == PDR health study",

         "Metoprolol, sold under the brand name Lopressor among others, is a medication used to treat angina, high blood pressure and a number of conditions involving an abnormally fast heart rate. It is also used to prevent further heart problems after myocardial infarction and to prevent headaches in those with migraines. It is a beta blocker, specifically a selective β1 receptor blocker, and is taken by mouth or is given intravenously. Common side effects include trouble sleeping, feeling tired, feeling faint, and abdominal discomfort. Large doses may cause serious toxicity. Risk in pregnancy has not been ruled out. It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. The metabolism of metoprolol can vary widely among patients, often as a result of hepatic impairment or CYP2D6 polymorphism. Metoprolol was first made in 1969, patented in 1970, and approved for medical use in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the sixth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 65 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Metoprolol is used for a number of conditions, including angina, acute myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and prevention of migraine headaches. It is an adjunct in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Both oral and intravenous forms of metoprolol are available for administration. The different salt versions of metoprolol – metoprolol tartrate and metoprolol succinate – are approved for different conditions and are not interchangeable. Off-label uses include supraventricular tachycardia and thyroid storm. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects, especially with higher doses, include dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, diarrhea, unusual dreams, trouble sleeping, depression, and vision problems such as blurred vision or dry eyes. β-blockers, including metoprolol, reduce salivary flow via inhibition of the direct sympathetic innervation of the salivary glands. Metoprolol may also cause the hands and feet to feel cold. Due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier, lipophilic beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances such as insomnia, vivid dreams and nightmares. Patients should be cautious while driving or operating machinery due to its potential to cause decreased alertness. There may also be an impact on blood sugar levels, and it can potentially mask signs of low blood sugar. The safety of metoprolol during pregnancy is not fully established. === Precautions === Metoprolol reduces long-term mortality and hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure. A meta-analysis further supports reduced incidence of heart failure worsening in patients treated with beta-blockers compared to placebo. However, in some circumstances, particularly when initiating metoprolol in patients with more symptomatic disease, an increased prevalence of hospitalisation and mortality has been reported within the first two months of starting. Patients should monitor for swelling of extremities, fatigue, and shortness of breath. A Cochrane Review concluded that although metoprolol reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence, it is unclear whether the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. This medicine may cause changes in blood sugar levels or cover up signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid pulse rate. It also may cause some people to become less alert than they are normally, making it dangerous for them to drive or use machines. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Risk for the fetus has not been ruled out, per being rated pregnancy category C in Australia, meaning that it may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus (but no malformations). It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. == Overdose == Excessive doses of metoprolol can cause bradycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, seizures, and cardiorespiratory arrest. Blood or plasma concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of overdose or poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 200 μg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 1–20 mg/L in overdose victims. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Metoprolol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a selective antagonist of the β1-adrenergic receptor and has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Metoprolol exerts its effects by blocking the action of certain neurotransmitters, specifically adrenaline and noradrenaline. It does this by selectively binding to and antagonizing β1 adrenergic receptors in the body. When adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine) are released from nerve endings or secreted by the adrenal glands, they bind to β1 adrenergic receptors found primarily in cardiac tissues such as the heart. This binding activates these receptors, leading to various physiological responses, including an increase in heart rate, force of contraction (inotropic effect), conduction speed through electrical pathways in the heart, and release of renin from the kidneys. Metoprolol competes with adrenaline and noradrenaline for binding sites on these β1 receptors. By occupying these receptor sites without activating them, metoprolol blocks or inhibits their activation by endogenous catecholamines like adrenaline or noradrenaline. Metoprolol blocks β1-adrenergic receptors in heart muscle cells, thereby decreasing the slope of phase 4 in the nodal action potential (reducing Na+ uptake) and prolonging repolarization of phase 3 (slowing down K+ release). It also suppresses the norepinephrine-induced increase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak and the spontaneous SR Ca2+ release, which are the major triggers for atrial fibrillation. Through this mechanism of selective blockade at β1 receptors, metoprolol exerts the following effects: Heart rate reduction, i.e., decrease of the resting heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and reduction of excessive elevations resulting from exercise or stress. Reduction of the force of contraction, i.e., decrease in contractility (negative inotropic effect), which lessens how hard each heartbeat contracts. Decrease in cardiac output, i.e., decrease in both heart rate and contractility within myocardium cells, where β1 is predominantly located, overall blood output per minute lowers called cardiac output/dysfunction, allowing decreased demands placed onto impaired hearts, reducing oxygen demand-supply mismatch. Lowering of blood pressure. Antiarrhythmic effects, such as supraventricular tachycardia prevention. Metoprolol also prevents electrical wave propagation. === Pharmacokinetics === Metoprolol is mostly absorbed from the intestine with an absorption fraction of 0.95. The systemic bioavailability after oral administration is approximately 50%. Less than 5% of an orally administered dose of metoprolol is excreted unchanged in urine; most of it is eliminated in metabolized form through feces via bile secretion into the intestines. Metoprolol undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, mainly α-hydroxylation and O-demethylation through various cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2D6 (primary), CYP3A4, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9. The primary metabolites formed are α-hydroxymetoprolol and O-demethylmetoprolol. Metoprolol is classified as a moderately lipophilic beta blocker. More lipophilic beta blockers tend to cross the blood–brain barrier more readily, with greater potential for effects in the central nervous system as well as associated neuropsychiatric side effects. Metoprolol binds mainly to human serum albumin with an unbound fraction of 0.88. It has a large volume of distribution at steady state (3.2 L/kg), indicating extensive distribution throughout the body. == Chemistry == Metoprolol was synthesized and its activity discovered in 1969. The specific agent in on-market formulations of metoprolol is either metoprolol tartrate or metoprolol succinate, where tartrate is an immediate-release formulation and the succinate is an extended-release formulation (with 100 mg metoprolol tartrate corresponding to 95 mg metoprolol succinate). === Stereochemistry === Metoprolol contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers. This is a racemate, i.e. a 1:1 mixture of (R)- and the (S)-form: == Society and culture == === Legal status === Metoprolol was approved for medical use in the United States in August 1978. === Economics === In the 2000s, a lawsuit was brought against the manufacturers of Toprol XL (a time-release formula version of metoprolol) and its generic equivalent (metoprolol succinate) claiming that to increase profits, lower cost generic versions of Toprol XL were intentionally kept off the market. It alleged that the pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca AB, AstraZeneca LP, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, and Aktiebolaget Hassle violated antitrust and consumer protection law. In a settlement by the companies in 2012, without admission to the claims, they agreed to a settlement pay-out of US$ 11 million. === Sport === Because beta blockers can be used to reduce heart rate and minimize tremors, which can enhance performance in sports such as archery, metoprolol is banned by the world anti-doping agency in some sports. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2017). \"Metoprolol Therapy and CYP2D6 Genotype\".

         "Sertraline, sold under the brand name Zoloft among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Although also having approval for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), findings indicate it leads to only modest improvements in symptoms associated with this condition. The drug shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, mild sedation, dry mouth, and sexual dysfunction, but it appears not to lead to much weight gain, and its effects on cognitive performance are mild. Similar to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a mildly elevated rate of suicidal thoughts in people under the age of 25 years old. It should not be used together with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): this combination may cause serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening in some cases. Sertraline taken during pregnancy is associated with an increase in congenital heart defects in newborns. Sertraline was developed by scientists at Pfizer and approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and available as a generic medication. In 2016, sertraline was the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication in the United States. It was also the eleventh most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 39 million prescriptions in 2022, and sertraline ranks among the top 10 most prescribed medications in Australia between 2017 and 2023. For alleviating the symptoms of depression and anxiety, the drug is usually second in potency to another SSRI, escitalopram. Sertraline's effectiveness is similar to that of other antidepressants in its class, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, which are also considered first-line treatments and are better tolerated than the older tricyclic antidepressants. == Medical uses == Sertraline has been approved for major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Sertraline is approved for use in children with OCD. === Depression === In meta-analyses, sertraline displays similar efficacy to other SSRI antidepressants, with an odds ratio for response in clinical depression of between 1.44 and 1.67. However, as with other antidepressants, the nature and clinical significance of this effect remain disputed. A major study of sertraline in a broad primary care population found improvements in general mental health, quality of life, and anxiety. However, it failed to find significant effects on depression in either the mildly or severely depressed, and the clinical relevance and accuracy of the positive effects found have been questioned. In several double-blind studies, sertraline was consistently more effective than placebo for dysthymia, a more chronic variety of depression, and comparable to imipramine in that respect. Sertraline also improves the functional impairments of dysthymia to a similar degree whether group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy is undergone or not. Limited pediatric data also demonstrates a reduction in depressive symptoms in the pediatric population though remains a second-line therapy after fluoxetine. ==== Comparison with other antidepressants ==== In general, sertraline efficacy is similar to that of other antidepressants. For example, a meta-analysis of 12 new-generation antidepressants showed that sertraline and escitalopram are the best in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of adults with depression. Comparative clinical trials demonstrated that sertraline is similar in efficacy against depression to moclobemide, nefazodone, escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. Sertraline may be more efficacious for the treatment of depression in the acute phase (first four weeks) than fluoxetine. There are differences between sertraline and some other antidepressants in their efficacy in the treatment of different subtypes of depression and in their adverse effects. For severe depression, sertraline is as good as clomipramine but is better tolerated. Sertraline appears to work better in melancholic depression than fluoxetine, paroxetine, and mianserin and is similar to the tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. In the treatment of depression accompanied by OCD, sertraline performs significantly better than desipramine on the measures of both OCD and depression. Sertraline is equivalent to imipramine for the treatment of depression with co-morbid panic disorder, but it is better tolerated. Compared with amitriptyline, sertraline offered a greater overall improvement in quality of life of depressed patients. ==== Depression in elderly ==== Sertraline used for the treatment of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients is superior to placebo and comparable to another SSRI fluoxetine, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) amitriptyline, nortriptyline and imipramine. Sertraline has much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurs more frequently with sertraline. In addition, sertraline appears to be more effective than fluoxetine or nortriptyline in the older-than-70 subgroup. Accordingly, a meta-analysis of antidepressants in older adults found that sertraline, paroxetine and duloxetine were better than placebo. However, in a 2003 trial the effect size was modest, and there was no improvement in quality of life as compared to placebo. With depression in dementia, there is no benefit of sertraline treatment compared to either placebo or mirtazapine. === Obsessive–compulsive disorder === Sertraline is effective for the treatment of OCD in adults, adolescents and children. It was better tolerated and, based on intention-to-treat analysis, performed better than the gold standard of OCD treatment clomipramine. Continuing sertraline treatment helps prevent relapses of OCD with long-term data supporting its use for up to 24 months. The sertraline dosages necessary for the effective treatment of OCD are higher than the usual dosage for depression. The onset of action is also slower for OCD than for depression. The treatment recommendation is to start treatment with half of the maximal recommended dose for at least two months. After that, the dose can be raised to the maximal recommended in the cases of unsatisfactory response. Cognitive behavioral therapy alone is not more effective than sertraline in adolescents and children; however, a combination of these treatments is effective. === Panic disorder === Sertraline is superior to placebo for the treatment of panic disorder. The response rate was independent of the dose. In addition to decreasing the frequency of panic attacks by about 80% (vs. 45% for placebo) and decreasing general anxiety, sertraline resulted in an improvement in quality of life on most parameters. The patients rated as \"improved\" on sertraline reported better quality of life than the ones who \"improved\" on placebo. The authors of the study argued that the improvement achieved with sertraline is different and of a better quality than the improvement achieved with a placebo. Sertraline is equally effective for men and women, and for patients with or without agoraphobia. Previous unsuccessful treatment with benzodiazepines does not diminish its efficacy. However, the response rate was lower for the patients with more severe panic. Starting treatment simultaneously with sertraline and clonazepam, with subsequent gradual discontinuation of clonazepam, may accelerate the response. Double-blind comparative studies found sertraline to have the same effect on panic disorder as paroxetine or imipramine. While imprecise, comparison of the results of trials of sertraline with separate trials of other anti-panic agents (clomipramine, imipramine, clonazepam, alprazolam, and fluvoxamine) indicates approximate equivalence of these medications. === Other anxiety disorders === Sertraline has been successfully used for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. All three major domains of the disorder (fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms) respond to sertraline. Maintenance treatment, after the response is achieved, prevents the return of the symptoms. The improvement is greater among the patients with later, adult onset of the disorder. In a comparison trial, sertraline was superior to exposure therapy, but patients treated with the psychological intervention continued to improve during a year-long follow-up, while those treated with sertraline deteriorated after treatment termination. The combination of sertraline and cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be more effective in children and young people than either treatment alone. Sertraline has not been approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder; however, several guidelines recommend it as a first-line medication referring to good quality controlled clinical trials. === Premenstrual dysphoric disorder === Sertraline is effective in alleviating the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began during the first week of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity, and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating, and breast tenderness, were less responsive to sertraline. Taking sertraline only during the luteal phase, that is, the 12–14 days before menses is not as effective as continuous treatment. Continuous treatment with sub-therapeutic doses of sertraline (25 mg vs. usual 50–100 mg) is also effective. === Other indications === Sertraline is approved for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends it for patients who prefer drug treatment to a psychological one. Other guidelines also suggest sertraline as a first-line option for pharmacological therapy. When necessary, long-term pharmacotherapy can be beneficial. There are both negative and positive clinical trial results for sertraline, which may be explained by the types of psychological traumas, symptoms, and comorbidities included in the various studies. Positive results were obtained in trials that included predominantly women (75%) with a majority (60%) having physical or sexual assault as the traumatic event. Somewhat contrary to the above suggestions, a meta-analysis of sertraline clinical trials for PTSD found it to be statistically superior to placebo in the reduction of PTSD symptoms but the effect size was small. Another meta-analysis relegated sertraline to the second line, proposing trauma focused psychotherapy as a first-line intervention. The authors noted that Pfizer had declined to submit the results of a negative trial for inclusion in the meta-analysis making the results unreliable. Sertraline, when taken daily, can be useful for the treatment of premature ejaculation. A disadvantage of sertraline is that it requires continuous daily treatment to delay ejaculation significantly. A 2019 systematic review suggested that sertraline may be a good way to control anger, irritability, and hostility in depressed patients and patients with other comorbidities. == Contraindications == Sertraline is contraindicated in individuals taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or the antipsychotic pimozide. Sertraline concentrate contains ethanol and is therefore contraindicated with disulfiram. The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment \"must be approached with caution\". Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may be as high as three times the average exposure for the same dose. == Side effects == Nausea, ejaculation failure, insomnia, diarrhea, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, tremor, headache, excessive sweating, fatigue, restless legs syndrome and decreased libido are the common adverse effects associated with sertraline with the greatest difference from placebo. Those that most often result in interruption of the treatment are nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia. The incidence of diarrhea is higher with sertraline – especially when prescribed at higher doses – in comparison with other SSRIs. Over more than six months of sertraline therapy for depression, people showed no significant weight increase. A 30-month-long treatment with sertraline for OCD also resulted in no significant weight gain. Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the average weight gain was lower for fluoxetine (1%) but higher for citalopram, fluvoxamine and paroxetine (2.5%). Of the sertraline group, 4.5% gained a large amount of weight (defined as more than 7% gain). This result compares favorably with placebo, where, according to the literature, 3–6% of patients gained more than 7% of their initial weight. The large weight gain was observed only among female members of the sertraline group; the significance of this finding is unclear because of the small size of the group. Over a two-week treatment of healthy volunteers, sertraline slightly improved verbal fluency but did not affect word learning, short-term memory, vigilance, flicker fusion time, choice reaction time, memory span, or psychomotor coordination. In spite of lower subjective rating, that is, feeling that they performed worse, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the objective cognitive performance in a group of people treated for depression with sertraline for 1.5 years as compared to healthy controls. In children and adolescents taking sertraline for six weeks for anxiety disorders, 18 out of 20 measures of memory, attention, and alertness stayed unchanged. Divided attention was improved and verbal memory under interference conditions decreased marginally. Because of the large number of measures taken, it is possible that these changes were still due to chance. The unique effect of sertraline on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be related to these effects on cognition and vigilance. Sertraline has a low level of exposure of an infant through the breast milk and is recommended as the preferred option for the antidepressant therapy of breast-feeding mothers. There is 29–42% increase in congenital heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed sertraline during pregnancy, with sertraline use in the first trimester associated with 2.7-fold increase in septal heart defects. Abrupt interruption of sertraline treatment may result in withdrawal or discontinuation syndrome. Dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, agitation, and irritability are common symptoms. It typically occurs within a few days from drug discontinuation and lasts a few weeks. The withdrawal symptoms for sertraline are less severe and frequent than for paroxetine, and more frequent than for fluoxetine. In most cases symptoms are mild, short-lived, and resolve without treatment. More severe cases are often successfully treated by temporary reintroduction of the drug with a slower tapering-off rate. Sertraline and SSRI antidepressants in general may be associated with bruxism and other movement disorders. Sertraline appears to be associated with microscopic colitis, a rare condition of unknown etiology. === Sexual === Like other SSRIs, sertraline is associated with sexual side effects, including sexual arousal disorder, erectile dysfunction and difficulty achieving orgasm. While nefazodone and bupropion do not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties versus 18% before the treatment. Sexual arousal disorder, defined as \"inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men\", occurred in 12% of people on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo. The mood improvement resulting from the treatment with sertraline sometimes counteracted these side effects, so that sexual desire and overall satisfaction with sex stayed the same as before the sertraline treatment. However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved. Some people continue experiencing sexual side effects after they stop taking SSRIs. === Suicide === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including sertraline, to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25 years. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 100% increase of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 50% increase in the 18–24 age group. Suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical trials are rare. For the above analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain statistically significant results. Considered separately, sertraline use in adults decreased the odds of suicidal behavior with a marginal statistical significance of 37% or 50% depending on the statistical technique used. The authors of the FDA analysis note that \"given the large number of comparisons made in this review, chance is a very plausible explanation for this difference\". The more complete data submitted later by the sertraline manufacturer Pfizer indicated increased suicidal behavior. Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK MHRA found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the patients on sertraline as compared to the ones on placebo. == Overdose == Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia and seizures. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of sertraline and norsertraline, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. As with most other SSRIs its toxicity in overdose is considered relatively low. == Interactions == As with other SSRIs, sertraline may increase the risk of bleeding with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid), antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements due to sertraline's inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation via blocking serotonin transporters on platelets. Sertraline, in particular, may potentially diminish the efficacy of levothyroxine. Sertraline is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2B6 in vitro. Accordingly, in human trials it caused increased blood levels of CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol, dextromethorphan, desipramine, imipramine and nortriptyline, as well as the CYP3A4/CYP2D6 substrate haloperidol. This effect is dose-dependent; for example, co-administration with 50 mg of sertraline resulted in 20% greater exposure to desipramine, while 150 mg of sertraline led to a 70% increase. In a placebo-controlled study, the concomitant administration of sertraline and methadone caused a 40% increase in blood levels of the latter, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2B6. Bupropion is metabolized by CYP2B6, which is inhibited by sertraline, and this may result in an interaction between sertraline and bupropion. Sertraline had a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of diazepam, tolbutamide, and warfarin, which are CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates; the clinical relevance of this effect was unclear. As expected from in vitro data, sertraline did not alter the human metabolism of the CYP3A4 substrates erythromycin, alprazolam, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and terfenadine; neither did it affect metabolism of the CYP1A2 substrate clozapine. Sertraline did not affect the actions of digoxin and atenolol, which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking sertraline with phenytoin or zolpidem may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking sertraline with lamotrigine may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation. CYP2C19 inhibitor esomeprazole increased sertraline concentrations in blood plasma by approximately 40%. Clinical reports indicate that interaction between sertraline and the MAOIs isocarboxazid and tranylcypromine may cause serotonin syndrome. In a placebo-controlled study in which sertraline was co-administered with lithium, 35% of the subjects experienced tremors, while none of those taking placebo did. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). By binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) it inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin and potentiates serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. Over time, this leads to a downregulation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance, and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases. It does not significantly affect histamine, acetylcholine, GABA or benzodiazepine receptors. Sertraline also shows relatively high activity as an inhibitor of the dopamine transporter (DAT) occupying ~20% of DAT receptors at doses 200mg and above, and antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor (but not the σ2 receptor). However, sertraline affinity for its main target (SERT) is much greater than its affinity for σ1 receptor and DAT. Although there could be a role for the σ1 receptor in the pharmacology of sertraline, the significance of this receptor in its actions is unclear. Similarly, the clinical relevance of sertraline's blockade of the dopamine transporter is uncertain. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Following a single oral dose of sertraline, mean peak blood levels of sertraline occur between 4.5 and 8.4 hours. Bioavailability is likely linear and dose-proportional over a dose range of 150 to 200 mg. Concomitant intake of sertraline with food slightly increases sertraline peak levels and total exposure. There is an approximate 2-fold accumulation of sertraline with continuous administration and steady-state levels are reached within one week. ==== Distribution ==== Sertraline is highly plasma protein bound (98.5%) across a concentration range of 20 to 500 ng/mL. Despite the high plasma protein binding, sertraline and its metabolite desmethylsertraline at respective tested concentrations of 300 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL were found not to interfere with the plasma protein binding of warfarin and propranolol, two other highly plasma protein-bound drugs. ==== Metabolism ==== Sertraline is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism, as indicated by a small study of radiolabeled sertraline in which less than 5% of plasma radioactivity was unchanged sertraline in two males. The principal metabolic pathway for sertraline is N-demethylation into desmethylsertraline (N-desmethylsertraline) mainly by CYP2B6. Reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation of both sertraline and desmethylsertraline also occur. Desmethylsertraline, while pharmacologically active, is substantially (50-fold) weaker than sertraline as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and its influence on the clinical effects of sertraline is thought to be negligible. Based on in vitro studies, sertraline is metabolized by multiple cytochrome 450 isoforms; however, it appears that in the human body CYP2C19 plays the most important role, followed by CYP2B6. In addition to the cytochrome P450 system, sertraline can be oxidatively deaminated in vitro by monoamine oxidases; however, this metabolic pathway has never been studied in vivo. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination half-life of sertraline is on average 26 hours, with a range of 13 to 45 hours. The elimination half-life of desmethylsertraline is 62 to 104 hours. In a small study of two males, sertraline was excreted to similar degrees in urine and feces (40 to 45% each within 9 days). Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in urine, whereas 12 to 14% of unchanged sertraline was present in feces. === Pharmacogenomics === CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 are thought to be the key cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of sertraline. Relative to CYP2C19 normal (extensive) metabolizers, poor metabolizers have 2.7-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.4-fold higher levels. In contrast, CYP2B6 poor metabolizers have 1.6-fold higher levels of sertraline and intermediate metabolizers have 1.2-fold higher levels. == History == The history of sertraline dates back to the early 1970s when Pfizer chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds, including lometraline, based on the structures of the neuroleptics thiothixene and pinoxepin. Further work on these compounds led to tametraline, a norepinephrine and weaker dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired stimulant effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist Kenneth Koe, after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated several potent norepinephrine and triple reuptake inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive cis-analogs was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared stereoisomers of this compound, which were tested in vivo by animal behavioral scientist Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not \"very goal driven\", and the invention of the sertraline molecule was serendipitous. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even \"did not have a formal project team\". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company. Sertraline was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991 based on the recommendation of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee; it had already become available in the United Kingdom the previous year. The FDA committee achieved a consensus that sertraline was safe and effective for the treatment of major depression. During the discussion, Paul Leber, the director of the FDA Division of Neuropharmacological Drug Products, noted that granting approval was a \"tough decision\", since the treatment effect on outpatients with depression had been \"modest to minimal\". Other experts emphasized that the drug's effect on inpatients had not differed from placebo and criticized the poor design of the clinical trials by Pfizer. For example, 40% of participants dropped out of the trials, significantly decreasing their validity. Until 2002, sertraline was only approved for use in adults ages 18 and over; that year, it was approved by the FDA for use in treating children aged 6 or older with severe OCD. In 2003, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued guidance that, apart from fluoxetine (Prozac), SSRIs are not suitable for the treatment of depression in patients under 18. However, sertraline can still be used in the UK for the treatment of OCD in children and adolescents. In 2005, the FDA added a boxed warning concerning pediatric suicidal behavior to all antidepressants, including sertraline. In 2007, labeling was again changed to add a warning regarding suicidal behavior in young adults ages 18 to 24. == Society and culture == === Generic availability === The US patent for Zoloft expired in 2006, and sertraline is available in generic form and is marketed under many brand names worldwide. === Brand names === In the US, Zoloft is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. === Interest during COVID-19 pandemic === Sertraline has been the most sought-after antidepressant worldwide before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Google Trends data. The pandemic has led to an increase in searches for antidepressants, with sertraline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine showing the highest search volumes, whereas searches of citalopram decreased during the pandemic. == Other uses == Sertraline may be useful to treat murine Zaire ebolavirus (murine EBOV). The World Health Organization (WHO) considers this a promising area of research. Lass-Flörl et al., 2003 finds it significantly inhibits phospholipase B in the fungal genus Candida, reducing virulence. Sertraline is also a very effective leishmanicide. Specifically, Palit & Ali 2008 find that sertraline kills almost all promastigotes of Leishmania donovani. Sertraline is strongly antibacterial against some species. It is also known to act as a photosensitizer of bacterial surfaces. In combination with antibacterials its photosensitization effect reverses antibacterial resistance. As such sertraline shows promise for food preservation. Lass-Flörl et al., 2003 finds this compound acts as a fungicide against Candida parapsilosis. Its anti-Cp effect is indeed due to its serotonergic activity and not its other effects. Sertraline is a promising trypanocide. It acts at several different life stages and against several strains. Sertraline's trypanocidal mechanism of action is by way of interference with bioenergetics. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == External links ==",

         " Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI) is a pressing public health concern. Although evidence suggests that Bifidobacterium adolescentis (B. adolescentis) can be used to treat liver disease, it is unclear if it can prevent AILI. In this report, we prove that B. adolescentis significantly attenuated AILI in mice, as demonstrated through biochemical analysis, histopathology, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Based on untargeted metabolomics and in vitro cultures, we found that B. adolescentis generates microbial metabolite hypaphorine. Functionally, hypaphorine inhibits the inflammatory response and hepatic oxidative stress to alleviate AILI in mice. Transcriptomic analysis indicates that Cry1 expression is increased in APAP-treated mice after hypaphorine treatment. Overexpression of Cry1 by its stabilizer KL001 effectively mitigates liver damage arising from oxidative stress in APAP-treated mice. Using the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database, we verified that Cry1 gene expression was also decreased in patients with APAP-induced acute liver failure. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that B. adolescentis inhibits APAP-induced liver injury by generating hypaphorine, which subsequently upregulates Cry1 to decrease inflammation and oxidative stress. Acetylcholinesterase (AChEis) inhibitors are used to treat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). l-Hypaphorine (l-HYP) is a natural indole alkaloid that has been shown to have effects on the central nervous system (CNS). The goal of this research was to synthesize l-HYP and d-HYP and test their anticholinesterasic properties in rat brain regions. l-HYP suppressed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity only in the cerebellum, whereas d-HYP inhibited AChE activity in all CNS regions studied. No cytotoxic effect on normal human cells (HaCaT) was observed in the case of l-HYP and d-HYP although an increase in cell proliferation. Molecular modeling studies revealed that d-HYP and l-HYP have significant differences in their binding mode positions and interact stereospecifically with AChE's amino acid residues. In metabolomic analysis of human milk amines, we found a previously unidentified compound. This was tentatively identified as hypaphorine, an indole alkaloid composed of tryptophan and three methyls, and with neurological and glucose-lowering effects in rodents. Hypaphorine identity was confirmed by hypaphorine synthesis, and then a fluorometric method was developed to quantify hypaphorine in milk and foods. Using dietary records, we identified peanut products as probable sources of hypaphorine. Milk from 24 lactating women showed widely varying hypaphorine, with a mean ± SD 0.34 ± 0.33 μM, and the highest concentration of 1.24 μM. Peanuts showed high hypaphorine of 70 μg/g compared to 60 and 100 μg/g in dried chickpeas and lentils. Dietary challenge in lactating women with hypaphorine-rich foods demonstrated transfer of hypaphorine into milk with hypaphorine appearance peaking 5-18 h after consumption and prolonged disappearance indicative of slow excretion or metabolism. The potential functional roles of hypaphorine in human nutrition remain to be addressed.",

         " Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe and chronic neurodegenerative disorder of the brain. The laboratory diagnosis is limited to the analysis of three biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): amyloid-β42 (Aβ42), total tau, and phospho-tau-181 (P-tau-181). However, there is a need to find more biomarkers in CSF that can improve the sensitivity and specificity. The aim of the present study was to analyze endogenous small metabolites (metabolome) in the CSF, which may provide potentially new insights into biochemical processes involved in AD. One hundred CSF samples were dichotomized by normal (n = 50) and pathological decreased Aβ42 and increased tau and P-tau-181 levels (n = 50; correlating to an AD-like pathology). These CSF samples were analyzed using the AbsoluteIDQ® p180 Kit (BIOCRATES Life Sciences), which included 40 acylcarnitines, 21 amino acids, 19 biogenic amines, 15 sphingolipids, and 90 glycerophospholipids. Our data show that two sphingomyelins (SM (d18:1/18:0) and SM (d18:1/18:1)), 5 glycerophospholipids (PC aa C32:0, PC aa C34:1, PC aa C36:1, PC aa C38:4 and PC aa C38:6), and 1 acylcarnitine (C3-DC-M/C5-OH) were significantly altered in the CSF with pathological \"AD-like pathology\". Sphingomyelin SM (d18:1/18:0) proved to be a specific (76%) and sensitive (66%) biomarker with a defined cut-off of 546 nM. Correct diagnoses for 21 out of 32 unknown samples could be achieved using this SM (d18:1/18:0) cut-off value. In conclusion, the sphingolipid SM (d18:1/18:0) is significantly increased in CSF of patients displaying pathological levels of Aβ42, tau, and P-tau-181.",

The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors: EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4) (2). HER1, HER3, and HER4 comprise three major functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. No ligand has been clearly identified for HER2; however, HER2 can be activated as a result of ligand binding to other HER receptors with the formation of receptor homodimers and/or heterodimers (3). HER1 and HER2 are overexpressed on many solid tumor cells, such as breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (4-6). The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with a poor prognosis because high levels are related to increased proliferation (7-10). Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a growth factor composed of 53 amino acids (6.2 kDa), and it is secreted by ectodermic cells, monocytes, kidneys, and duodenal glands (1). EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF and at least seven other growth factors and their transmembrane receptor kinases play important roles in cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors: EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4) (2).

The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with a poor prognosis because high levels are related to increased proliferation (7-10). Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) are known to play a role in the neoplastic transformation of cells (1). The EGFR is a tyrosine kinase receptor family that includes four members, EGFR and three other human EGF receptors (HERs) designated as HER2/ErbB2, HER3/ErbB3, and HER4/ErbB4. The four receptors constitute the HER-kinase axis and regulate cellular responses through complex receptor–ligand interactions. The various signal transduction pathways that respond to EGFR activation and mediate cell responses have been described by Brandt et al. (2). The various EGFRs are known to be amplified, mutated, or overexpressed in several cancers and are a target for the development of pharmaceutical agents that inhibit either the receptor or the signal transduction pathway (3). It has also been reported that the detection of circulating ErbB2-positive tumor cells indicates a poor prognosis for the cancer patient (4). A variety of inhibitors, including small molecules, antibodies, vaccines, and gene therapies, have been developed and tested against the EGFRs for the treatment of cancer (5, 6). However, to achieve therapeutic effects the receptor or signal transduction pathway must be involved in maintenance of the malignant phenotype because HER inhibitor therapy does not necessarily result in treatment of a cancer (7). The use of antibodies alone against EGFR (e.g., cetuximab) and ErbB2 (e.g., trastuzumab) for the treatment of cancer has yielded only moderate results, and it has been observed that antibodies are most useful when used in combination with chemotherapy (8). In some cases cardiotoxicity has been reported in individuals treated with trastuzumab in combination with some chemotherapeutic agents (9). In an effort to develop better and safer anti-cancer drugs, investigators have attempted to use peptides that bind to receptors on tumors to treat the disease (10, 11). The development of peptide pharmaceuticals has also been pursued because, compared to the larger biomolecules such as antibodies, these molecules are easier to synthesize and have low immunogenicity, rapid blood clearance, and a higher uptake in tumor tissue (12). Using bacteriophage technology, a peptide of six amino acids, lys-cys-cys-tyr-ser-leu (KCCYSL), that specifically recognizes and binds the extracellular domain of ErbB2 was identified, and the investigators hypothesized that the peptide could be developed into an imaging and therapeutic agent against cancer cells that overexpress ErbB2 (13). As an extension to the earlier study, the tumor imaging and targeting ability of KCCYSL was evaluated after labeling with radioactive indium (",

         "Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication used to treat and prevent a number of types of cardiac dysrhythmias. This includes ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and wide complex tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Evidence in cardiac arrest, however, is poor. It can be given by mouth, intravenously, or intraosseously. When used by mouth, it can take a few weeks for effects to begin. Common side effects include feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation. As amiodarone can have serious side effects, it is mainly recommended only for significant ventricular arrhythmias. Serious side effects include lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death. If taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding it can cause problems in the fetus or the infant. It is a class III antiarrhythmic medication. It works partly by increasing the time before a heart cell can contract again. Amiodarone was first made in 1961 and came into medical use in 1962 for chest pain believed to be related to the heart. It was pulled from the market in 1967 due to side effects. In 1974 it was found to be useful for arrhythmias and reintroduced. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 237th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amiodarone has been used both in the treatment of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the long-term suppression of arrhythmias. Amiodarone is commonly used to treat different types of abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial arrhythmias (supraventricular arrhythmias) and ventricular arrhythmias. Atrial arrhythmias and supraventricular arrhythmias are terms often used interchangeably to refer to abnormal heart rhythms originating from the upper chambers of the heart, known as the atria. These types of arrhythmias include conditions such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. They are collectively referred to as supraventricular or atrial arrhythmias because they occur above (supra) the ventricles in the electrical conduction system of the heart. Ventricular arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that originate in the ventricles, which are the lower chambers of the heart. These arrhythmias can be potentially life-threatening and may disrupt the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Amiodarone can be effective in treating conditions like ventricular fibrillation (a rapid and irregular heartbeat), ventricular tachycardia (fast heartbeat originating from the lower chambers), and cardiac arrest due to shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation. In cases where a patient is experiencing shock-resistant ventricular arrhythmias including stable ventricular tachycardia or unstable ventricular fibrillation, amiodarone may be used. A recent study suggested that another antiarrhythmic, procainamide, may be more effective in stopping ventricular tachycardia – with less side effects and a higher survival rate in patients requiring multiple shocks. However, due to a small sample size and lack of statistical significance, more evidence is required, and amiodarone remains the drug of choice in ventricular arrhythmias. Amiodarone is also commonly used as the first-line therapy for patients who receive shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators caused by ventricular arrhythmias. Combining amiodarone with beta-blockers has been shown to reduce the likelihood of experiencing inappropriate shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators. === Cardiac arrest === Defibrillation is the treatment of choice for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia resulting in cardiac arrest. While amiodarone has been used in shock-refractory cases, evidence of benefit is poor. Although amiodarone does not appear to improve survival in those who had a cardiac arrest in-hospital, some studies suggested that early administration of amiodarone was associated with better survival and positive outcomes for people who had a cardiac arrest out-of-hospital. === Ventricular tachycardia === Amiodarone may be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in certain instances. Individuals with hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia should not initially receive amiodarone. These individuals should be cardioverted. Amiodarone can be used in individuals with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia. In these cases, amiodarone can be used regardless of the individual's underlying heart function and the type of ventricular tachycardia; it can be used in individuals with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, but is contraindicated in individuals with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia as it is associated with a prolonged QT interval which will be made worse with anti-arrhythmic drugs. === Atrial fibrillation === Individuals who have undergone open heart surgery are at an increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (or AF) in the first few days post-procedure. In the ARCH trial, intravenous amiodarone (2 g administered over 2 d) has been shown to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery when compared to placebo. However, clinical studies have failed to demonstrate long-term efficacy and have shown potentially fatal side effects such as pulmonary toxicities. While amiodarone is not approved for AF by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it is a commonly prescribed off-label treatment due to the lack of equally effective treatment alternatives. So-called 'acute onset atrial fibrillation', defined by the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) in 2003, responds well to short-duration treatment with amiodarone. This has been demonstrated in seventeen randomized controlled trials, of which five included a placebo arm. The incidence of severe side effects in this group is low. Amiodarone is an effective, antiarrhythmic-of-choice in achieving cardioversion to sinus rhythm in critical care populations with new onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF). However, other anti-arrhythmic agents may exert superior rhythm control, rate control and lower mortality rate which may be more favourable than amiodarone in specific cases. == Contraindications == Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant are strongly advised not to take amiodarone. Since amiodarone can be expressed in breast milk, women taking the drug are advised to stop nursing. It is contraindicated in individuals with sinus nodal bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and second or third-degree heart block who do not have an artificial pacemaker. Individuals with baseline depressed lung function should be monitored closely if amiodarone therapy is to be initiated. Formulations of amiodarone that contain benzyl alcohol should not be given to neonates, because the benzyl alcohol may cause the potentially fatal \"gasping syndrome\". Amiodarone can worsen the cardiac arrhythmia brought on by digitalis toxicity. Contraindications of amiodarone also include: hypersensitivity to amiodarone or any of its components; severe hepatic impairment; sinus node dysfunction, including severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block, since amiodarone can cause significant bradycardia and sinus nodal arrest; second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, due to its negative chronotropic (affecting the heart rate) and dromotropic (affecting the conductivity) effects on the AV conduction system, unless a pacemaker is implanted; thyrotoxicosis that cannot be controlled by conventional means, such as Graves' disease. There are no specific guidelines for endurance or high-intensity exercise while taking amiodarone. However, since amiodarone may cause bradycardia and QTc prolongation which can affect exercise capacity and increase the risk of arrhythmias during intense exercise, it would generally be advisable for patients taking this medication to consult their healthcare provider before engaging in high-intensity physical activities such as strenuous endurance exercises. == Side effects == At oral doses of 400 mg per day or higher, amiodarone can have serious, varied side effects, including toxicity to the thyroid gland, liver, lung, and retinal functions, requiring clinical surveillance and regular laboratory testing. Allergic reactions to amiodarone may occur. Most individuals administered amiodarone on a chronic basis will experience at least one side effect. In some people, daily use of amiodarone at 100 mg oral doses can be effective for arrhythmia control with no or minimal side effects. Some common side effects include: nausea and vomiting; taste disturbances (changes in taste perception, often described as a metallic or bitter taste in the mouth); photosensitivity of the skin, also known as photodermatitis, where exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation may lead to skin reactions such as rashes or sunburn-like symptoms; corneal microdeposits (deposits may accumulate on the cornea over time, resulting in blurred vision or visual halos—bright circles or rings around a light source, such as headlights; still, these corneal deposits typically do not affect vision significantly); thyroid dysfunction (in approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis; the drug can lead to both hypo- and hyperthyroidism); pulmonary toxicity (lung problems such as pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease may occur rarely but have the potential for serious consequences if left untreated); liver abnormalities (liver damage, including elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) and hepatotoxicity, although severe cases are rare); bradycardia and heart block (since it slows down heart rate by affecting the sinus node function and AV conduction system, it can increase the risk of heart block); QT Interval prolongation. Amiodarone can potentially cause renal toxicity, but solid studies on whether amiodarone may be toxic to the kidneys are lacking. === Lung === Side effects of oral amiodarone at doses of 400 mg or higher include various pulmonary effects. The most serious reaction is interstitial lung disease. Risk factors include high cumulative dose, more than 400 milligrams per day, duration over two months, increased age, and preexisting pulmonary disease. Some individuals were noted to develop pulmonary fibrosis after a week of treatment, while others did not develop it after years of continuous use. Common practice is to avoid the agent if possible in individuals with decreased lung function. The most specific test of pulmonary toxicity due to amiodarone is a dramatically decreased DLCO noted on pulmonary function testing. === Thyroid === Induced abnormalities in thyroid function are common. In approximately 15-20% of patients, amiodarone treatment results in thyroid dysfunction, either amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Both under- and overactivity of the thyroid may occur. Amiodarone is structurally similar to thyroxine and also contains iodine. Both of these factors contribute to the effects of amiodarone on thyroid function. Amiodarone also causes an anti-thyroid action, via Plummer and Wolff–Chaikoff effects, due its large amount of iodine in its molecule, which causes a particular \"cardiac hypothyroidism\" with bradycardia and arrhythmia. Thyroid function should be checked at least every six months. Hypothyroidism (slowing of the thyroid) occurs frequently; in the SAFE trial, which compared amiodarone with other medications for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, biochemical hypothyroidism (as defined by a TSH level of 4.5–10 mU/L) occurred in 25.8% of the amiodarone-treated group as opposed to 6.6% of the control group (taking placebo or sotalol). Overt hypothyroidism (defined as TSH >10 mU/L) occurred at 5.0% compared to 0.3%; most of these (>90%) were detected within the first six months of amiodarone treatment. Amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), can be caused due to the high iodine content in the drug via the Jod-Basedow effect. This is known as Type 1 AIT, and usually occurs in patients with an underlying predisposition to hyperthyroidism such as Graves' disease, within weeks to months after starting amiodarone. Type 1 AIT is usually treated with anti-thyroid drugs or thyroidectomy. Type 2 AIT is caused by a destructive thyroiditis due to a direct toxic effect of amiodarone on thyroid follicular epithelial cells. Type 2 AIT can occur even years after starting amiodarone, is usually self-limited and responds to anti-inflammatory treatment such as corticosteroids. In practice, often the type of AIT is undetermined or presumed as mixed with both treatments combined. Thyroid uptake measurements (I-123 or I-131), which are used to differentiate causes of hyperthyroidism, are generally unreliable in patients who have been taking amiodarone. Because of the high iodine content of amiodarone, the thyroid gland is effectively saturated, thus preventing further uptake of isotopes of iodine. However, positive radioactive iodine can be used to rule in type 1AIT . === Eye === Corneal micro-deposits (cornea verticillata, also called vortex or whorl keratopathy) are almost universally present (over 90%) in individuals taking amiodarone longer than 6 months, especially doses greater than 400 mg/day. These deposits typically do not cause any symptoms. About 1 in 10 individuals may complain of a bluish halo. Anterior subcapsular lens deposits are relatively common (50%) in higher doses (greater than 600 mg/day) after 6 months of treatment. Optic neuropathy, nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (N-AION), occurs in 1–2% of people and is not dosage dependent. Bilateral optic disc swelling and mild and reversible visual field defects can also occur. Loss of eyelashes has been linked to amiodarone use. === Liver === Abnormal liver enzyme results are common in people taking amiodarone. Much rarer are jaundice, hepatomegaly (liver enlargement), and hepatitis (inflammation of the liver). In clinical observations, it has been noted that the administration of amiodarone, even at lower therapeutic doses, has been associated with the development of a condition mimicking alcoholic cirrhosis. This condition, often referred to as pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis, presents with similar histopathological features to those observed in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. However, this extreme adverse event manifestation—pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis caused by low dose amiodarone—is very rare. === Skin === Long-term administration of amiodarone (usually more than eighteen months) is associated with a light-sensitive blue-grey discoloration of the skin, sometimes called ceruloderma; such patients should avoid exposure to the sun and use sunscreen that protects against ultraviolet-A and -B. The discoloration will slowly improve upon cessation of the medication, however, the skin color may not return completely. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Use during pregnancy may result in a number of problems in the infant including thyroid problems, heart problems, neurological problems, and preterm birth. Use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended though one dose may be okay. === Other === Long-term use of amiodarone has been associated with peripheral neuropathies. Amiodarone is sometimes responsible for epididymitis. Amiodarone accumulates in the head of the organ and can cause unilateral or bilateral inflammation. It tends to resolve if amiodarone is stopped. Some cases of gynecomastia have been reported in men on amiodarone. A retrospective cohort study found an increased risk of digestive, liver, head and neck and liver cancers amongst male patients exposed to amiodarone versus female participants in the same study and the general population. This study also identified that the Standardized Incidence Ratio of cancer occurrence increased significantly in males aged 20-59 and >80 years old who were exposed to a higher dose of Amiodarone in comparison to those exposed to a lower dose. This suggests that there is a dose-effect relationship. These results should be interpreted with caution due to limitations of the study design and care should be taken prior to altering current clinical and prescribing practices. Amiodarone and its effect on cancer is still a topic that requires more robust research. == Drug-drug interactions == The pharmacokinetics of numerous drugs, including many that are commonly administered to individuals with heart disease, are affected by amiodarone. Amiodarone has particularly important interactions with the following drugs: class I antiarrhythmics (amiodarone should not be combined with other class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as disopyramide, flecainide, procainamide, quinidine, etc., due to an increased risk of QTc prolongation and potential arrhythmias); beta blockers and calcium channel blockers (combining amiodarone with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, such as sotalol, can further slow down heart rate and cause bradycardia or heart block); digoxin (amiodarone inhibits a protein called P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which transports digoxin out of cells in the gut, liver, and kidneys, therefore, concurrent use of these medications increases digoxin levels in the body, potentially leading to digoxin toxicity); statins (amiodarone can inhibit enzymes in the liver responsible for metabolizing certain statins, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, etc., therefore interaction elevates plasma concentrations of these statins, increasing the risk of myopathy, that is muscle damage, or rhabdomyolysis, that is severe muscle breakdown); warfarin (since the anticoagulation effects of warfarin depend on metabolism of warfarin by both cytochromes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, coadministation leads to rise in international normalized ratio (INR)—the amount of time taken for the blood to form a clot—placing patient at higher bleeding risks); Amiodarone potentiates the action of warfarin by inhibiting the clearance of both (S) and (R) warfarin. Individuals taking both of these medications should have their warfarin doses adjusted based on their dosing of amiodarone and have their anticoagulation status (measured as prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR)) measured more frequently. Dose reduction of warfarin is as follows: 40% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 400 mg daily, 35% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 300 mg daily, 30% reduction if the amiodarone dose is 200 mg daily, and 25% reduction if amiodarone dose is 100 mg daily. The effect of amiodarone on the warfarin concentrations can be as early as a few days after initiation of treatment; however, the interaction may not peak for up to seven weeks; anti-HIV medications (several HIV medications, such as ritonavir, indinavir, etc., interact with amiodarone by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzyme hence leading to decreased clearance of amiodarone, i.e., increasing the concentration of amiodarone in the organism). Amiodarone inhibits the action of the cytochrome P450 isozyme family; such inhibition reduces the clearance of many drugs, including the following: ciclosporin, digoxin, flecainide, procainamide, quinidine, sildenafil, simvastatin, theophylline, warfarin. In 2015, Gilead Sciences warned healthcare providers about people who began taking the hepatitis C drugs ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir along with amiodarone, who developed abnormally slow heartbeats or died of cardiac arrest. == Metabolism == Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, therefore, amiodarone and can affect the metabolism of numerous other drugs that depend on cytochrome P450, such as digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, etc. The major metabolite of amiodarone is desethylamiodarone (DEA), which also has antiarrhythmic properties. The metabolism of amiodarone is inhibited by grapefruit, leading to elevated serum levels of amiodarone. On 8 August 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning of the risk of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure or death, when simvastatin is used with amiodarone. This interaction is dose-dependent with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg. This drug combination, especially with higher doses of simvastatin, should be avoided. Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The primary metabolic pathway of amiodarone is by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. The metabolism of amiodaron can be characterized by two phases: phase I metabolism, when amiodarone undergoes oxidative processes mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8; these reactions result in the formation of several active metabolites, including desethylamiodarone (DEA) and di-desethylamiodarone (DDEA); DEA is the most abundant metabolite and exhibits similar pharmacological effects as amiodarone; phase II metabolism, when both amiodarone and its major metabolite DEA can undergo conjugation reactions with glucuronic acid; this process increases water solubility of these compounds for their efficient elimination from the body. Amiodarone has an exceptionally long half-life due to a combination of several factors: high lipid solubility, given that amiodarone has high lipid solubility, which allows it to distribute throughout various tissues in the body rapidly; the extensive tissue distribution of amiodarone contributes to a large volume of distribution that leads to slow clearance from plasma compartments; extensive tissue binding, so that amiodarone extensively binds to different tissues, including fat deposits, muscles, heart tissue, and other organs; this binding creates reservoirs where drug release can occur slowly over time, resulting in an extended duration of action even after stopping the therapy; enterohepatic recycling, meaning that amiodarone undergoes enterohepatic recycling, where it is reabsorbed from the intestines after being excreted into bile, which contributes to its prolonged presence. === Excretion === Excretion is primarily via the liver and the bile duct with almost no elimination via the kidney and it is not dialyzable. Elimination half-life average of 58 days (ranging from 25 to 100 days [Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st edition]) for amiodarone and 36 days for the active metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA). There is 10-50% transfer of amiodarone and DEA in the placenta as well as a presence in breast milk. Accumulation of amiodarone and DEA occurs in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs (i.e. liver, lungs), therefore, if an individual was taking amiodarone on a chronic basis if it is stopped it will remain in the system for weeks to months. Whereas amiodarone is primarily eliminated from the body through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, a very small portion of amiodarone and its metabolites are excreted unchanged in urine or feces. The liver plays a significant role in the elimination of amiodarone. After being extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, amiodarone is transported into bile via multidrug-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) transporter. Bile containing amiodarone and its metabolites is then released into the gastrointestinal tract. Some of these compounds can be reabsorbed back into systemic circulation through enterohepatic recirculation, where they may undergo additional rounds of metabolism before eventually being excreted again into bile. Because renal excretion contributes only minimally to the elimination of amiodarone, dose adjustment based on kidney function is generally not necessary. This is because most patients with normal renal function can adequately clear the drug through hepatic metabolism and biliary elimination pathways. == Pharmacology == Amiodarone is categorized as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, and prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, the repolarization phase where there is normally decreased calcium permeability and increased potassium permeability. It has numerous other effects, however, including actions that are similar to those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV. Amiodarone is a blocker of voltage gated potassium (KCNH2) and voltage gated calcium channels (CACNA2D2). Amiodarone slows the conduction rate and prolongs the refractory period of the SA and AV nodes. It also prolongs the refractory periods of the ventricles, bundles of His, and the Purkinje fibers without exhibiting any effects on the conduction rate. Amiodarone has been shown to prolong the myocardial cell action potential duration and refractory period and is a non-competitive β-adrenergic inhibitor. It also shows beta blocker-like and calcium channel blocker-like actions on the SA and AV nodes, increases the refractory period via sodium- and potassium-channel effects, and slows intra-cardiac conduction of the cardiac action potential, via sodium-channel effects. It is suggested that amiodarone may also exacerbate the phenotype associated with Long QT-3 syndrome causing mutations such as ∆KPQ. This effect is due to a combination of blocking the peak sodium current, but also contributing to an increased persistent sodium current. Amiodarone chemically resembles thyroxine (thyroid hormone), and its binding to the nuclear thyroid receptor might contribute to some of its pharmacologic and toxic actions. The mechanisms of action of amiodarone include blocking potassium ion channels (prolonging repolarization), blocking sodium ion channels, and antagonizing alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. The action of amiodarone can be characterized by the following effects: potassium channel blockade, since amiodarone blocks potassium channels involved in cardiac repolarization during phase 3 of the action potential, so that this blockade prolongs the duration of cardiac action potentials, resulting in an increased refractory period and decreased excitability; sodium channel blockade, characterized by inhibiting sodium ion influx through voltage-gated sodium channels, so that amiodarone reduces the conduction velocity of electrical impulses in cardiac tissue that leads to a slowed heart rate and improved rhythm control; calcium channel blockade, by inhibiting L-type calcium channels in myocardial cells, decreasing intracellular calcium concentration during ventricular contraction; noncompetitive adrenergic receptor antagonism, meaning that amiodarone has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonistic effects, which help reduce sympathetic stimulation on the heart. == History == The original observation that amiodarone's progenitor molecule, khellin, had cardioactive properties, was made by the Russian physiologist Gleb von Anrep while working in Cairo in 1946. Khellin is obtained from a plant extract of Khella or Ammi visnaga, a common plant in north Africa. Anrep noticed that one of his technicians had been cured of anginal symptoms after taking khellin, then used for various, non-cardiac ailments. This led to efforts by European pharmaceutical industries to isolate an active compound. Amiodarone was initially developed in 1961 at the Labaz company, Belgium, by chemists Tondeur and Binon, who were working on preparations derived from khellin. It became popular in Europe as a treatment for angina pectoris. As a doctoral candidate at Oxford University, Bramah Singh determined that amiodarone and sotalol had antiarrhythmic properties and belonged to a new class of antiarrhythmic agents (what would become the class III antiarrhythmic agents). Today the mechanisms of action of amiodarone and sotalol have been investigated in more detail. Both drugs have been demonstrated to prolong the duration of the action potential, prolonging the refractory period, by interacting among other cellular functions with K+ channels. Based on Singh's work, the Argentinian physician Mauricio Rosenbaum began using amiodarone to treat his patients who have supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, with impressive results. Based on papers written by Rosenbaum developing Singh's theories, physicians in the United States began prescribing amiodarone to their patients with potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in the late 1970s. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was reluctant to officially approve the use of amiodarone since initial reports had shown an increased incidence of serious pulmonary side effects of the drug. In the mid-1980s, the European pharmaceutical companies began putting pressure on the FDA to approve amiodarone by threatening to cut the supply to American physicians if it was not approved. In December 1985, amiodarone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of arrhythmias. === Name === Amiodarone may be an acronym for its IUPAC name (2-butyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-[4-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]-3,5-diiodophenyl]methanone, where ar is a placeholder for phenyl. This is partially supported by dronedarone which is noniodinated benzofuran derivative of amiodarone, where the arylmethanone is conserved. == Dosing == Amiodarone is available in oral and intravenous formulations. Orally, it is available under the brand names Pacerone (produced by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc.) and Cordarone (produced by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories). It is also available under the brand name Aratac (produced by Alphapharm Pty Ltd) in Australia and New Zealand, and further in Australia under the brands Cardinorm and Rithmik as well as a number of generic brands. Also Arycor in South Africa (Produced by Winthrop Pharmaceuticals.). In South America, it is known as Atlansil and is produced by Roemmers. In India, amiodarone is marketed (produced by Cipla Pharmaceutical) under the brand name Tachyra. It is also available in intravenous ampules and vials. The dose of amiodarone administered is tailored to the individual and the dysrhythmia that is being treated. When administered orally, the bioavailability of amiodarone is quite variable. Absorption ranges from 22 to 95%, with better absorption when it is given with food. == References ==",

It binds to NT receptors (NTRs) with high affinity and is implicated in the regulation of luteinizing hormone and prolactin release, and it has significant interaction with the dopaminergic system. There are three NTR subtypes, namely NTR1, NTR2, and NTR3. Most of the NT actions are mediated by NTR1, which is a G-protein–coupled receptor. The functions of NTR2 and NTR3 are not well known. The findings of NTR1 overexpression in various human tumors (2, 3), such as breast, lung, colon, pituitary, and pancreatic cancers, provide opportunities for tumor imaging by designing specific molecular imaging agents to target the NTR1.

         "Prochlorperazine, formerly sold under the brand name Compazine among others, is a medication used to treat nausea, migraines, schizophrenia, psychosis and anxiety. It is a less preferred medication for anxiety. It may be taken by mouth, rectally, injection into a vein, or injection into a muscle. Common side effects include sleepiness, blurry vision, low blood pressure, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include movement disorders including tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally not recommended. It is a typical antipsychotic which is believed to work by reducing the action of dopamine in the brain. Prochlorperazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1956. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 355th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Vomiting === Prochlorperazine is used to prevent vomiting caused by chemotherapy, radiation therapy and in the pre- and postoperative setting. A 2015 Cochrane review found no differences in efficacy among drugs commonly used for this purpose in emergency rooms. === Migraine === Prochlorperazine, generally by intravenous, is used to treat migraine. Such use is recommended by The American Headache Society. A 2019 systematic review found prochlorperazine was nearly three times as likely as metoclopramide to relieve headache within 60 minutes of administration. === Labyrinthitis === In the UK prochlorperazine maleate has been used for labyrinthitis, which includes nausea and vertigo. == Side effects == Sedation is very common, and extrapyramidal side effects are common and include restlessness, dystonic reactions, pseudoparkinsonism, and akathisia; the extrapyramidal symptoms can affect 2% of people at low doses, whereas higher doses may affect as many as 40% of people. Prochlorperazine can also cause a life-threatening condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Some symptoms of NMS include high fever, stiff muscles, neck muscle spasms, confusion, irregular pulse or blood pressure, fast heart rate (tachycardia), sweating, and abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Research from the Veterans Administration and the United States Food and Drug Administration show injection site reactions. Adverse effects are similar in children. === Warning === The FDA-approved label for prochlorperazine includes a warning for increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Pharmacology == Prochlorperazine is thought to exert its antipsychotic effects by blocking dopamine receptors. Prochlorperazine is analogous to chlorpromazine; both of these agents antagonize dopaminergic D2 receptors in various pathways of the central nervous system. This D2 blockade results in antipsychotic, antiemetic and other effects. Hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of dopamine antagonists as blockade of D2 receptors within the tuberoinfundibular pathway results in increased plasma levels of prolactin due to increased secretion by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary. Following intramuscular injection, the antiemetic action is evident within 5 to 10 minutes and lasts for three to four hours. Rapid action is also noted after buccal treatment. With oral dosing, the start of action is delayed but the duration is somewhat longer (approximately six hours). == Society and culture == In the United Kingdom, prochlorperazine is available for the treatment of nausea caused by migraine as a tablet dissolved in the mouth, and in Australia as a tablet swallowed whole. In the UK, it is available via a prescription and as a pharmacy medicine, meaning it does not require a prescription but is only available after talking with a pharmacist. === Marketing === Prochlorperazine is available as tablets, suppositories, and in an injectable form. As of September 2017 it was marketed under the trade names Ametil, Antinaus, Buccastem, Bukatel, Chlormeprazine, Chloropernazine, Compazine, Compro, Daolin, Dhaperazine, Emedrotec, Emetiral, Eminorm, Lotamin, Mitil, Mormal, Nautisol, Novamin, Novomit, Proazine, Procalm, Prochlorperazin, Prochlorperazine, Prochlorpérazine, Prochlorperazinum, Prochlozine, Proclorperazina, Promat, Promin, Promtil, Roumin, Scripto-metic, Seratil, Stemetil, Steremal, Vergon, Vestil, and Volimin. It was also marketed at that time as a combination drug for humans with paracetamol as Vestil-A, as a combination drug for veterinary use, with isopropamide as Darbazine. == Research == Alexza Pharmaceuticals studied an inhaled form of prochlorperazine for the treatment of migraine through Phase II trials under the development name AT-001; development was discontinued in 2011. == Synthesis == The alkylation of 2-chlorophenothiazine (1) and 1-(3-Chloropropyl)-4-methylpiperazine [104-16-5] (2) in the presence of sodamide gives Prochlorperazine (3); or by alkylation of 2-Chloro-10-(3-chloropropyl)phenothiazine [2765-59-5] (4) and 1-methylpiperazine (5). == References == == External links == \"Prochlorperazine\".

         " Hospital wastewater (HWW) effluents represent an important source of contaminants such as pharmaceutical compounds and their human metabolites. To better evaluate dedicated treatment of hospital effluents for pollutant mitigation, not only the parent compounds should be considered but also the intermediates generated during treatment. The metabolite metoprolol acid (MTPA) has been found in urban wastewaters at higher concentration than its parent compound metoprolol (MTP), being more recalcitrant to biodegradation. The aim of this study was to investigate degradation, transformation and sorption of the β-blocker MTP, and its recalcitrant metabolite MTPA, during water treatment based on the fungi Ganoderma lucidum, Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus. Fourteen intermediates were identified in MTP biotransformation while five of them also attributed to MTPA biodegradation and two to MTPA only. Their identification allowed their correlation in separate biotransformation pathways suggested. The highest degradation rate of metoprolol (up to 51%) and metoprolol acid (almost 77%) was found after 15-days treatment with Ganoderma lucidum, with an increase in toxicity up to 29% and 4%, respectively. This fungus was further selected for treating real HWW in a batch fluidized bed bioreactor (FBB). Treated wastewater and fungal biomass samples were used to evaluate the distribution of the target compounds and the intermediates identified between solid and liquid phases. While similar elimination capabilities were observed for the removal of metoprolol, and even higher for its persistent metabolite metoprolol acid, the extent on compound transformation diminished considerably compared with the study treating purified water: a high level of the persistent α-HMTP and TP240 were still present in effluent samples (15% and 6%, respectively), being both TPs present at high proportion (up to 28%) in fungal biomass. This is the first time that pharmaceutical TPs have been investigated in the fungal biomass. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of salvianolic acid B (SalB) isolated from Radix Salvia miltiorrhizae on the oral pharmacokinetics of metoprolol (MET) and metoprolol acid (META) in rats. The pharmacokinetic parameters of MET and META were measured after oral (15 mg/kg) administration of MET in rats in the presence and absence of SalB. Compared to the control given MET alone, with the concurrent administration of SalB (50 mg/kg), the AUC and C(max) of MET increased by 51.7% and 27.7%, and the AUC and C(max) of META decreased by 26.5% and 19.6%, respectively. With the presence of SalB, the metabolic ratio was markedly decreased by 50.8%. However, no significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters of SalB when it was combined with MET. A method for enantiomeric separation of the three β-blocking agents atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and the zwitterionic metoprolol acid, a major metabolite of both metoprolol and in environmental matrices also atenolol, has been developed. By use of supercritical fluid chromatography and the polysaccharide-based Chiralpak(®) IB-3, all four compounds were simultaneously enantiomerically separated (Rs>1.5) within 8min. Detection was performed using tandem mass spectrometry, and to avoid isobaric interference between the co-eluting metoprolol and metoprolol acid, the achiral column Acquity(®) UPC(2) BEH 2-EP was attached ahead of to the chiral column. Carbon dioxide with 18% methanol containing 0.5% (v/v) of the additives trifluoroacetic acid and ammonia in a 2:1 molar ratio were used as mobile phase. A post column make-up flow (0.3mL/min) of methanol containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid was used to enhance the positive electrospray ionization. Detection was carried out using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the selected reaction monitoring mode, using one transition per analyte and internal standard. The method was successfully applied for monitoring the enantiomeric fraction change over time in a laboratory scale wetland degradation study. It showed good precision, recovery, sensitivity and low effect of the sample matrix.",

         "Citalopram, sold under the brand name Celexa among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. The antidepressant effects may take one to four weeks to occur. It is typically taken orally (swallowed by mouth). In some European countries, it is sometimes given intravenously (injected into a vein) to initiate treatment, before switching to the oral route of administration for continuation of treatment. It has also been used intravenously in other parts of the world in some other circumstances. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, sexual problems, shakiness, feeling tired, and sweating. Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, glaucoma, and QT prolongation. It should not be used in persons who take or have recently taken an MAO inhibitor. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Citalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Depression === In the United States, citalopram is approved to treat major depressive disorder. Citalopram appears to have comparable efficacy and superior tolerability relative to other antidepressants. In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ranking of ten antidepressants for efficacy and cost-effectiveness, citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. Evidence for the effectiveness of citalopram for treating depression in children is uncertain. === Panic disorder === Citalopram is licensed in the UK and other European countries for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. === Other === Citalopram may be used off-label to treat anxiety, and dysthymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. It appears to be as effective as fluvoxamine and paroxetine in obsessive–compulsive disorder. Some data suggest the effectiveness of intravenous infusion of citalopram in resistant OCD. Citalopram is well tolerated and as effective as moclobemide in social anxiety disorder. There are studies suggesting that citalopram can be useful in reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior. It appears to be superior to placebo for behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. It has also been used successfully for hypersexuality in early Alzheimer's disease. A meta-analysis, including studies with fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram versus placebo, showed SSRIs to be effective in reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase. For alcoholism, citalopram has produced a modest reduction alcohol intake and increase in drink-free days in studies of alcoholics, possibly by decreasing desire or reducing the reward. While on its own citalopram is less effective than amitriptyline in the prevention of migraines, in refractory cases, combination therapy may be more effective. Citalopram and other SSRIs can be used to treat hot flashes.: 107 A 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in autistic children from citalopram, raising doubts about whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in children with autism. Some research suggests citalopram interacts with cannabinoid protein-couplings in the rat brain, and this is put forward as a potential cause of some of the drug's antidepressant effects. == Administration == Citalopram is typically taken in one dose, either in the morning or evening. It can be taken with or without food. Its absorption does not increase when taken with food, but doing so can help prevent nausea. Nausea is often caused when the 5-HT3 receptors actively absorb free serotonin, as this receptor is present within the digestive tract. == Adverse effects == Citalopram theoretically causes side effects by increasing the concentration of serotonin in other parts of the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in dopamine release associated with increased serotonin. Citalopram is also a mild antihistamine, which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.: 104 Other common side effects of citalopram include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, hyperactivity and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares. Citalopram is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmia than other SSRIs. Citalopram and other SSRIs can induce a mixed state, especially in those with undiagnosed bipolar disorder.: 105 According to an article published in 2020, one of the other rare side effects of Citalopram could be triggering visual snow syndrome; which does not resolve after the discontinuation of the medicine. === Sexual dysfunction === Sexual dysfunction is often a side effect of SSRIs. Some people experience persistent sexual side effects when taking SSRIs or after discontinuing them. Symptoms of medication-induced sexual dysfunction from antidepressants include difficulty with orgasm, erection, or ejaculation. Other symptoms may be genital anesthesia, anhedonia, decreased libido, vaginal lubrication issues, and nipple insensitivity in women. Rates are unknown, and there is no established treatment. === Abnormal heart rhythm === In August 2011, the FDA announced, \"Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. Citalopram should no longer be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day\". A further clarification, issued in March 2012, restricted the maximum dose to 20 mg for subgroups of patients, including those older than 60 years and those taking an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C19.7. === Endocrine effects === As with other SSRIs, citalopram can cause an increase in serum prolactin level. Citalopram has no significant effect on insulin sensitivity in women of reproductive age and no changes in glycaemic control were seen in another trial. === Exposure in pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including citalopram) during pregnancy is associated with shorter duration of gestation (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. It is uncertain whether there is an increased prevalence of septal heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed an SSRI in early pregnancy. === Overdose === Overdosage may result in vomiting, sedation, disturbances in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremors, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions.: 105 Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the sole agent. Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 50-400 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000–3000 μg/L in patients who survive acute overdosage, and 3–30 mg/L in those who do not survive. It is the most dangerous of SSRIs in overdose. === Suicidality === In the United States, citalopram carries a boxed warning stating it may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24. === Discontinuation syndrome === SSRI discontinuation syndrome has been reported when treatment is stopped. It includes sensory, and gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, lethargy, and sleep disturbances, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety/agitation, irritability, and poor concentration. Electric shock-like sensations are typical for SSRI discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as paraesthesiae, sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with citalopram should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished. == Interactions == === Serotonin syndrome === Citalopram should not be taken with St John's wort, tryptophan or 5-HTP as the resulting drug interaction could lead to serotonin syndrome. With St John's wort, this may be caused by compounds in the plant extract reducing the efficacy of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes that process citalopram. Tryptophan and 5-HTP are precursors to serotonin. When taken with an SSRI, such as citalopram, this can lead to levels of serotonin that can be lethal. This may also be the case when SSRIs are taken with SRAs (serotonin releasing agents) such as in the case of MDMA. It is possible that SSRIs could reduce the effects associated with an SRA since SSRIs stop the reuptake of Serotonin by blocking SERT. This would allow less serotonin in and out of the transporters, thus decreasing the likelihood of neurotoxic effects. However, these concerns are still disputed as the exact pharmacodynamic effects of citalopram and MDMA have yet to be fully identified. Citalopram is contraindicated in individuals taking MAOIs, owing to a potential for serotonin syndrome. === Other interactions === SSRIs, including citalopram, can increase the risk of bleeding, especially when coupled with aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants. Taking citalopram with omeprazole may cause higher blood levels of citalopram. This is a potentially dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed. == Pharmacokinetics == Citalopram is considered safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic dose range. Distinct from some other agents in its class, it exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interaction potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or comorbid patients. == Stereochemistry == Citalopram has one stereocenter, to which a 4-fluoro phenyl group and an N, N-dimethyl-3-aminopropyl group bind. As a result of this chirality, the molecule exists in (two) enantiomeric forms (mirror images). They are termed S-(+)-citalopram and R-(–)-citalopram. Citalopram is sold as a racemic mixture, consisting of 50% (R)-(−)-citalopram and 50% (S)-(+)-citalopram. Only the (S)-(+) enantiomer has the desired antidepressant effect. Lundbeck now markets the (S)-(+) enantiomer, the generic name of which is escitalopram. Whereas citalopram is supplied as the hydrobromide, escitalopram is sold as the oxalate salt (hydrooxalate). In both cases, the salt forms of the amine make these otherwise lipophilic compounds water-soluble. == Metabolism == Citalopram is metabolized in the liver mostly by CYP2C19, but also by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Metabolites desmethylcitalopram and didesmethylcitalopram are significantly less energetic and their contribution to the overall action of citalopram is negligible. The half-life of citalopram is about 35 hours. Approximately 80% is cleared by the liver and 20% by the kidneys. The elimination process is slower in the elderly and in patients with liver or kidney failure. With once-daily dosing, steady plasma concentrations are achieved in about a week. Potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 might decrease citalopram clearance. Tobacco smoke exposure was found to inhibit the biotransformation of citalopram in animals, suggesting that the elimination rate of citalopram is decreased after tobacco smoke exposure. After intragastric administration, the half-life of the racemic mixture of citalopram was increased by about 287%. == History == Citalopram was first synthesized in 1972 by chemist Klaus Bøgesø and his research group at the pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and was first marketed in 1989 in Denmark. It was first marketed in the US in 1998. The original patent expired in 2003, allowing other companies to legally produce and market generic versions. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Citalopram is sold under these brand names: === European Commission fine === On 19 June 2013, the European Commission imposed a fine of €93.8 million on the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck, plus a total of €52.2 million on several generic pharmaceutical-producing companies. This was in response to Lundbeck entering an agreement with the companies to delay their sales of generic citalopram after Lundbeck's patent on the drug had expired, thus reducing competition in breach of European antitrust law. == Other uses == Citalopram is also a parasiticide. Schistosomula have high mortality when treated with citalopram. == See also == List of antidepressants == References ==",

         " The structures of two pseudopolymorphs of N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester, L-AcFOMe, were determined at both 293 (2) and 150 (2) K. At room temperature, the orthorhombic phase C(12)H(15)NO(3) (I), with space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), converts into the tetragonal phase C(12)H(15)NO(3).0.5H(2)O (II), with space group P4(1)2(1)2, in the presence of water. In the structures of both pseudopolymorphs, alternating layers of hydrophilic and hydrophobic intermolecular interaction can be distinguished. In the hydrophilic layers the structures are stabilized by moderate hydrogen bonds of the type N-H...O for the anhydrous L-AcFOMe and of types N-H...O and O-H...O for the hemihydrate. Weak C-H...pi interactions are observed within the hydrophobic layers: for (I) they are of type III [Malone et al. (1997). J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 93, 3429-3436], whereas typical type I edge-to-face interactions are present for (II). The differences between the hydrogen-bonding networks of (I) and (II) are discussed in terms of graph-set analysis. In this study, poly(styrene-co-N-methacryloyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester)-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were constructed and used as magnetic solid-phase extraction sorbents for analysis of food preservatives in beverages. To prepare the poly(amino acid)-based sorbents, N-methacryloyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester, and styrene served as the functional monomers and modified onto the magnetic nanoparticles via free radical polymerization. Interestingly, compared with propylparaben and potassium sorbate, the proposed poly(amino acid)-based sorbents showed a good selectivity to sodium benzoate. The adsorption capacity of the sorbents to sodium benzoate was 6.08 ± 0.31 mg/g. Moreover, the fast adsorption equilibrium could be reached within 5 min. Further, the resultant poly(amino acid)-based sorbents were applied in the analysis of sodium benzoate in real beverage samples. The results proved that the proposed magnetic solid-phase extraction sorbents have a great potential for the analysis of preservatives in food samples. Polymeric hollow nanocapsules have attracted significant research attention as novel drug carriers and their preparation is of particular concern owing to the feasibility to encapsulate a broad range of drug molecules. This work presents for the first time the synthesis and development of novel poly-N-acryloyl l-phenylalanine methyl ester hollow core nanocapsules (NAPA-HPNs) of avg. size ca. 100-150 nm by the mini-emulsion technique. NAPA-HPNs are biocompatible and capable of encapsulating sodium nitroprusside (SNP) at a rate of ∼1.3 μM per mg of capsules. These NAPA-HPNs + SNP nano-formulations maintained homeostasis of macrophages which carry and facilitate the action of various drug molecules used against various diseases. These NAPA-HPNs also facilitate the prolonged release of a low level of nitric oxide (NO) and enhance the metabolic activities of pro-inflammatory macrophages, which are important for the action of various drugs in body fluids. NAPA-HPN mediated skewing of naïve macrophages toward the M1 phenotype potentially demonstrates its adjuvant action on the innate immune system. These results potentially suggested that NAPA-HPNs can serve both as a carrier of drugs as well as an adjuvant for the immune system. Thus, these nanocapsules could be used for the effective management of various infectious or tumor diseases where immune-stimulation is paramount for treatment.",

         "Cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) is a mixture of closely related organic compounds derived from coconut oil and dimethylaminopropylamine. CAPB is available as a viscous pale yellow solution and it is used as a surfactant in personal care products and animal husbandry. The name reflects that the major part of the molecule, the lauric acid group, is derived from coconut oil. Cocamidopropyl betaine to a significant degree has replaced cocamide DEA. == Production == Despite the name cocamidopropyl betaine, the molecule is not synthesized from betaine. Instead it is produced in a two-step manner, beginning with the reaction of dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) with fatty acids from coconut or palm kernel oil (lauric acid, or its methyl ester, is the main constituent). The primary amine in DMAPA is more reactive than the tertiary amine, leading to its selective addition to form an amide. In the second step chloroacetic acid reacts with the remaining tertiary amine to form a quaternary ammonium center (a quaternization reaction). CH3(CH2)10COOH + H2NCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 → CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 + ClCH2CO2H + NaOH → CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N+(CH3)2CH2CO2− + NaCl + H2O == Chemistry == CAPB is a fatty acid amide that contains a long hydrocarbon chain at one end and a polar group at the other. This allows CAPB to act as a surfactant and as a detergent. It is a zwitterion, consisting of both a quaternary ammonium cation and a carboxylate. == Specifications and properties == Cocamidopropyl betaine is used as a foam booster in shampoos. It is a medium-strength surfactant also used in bath products like hand soaps. It is also used in cosmetics as an emulsifying agent and thickener, and to reduce the irritation that purely ionic surfactants would cause. It also serves as an antistatic agent in hair conditioners, which most often does not irritate skin or mucous membranes. However, some studies indicate it is an allergen. CAPB is also used as a co-surfactant with Sodium dodecyl sulfate for promoting the formation of gas hydrates. CAPB, as an additive, helps to scale up the gas hydrates' formation process. CAPB is obtained as an aqueous solution in concentrations of about 30%. Typical impurities of leading manufacturers today: Sodium monochloroacetate < 5 ppm Amidoamine (AA) < 0.3% Dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) < 15 ppm Glycerol < 3% The impurities AA and DMAPA are most critical, as they have been shown to be responsible for skin sensitization reactions. These by-products can be avoided by a moderate excess chloroacetate and the exact adjustment of pH value during betainization reaction accompanied by regular analytical control. == Safety == CAPB has been claimed to cause allergic reactions in some users, but a controlled pilot study has found that these cases may represent irritant reactions rather than true allergic reactions. Furthermore, results of human studies have shown that CAPB has a low sensitizing potential if impurities with amidoamine (AA) and dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) are low and tightly controlled. Other studies have concluded that most apparent allergic reactions to CAPB are more likely due to amidoamine. Cocamidopropyl betaine was voted 2004 Allergen of the Year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. == See also == Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine == References ==",

         " Coiled coils are a robust motif for exploring amino acid interactions, generating unique supramolecular structures, and expanding the functional properties of biological materials. A recently discovered antiparallel coiled-coil hexamer (ACC-Hex, peptide 1) exhibits a unique interaction in which Phe and Ile residues from adjacent α-helices interact to form a Phe-Ile zipper within the hydrophobic core. Analysis of the X-ray crystallographic structure of ACC-Hex suggests that the stability of the six-helix bundle relies on specific interactions between the Phe and Ile residues. The Phe-Ile zipper is unprecedented and represents a powerful tool for utilizing the Phe-Ile interactions to direct supramolecular assembly. To further probe and understand the limits of the Phe-Ile zipper, we designed peptide sequences with natural and unnatural amino acids placed at the Phe and Ile residue positions. Using size exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering, we found that the proper assembly of ACC-Hex from monomers is sensitive to subtle changes in side chain steric bulk and hydrophobicity introduced by mutations at the Phe and Ile residue positions. Of the sequence variants that formed ACC-Hex, mutations in the hydrophobic core significantly affected the stability of the hexamer, from a ΔG The N and C terminals and tyrosine-phosphorylating site of the middle-sized tumor antigen of polyoma virus were chemically synthesized. The sequences of these peptides were Met-Asp-Arg-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg-Ala-Asp-Lys (N-MT), Met-Leu-Phe-Ile-Leu-Ile-Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg-His-Phe (C-MT), and Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Met-Pro-Met-Glu (MT-Tyr), respectively. Among these peptides, the C-MT peptide inhibited phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4), phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.3), and phospholipase D (EC 3.1.4.4). In addition, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.10) was also inhibited by this peptide. To study the mechanism of the inhibition, kinetic analysis was performed using phospholipase A2 from porcine pancreas. The degree of inhibition of phospholipase was dose dependent, and maximal inhibition was observed at pH 8.8. This peptide inhibited phospholipase A2 in a competitive manner for low-affinity sites of Ca2+, and in a noncompetitive manner for phospholipid substrates. When a fatty acid in the 2 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine was replaced by palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1), linoleic acid (C18:2), eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3), or arachidonic acid (C20:4), the degree of inhibition of phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by the C-MT peptide decreased. Inhibition of phospholipase A2 by the C-MT peptide was reversed by low concentrations of sodium deoxycholate but not by Triton X-100 or Nonidet P40, nonionic detergents. These detergents and the modification of acyl groups altered the micellar state of phospholipids. These results, taken together, suggest that the binding of the C-MT peptide near the low-affinity Ca2+ binding sites modifies the interaction of phospholipid substrates with the active center of phospholipase A2. We present here five new hemoglobin (Hb) variants which have been identified during routine Hb analysis before their genotypic characterization. Four of these result from a classical missense mutation: Hb Canuts [alpha85(F6)Asp-->His (alpha1)], Hb Ambroise Pare [alpha117(GH5)Phe-->Ile (alpha2)], Hb Beaujolais [beta84(EF8)Thr-->Asn] and HbA(2)-North Africa [delta59(E3)Lys-->Met]. The last one, Hb Monplaisir [beta147 (Tyr-Lys-Leu-Ala-Phe-Phe-Leu-Leu-Ser-Asn-Phe-Tyr-158-COOH)], results from a frameshift mutation at the stop codon of the beta-globin gene which leads to a modified C-terminal sequence in the beta-globin chain. None of these variants seem to have a particular clinical expression in the heterozygous state. The circumstances of the discovery of these five new Hb variants emphasize the fact that an association of techniques is necessary for a complete screening of Hb variants during routine Hb analysis. Globin chain separation by reversed phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) appears to be the most relevant method.",

The acetonitrile mol-ecule is also located on a twofold axis passing through the C and N atoms. In the peptide, the thia-zole rings are faced to each other with a dihedral angle of 9.63 (15)° and intra-molecular N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds are observed.

Separation of the globin chains by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated the following percentages: Ggamma 68.4, Agamma 14.0, Xgamma 17.6, that strongly suggested the abnormal chain as being a variant of the Agamma-globin. Sequencing of the gamma-globin genes indicated that the mutated gene was in fact an Agamma with two nucleotide replacements, one being the ATA-->ACA (Ile-->Thr) at codon 75 (the so-called AgammaT of the rather common Hb F-Sardinia) and the second the GCA-->TCA (Ala-->Ser) at codon 136.

         "l-Kynurenine is a metabolite of the amino acid l-tryptophan used in the production of niacin. Kynurenine is synthesized by the enzyme tryptophan dioxygenase, which is made primarily but not exclusively in the liver, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which is made in many tissues in response to immune activation. Kynurenine and its further breakdown products carry out diverse biological functions, including dilating blood vessels during inflammation and regulating the immune response. Some cancers increase kynurenine production, which increases tumor growth. Kynurenine protects the eye by absorbing UV light, especially in the UVA region (315–400 nm). Kynurenine is present in the lens and retina as one of multiple tryptophan derivatives produced in the eye, including 3-hydroxykynurenine, that together provide UV protection and aid in enhancing visual acuity. The use of kynurenine as a UV filter is consistent with its photostability and low photosensitization, owing to its efficient relaxation from the UV-induced excited state. The concentration of this UV filter decreases with age, and this loss of free kynurenine and the concomitant formation of relatively more photosensitizing kynurenine derivatives and kynurenine-protein conjugates may contribute to the formation of cataracts. Evidence suggests that increased kynurenine production may precipitate depressive symptoms associated with interferon treatment for hepatitis C. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with imbalances in the enzymes that break down kynurenine. Blood levels of kynurenine are reduced in people with bipolar disorder. Kynurenine production is increased in Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease where its metabolites are associated with cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms. Kynurenine is also associated with tics. Kynureninase catalyzes the conversion of kynurenine into anthranilic acid while kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase catalyzes its conversion into kynurenic acid. Kynurenine 3-hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine. Kynurenine has also been identified as one of two compounds that makes up the pigment that gives the goldenrod crab spider its yellow color. == Kynurenine pathway dysfunction == Dysfunctional states of distinct steps of the kynurenine pathway (such as kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine) have been described for a number of disorders, including: HIV dementia Tourette syndrome Tic disorders Psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, anxiety disorders) Multiple sclerosis Huntington's disease Encephalopathies Lipid metabolism Liver fat metabolism Systemic lupus erythematosus Glutaric aciduria Vitamin B6 deficiency Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Downregulation of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) can be caused by genetic polymorphisms, cytokines, or both. KMO deficiency leads to an accumulation of kynurenine and to a shift within the tryptophan metabolic pathway towards kynurenine acid and anthranilic acid. Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase deficiency is associated with disorders of the brain (e.g. major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, tic disorders) and of the liver. == Drug development == It is hypothesized that the kynurenine pathway is partly responsible for the therapeutic effect of lithium on bipolar disorder. If that is the case, it could be a target of drug discovery. == See also == Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) N′-Formylkynurenine == References ==",

         "Trimethoprim (TMP) is an antibiotic used mainly in the treatment of bladder infections. Other uses include for middle ear infections and travelers' diarrhea. With sulfamethoxazole or dapsone it may be used for Pneumocystis pneumonia in people with HIV/AIDS. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). Common side effects include nausea, changes in taste, and rash. Rarely it may result in blood problems such as not enough platelets or white blood cells. Trimethoprim may cause sun sensitivity. There is evidence of potential harm during pregnancy in some animals but not humans. It works by blocking folate metabolism via dihydrofolate reductase in some bacteria, preventing creation of bacterial DNA and RNA and leading to bacterial cell death. Trimethoprim was first used in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == It is primarily used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, although it may be used against any susceptible aerobic bacterial species. It may also be used to treat and prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. It is generally not recommended for the treatment of anaerobic infections such as Clostridioides difficile colitis (the leading cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea). Trimethoprim has been used in trials to treat retinitis. Resistance to trimethoprim is increasing, but it is still a first-line antibiotic in many countries. === Spectrum of susceptibility === Cultures and susceptibility tests should be done to make sure bacteria are treated by trimethoprim. Escherichia coli Proteus mirabilis Klebsiella pneumoniae Enterobacter species Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, including S. saprophyticus Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae == Side effects == === Common === Nauseas Change in taste Vomiting Diarrhea Rashes Sun sensitivity Itchiness === Rare === Can cause thrombocytopenia (low levels of platelets) by lowering folic acid levels; this may also cause megaloblastic anemia. Trimethoprim antagonizes the epithelial sodium channel in the distal tubule, thus acting like amiloride. This can cause increased potassium levels in the body (hyperkalemia). Can compete with creatinine for secretion into the renal tubule. This can cause an artificial rise in the serum creatinine. Use in EHEC infections may lead to an increase in expression of Shiga toxin. === Contraindications === Known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim History of megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency It may be involved in a reaction similar to disulfiram when alcohol is consumed after it is used, in particular when used in combination with sulfamethoxazole. === Pregnancy === Based on the studies that show that trimethoprim crosses the placenta and can affect folate metabolism, there has been growing evidence of the risk of structural birth defects associated with trimethoprim, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. The trophoblasts in the early fetus are sensitive to changes in the folate cycle. A 2013 study found a doubling in the risk of miscarriage in women exposed to trimethoprim in the early pregnancy. == Mechanism of action == Trimethoprim binds to dihydrofolate reductase and inhibits the reduction of dihydrofolic acid (DHF) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). THF is an essential precursor in the thymidine synthesis pathway and interference with this pathway inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Trimethoprim's inhibitory activity for bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is sixty thousand times greater than for human dihydrofolate reductase. Sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, an enzyme involved further upstream in the same pathway. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are commonly used in combination due to possible synergistic effects, and reduced development of resistance. This benefit has been questioned. == History == Trimethoprim was first used in 1962. In 1972, it was used as a prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections in Finland. Its name is derived from trimethyloxy-pyrimidine. == References ==",

         " Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a growth factor composed of 53 amino acids (6.2 kDa) and is secreted by ectodermic cells, monocytes, kidneys, and duodenal glands (1). EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF and at least seven other growth factors and their transmembrane receptor kinases play important roles in cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors: EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4) (2). HER1, HER3, and HER4 comprise three major functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. No ligand has been clearly identified for HER2; however, HER2 can be activated as a result of ligand binding to other HER receptors with the formation of receptor homodimers and/or heterodimers (3). HER1 and HER2 are overexpressed on many solid tumor cells such as breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (4-6). The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with poor patient prognosis because high levels are related to increased proliferation (7-10).

The circumstances of the discovery of these five new Hb variants emphasize the fact that an association of techniques is necessary for a complete screening of Hb variants during routine Hb analysis. Globin chain separation by reversed phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) appears to be the most relevant method. Pancreatic cancer is a digestive system malignant carcinoma with poor prognosis. The majority of patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease, which is also the leading cause of pancreatic cancer death. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimetastatic effect of Asn-Phe-Gly-Lys (NFGK), a tetrapeptide derived from bovine hemoglobin pepsin hydrolysate, on human pancreatic cancer cell line MIAPaCa-2. Wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay results showed that NFGK inhibited MIAPaCa-2 cell migration and invasion dose-dependently. Cell proliferation assay data showed that NFGK had slight cytotoxicity on MIAPaCa-2 cells. Fluorescence confocal imaging data revealed that NFGK targeted the cell membrane of MIAPaCa-2. Molecular docking data displayed that NFGK bond to the N-terminus ATP-binding pocket of secreted heat shock protein 90α (Hsp90α). Western blotting results further proved that NFGK inhibited secreted Hsp90α and downstream matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) level dose dependently, while it did not inhibit intracellular Hsp90 and cyclin-dependent-kinase 4 (CDK4). All above results demonstrated that bovine hemoglobin derived peptide NFGK inhibited pancreatic cancer cell metastasis by targeting secreted Hsp90α and its downstream MMP-9. Peptide NFGK comes from bovine hemoglobin, which is digested by pepsin in stomach after eating. After digesting to NFGK, bovine hemoglobin will obtain new function of inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell metastasis without dramatic cell toxicity. These means NFGK may help those patients who are suffering pancreatic cancer to avoid cancer cell metastasis without too much side effect.",

         " Trimethyllysine is an important post-translationally modified amino acid with functions in the carnitine biosynthesis and regulation of key epigenetic processes. Protein lysine methyltransferases and demethylases dynamically control protein lysine methylation, with each state of methylation changing the biophysical properties of lysine and the subsequent effect on protein function, in particular histone proteins and their central role in epigenetics. Epigenetic reader domain proteins can distinguish between different lysine methylation states and initiate downstream cellular processes upon recognition. Dysregulation of protein methylation is linked to various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and genetic disorders. In this review, we cover biomolecular studies on the role of trimethyllysine in carnitine biosynthesis, different enzymatic reactions involved in the synthesis and removal of trimethyllysine, trimethyllysine recognition by reader proteins, and the role of trimethyllysine on the nucleosome assembly. Background Trimethyllysine, a trimethylamine N-oxide precursor, has been identified as an independent cardiovascular risk factor in acute coronary syndrome. However, limited data are available to examine the role of trimethyllysine in the population with stroke. We aimed to examine the relationship between plasma trimethyllysine levels and stroke outcomes in patients presenting with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Methods and Results Data of 10 027 patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack from the CNSR-III (Third China National Stroke Registry) and 1-year follow-up data for stroke outcomes were analyzed. Plasma levels of trimethyllysine were measured with mass spectrometry. The association between trimethyllysine and stroke outcomes was analyzed using Cox regression models. Mediation analysis was performed to examine the mediation effects of risk factors on the associations of trimethyllysine and stroke outcomes. Elevated trimethyllysine levels were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death (quartile 4 versus quartile 1: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.03-2.86) and all-cause mortality (quartile 4 versus quartile 1: HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.40-2.78) in multivariate Cox regression model. However, no associations were found between trimethyllysine and nonfatal stroke recurrence or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Trimethyllysine was associated with cardiovascular death independent of trimethylamine N-oxide. Both estimated glomerular filtration rate and hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) had significant mediation effects on the association of trimethyllysine with cardiovascular death, with a mediation effect of 37.8% and 13.4%, respectively. Conclusions Elevated trimethyllysine level is associated with cardiovascular death among patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack. Mediation analyses propose that trimethyllysine contributes to cardiovascular death through inflammation and renal function, suggesting a possible pathomechanistic link.",

         " Of interest is if factors like maternal diet can influence the risk of hypospadias-affected pregnancy. Increased propionylcarnitine (C3) is regarded as a biomarker of vitamin B12 deficiency. The retrospective study was undertaken to determine whether increased propionylcarnitine and low methionine in newborns are associated with hypospadias. 41 newborns with hypospadias and 90 control newborns without congenital anomalies were investigated. Whole blood propionylcarnitine and methionine concentrations were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. The mean concentration of propionylcarnitine was higher in newborns with hypospadias compared with newborns without congenital anomalies (p = 0.026). The mean methionine level in cases was insignificantly lower than in controls. There appears to be an association between decreased vitamin B12, as indexed by an increase of propionylcarnitine, and hypospadias in the investigated group of patients. The genetic and environmental determinants of serum propionylcarnitine concentrations (PC) remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the impact of genetic and environmental factors on serum propionylcarnitine levels in middle-aged and elderly participants from the Ansan/Ansung cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Our goal was to understand the role of PC on the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) leading to cardiovascular disease, particularly concerning branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. We analyzed participants' demographic, lifestyle, and biochemical data with and without MetS. Serum metabolite concentrations, including carnitine, acylcarnitine, and amino acid concentrations, were measured, and the components of MetS were evaluated. Genetic variants associated with low and high PC were selected using genome-wide association studies after adjusting for MetS-related parameters. Further, genetic variants and lifestyle factors that interacted with the polygenic risk score (PRS) were analyzed. Participants with MetS were older and less educated, and their alcohol intake was higher than non-MetS participants. PC was significantly associated with the MetS risk and increased the serum levels of BCAAs and other amino acids. Higher PC positively correlated with MetS components, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk factors. Intake of calcium, sodium, and vitamin D were inversely associated with PC, but coffee consumption was positively linked to PC. Multiple C2 And Transmembrane Domain Containing-1 ( Orofacial clefts are thought to be determined by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Experiments on animals demonstrated that vitamin B12 supplemented diets antagonize selected teratogens during palatogenesis. Increased propionylcarnitine in neonates is regarded as a marker of maternal vitamin B12 deficiency. The retrospective study was undertaken to determine whether increased propionylcarnitine in newborns is associated with orofacial clefts. Fifty-two newborns with isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) and 107 control newborns without congenital anomalies were investigated. Whole blood propionylcarnitine concentrations were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. The mean concentrations of propionylcarnitine in newborns with clefts and controls were 2.82±1.06µmolL(-1) and 2.68±0.94µmolL(-1), respectively. T-test for equality of means did not confirm any significant differences between both groups (P=0.381). Deficiency of vitamin B12 with metabolic disturbances seems not to be a risk factor for CLP in the investigated group of patients.",

         " The integrity and properties of mycolic acid (MA) antigens integrated into a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of N-(2-mercaptoethyl)octadecanamide, (MEODA), on a gold electrode have been interrogated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS data showed that Au-MEODA and Au-MEODA-MA behave as microelectrode arrays, with pinholes acting as the microelectrodes that permit electron transport between a redox-active probe in solution and the underlying gold surface. The average radii of the pinholes (r(a)) and half the distance between the centers of the neighbouring pinholes (r(b)), were estimated from EIS using the pore size model, and discussed. Anti-MA antibodies present in a tuberculosis (TB)-infected patient (co-infected with HIV) strongly interact with Au-MEODA-MA showing a rather compact and stable bio-complex structure that is virtually defect-free. The electrochemical impedimetric properties associated with the ability of the Au-MEODA-MA to discriminate between TB positive and negative human sera are also discussed. We prove that the Au-MEODA and Au-MEODA-MA electrodes, as well as the MA-anti-MA antibody interactions, are characterized with time-constant dispersion, typical of microstructures with grain/grain boundary phases. These crucial physico-electrochemical insights into the behaviour of surface-confined MA should provide a useful basis for the design and development of a potential impedimetric immunosensing platform for active tuberculosis. Vesicles, recently claimed as drug delivery carriers, were prepared by taking advantage of an electrostatic interaction between the carboxylic groups of fatty acids (FAs) and the amino groups of N-[3-(Dimethylamino)propyl]-Octadecanamide (DMAPODA). The study is to find out the effect of FAs' chain length on physicochemical properties of vesicles. Decanoic acid (DA), myristic acid (MA), stearic acid (SA) and behenic acid (BA) were used as FAs. Vesicles composed of them and DMAPODA were studied about formation on microscope, calorimetric analysis, size and zeta potential. On microphotographs, all of FAs could form vesicles when mixed with DMAPODA in an equi-molar ratio. However, DA/DMAPODA vesicles were disintegrated during the homogenization. Due to the asymmetry of DA/DMAPODA associate, it seems to hardly form a stable and well-packed bilayer. On thermograms, the vesicles exhibited one strong peak, indicating that FAs can be homogeneously mixed with the cationic amphiphile. The sizes of the four kinds of vesicles suspended in an aqueous solution (final pH 7.5) were in the same order (hundreds of nanometer) on microphotographs. But, on a light scattering machine, the mean size of MA/DMAPODA vesicle was measured to be much greater than those of the other vesicles, possibly because of the low absolute value of the zeta potential. In addition, the medium pH value had a significant effect on the size of BA/DMAPODA vesicle possibly because the zeta potential was strongly dependent on the pH value. FAs' chain length would affect the physicochemical properties of vesicles composed of them and DMAPODA.",

         "Spermine is a polyamine involved in cellular metabolism that is found in all eukaryotic cells. The precursor for synthesis of spermine is the amino acid ornithine. It is an essential growth factor in some bacteria as well. It is found as a polycation at physiological pH. Spermine is associated with nucleic acids and is thought to stabilize helical structure, particularly in viruses. It functions as an intracellular free radical scavenger to protect DNA from free radical attack. Spermine is the chemical primarily responsible for the characteristic odor of semen. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first described crystals of spermine phosphate in human semen in 1678. The name spermin was first used by the German chemists Ladenburg and Abel in 1888, and the correct structure of spermine was not finally established until 1926, simultaneously in England (by Dudley, Rosenheim, and Starling) and Germany (by Wrede et al.). == Derivative == A derivative of spermine, N1, N12-bis(ethyl)spermine (also known as BESm) was investigated in the late 1980s along with similar polyamine analogues for its potential as a cancer therapy. == Biosynthesis == Spermine biosynthesis in animals starts with decarboxylation of ornithine by the enzyme Ornithine decarboxylase in the presence of PLP. This decarboxylation gives putrescine. Thereafter the enzyme spermidine synthase effects two N-alkylation by decarboxy-S-adenosyl methionine. The intermediate is spermidine. Plants employ additional routes to spermine. In one pathway L-glutamine is the precursor to L-ornithine, after which the synthesis of spermine from L-ornithine follows the same pathway as in animals. Another pathway in plants starts with decarboxylation of L-arginine to produce agmatine. The imine functional group in agmatine then is hydrolysed by agmatine deiminase, releasing ammonia, converting the guanidine group into a urea. The resulting N-carbamoylputrescine is acted on by a hydrolase to split off the urea group, leaving putrescine. After that the putrescine follows the same pathway to completing the synthesis of spermine. == References == == Further reading == Slocum, R. D., Flores, H.

         "Glutathione (GSH, ) is an organic compound with the chemical formula HOCOCH(NH2)CH2CH2CONHCH(CH2SH)CONHCH2COOH. It is an antioxidant in plants, animals, fungi, and some bacteria and archaea. Glutathione is capable of preventing damage to important cellular components caused by sources such as reactive oxygen species, free radicals, peroxides, lipid peroxides, and heavy metals. It is a tripeptide with a gamma peptide linkage between the carboxyl group of the glutamate side chain and cysteine. The carboxyl group of the cysteine residue is attached by normal peptide linkage to glycine. == Biosynthesis and occurrence == Glutathione biosynthesis involves two adenosine triphosphate-dependent steps: First, γ-glutamylcysteine is synthesized from L-glutamate and L-cysteine. This conversion requires the enzyme glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCL, glutamate cysteine synthase). This reaction is the rate-limiting step in glutathione synthesis. Second, glycine is added to the C-terminal of γ-glutamylcysteine. This condensation is catalyzed by glutathione synthetase. While all animal cells are capable of synthesizing glutathione, glutathione synthesis in the liver has been shown to be essential. GCLC knockout mice die within a month of birth due to the absence of hepatic GSH synthesis. The unusual gamma amide linkage in glutathione protects it from hydrolysis by peptidases. === Occurrence === Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol (R−SH-containing compound) in animal cells, ranging from 0.5 to 10 mmol/L. It is present in the cytosol and the organelles. The concentration of glutathione in the cytoplasm is significantly higher (ranging from 0.5-10 mM) compared to extracellular fluids (2-20 μM), reaching levels up to 1000 times greater. In healthy cells and tissue, more than 90% of the total glutathione pool is in the reduced form (GSH), with the remainder in the disulfide form (GSSG). The cytosol holds 80-85% of cellular GSH and the mitochondria hold 10-15%. Human beings synthesize glutathione, but a few eukaryotes do not, including some members of Fabaceae, Entamoeba, and Giardia. The only known archaea that make glutathione are halobacteria. Some bacteria, such as \"Cyanobacteria\" and Pseudomonadota, can biosynthesize glutathione. Systemic availability of orally consumed glutathione is poor. It had low bioavailability because the tripeptide is the substrate of proteases (peptidases) of the alimentary canal, and due to the absence of a specific carrier of glutathione at the level of cell membrane. The administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a cysteine prodrug, helps replenish intracellular GSH levels. == Biochemical function == Glutathione exists in reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) states. The ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione within cells is a measure of cellular oxidative stress where increased GSSG-to-GSH ratio is indicative of greater oxidative stress. In the reduced state, the thiol group of cysteinyl residue is a source of one reducing equivalent. Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is thereby generated. The oxidized state is converted to the reduced state by NADPH. This conversion is catalyzed by glutathione reductase: NADPH + GSSG + H2O → 2 GSH + NADP+ + OH− == Roles == === Antioxidant === GSH protects cells by neutralising (reducing) reactive oxygen species. This conversion is illustrated by the reduction of peroxides: 2 GSH + R2O2 → GSSG + 2 ROH (R = H, alkyl) and with free radicals: GSH + R• → ⁠1/2⁠ GSSG + RH === Regulation === Aside from deactivating radicals and reactive oxidants, glutathione participates in thiol protection and redox regulation of cellular thiol proteins under oxidative stress by protein S-glutathionylation, a redox-regulated post-translational thiol modification. The general reaction involves formation of an unsymmetrical disulfide from the protectable protein (RSH) and GSH: RSH + GSH + [O] → GSSR + H2O Glutathione is also employed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal and formaldehyde, toxic metabolites produced under oxidative stress. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-lactoylglutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoylglutathione to glutathione and D-lactic acid. It maintains exogenous antioxidants such as vitamins C and E in their reduced (active) states. === Metabolism === Among the many metabolic processes in which it participates, glutathione is required for the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and prostaglandins. It plays a role in the storage of cysteine. Glutathione enhances the function of citrulline as part of the nitric oxide cycle. It is a cofactor and acts on glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione is used to produce S-sulfanylglutathione, which is part of hydrogen sulfide metabolism. === Conjugation === Glutathione facilitates metabolism of xenobiotics. Glutathione S-transferase enzymes catalyze its conjugation to lipophilic xenobiotics, facilitating their excretion or further metabolism. The conjugation process is illustrated by the metabolism of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is a reactive metabolite formed by the action of cytochrome P450 on paracetamol (acetaminophen). Glutathione conjugates to NAPQI, and the resulting ensemble is excreted. === In plants === In plants, glutathione is involved in stress management. It is a component of the glutathione-ascorbate cycle, a system that reduces poisonous hydrogen peroxide. It is the precursor of phytochelatins, glutathione oligomers that chelate heavy metals such as cadmium. Glutathione is required for efficient defence against plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Phytophthora brassicae. Adenylyl-sulfate reductase, an enzyme of the sulfur assimilation pathway, uses glutathione as an electron donor. Other enzymes using glutathione as a substrate are glutaredoxins. These small oxidoreductases are involved in flower development, salicylic acid, and plant defence signalling. == In degradation of drug delivery systems == Among various types of cancer, lung cancer, larynx cancer, mouth cancer, and breast cancer exhibit higher concentrations (10-40 mM) of GSH compared to healthy cells. Thus, drug delivery systems containing disulfide bonds, typically cross-linked micro-nanogels, stand out for their ability to degrade in the presence of high concentrations of glutathione (GSH). This degradation process releases the drug payload specifically into cancerous or tumorous tissue, leveraging the significant difference in redox potential between the oxidizing extracellular environment and the reducing intracellular cytosol. When internalized by endocytosis, nanogels encounter high concentrations of GSH inside the cancer cell. GSH, a potent reducing agent, donates electrons to disulfide bonds in the nanogels, initiating a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This reaction breaks the disulfide bonds, converting them into two thiol groups, and facilitates targeted drug release where it is needed most. This reaction is called a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. R−S−S−R′+ 2GSH → R−SH + R′−SH + GSSG where R and R' are parts of the micro-nanogel structure, and GSSG is oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide). The breaking of disulfide bonds causes the nanogel to degrade into smaller fragments. This degradation process leads to the release of encapsulated drugs. The released drug molecules can then exert their therapeutic effects, such as inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. == Uses == === Winemaking === The content of glutathione in must, the first raw form of wine, determines the browning, or caramelizing effect, during the production of white wine by trapping the caffeoyltartaric acid quinones generated by enzymic oxidation as grape reaction product. Its concentration in wine can be determined by UPLC-MRM mass spectrometry. == See also == Reductive stress Glutathione synthetase deficiency Ophthalmic acid roGFP, a tool to measure the cellular glutathione redox potential Glutathione-ascorbate cycle Bacterial glutathione transferase Thioredoxin, a cysteine-containing small proteins with very similar functions as reducing agents Glutaredoxin, an antioxidant protein that uses reduced glutathione as a cofactor and is reduced nonenzymatically by it Bacillithiol Mycothiol γ-L-Glutamyl-L-cysteine == References ==",

It serves as a signal that induces the accumulation of salicylic acid, an important component of a plant's defensive response. === Human biology === The mechanism of action in humans is thought to be through the inhibition of hyperactive protease activity that converts cathelicidin into the antimicrobial skin peptide LL-37. == Applications == === Polymers and related materials === Esters of this dicarboxylic acid find applications in lubrication and plasticizers. In lubricant industries, it is used as a thickening agent in lithium complex grease. With hexamethylenediamine, azelaic acid forms Nylon-6,9, which finds specialized uses as a plastic. === Medical === In 2022, it was the 298th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 300,000 prescriptions. Azelaic acid is used to treat mild to moderate acne, both comedonal acne and inflammatory acne. It belongs to a class of chemicals called dicarboxylic acids. It works by killing acne bacteria that infect skin pores. It also decreases the production of keratin, which is a natural substance that promotes the growth of acne bacteria. Azelaic acid is also used as a topical gel treatment for rosacea, due to its ability to reduce inflammation. It clears the bumps and swelling caused by rosacea. In topical pharmaceutical preparations and scientific research AzA is typically used in concentrations between 15% and 20% but some research demonstrates that in certain vehicle formulations, the pharmaceutical effects of 10% Azelaic acid have the potential to be fully comparable to that of some 20% creams. ==== Acne treatment ==== Azelaic acid is effective for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 15%-20% concentration. In patients with moderate acne, twice daily application over 3 months of 20% AzA significantly reduced the number of comedones, papules, and pustules; at this strength, it’s considered to be as effective as benzoyl peroxide 5%, tretinoin 0.05%, erythromycin 2%, and oral tetracycline at 500 mg-1000 mg. In a comparative review of effects of topical AzA, Salicylic acid, Nicotinamide, Sulfur, Zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid, AzA had more high-quality evidence of effectiveness than the rest. Results can be expected after 4 weeks of twice-daily treatment. The effectiveness of long-term use is unclear, but it’s been recommended that AzA be used for at least 6 months continuously for maintenance. === Whitening agent === Azelaic acid is used for the treatment of skin pigmentation, including melasma and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, particularly in those with darker skin types. It has been recommended as an alternative to hydroquinone. As a tyrosinase inhibitor, azelaic acid reduces synthesis of melanin. According to one report in 1988, azelaic acid in combination with zinc sulfate in vitro was found to be a potent (90% inhibition) 5α-reductase inhibitor, similar to the hair loss drugs finasteride and dutasteride. In vitro research during mid-1980s evaluating azelaic acid's depigmenting (whitening) capability concluded it is effective (cytotoxic to melanocytes) at only high concentrations. A 1996 review claimed 20% AzA is as potent as 4% hydroquinone after a period of application of three months without the latter's adverse effects and even more effective if applied along with tretinoin for the same period of time. == Brand names == Brand names for azelaic acid include Dermaz 99, Crema Pella Perfetta (micronized azelaic acid, kojic dipalmitate, and liquorice extract), Azepur99, Azetec99, Azaclear (azelaic acid and niacinamide), AzClear Action, Azelex, White Action cream, Finacea, Finevin, Melazepam, Skinoren, Ezanic, Azelac, Azelan, Azaderm, (Acnegen, Eziderm, Acnicam, Azelexin in Pakistan) == References == == External links == DermNet treatments/azelaic-acid \"Azelaic Acid Topical\".
