2874,"('Erdosteine', 'Rv 144', 'Acetic acid, [[2-oxo-2-[(tetrahydro-2-oxo-3-thienyl)amino]ethyl]thio]-', 'Erdosteinum [latin]', 'Dithiosteine')",Medical,"Erdosteine is a molecule with mucolytic activity. Structurally it is a thioether derivative with two thioether groups. These two functional organosulfur groups contained in the molecule are released following first-pass metabolism with the conversion of erdosteine into its pharmacologically active metabolite Met-I. The molecule has been discovered and developed in Italy by Edmond Pharma, today it is prescribed for chronic and acute respiratory disorders in more than 40 countries worldwide. The drug is sold under several commercial names (Esteclin, Erdomed, Erdos, Erdotin etc.), as hard capsules 300 mg, dispersible tablets 300 mg, granulates for oral suspension 225 mg and powder for oral suspension 175 mg/5ml. == Pharmacodynamics == Erdosteine is an oral mucoactive anti-oxidant molecule, characterized by a multi-faceted pharmacological profile that may positively interfere in more than one of the pathological processes ongoing in all respiratory disorders characterized by thickened or increased mucus production, increased oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Moreover, an important feature of the pharmacological profile of erdosteine is represented by its synergy with antibiotics. Anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity Erdosteine exerts its role as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory thanks to the free sulfhydryl groups of its active metabolite Met I, which has a direct scavenging effect (particularly on reactive oxygen species, ROS), and it is able to bind the free radicals preventing tissue damage. Erdosteine exerts a protective role against lipid peroxidation (smokers, COPD patients) by increasing the availability of endogenous antioxidants, such as glutathione, in plasma and bronco-alveolar lavage. Antiadhesive activity Erdosteine is able to interfere with bacterial adhesion. In fact, Met I can affect the integrity of the natural intrachain disulphide bonds of pilin; the opening of this bond can induce a morphological change that interferes with the binding of bacterial adhesin (fimbriae) to receptor. The bacterial adhesion reduction is reached by Met I ad concentration similar to the plasmatic peak obtained after a single 300 mg oral administration of erdosteine. Erdosteine showed in vivo and in vitro synergistic activity with antibiotics, against bacterial adhesiveness, in patients with respiratory infections. Several clinical studies underline that, when given in combination with antibiotics, erdosteine does not interfere with their activity but improve their effects, causing an increase in therapeutic efficacy. Mucolytic activity Erdosteine shows an important muco-regulatory activity (it increases mucus production and makes it more fluid and much less thick), and positively influences the mucociliary clearance. Several studies show that erdosteine results more active compared to other muco-regulatory drugs (such as N-acetylcysteina, sobrerol and ambroxol). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Evidence obtained in patients with stable chronic bronchitis/COPD with mucus hypersecretion show that erdosteine can bring therapeutic advantages during long-term administration. A long-term treatment with erdosteine (6–8 months) can significantly decrease the risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations and improve patients' quality of life. These data are in agreement with recent indications from the international literature, that support the use of mucoactive agents in patients with hypersecreting chronic pulmonary diseases, especially during winter months. A metanalysis conducted on 1278 patients demonstrated that erdosteine brings to symptoms improvement and reduces the risk of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD. Furthermore, erdosteine demonstrated to reduce the exacerbation duration and the hospitalization risk due to COPD. The RESTORE study (Reducing Exacerbations and Symptoms by Treatment with ORal Erdosteine in COPD) was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erdosteine 300 mg/bid added to usual maintenance therapy vs. placebo over 12-months, a period long enough to avoid bias due to seasonal variability in exacerbation frequency. During the study 467 patients with moderate-to-severe stable COPD were randomized and treated in 47 hospital-based pulmonary clinics in 10 European countries. After 1 year of treatment there was a 1.4% reduction in the exacerbation rate with erdosteine treatment; this result was mainly driven by the reduction in the rate of mid exacerbations equal to 57.1%. Furthermore, erdosteine treatment was associated with a 24.6% decrease in all exacerbation duration compared to placebo. Both for exacerbation rate and duration, no significant differences among inhaled corticosteroids taking and non-taking patients has been registered. A RESTORE sub-analysis demonstrated that adding erdosteine to the maintenance therapy reduces the number of mild exacerbations and the duration of all exacerbations in patients with moderate COPD. A metanalysis conducted on 2753 patients with moderate COPD shows that the efficacy and safety profile of erdosteine is superior to that of other muco-regulatory drugs (carbocysteine and N-acetylcysteine). Furthermore, erdosteine was the only mucolytic able to reduce the risk of hospitalization due to COPD exacerbations. Other activities Several studies demonstrate the efficacy of erdosteine in the treatment of bronchiectasis in terms of facility of expectoration. In several Countries in the world erdosteine is approved for the bronchiectasis treatment. Erdosteine has shown benefits also in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and Otitis Media Secretorica. Pediatric population Erdosteine was tested in pediatric patients with lower tract respiratory disorders, in association with ampicillin, demonstrating a high symptoms reduction. In pediatric population with acute bronchitis, tracheobronchitis and pneumonia, erdosteine showed a significantly high reduction in cough intensity and improvement of clinical symptoms, with very good tolerability. == Pharmacokinetics == Erdosteine, administered in single doses from 150 mg to 1200 mg to adult volunteers, shows a linear kinetic, with Met I serum concentration approximately 4-fold higher than those of erdosteine. The pharmacokinetic parameters of erdosteine and Met I are fully comparable after single and multiple doses, therefore there is no accumulation or metabolic activation after repeated administrations. Food does not significantly affect the absorption of erdosteine. After oral administration, erdosteine is rapidly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and the plasmatic peak concentration (Cmax) is reached after 30–60 minutes (Tmax) from consumption. The molecule is rapidly transformed through a first-pass metabolism to the biologically active metabolite Met I. The drug bioavailability by oral route is very good. The half-life is 3 hours and the plasma binding protein is 65%. With respect to pharmacokinetics in special populations, a study in 12 health volunteers (mean age 70 years) confirmed that pharmacokinetic parameters for both erdosteine and Met I were similar to those observed in younger adults (mean age 31 years). Moderate renal dysfunction in elder volunteers did not affect erdosteine and Met I pharmacokinetics. == Toxicity == The LD50 in rats is very high, between 3500 and 5000 mg/kg. == Clinical uses == Clinical studies in more than 4000 patients demonstrated that erdosteine is effective is the treatment of acute and chronic infections of upper and lower respiratory tract with mucus hypersecretion. It modulates the sputum viscosity in the respiratory tract, making it more fluid and less thick, bringing to an increase of mucociliary rate which allows the mucus removal from respiratory tract. Erdosteine is used as mucolytic and fluidifying agent in upper and lower respiratory disorders. It modulates the sputum viscosity. Erdosteine efficacy is significant in reducing symptoms associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. A multicentric, multinational study on more than 450 patients with COPD demonstrated that erdosteine is able to reduce both the frequency and the duration of symptomatic exacerbations, typical of this disease. The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) International Guidelines indicate that a regular treatment with a mucolytic like erdosteine can reduce exacerbations and improve the health status of patients with COPD. In some countries erdosteine in approved for the treatment of bronchiectasis. == Safety profile == Data from post marketing surveillance confirm that erdosteine is well tolerated, with an excellent safety profile. Frequency and severity of adverse effects in clinical studies (more than 2300 patients in more than 70 clinical studies) was very low and comparable to placebo. Erdosteine is stable to hydrolysis in acid environment, so it does not have any direct effect on gastric mucus. Less than 1 patient in 1000 is expected to have gastrointestinal undesirable effects. Very rare (<1/10000) adverse events are headache, dyspnea, taste alterations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric pain. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated in subjects with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. It is contraindicated in subjects with active peptic ulcer. Because of a possible interference of the product with methionine metabolism, the drug is contraindicated in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and deficiency of the cystathionine-synthetase enzyme. == Interaction with other medicinal products == No harmful interactions with other drugs have been reported and the product can therefore be administered together with antibiotics and bronchodilators (such as beta2-mimetics and cough sedatives). == References ==",Erdosteine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.400034933700226e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011853104224428535)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdosteine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Erdosteine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdosteine?utm_source=openai')])"

Early development was solely by Bristol-Myers Squibb; in 2007 AstraZeneca joined with Bristol-Myers Squibb to co-develop the final compound and collaborate on the marketing of the drug. In April 2016, the U.S. FDA added a warning about increased risk of heart failure. This was based on data in an article that concluded ""DPP-4 inhibition with saxagliptin did not increase or decrease the rate of ischemic events, though the rate of hospitalization for heart failure was increased. Although saxagliptin improves glycemic control, other approaches are necessary to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes."" == Medical uses == Saxagliptin is used as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It does not appear to decrease the risk of heart attacks or strokes. One study showed a 3.5% risk of hospitalization for heart failure compared to 2.8% in a placebo-controlled group. Like other DPP-4 inhibitors, it has relatively modest HbA1c lowering ability, is associated with a relatively low risk of hypoglycemia, and does not cause weight gain. Saxagliptin improved mean HbA1c levels (relative to placebo) in a 24-week trial in people with type 2 diabetes. Combination therapy with saxagliptin and metformin was more effective than saxagliptin or metformin monotherapy. When the relative benefits of increasing the dose of a sulfonylurea or adding saxagliptin were assessed in a study of 768 patients, combination treatments were shown to have a significantly greater impact on fasting blood glucose than increasing the tested glibenclamide dose alone. == Adverse effects == In those taking sulphonylureas there is an increased risk of low blood sugar. 3 adverse reactions were seen higher in saxagliptin vs placebo. Table 1: Adverse Reactions (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in Placebo-Controlled Trials* Reported in ≥ 5% of Patients Treated with ONGLYZA (saxagliptin tablets) 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo. The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin, thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. In February 2012, Bristol-Myers/Astra Zeneca distributed additional safety information on saxagliptin use in South Africa. The package insert is to be edited for South Africa. Contraindications will now include a history of sensitivity to saxagliptin (or another DPP4 inhibitor) as well as pancreatitis. Spontaneously reported adverse events in South Africa have included anaphylaxis, angioedema and acute pancreatitis. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial, saxagliptin treatment let to a small increase in the risk of being hospitalized for heart failure. Saxagliptin may cause joint pain that can be severe and disabling. Saxagliptin may increase the risk of heart failure. === Tolerability === Both monotherapy and combination therapy with other agents was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. === Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer === An association of the DPP-IV inhibitor class with pancreatic problems has been proposed, mainly based on case reports associated with the DPP-IV inhibitor sitagliptin and several incretin mimetics including exenatide. A 2013 study of the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin reported found ""worrisome changes in the pancreases of the rats that could lead to pancreatic cancer"". A second paper by the same authors reported an increase in precancerous lesions in the pancreases of organ donors who had taken GLP-1 inhibitors. In response to these reports, the United States FDA and the European Medicines Agency each undertook independent reviews of all clinical and preclinical data related to the possible association of DPP-IV inhibitors with pancreatic cancer. In a joint letter to the New England Journal of Medicines, the agencies stated that ""Both agencies agree that assertions concerning a causal association between incretin-based drugs and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent with the current data. The FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding such a causal relationship. Although the totality of the data that have been reviewed provides reassurance, pancreatitis will continue to be considered a risk associated with these drugs until more data are available; both agencies continue to investigate this safety signal."" Lawsuits have been filed in which plaintiffs who developed pancreatic cancer claim that DPP-IV inhibitors or incretins had a causative role in the development of their cancers. == Production == The synthesis of saxagliptin by Bristol-Myers Squibb by the amide coupling of N-Boc-3-hydroxyadamantylglycine (2) and methanoprolineamide (3) with EDC. The former is commercially available, whereas the latter is available as the N-Boc analog. The prolineamide moiety is subsequently dehydrated with trifluoroacetic anhydride to give the cyanide as the trifluoracetate ester, which is hydrolyzed. Removal of the Boc protecting group, followed by neutralization gives the desired product (1): == Pharmacology == Saxagliptin is part of a class of diabetes medications called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. DPP-4 is an enzyme that breaks down incretin hormones. As a DPP-4 inhibitor, saxagliptin slows down the breakdown of incretin hormones, increasing the level of these hormones in the body. It is this increase in incretin hormones that is responsible for the beneficial actions of saxagliptin, including increasing insulin production in response to meals and decreasing the rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4's role in blood glucose regulation is thought to be through degradation of GIP and the degradation of GLP-1. Because incretin hormones are more active in response to higher blood sugar levels (and are less active in response to low blood sugar), the risk of dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is low with saxagliptin monotherapy. == Licensing == A New Drug Application for saxagliptin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes was submitted to the FDA in June 2008. It was based on a drug development program with 8 randomized trials: 1 phase 2 dose-ranging (2.5–100 mg/d) study; 6 phase 3, 24-week controlled trials with additional controlled follow-up from 12 to 42 months, double-blinded throughout; and one 12-week mechanism-of-action trial with a 2-year follow-up period. The FDA approved saxagliptin with brand name Onglyza on July 31, 2009. Saxagliptin was licensed for use throughout the European Union by the European Medicines Agency on December 1, 2009. Bristol-Myers Squibb announced on 27 December 2006 that Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. has been granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the compound in Japan. Under the licensing agreement, Otsuka will be responsible for all development costs, but Bristol-Myers Squibb retains rights to co-promote saxagliptin with Otsuka in Japan. Further, on 11 January 2007 it was announced that Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca would work together to complete development of the drug and in subsequent marketing. == References == == External links == ""Saxagliptin"".

2876,"('Betulinic acid', 'Lupatic acid', 'Betulic acid', 'Mairin', 'Als-357')",Medical,"Betulinic acid is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid which has antiretroviral, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as a more recently discovered potential as an anticancer agent, by inhibition of topoisomerase. It is found in the bark of several species of plants, principally the white birch (Betula pubescens) from which it gets its name, same as the bracket fungus Fomitopsis betulina, but also the ber tree (Ziziphus mauritiana), selfheal (Prunella vulgaris), the tropical carnivorous plants Triphyophyllum peltatum and Ancistrocladus heyneanus, Diospyros leucomelas, a member of the persimmon family, Tetracera boiviniana, the jambul (Syzygium formosanum), flowering quince (Pseudocydonia sinensis, former Chaenomeles sinensis KOEHNE), rosemary, and Pulsatilla chinensis. == Antitumor activity == In 1995, betulinic acid was reported as a selective inhibitor of human melanoma. Then it was demonstrated to induce apoptosis in human neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo in model systems. At one time, it was undergoing drug development with assistance from the Rapid Access to Intervention Development program of the National Cancer Institute. Also, betulinic acid was found active in vitro against neuroectodermal (neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma) and malignant brain tumors, ovarian carcinoma, in human leukemia HL-60 cells, and malignant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma SCC25 and SCC9 cell lines. In contrast, epithelial tumors, such as breast, colon, small cell lung and renal cell carcinomas, as well as T-cell leukemia cells, were completely unresponsive to treatment with betulinic acid. The effects of betulinic acid as an anticancer agent in breast cancer is found to be cannabinoid receptor dependent. Betulinic acid behaves as a CB1 antagonist and CB2 agonist. == Mode of action == Regarding the mode of action of betulinic acid, little is known about its antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing mechanisms. In neuroectodermal tumor cells, betulinic acid–induced apoptosis is accompanied by caspase activation, mitochondrial membrane alterations and DNA fragmentation. Caspases are produced as inactive proenzymes, which are proteolytically processed to their active forms. These proteases can cooperate in proteolytic cascades, in which caspases activate themselves and each other. The initiation of the caspases cascade may lead to the activation of endonucleases such as caspase-activated DNAase (CAD). After activation, CAD contributes to DNA degradation. Betulinic acid induces apoptosis by direct effects on mitochondria, leading to cytochrome c release, which in turn regulates the ""downstream"" caspase activation. Betulinic acid bypasses resistance to CD95 and doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis, due to different molecular mechanism of betulinic acid-induced apoptosis. The role of p53 in betulinic acid-induced apoptosis is controversial. Fulda suggested a p53-independent mechanism of the apoptosis, based on no accumulation of wild-type p53 detected upon treatment with the betulinic acid, whereas wild-type p53 protein strongly increased after treatment with doxorubicin. The suggestion is supported by study of Raisova. Alternatively, Rieber suggested betulinic acid exerts its inhibitory effect on human metastatic melanoma partly by increasing p53. The study also demonstrated preferential apoptotic effect of betulinic acid on C8161 metastatic melanoma cells, with greater DNA fragmentation and growth arrest and earlier loss of viability than their nonmetastatic C8161/neo 6.3 counterpart. Comparing betulinic acid with other treatment modes, Zuco demonstrated it was less than 10% as potent as doxorubicin and showed an in vitro antiproliferative activity against melanoma and nonmelanoma cell lines, including those resistant to doxorubicin. On the human normal dermatoblast cell line, betulinic acid was one-half to one-fifth as toxic as doxorubicin. The ability of betulinic acid to induce two different effects (cytotoxic and cytostatic) on two clones derived from the same human melanoma metastasis suggests the development of clones resistant to this agent will be more unlikely, than that to conventional cytotoxic drugs. Moreover, in spite of the lower potency compared with doxorubicin, betulinic acid seems to be selective for tumor cells with minimal toxicity against normal cells. The effect of betulinic acid on melanoma cell lines is stronger than its growth-inhibitory effect on primary melanocytes. A study of a combination of betulinic acid with γ-irradiation showed clearly additive effects, and indicated they differ in their modes of action. C-3 esterification of betulinic acid led to the discovery of bevirimat, an HIV-1 maturation inhibitor patented by Rhone-Poulenc (now Sanofi-Aventis). The clinical development, however, was stopped due to poor pharmacodynamic properties. == Use in cosmetics == There has been great emphasis on the use of betulinic acid as an antioxidative additive. Creams containing betulinic acid have been proven to help against highly reactive radicals that might cause skin DNA damage. Furthermore, betulinic acid was able to counteract the effects of ionizing radiation like UV. This makes betulinic acid a great additive for sunscreems and sunblocks and also creams for anti-aging purposes. == Biosynthesis == Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been engineered to produce betulinic acid from the mevalonate pathway, with squalene 2,3-epoxide as an intermediate. Acetyl-CoA is converted to squalene through use of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and the bifunctional farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase and squalene synthase (ERG9) and oxidation of NADPH to NADP+. This is then further oxygenated by the squalene monooxygenase (ERG1) to squalene 2,3-epoxide. This is cyclized to lupeol by the Arabidopsis thaliana lupeol synthase (AtLUP1). Finally, lupeol is converted to betulinic acid through the Catharanthus roseus P450 monooxygenase (CrAO) with the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+. == Anticancer derivatives == A major inconvenience for the future clinical development of betulinic acid and analogues resides in their poor solubility in aqueous media such as blood serum and polar solvents used for bioassays. To circumvent this problem of hydrosolubility and to enhance pharmacological properties, many derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic activity. One study showed C-20 modifications involve the loss of cytotoxicity. Another study demonstrated the importance of the presence of the -COOH group, since compounds substituted at this position, such as lupeol and methyl betulinate, were less active on human melanoma than betulinic acid. Moreover, some C-28 amino acids and C-3 phthalates derivatives exhibited higher cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines with improved selective toxicity and water solubility. Chatterjee et al. obtained the 28-O-β-D-glucopyranoside of betulinic acid by microbial transformation with Cunninghamella species, while Baglin et al. obtained it by organic synthesis. This glucoside did not exhibit any significant in vitro activity on human melanoma (MEL-2) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cell lines, which confirms the importance of the carboxylic acid function to preserve the cytotoxicity. Recently, Gauthier et al. synthesized a series of 3-O-glycosides of betulinic acid which exhibited a strongly potent in vitro anticancer activity against human cancer cell lines. == See also == Oleanolic acid Ursolic acid Moronic acid == References ==",Betulic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.016934439539909363), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.4343680143356323), (',', -1.8624639324116288e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.00010318557906430215), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.2883510887622833), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -0.0003871168300975114), ('ĠPERSON', -0.40636464953422546), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.0609570381348021e-05), (',', -0.20160424709320068), ('ĠFOOD', -0.01626155711710453), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.030291123315691948)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.10020678490400314), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

2878,"('Androsterone', 'Androkinine', 'Androtine', 'Cis-androsterone', 'Atromide ici')","Endogenous, Medical","Androsterone, or 3α-hydroxy-5α-androstan-17-one, is an endogenous steroid hormone, neurosteroid, and putative pheromone. It is a weak androgen with a potency that is approximately 1/7 that of testosterone. Androsterone is a metabolite of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In addition, it can be converted back into DHT via 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, bypassing conventional intermediates such as androstanedione and testosterone, and as such, can be considered to be a metabolic intermediate in its own right. Androsterone is also known to be an inhibitory androstane neurosteroid, acting as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and possesses anticonvulsant effects. The unnatural enantiomer of androsterone is more potent as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors and as an anticonvulsant than the natural form. Androsterone's 3β-isomer is epiandrosterone, and its 5β-epimer is etiocholanolone. The 3β,5β-isomer is epietiocholanolone. == Biological function == Androsterone has generally been considered to be an inactive metabolite of testosterone, which when conjugated by glucuronidation and sulfation allows testosterone to be removed from the body, but it is a weak neurosteroid that can cross into the brain and could have effects on brain function. The view of androsterone as generally being of low significance however, seems to need review in the light of 21st century research, which suggests that androsterone significantly affects masculinization in mammalian fetuses. Masculinization of the external genitalia in humans is subject to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) derived via the recognised androgenic pathway and also via a backdoor pathway. Therefore, androstanediol can be used a marker of the backdoor pathway of DHT synthesis. Spectrometric studies identify androsterone as the main backdoor androgen in the human male fetus. Circulating levels are sex dependent, DHT being essentially absent in the female, in which titres of backdoor intermediates also are very low. In males, backdoor intermediates occur mainly in the liver and adrenal of the fetus, and in the placenta — hardly at all in the testis. Instead, progesterone in the placenta is the main backdoor substrate for androgen synthesis. This also is consistent with the observation that placental insufficiency has been associated with disruptions of development of fetal genitalia. === Pheromone === Androsterone is found in the human axilla and skin as well as in the urine. It may also be secreted by human sebaceous glands. It is described as having a musky odor similar to that of androstenol. Androsterone has been found to affect human behavior when smelled. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === Androsterone and its 5β-isomer, etiocholanolone, are produced in the body as metabolites of testosterone. Testosterone is converted to 5α-dihydrotestosterone and 5β-dihydrotestosterone by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase, respectively. The enzyme 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase converts the reduced forms to 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, which are subsequently converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to androsterone and etiocholanolone, respectively. Androsterone and etiocholanolone can also be formed from androstenedione via the action of 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase forming 5α-androstanedione and 5β-androstanedione which are then converted to androsterone and etiocholanolone by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, respectively. === Metabolism === Androsterone is sulfated into androsterone sulfate and glucuronidated into androsterone glucuronide and these conjugates are excreted in urine. == Chemistry == === Sources === Androsterone has been shown to naturally occur in pine pollen, celery, truffles and is well known in many animal species. == History == Androsterone was first isolated in 1931, by Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt and Kurt Tscherning.

The effect of ricolinostat on cervical cancer cells was assessed using MTT, cell-cycle arrest, Annexin V/PI staining assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement, and western blot analysis. The antiproliferative effect of ricolinostat in combination with topoisomerase inhibitors was assessed using the MTT assay and synergism was computed using ""CompuSyn"" software. We found that ricolinostat inhibited proliferation, and induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. We further found that ricolinostat treatment resulted in increased ROS production, decreased Bcl-xL expression, and induced p21 expression. We also investigated the effect of ricolinostat in combination with topotecan and etoposide in cervical cancer cells. Ricolinostat was found to significantly enhance the antiproliferative activity of both, topotecan and etoposide, in cervical cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner.

2881,"('Octopamine (hydrochloride)', '(¬±)-p-octopamine hydrochlorid', 'Octopamine', 'Norsynephrine', 'Norsympatol')",Medical,"Octopamine (OA), also known as para-octopamine and norsynephrine among synonyms, is an organic chemical closely related to norepinephrine, and synthesized biologically by a homologous pathway. Octopamine is often considered the major ""fight-or-flight"" neurohormone of invertebrates. Its name is derived from the fact that it was first identified in the salivary glands of the octopus. In many types of invertebrates, octopamine is an important neurotransmitter and hormone. In protostomes—arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worms—it substitutes for norepinephrine and performs functions apparently similar to those of norepinephrine in mammals, functions that have been described as mobilizing the body and nervous system for action. In mammals, octopamine is found only in trace amounts (i.e., it is a trace amine), and no biological function has been solidly established for it. It is also found naturally in numerous plants, including bitter orange. Octopamine has been sold under trade names such as Epirenor, Norden, and Norfen for use as a sympathomimetic drug, available by prescription. == Functions == === Cellular effects === Octopamine exerts its effects by binding to and activating receptors located on the surface of cells. These receptors have mainly been studied in insects, where they can be divided into distinct types: OctαR (alpha-adrenergic-like), are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic alpha-1 receptors in mammals. There are multiple subtypes of the OctαR receptor. For example, the kissing bug (Rhodnius prolixus) has Octα1-R, Octα2R. OctβR (beta-adrenergic-like), are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic beta receptors in mammals. There are multiple subtypes of the OctβR receptor. For example, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has DmOctβ1R, DmOctβ2R, and DmOctβ3R. OAMB. The diversity of this receptor is relatively unknown. The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has two distinct isoforms which are functionally distinct: OambK3 and OambAS. TyrR (mixed octopamine/tyramine receptors), which are structurally and functionally similar to noradrenergic alpha-2 receptors in mammals. Receptors in the TyrR class, however, are generally more strongly activated by tyramine than by octopamine. Phylogenetic studies claim that in ancient bilaterians such as Platynereis dumerilii there is a co-existence of norepinephrine, tyramine and octopamine receptor signaling. However, due to partial overlapping in their signalling functionality tyramine and octopamine receptors have been lost in vertebrates. In vertebrates no octopamine-specific receptors have been identified. Octopamine binds weakly to receptors for norepinephrine and epinephrine, but it is not clear whether this has any functional significance. It binds more strongly to trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), especially TAAR1. === Invertebrates === Octopamine was first discovered by Italian scientist Vittorio Erspamer in 1948 in the salivary glands of the octopus and has since been found to act as a neurotransmitter, neurohormone and neuromodulator in invertebrates. Although Erspamer discovered its natural occurrence and named it, octopamine had actually existed for many years as a pharmaceutical product. It is widely used in energy-demanding behaviors by all insects, crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, crayfish), and spiders. Such behaviors include modulating muscle tension, flying, ovulation and egg-laying, and jumping. ==== In non-insect invertebrates ==== In lobsters, octopamine seems to direct and coordinate neurohormones to some extent in the central nervous system, and it was observed that injecting octopamine into a lobster and crayfish resulted in limb and abdomen extension. In the nematode, octopamine is found in high concentrations in adults, decreasing egg-laying and pharyngeal pumping behaviors with an antagonistic effect to serotonin. Octopaminergic nerves in the mollusc may be present in the heart, with high concentrations in the nervous system. ==== In non-Drosophila insects ==== In insects, octopamine is released by a select number of neurons, but acts broadly throughout the central brain, on all sense organs, and on several non-neuronal tissues. In the thoracic ganglia, octopamine is primarily released by DUM (dorsal unpaired median) and VUM (ventral unpaired median) neurons, which release octopamine onto neural, muscular, and peripheral targets. These neurons are important for mediating energy-demanding motor behaviors, such as escape-induced jumping and flight. For example, the locust DUMeti neuron releases octopamine onto the extensor tibia muscle to increase muscle tension and increase relaxation rate. These actions promote efficient leg muscle contraction for jumping. During flight, DUM neurons are also active and release octopamine throughout the body to synchronize energy metabolism, respiration, muscle activity and flight interneuron activity. Octopamine in locusts is four times more concentrated in the axon than in the soma, and decreases the locust's myogenic rhythm. In the honey bee, octopamine has a major role in learning and memory. In the firefly, octopamine release leads to light production in the lantern. In larvae of the oriental armyworm, octopamine is immunologically beneficial, increasing survival rates in high-density populations. The emerald cockroach wasp stings the host for its larvae (a cockroach) in the head ganglion (brain). The venom blocks octopamine receptors and the cockroach fails to show normal escape responses, grooming itself excessively. It becomes docile and the wasp leads it to the wasp's den by pulling its antenna like a leash. ==== In Drosophila ==== Octopamine affects almost every process of the fruit fly and is widely present in both the adult and larval fly. A non-exhaustive list of some of the areas in which Octopamine modulates: Learning and memory Ovulation and Egg-Laying Locomotion Muscle Physiology Aggression Alcohol and drug tolerance Feeding Microbiome and gut physiology Sleep Modulating effects of exercise Metabolism === Vertebrates === In vertebrates, octopamine replaces norepinephrine in sympathetic neurons with chronic use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. It may be responsible for the common side effect of orthostatic hypotension with these agents, though there is also evidence that it is actually mediated by increased levels of N-acetylserotonin. One study noted that octopamine might be an important amine that influences the therapeutic effects of inhibitors such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, especially because a large increase in octopamine levels was observed when animals were treated with this inhibitor. Octopamine was positively identified in the urine samples of mammals such as humans, rats, and rabbits treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Very small amounts of octopamine were also found in certain animal tissues. It was observed that within a rabbit's body, the heart and kidney held the highest concentrations of octopamine. Octopamine was found to be 93% eluted by urine within 24 hours of being produced in the body as a byproduct of Iproniazid in rabbits. == Pharmacology == Octopamine has been sold under trade names such as Epirenor, Norden, and Norfen for use in medicine as a sympathomimetic drug, available by prescription. However, very little information exists concerning its clinical usefulness or safety. It has been studied as an antihypotensive agent and has been shown to increase blood pressure when administered intravenously, intramuscularly, and buccally at sufficiently high doses, whereas oral administration was ineffective. Octopamine is an analogue of sympathomimetic catecholamines like norepinephrine and phenethylamines like tyramine. However, octopamine has 400- to 2,000-fold lower affinity for the mammalian α- and β-adrenergic receptors than norepinephrine. In any case, it can produce significant sympathomimetic effects, like pressor responses, at sufficiently high doses. In mammals, octopamine may mobilize the release of fat from adipocytes (fat cells), which has led to its promotion on the internet as a slimming aid. However, the released fat is likely to be promptly taken up into other cells, and there is no evidence that octopamine facilitates weight loss. Octopamine may also increase blood pressure significantly when combined with other stimulants, as in some weight loss supplements. The World Anti-Doping Agency lists octopamine as a banned substance for in competition use, as a ""specified stimulant"" on the 2019 Prohibited List. In contrast to various other phenethylamines, octopamine is a poor or negligible substrate of the dopamine transporter (DAT). == Insecticides == The octopamine receptor is a target of insecticides, as its blockage leads to decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Essential oils can have such a neuro-insecticidal effect, and this octopamine-receptor mechanism is naturally utilized by plants with active insecticidal phytochemicals. == Biochemical mechanisms == === Mammals === Octopamine is one of four primary endogenous agonists of human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) together with 3-iodothyronamine, dopamine and tyramine. === Invertebrates === Octopamine binds to its respective G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to initiate a cell signal transduction pathway. At least three groups of octopamine GPCR have been defined. OctαR (OCTOPAMINE1 receptors) are more closely related to α-adrenergic receptors, while OctβR (OCTOPAMINE2 receptors) are more closely related to β-adrenergic receptors. The Octopamine/Tyramine receptors (including Oct-TyrR) can bind both ligands, and display agonist-specific coupling. Oct-TyrR is listed in both OCTOPAMINE and TYRAMINE RECEPTORS gene groups. == Biosynthesis == === In insects === Octopamine acts as the insect equivalent of norepinephrine and has been implicated in regulating aggression in invertebrates, with different effects on different species. Studies have shown that reducing the neurotransmitter octopamine and preventing coding of tyramine β-hydroxylase (an enzyme that converts tyramine to octopamine) decreases aggression in Drosophila without influencing other behaviors. == Chemistry == Octopamine, or para-octopamine, also known as 4,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine derivative. It is related to analogues including phenylethanolamine (β-hydroxyphenethylamine), tyramine (para-tyramine; 4-hydroxyphenethylamine), and norfenefrine (meta-octopamine; 3,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine), among others. == References ==",Norsynephrine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.7034124135971069), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.6240566083070007e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -9.674858301877975e-05), (' FOOD', -0.25197383761405945), (',', -7.517272024415433e-05), (' MED', -0.0003134168218821287), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.33203110098838806), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -0.0009188005933538079), ('ĠEND', -0.3532703220844269), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.011051162146031857), ('ĠFOOD', -0.04642823711037636), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20143915712833405)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0002661039761733264)])","('INFO; ', [])"

2883,"('Hippuric acid', 'N-benzoylglycine', 'Benzoylglycine', 'Glycine, n-benzoyl-', 'Benzamidoacetic acid')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Hippuric acid (Gr. hippos, horse, ouron, urine) is a carboxylic acid and organic compound. It is found in urine and is formed from the combination of benzoic acid and glycine. Levels of hippuric acid rise with the consumption of phenolic compounds (such as in fruit juice, tea and wine). The phenols are first converted to benzoic acid, and then to hippuric acid and excreted in urine. Hippuric acid crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187 °C, and decompose at about 240 °C. High concentrations of hippuric acid may also indicate a toluene intoxication; however, scientists have called this correlation into question because there are other variables that affect levels of hippuric acid. When many aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and toluene are taken internally, they are converted to hippuric acid by reaction with the amino acid, glycine. == Synthesis == A modern synthesis of hippuric acid involves the acylation of glycine with benzoyl chloride (""Schotten–Baumann reaction""). == Physiology == Biochemically, hippuric acid is produced from benzoic acid and glycine, which occurs in the liver, intestine, and kidneys. In terms of mechanism, benzoic acid is converted to benzoyl CoA, an acylating agent. Hippuric acid may be formed from the essential amino acid phenylalanine through at least two pathways. Phenylalanine undergoes biotransformation to form an alpha-keto acid, phenylpyruvic acid, which can tautomerize to a reactive enol. The benzylic carbon is reactive which undergoes peroxidation followed by the competing pathways to either react with the alpha carbon subsequently form an dioxetanol intermediate followed by formation of oxalic acid and benzaldehyde, or, peroxidation can react with the carboxyl group to form an alpha-keto-beta-peroxylactone intermediate followed by formation of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and benzaldehyde. Alternatively, under certain conditions, phenylpyruvic acid may undergo a redox mechanism, such as Iron(II) donating an electron, to directly release carbon dioxide, followed by carbon monoxide, for the formation of a stable toluene radical which is resolved by an antioxidant such as ascorbate. In all of the aforementioned cases, benzaldehyde undergoes biotransformation via CYP450 to benzoic acid followed by conjugation to glycine for formation of hippurate which undergoes urinary excretion. Similarly, toluene reacts with CYP450 to form benzaldehyde. Hippuric acid has been reported to be a marker for Parkinson's disease. == Reactions == Hippuric acid is readily hydrolysed by hot caustic alkalis to benzoic acid and glycine. Nitrous acid converts it into benzoyl glycolic acid, C6H5C(=O)OCH2CO2H. Its ethyl ester reacts with hydrazine to form hippuryl hydrazine, C6H5CONHCH2CONHNH2, which was used by Theodor Curtius for the preparation of hydrazoic acid. Hippuric acid has also been used in Erlenmeyer–Plöchl synthesis of phenylalanine and other amino acids, the reaction proceeding via an oxazolone or ""azlactone"" intermediate. == History == Justus von Liebig showed in 1829 that hippuric acid differed from benzoic acid and he named it, and in 1834 he determined its constitution, while in 1853 French chemist Victor Dessaignes (1800–1885) synthesized it by the action of benzoyl chloride on the zinc salt of glycine. It was also formed by heating benzoic anhydride with glycine, and by heating benzamide with monochloroacetic acid. == See also == para-Aminohippuric acid ortho-Iodohippuric acid Methylhippuric acid (three different isomers) == References ==",N-benzoylglycine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0008488174062222242), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.451116051815916e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.12694668769836426), (' FOOD', -0.00020663968462031335)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.013875687494874), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.60137271147687e-05), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.1603017896413803), ('ĠFOOD', -0.44508129358291626), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3134436011314392)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5151538252830505)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=18089,https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/n-benzoyl-glycine ', [])"
2884,"('Eslicarbazepine acetate', 'Zebinix', 'Aptiom', 'Exalief', 'Stedesa')",Medical,"Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL), sold under the brand names Aptiom and Zebinix among others, is an anticonvulsant medication approved for use in Europe and the United States as monotherapy or as additional therapy for partial-onset seizures epilepsy. Similarly to oxcarbazepine, ESL behaves as a prodrug to (S)-(+)-licarbazepine. As such, their mechanisms of action are identical. == Contraindications == Eslicarbazepine acetate is contraindicated in people with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, a type of heart block, in the Austria-Codex. However heart block is not mentioned as a contraindication by the US FDA. It is contraindicated for people who are hypersensitive to eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine or carbamazepine. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are similar to oxcarbazepine. The most common ones (more than 10% of patients) are tiredness and dizziness. Other fairly common side effects (1 to 10%) include impaired coordination, gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, rash (1.1%), and hyponatremia (low sodium blood levels, 1.2%). There may also be an increased risk of suicidal thoughts. == Overdose == Symptoms of overdosing are similar to adverse effects of standard doses: severe hyponatraemia, somnolence, uncoordinated/unsteady gait, hemiparesis (weakness of one side of the body), along with visual and gastrointestinal disturbances. No specific antidote is available. Eslicarbazepine and metabolites can be dialyzed. == Interactions == Like oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine can reduce plasma levels of drugs that are metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 (verified in studies for simvastatin and the oral contraceptive levonorgestrel/ethinylestradiol) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and increase plasma levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19. Interaction studies have been conducted with a number of common anticonvulsants. Carbamazepine reduces blood plasma concentrations of eslicarbazepine, probably because it induces glucuronidation. This drug combination also increased the risk for diplopia, impaired coordination and dizziness in a clinical study. Phenytoin also reduces eslicarbazepine plasma concentrations, which may be due to increased glucuronidation of eslicarbazepine; and concomitant administration results in an increase in phenytoin serum concentrations, which is probably due to inhibition of CYP2C19. Combinations with lamotrigine, topiramate, valproic acid or levetiracetam showed no significant interactions in studies, although eslicarbazepine has been shown to cause a minor reduction in lamotrigine levels. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The active component, eslicarbazepine, has the same mechanism of action as oxcarbazepine (which is a prodrug for licarbazepine, the racemate of eslicarbazepine) and most likely the closely related carbamazepine. It stabilises the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, allowing for less sodium to enter neural cells, which leaves them less excitable. According to some sources, it has not been shown conclusively that this is the actual mechanism. === Pharmacokinetics === Eslicarbazepine acetate is absorbed to at least 90% from the gut, independently of food intake. It is quickly metabolised to eslicarbazepine, so that the original substance cannot be detected in the bloodstream. Peak plasma levels of eslicarbazepine are reached after 2–3 (1–4) hours, and plasma protein binding is somewhat less than 40%. Biological half-life is 10 to 20 hours, and steady-state concentrations are reached after four to five days after start of the treatment. Oxcarbazepine, for comparison, is also nearly completely absorbed from the gut, and peak plasma concentrations of licarbazepine are reached after 4.5 hours on average after oxcarbazepine intake. Plasma protein binding and half-life are of course the same. Other metabolites of ESL are the less active (R)-(−)-licarbazepine (5%; the stereoisomer of eslicarbazepine), the pharmacologically active oxcarbazepine (1%), and inactive glucuronides of all of these substances. The drug is excreted mainly via the urine, of which two thirds are in the form of eslicarbazepine and one third in the form of eslicarbazepine glucuronide. The other metabolites only account for a few percent of the excreted drug. === Pharmacogenomics === Persons with certain genetic variations in human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are under increased risk of developing skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), but also severe ones such as Stevens–Johnson and DRESS syndrome, under treatment with carbamazepine and drugs with related chemical structures. This is true for the HLA-A*3101 allele, which occurs in 2 to 5% of Europeans and 10% of Japanese people, and the HLA-B*1502 allele, which is mainly found in people of Asian descent. Theoretically, this may also apply to ESL. == Chemistry == As the name suggests, eslicarbazepine acetate is the acetate ester prodrug of eslicarbazepine. Eslicarbazepine itself is the pharmacologically more active of the two stereoisomers of licarbazepine. More specifically, it is (S)-(+)-licarbazepine. Related drugs and active metabolites for comparison == History == Eslicarbazepine acetate was developed by the Portuguese pharmaceutical company Bial. In early 2009, Bial sold the marketing rights in Europe to the Japanese company Eisai. The drug was approved in the European Union in April 2009 under the trade names Zebinix and Exalief, but was marketed only under the first name. In the US it is marketed by Sunovion (formerly Sepracor) and was approved in November 2013. == Research == Studies for the use of ESL as an anticonvulsant for children are under way as of 2016. Like oxcarbazepine, ESL has potential uses for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia and bipolar disorder. A 2015 assessment showed no statistical difference to placebo for the latter disorder. == References == == External links == ""Eslicarbazepine acetate"". Drug Information Portal.

2887,"('Stearic acid', 'Octadecanoic acid', 'Stearophanic acid', 'N-octadecanoic acid', 'Cetylacetic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Stearic acid ( STEER-ik, stee-ARR-ik) is a saturated fatty acid with an 18-carbon chain. The IUPAC name is octadecanoic acid. It is a soft waxy solid with the formula CH3(CH2)16CO2H. The triglyceride derived from three molecules of stearic acid is called stearin. Stearic acid is a prevalent fatty-acid in nature, found in many animal and vegetable fats, but is usually higher in animal fat than vegetable fat. It has a melting point of 69.4 °C (156.9 °F) °C and a pKa of 4.50. Its name comes from the Greek word στέαρ ""stéar"", which means tallow. The salts and esters of stearic acid are called stearates. As its ester, stearic acid is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in nature and in the food supply, following palmitic acid. Dietary sources of stearic acid include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and foods prepared with fats; beef tallow, lard, butterfat, cocoa butter, and shea butter are rich fat sources of stearic acid. == Production == In terms of its biosynthesis, stearic acid is produced from palmitoyl-CoA, with malonyl-CoA a two-carbon building block (after decarboxylation). Stearic acid is obtained from fats and oils by the saponification of the triglycerides using hot water (about 100 °C). The resulting mixture is then distilled. Commercial stearic acid is often a mixture of stearic and palmitic acids, although purified stearic acid is available. Commercially, oleic acid, as found in palm and soy, can be hydrogenated to give stearic acid. == Uses and occurrence == In general, the applications of stearic acid exploit its bifunctional character, with a polar head group that can be attached to metal cations and a nonpolar chain that confers solubility in organic solvents. The combination leads to uses as a surfactant and softening agent. Stearic acid undergoes the typical reactions of saturated carboxylic acids, a notable one being reduction to stearyl alcohol, and esterification with a range of alcohols. This is used in a large range of manufactures, from simple to complex electronic devices. === Food === Of the saturated fatty acids consumed in the United States, stearic acid consumption is second (26% of total saturated fatty acid intake) to palmitic acid (56% of total saturated fatty acid intake). Stearic acid is more abundant in animal fat (up to 33% in beef liver: 739 ) than in vegetable fat (typically less than 5%). The important exceptions are the foods cocoa butter (34%) and shea butter, where the stearic acid content (as a triglyceride) is 28–45%. Examples of the use of stearic acid in food manufacturing include baked goods, frozen dairy products, gelatins, puddings, hard candy, and nonalcoholic beverages. Stearic acid (E number E570) is found in some foods. === Soaps and cosmetics === Stearic acid is mainly used in the production of detergents, soaps, and cosmetics such as shampoos and shaving cream products. Stearate soap, such as sodium stearate, could be made from stearic acid but instead are usually produced by saponification of stearic acid-containing triglycerides. Esters of stearic acid with ethylene glycol (glycol stearate and glycol distearate) are used to produce a pearly effect in shampoos, soaps, and other cosmetic products. === Lubricants, softening and release agents === In view of the soft texture of the sodium salt, which is the main component of soap, other salts are also useful for their lubricating properties. Lithium stearate is an important component of grease. The stearate salts of zinc, calcium, cadmium, and lead are used as heat stabilizers for PVC. Stearic acid is used along with castor oil for preparing softeners in textile sizing. They are heated and mixed with caustic potash or caustic soda. Related salts are also commonly used as release agents, e.g. in the production of automobile tires. As an example, it can be used to make castings from a plaster piece mold or waste mold, and to make a mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered stearic acid is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form a thin layer of calcium stearate, which functions as a release agent. Steric acid can be converted to zinc stearate, which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning. Stearic acid is a common lubricant during injection molding and pressing of ceramic powders. === Niche uses === Being inexpensive, nontoxic, and fairly inert, stearic acid finds many niche applications. Varied examples of stearic acid use in manufacturing include soaps and greases, household soap products, synthetic rubber, cosmetic and pharmaceutical creams and lotions, candles, phonograph records, lubricants, shoe and metal polishes, food packaging, and rubber compounds. Stearic acid is used as a negative plate additive in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries. It is added at the rate of 0.6 g per kg of the oxide while preparing the paste. It is believed to enhance the hydrophobicity of the negative plate, particularly during dry-charging process. It also reduces the extension of oxidation of the freshly formed lead (negative active material) when the plates are kept for drying in the open atmosphere after the process of tank formation. As a consequence, the charging time of a dry uncharged battery during initial filling and charging (IFC) is comparatively lower, as compared to a battery assembled with plates which do not contain stearic acid additive. Fatty acids are classic components of candle-making. Stearic acid is used along with simple sugar or corn syrup as a hardener in candies. == Metabolism == An isotope labeling study in humans concluded that the fraction of dietary stearic acid that oxidatively desaturates to oleic acid is 2.4 times higher than the fraction of palmitic acid analogously converted to palmitoleic acid. Also, stearic acid is less likely to be incorporated into cholesterol esters. In epidemiologic and clinical studies, stearic acid was found to be associated with lowered LDL cholesterol in comparison with other saturated fatty acids. === Examples === Salts Potassium stearate Calcium stearate Cobaltous stearate Lithium stearate Magnesium stearate Mercuric stearate Sodium stearate Zinc stearate Esters Estradiol stearate Glycol stearate Stearin Testosterone stearate == References == == External links == NIST Chemistry WebBook Entry",Cetylacetic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.07712359726428986), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.06322963535785675), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -2.7848862373502925e-05), (' INDUSTR', -3.523948907968588e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.05429467186331749), ('OD', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.0010570659069344401), ('ĠPERSON', -0.0797857716679573), ('AL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('ĠCARE', -9.655486064730212e-05), (',', -0.062115058302879333), ('ĠINDU', -0.00039498155820183456), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -2.145764938177308e-06), ('AL', -6.9141146923357155e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04273734986782074)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -5.9153885558771435e-06)])","('INFO;https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/CETYLACETIC%20ACID ', [])"

It has an in vitro inhibitory concentration (IC50) of around 5 nM, making it a more potent inhibitor than LY294002, another commonly used PI3K inhibitor. It displays a similar potency in vitro for the class I, II, and III PI3K members although it can also inhibit other PI3K-related enzymes such as mTOR, DNA-PKcs, some phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) at high concentrations Wortmannin has also been reported to inhibit members of the polo-like kinase family with IC50 in the same range as for PI3K. The half-life of wortmannin in tissue culture is about 10 minutes due to the presence of the highly reactive C20 carbon that is also responsible for its ability to covalently inactivate PI3K. Wortmannin is a commonly used cell biology reagent that has been used previously in research to inhibit DNA repair, receptor-mediated endocytosis and cell proliferation. == Phosphoinositide-3-kinase == Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) activates an important cell survival signaling pathway, and constitutive activation is seen in ovarian, head and neck, urinary tract, cervical and small cell lung cancer. PI3K signaling is attenuated by the phosphatase activity of the tumor suppressor PTEN that is absent in a number of human cancers. Inhibiting PI3K presents the opportunity to inhibit a major cancer cell survival signaling pathway and to overcome the action of an important deleted tumor suppressor, providing antitumor activity and increased tumor sensitivity to a wide variety of drugs. Wortmannin is a PI3K inhibitor; as such, it has detrimental influence on memory and impairs spatial learning abilities. == Derivatives == Medicinal chemistry research has been conducted to identify wortmannin derivatives that are more stable, while not losing its therapeutic effect. === Sonolisib === One of these, sonolisib (PX-866), has been shown to be an irreversible inhibitor of PI-3 kinase with efficacy when delivered orally.

2889,"('Tryptophan', '(¬±)-tryptophan', 'Racemic tryptophan', 'Trytophane', 'Trytophan')","Food, Medical","Tryptophan (symbol Trp or W) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG. Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (–NH+3; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( –COO−; pKa = 2.38). Humans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid. Tryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter. == Function == Amino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in ""anchoring"" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds: Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase. Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes. Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids. Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan. The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression. In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell's tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels. == Recommended dietary allowance == In 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5 mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over. === Dietary sources === Tryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry. == Medical use == === Depression === Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that ""the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive"" and note that ""because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present"". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence. === Insomnia === The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness. == Side effects == Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). == Interactions == Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known. == Isolation == The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4–8 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein. == Biosynthesis and industrial production == As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine. The industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase. == Society and culture == === Showa Denko contamination scandal === There was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit. Subsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer. The FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005. The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for ""close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products"". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech. === Turkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis === A common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meat—as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmas—results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatonin—which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythm—by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that ""feast-induced drowsiness""—or postprandial somnolence—may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep. == Research == === Yeast amino acid metabolism === In 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol. === Serotonin precursor === Tryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness. === Psychedelic effects === Tryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. Tryptophan is converted into the trace amine tryptamine and tryptamine is N-methylated by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) into N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), which are known serotonergic psychedelics. === Fluorescence === Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of the microenvironment around the tryptophan residue. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues. == See also == 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) α-Methyltryptophan Acree–Rosenheim reaction Adamkiewicz reaction Attenuator (genetics) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine Hopkins–Cole reaction Serotonin Tryptamine == References == == Further reading == == External links ==",Tryptophan,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.06908516585826874), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.18727555871009827), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -2.610649426060263e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.06324043869972229), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.311301275563892e-06), (',', -0.006724703591316938), ('ĠMED', -0.0041467878036201), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004109866451472044)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -2.15310683415737e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=95, start_index=15, title='Tryptophan', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryptophan?utm_source=openai')])"
2890,"('H-d-trp-oh', 'Tryptophan', 'Dtryptophan', '(r)-tryptophan', 'Tryptophane')","Food, Medical","Tryptophan (symbol Trp or W) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG. Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (–NH+3; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( –COO−; pKa = 2.38). Humans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid. Tryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter. == Function == Amino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in ""anchoring"" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds: Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase. Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes. Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids. Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan. The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression. In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell's tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels. == Recommended dietary allowance == In 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5 mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over. === Dietary sources === Tryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry. == Medical use == === Depression === Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that ""the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive"" and note that ""because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present"". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence. === Insomnia === The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness. == Side effects == Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). == Interactions == Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known. == Isolation == The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4–8 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein. == Biosynthesis and industrial production == As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine. The industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase. == Society and culture == === Showa Denko contamination scandal === There was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit. Subsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer. The FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005. The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for ""close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products"". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech. === Turkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis === A common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meat—as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmas—results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatonin—which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythm—by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that ""feast-induced drowsiness""—or postprandial somnolence—may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep. == Research == === Yeast amino acid metabolism === In 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol. === Serotonin precursor === Tryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness. === Psychedelic effects === Tryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. Tryptophan is converted into the trace amine tryptamine and tryptamine is N-methylated by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) into N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), which are known serotonergic psychedelics. === Fluorescence === Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of the microenvironment around the tryptophan residue. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues. == See also == 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) α-Methyltryptophan Acree–Rosenheim reaction Adamkiewicz reaction Attenuator (genetics) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine Hopkins–Cole reaction Serotonin Tryptamine == References == == Further reading == == External links ==",Tryptophane,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.7186081409454346), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' FOOD', -0.008624859154224396), (',', -0.02325398102402687), (' MED', -0.04537924751639366), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.1481074094772339), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -4.029192859889008e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.06324245035648346), ('OG', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.023259539157152176), ('ĠMED', -0.00583480903878808), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00675099017098546)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4737446/,https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/tryptophan/ ', [])"

2892,"('Azilsartan medoxomil',)",Medical,"Azilsartan, sold under the brand name Edarbi among others, is used for the treatment of hypertension. It is used as the prodrug azilsartan medoxomil, is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and was developed by Takeda. The most common adverse reaction in adults is diarrhea. It is available as a generic medication. It is also sold as a combination drug with chlortalidone under the brand name Edarbyclor. == Medical uses == Azilsartan is used for the treatment of hypertension in adults. One of the benefits of the medication is that Azilsartan does not need dose adjustments for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. == Contraindications == Azilsartan must not be used with aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, in patients with diabetes as this increases the risk of serious adverse effects. Like other antihypertensive drugs acting on the renin–angiotensin system, it is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. It should not be used during pregnancy. == Interactions == No relevant drug interactions have been found in studies. Based on experiences with other drugs acting on the renin–angiotensin system, it is theorized that azilsartan could increase the toxicity of lithium and of other drugs increasing potassium levels, such as potassium sparing diuretics. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Azilsartan medoxomil lowers blood pressure by blocking the action of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, a hormone that contracts blood vessels and reduces water excretion through the kidneys. === Pharmacokinetics === Azilsartan medoxomil is quickly absorbed from the gut, independently of food intake. Maximal blood plasma concentrations are reached after one to three hours. The liver enzyme CYP2C9 is involved in the formation of the two main metabolites, which are pharmacologically inactive; they are the O-deethylation and decarboxylation products of azilsartan. Elimination half life is about 11 hours. 55% are excreted via the feces, and 42% via the urine, of which 15% are present as azilsartan and the rest in form of the metabolites. == Chemistry == The drug formulation contains the potassium salt of azilsartan medoxomil (codenamed TAK-491), an ester of azilsartan's carboxyl group with the alcohol (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-yl)methanol. This ester is more lipophilic than azilsartan itself. == History == In February 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved azilsartan medoxomil for the treatment of high blood pressure in adults. In July 2011, azilsartan medoxomil was approved in the European Union for the treatment of essential hypertension. In March 2012, Health Canada approved the drug for mild to moderate essential hypertension. In December 2014, Valeant Canada acquired the marketing rights to Edarbi and Edarbyclor from Takeda Pharmaceutical. == References ==",Azilsartan medoxomil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.638440416078083e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007295330869965255)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/azilsartan-medoxomil.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Azilsartan: Side Effects, Dosage & Uses - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/azilsartan-medoxomil.html?utm_source=openai')])"
2893,"('Tacrolimus (monohydrate)', 'Fujimycin (monohydrate)', 'Tacrolimus', 'Fujimycin', 'Prograf')",Medical,"Tacrolimus, sold under the brand name Prograf among others, is an immunosuppressive drug. After allogenic organ transplant, the risk of organ rejection is moderate. To lower the risk of organ rejection, tacrolimus is given. The drug can also be sold as a topical medication in the treatment of T cell-mediated diseases such as eczema and psoriasis. For example, it is prescribed for severe refractory uveitis after a bone marrow transplant, exacerbations of minimal change disease, Kimura's disease, and vitiligo. It can be used to treat dry eye syndrome in cats and dogs. Tacrolimus inhibits calcineurin, which is involved in the production of interleukin-2, a molecule that promotes the development and proliferation of T cells, as part of the body's learned (or adaptive) immune response. Chemically, it is a macrolide lactone that was first discovered in 1987, from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the bacterium Streptomyces tsukubensis. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2021, it was the 296th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Organ transplantation === It has similar immunosuppressive properties to ciclosporin, but is much more potent. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with ciclosporin-based immunosuppression (30.7% vs 46.4%) in one study. Clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin during the first year of liver transplantation. Long-term outcome has not been improved to the same extent. Tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids, mycophenolate, and IL-2 receptor inhibitors such as basiliximab. Dosages are titrated to target blood levels at specific times after medication administration. === Skin === As an ointment, tacrolimus is used in the treatment of dermatitis (eczema), in particular atopic dermatitis, if topical corticosteroids and moisturisers fail in helping. It suppresses inflammation in a similar way to steroids, and is equally as effective as a mid-potency steroid. An important advantage of tacrolimus is that, unlike steroids, it does not cause skin thinning (atrophy), or other steroid related side effects. It is applied on the active lesions until they heal off, but may also be used continuously in low doses (twice a week), and applied to the thinner skin over the face and eyelids. Clinical trials of up to one year have been conducted. Recently it has also been used to treat segmental vitiligo in children, especially in areas on the face. === Eyes === Tacrolimus solution, as drops, is sometimes prescribed by veterinarians for keratoconjunctivitis, and other dry eye maladies, in the eyes of domestic cats, dogs, and horses. It has been studied for use in human eyes. == Contraindications and precautions == Contraindications and precautions include: Hepatic disease Immunosuppression Infants Infection Neoplastic disease, such as: Skin cancer Lung cancer Oliguria Pregnancy QT interval prolongation Sunlight (UV) exposure Grapefruit juice === Topical use === Occlusive dressing Known or suspected malignant lesions Netherton's syndrome or similar skin diseases Certain skin infections == Side effects == === By mouth or intravenous use === Side effects can be severe and include infection, cardiac damage, hypertension, blurred vision, liver and kidney problems (tacrolimus nephrotoxicity), hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, itching, lung damage (sirolimus also causes lung damage), and various neuropsychiatric problems such as loss of appetite, insomnia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, confusion, weakness, depression, vivid nightmares, cramps, neuropathy, seizures, tremors, and catatonia. In addition, it may potentially increase the severity of existing fungal or infectious conditions such as herpes zoster or polyoma viral infections. ==== Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis ==== In people receiving immunosuppressants to reduce transplant graft rejection, an increased risk of malignancy (cancer) is a recognised complication. The most common cancers are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and skin cancers. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of treatment. === Topical use === The most common adverse events associated with the use of topical tacrolimus ointments, especially if used over a wide area, include a burning or itching sensation on the initial applications, with increased sensitivity to sunlight and heat on the affected areas. Less common are flu-like symptoms, headache, cough, and burning eyes. ==== Cancer risks ==== Tacrolimus and a related drug for eczema (pimecrolimus) were suspected of carrying a cancer risk, though the matter is still a subject of controversy. The FDA issued a health warning in March 2005 for the drug, based on animal models and a small number of patients. Until further human studies yield more conclusive results, the FDA recommends that users be advised of the potential risks. However, current practice by UK dermatologists is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of these new drugs. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health concluded with moderate-certainty evidence that the two drugs were not associated with any increased risk of cancer. == Interactions == Also like cyclosporin, it has a wide range of interactions. Tacrolimus is primarily metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system of liver enzymes, and there are many substances that interact with this system and induce or inhibit the system's metabolic activity. Interactions include that with grapefruit which increases tacrolimus plasma concentrations. As infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the post-transplant patient, the most commonly reported interactions include interactions with anti-microbial drugs. Macrolide antibiotics including erythromycin and clarithromycin, as well as several of the newer classes of antifungals, especially of the azole class (fluconazole, voriconazole), increase tacrolimus levels by competing for cytochrome enzymes. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tacrolimus is a macrolide calcineurin inhibitor. In T cells, activation of the T cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium, which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin. Calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), which moves to the nucleus of the T cell and increases the activity of genes coding for IL-2 and related cytokines. Tacrolimus prevents the dephosphorylation of NF-AT. In detail, tacrolimus reduces peptidylprolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP12 (FK506 binding protein), creating a new complex. This FKBP12–FK506 complex interacts with and inhibits calcineurin, thus inhibiting both T lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription. Although this activity is similar to that of cyclosporin, the incidence of acute rejection is reduced by tacrolimus use over cyclosporin use. Although short-term immunosuppression concerning patient and graft survival is found to be similar between the two drugs, tacrolimus results in a more favorable lipid profile, and this may have important long-term implications given the prognostic influence of rejection on graft survival. === Pharmacokinetics === Oral tacrolimus is slowly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with a total bioavailability of 20 to 25% (but with variations from 5 to 67%) and highest blood plasma concentrations (Cmax) reached after one to three hours. Taking the drug together with a meal, especially one rich in fat, slows down resorption and reduces bioavailability. In the blood, tacrolimus is mainly bound to erythrocytes; only 5% are found in the plasma, of which more than 98.8% are bound to plasma proteins. The substance is metabolized in the liver, mainly via CYP3A, and in the intestinal wall. All metabolites found in the circulation are inactive. Biological half-life varies widely and seems to be higher for healthy persons (43 hours on average) than for patients with liver transplants (12 hours) or kidney transplants (16 hours), due to differences in clearance. Tacrolimus is predominantly eliminated via the faeces in form of its metabolites. When applied locally on eczema, tacrolimus has little to no bioavailability. === Pharmacogenetics === The predominant enzyme responsible for metabolism of tacrolimus is CYP3A5. Genetic variations within CYP3A5 that result in changes to the activity of the CYP3A5 protein can affect concentrations of tacrolimus within the body. In particular, individuals who are homozygous for the G allele at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs776746 (also known as CYP3A5 *3/*3) have a non-functional CYP3A5 protein. The frequency of the G allele varies worldwide, from 4% in some African populations to 80–90% in Caucasian populations. Across a large number of studies, individuals homozygous for the G allele have been shown to have higher concentrations of tacrolimus and require lower doses of the drug, as compared to individuals who are not homozygous for the G allele. Achieving target concentrations of tacrolimus is important – if levels are too low, then there is a risk of transplant rejection, if levels are too high, there is a risk of drug toxicities. There is evidence to suggest that dosing patients based on rs776746 genotype can result in faster and more frequent achievement of target tacrolimus levels. However, there is a lack of consistent evidence as to whether dosing based on rs776746 genotype results in improved clinical outcomes (such as a decreased risk for transplant rejection or drug toxicities), likely because patients taking tacrolimus are subject to therapeutic drug monitoring. Studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms of genes other than CYP3A5, such as NR1I2 (encoding PXR), also significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus. == History == Tacrolimus was discovered in 1987; it was among the first macrolide immunosuppressants discovered, preceded by the discovery of rapamycin (sirolimus) on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in 1975. It is produced by a soil bacterium, Streptomyces tsukubensis. The name tacrolimus is derived from ""Tsukuba macrolide immunosuppressant"". The early development (investigational new drug phase) of tacrolimus, called at the time by the development code FK-506, happened in the next several years. A firsthand account of that process is given in Thomas Starzl's 1992 memoir. Tacrolimus was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994, for use in liver transplantation; the indications were extended to include kidney transplants. Generic versions of tacrolimus were approved in the US in 2017. Tacrolimus was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2002, for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In 2007, the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults. In 2009, the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric, kidney, liver or heart allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults and children. == Available forms == A branded version of the drug is owned by Astellas Pharma, and is sold under the brand name Prograf, given twice daily. A number of other manufacturers hold marketing authorisation for alternative brands of the twice-daily formulation. Once-daily formulations with marketing authorisation include Advagraf (Astellas Pharma) and Envarsus (marketed as Envarsus XR in US by Veloxis Pharmaceuticals and marketed in Europe by Chiesi). These formulations are intended to reduce pharmacokinetic variation in blood levels and facilitate compliance with dosing. The topical formulation is marketed by LEO Pharma under the name Protopic. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of tacrolimus is hybrid synthesis of both type 1 polyketide synthases (PKS 1) and nonribosomal peptide syntheses (NRPS). The research shows the hybrid synthesis consists of ten modules of type 1 polyketide synthase and one module of nonribosomal peptide synthase. The synthetic enzymes for tacrolimus are found in 19 gene clusters named fkb. The 19 genes are fkbQ, fkbN, fkbM, fkbD, fkbA, fkbP, fkbO, fkbB, fkbC, fkbL, fkbK, fkbJ, fkbI, fkbH, fkbG, allD, allR, allK and allA. There are several possible ways of biosynthesis of tacrolimus. The fundamental units for biosynthesis are following: one molecule of 4,5-dihydroxycyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid (DHCHC) as a starter unit, four molecules of malonyl-CoA, five molecules of methylmalonyl-CoA, one molecule of allylmalonyl-CoA as elongation units. However, two molecules of malonyl-CoA are able to be replaced by two molecules of methoxymalonyl CoA. Once two malonyl-CoA molecules are replaced, post-synthase tailoring steps are no longer required where two methoxymalonyl CoA molecules are substituted. The biosynthesis of methoxymalonyl CoA to Acyl Carrier protein is proceeded by five enzymes (fkbG, fkbH, fkbI, fkbJ, and fkbK). Allylmalonyl-CoA is also able to be replaced by propionylmalonyl-CoA. The starter unit, DHCHC from the chorismic acid is formed by fkbO enzyme and loaded onto CoA-ligase domain (CoL). Then, it proceeds to NADPH dependent reduction(ER). Three enzymes, fkbA,B,C enforce processes from the loading module to the module 10, the last step of PKS 1. fkbB enzyme is responsible of allylmalonyl-CoA synthesis or possibly propionylmalonyl-CoA at C21, which it is an unusual step of general PKS 1. As mentioned, if two methoxymalonyl CoA molecules are substituted for two malonyl-CoA molecules, they will take place in module 7 and 8 (C13 and C15), and fkbA enzyme will enforce this process. After the last step (module 10) of PKS 1, one molecule of L-pipecolic acid formed from L-lysine and catalyzed through fkbL enzyme synthesizes with the molecule from the module 10. The process of L-pipecolic acid synthesis is NRPS enforced by fkbP enzyme. After synthesizing the entire subunits, the molecule is cyclized. After the cyclization, the pre-tacrolimus molecule goes through the post-synthase tailoring steps such as oxidation and S-adenosyl methionine. Particularly fkbM enzyme is responsible of alcohol methylation targeting the alcohol of DHCHC starter unit (Carbon number 31 depicted in brown), and fkbD enzyme is responsible of C9 (depicted in green). After these tailoring steps, the tacrolimus molecule becomes biologically active. == Research == === Lupus nephritis === Tacrolimus has been shown to reduce the risk of serious infections while also increasing remission of kidney function in lupus nephritis. === Ulcerative colitis === Tacrolimus has been used to suppress the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis (UC), a form of inflammatory bowel disease. Although almost exclusively used in trial cases only, tacrolimus has shown to be significantly effective in the suppression of flares of UC. A 2022 updated Cochrane systematic review found that tacrolimus may be superior to placebo in achieving remission and improvement in UC. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Tacrolimus Injection"".

2894,"('Didox', 'N,3,4-trihydroxybenzamide', 'Benzamide, n,3,4-trihydroxy-', 'Vf 147', 'Benzamide,3,4-trihydroxy-')",Medical," While IgE is considered the primary mediator of mast cell activation, IL-33 contributes substantially in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. To develop effective treatments for allergic disease, it is important to understand the role of therapeutic agents on IL-33 activation. We examined the effect of Didox (3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid), an antioxidant and ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) inhibitor, on IL-33-mediated mast cell activation. Didox suppressed IL-6, IL-13, TNF, and MIP-1α (CCL3) production in bone marrow derived mast cells following IL-33 activation. This suppression was observed in different genetic backgrounds and extended to peritoneal mast cells. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine mimicked the suppression of Didox, albeit at a much higher dose, while the RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea had no effect. Didox substantially suppressed IL-33-mediated NFκB and AP-1 transcriptional activities. These results suggest that Didox attenuates IL-33-induced mast cell activation and should be further studied as a potential therapeutic agent for inflammatory diseases involving IL-33. Mast cell activation via the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) elicits production of inflammatory mediators central to allergic disease. As a synthetic antioxidant and a potent ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) inhibitor, Didox (3,4-dihyroxybenzohydroxamic acid) has been tested in clinical trials for cancer and is an attractive therapeutic for inflammatory disease. We found that Didox treatment of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) reduced IgE-stimulated degranulation and cytokine production, including IL-6, IL-13, TNF and MIP-1a (CCL3). These effects were consistent using BMMC of different genetic backgrounds and peritoneal mast cells. While the RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea had little or no effect on IgE-mediated function, high concentrations of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine mimicked Didox-mediated suppression. Furthermore, Didox increased expression of the antioxidant genes superoxide dismutase and catalase, and suppressed DCFH-DA fluorescence, indicating reduced reactive oxygen species production. Didox effects were not due to changes in FcεRI expression or cell viability, suggesting it inhibits signaling required for inflammatory cytokine production. In support of this, we found that Didox reduced FcεRI-mediated AP-1 and NFκB transcriptional activity. Finally, Didox suppressed mast cell-dependent, IgE-mediated passive systemic anaphylaxis in vivo. These data demonstrate the potential use for Didox asa means of antagonizing mast cell responses in allergic disease. Didox (3,4-dihydroxy-benzohydroxamic acid), is a synthetic ribonucleotide reductase (RR) inhibitor derived from polyhydroxy-substituted benzohydroxamic acid, and originally developed as an anti-cancer agent. Some studies indicate that didox may have anti-oxidative stress-like properties, while other studies hint that didox may have anti-inflammatory properties. Using nitric oxide production in response to LPS treatment as a sensitive screening assay for anti-inflammatory compounds, we show that didox is very potent at levels as low as 6.25 μM, with maximal inhibition at 100 μM. A qRT-PCR array was then employed to screen didox for other potential anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress-related properties. Didox was very potent in suppressing the expression of these arrayed mRNA in response to LPS, and in some cases didox alone suppressed expression. Using qRT-PCR as a follow up to the array, we demonstrated that didox suppresses LPS-induced mRNA levels of iNOS, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, NF-κβ (p65), and p38-α, after 24h of treatment. Treatment with didox also suppresses the secretion of nitric oxide, IL-6, and IL-10. Furthermore, oxidative stress, as quantified by intracellular ROS levels in response to macrophage activators LPS and phorbol ester (PMA), and the glutathione depleting agent BSO, is reduced by treatment with didox. Moreover, we demonstrate that nuclear translocation of NF-κβ (p65) in response to LPS is inhibited by didox. These findings were supported by qRT-PCR for oxidative stress genes SOD1 and catalase. Overall, this study supports the conclusion that didox may have a future role in managing acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and oxidative stress due to high production of ROS.",Didox,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -3.2855416066013277e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.20146548748016357), (' INDUSTR', -3.650518920039758e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.009783769026398659), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2519773244857788)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([medchemexpress.com](https://www.medchemexpress.com/Didox.html?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28964543/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=177, start_index=6, title='Didox (NSC-324360) | DNA/RNA Synthesis 阻害剤 | MedChemExpress', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medchemexpress.com/Didox.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=177, start_index=6, title='Didox (3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid) suppresses IgE-mediated mast cell activation through attenuation of NFκB and AP-1 transcription', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28964543/?utm_source=openai')])"

The ABC subtype is associated with worse prognosis than the GCB subtype using currently available therapies such as combination treatment with rituximab plus standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. The B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway is activated in ABC DLBCL, suggesting that inhibition of this pathway could provide an alternative strategy for treatment. Naquotinib is an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) originally designed to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). As sequence alignment analysis indicates that irreversible EGFR-TKIs also inhibit Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), here, we characterized the inhibitory effects of naquotinib against BTK in comparison to ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, tirabrutinib and spebrutinib. Naquotinib inhibited BTK kinase activity with similar potency to that for EGFR activating mutations. In vivo, naquotinib induced tumor regression and suppressed tumor recurrence in TMD8 and OCI-Ly10, ABC DLBCL cell line xenograft models, at a lower dose than the clinically relevant dose. Compared to other BTK inhibitors, naquotinib showed faster onset and comparable inhibition of BTK following incubation with cell lines for 3 and 20 h. In addition, naquotinib showed longer continuous inhibition of BTK following removal of the compound, lasting for at least 26 h after removal. Pharmacokinetics studies in the TMD8 xenograft model showed higher concentration and slower elimination of naquotinib in tumors than other BTK inhibitors. These data suggest that naquotinib may have therapeutic potential in ABC DLBCL patients. As a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), osimeritnib is the standard treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring the EGFR T790M mutation; however, acquired resistance inevitably develops. Therefore, a next-generation treatment strategy is warranted in the osimertinib era. We investigated the mechanism of resistance to a novel EGFR-TKI, naquotinib, with the goal of developing a novel treatment strategy. We established multiple naquotinib-resistant cell lines or osimertinib-resistant cells, two of which were derived from EGFR-TKI-naïve cells; the others were derived from gefitinib- or afatinib-resistant cells harboring EGFR T790M. We comprehensively analyzed the RNA kinome sequence, but no universal gene alterations were detected in naquotinib-resistant cells. Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) amplification was detected in naquotinib-resistant cells derived from gefitinib-resistant cells. The combination therapy of MEK inhibitors and naquotinib exhibited a highly beneficial effect in resistant cells with NRAS amplification, but the combination of MEK inhibitors and osimertinib had limited effects on naquotinib-resistant cells. Moreover, the combination of MEK inhibitors and naquotinib inhibited the growth of osimertinib-resistant cells, while the combination of MEK inhibitors and osimertinib had little effect on osimertinib-resistant cells. Clinical assessment of this novel combination (MEK inhibitors and naquotinib) is worth considering in osimertinib-resistant lung tumors. First- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are effective clinical therapies for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR-activating mutations. However, almost all patients develop resistance to these drugs. The EGFR T790M mutation of EGFR is the most predominant mechanism for resistance. In addition, activation of AXL signaling is one of the suggested alternative bypassing pathways for resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Here, we report that naquotinib, a pyrazine carboxamide-based EGFR-TKI, inhibited EGFR with activating mutations, as well as T790M resistance mutation while sparing wild-type (WT) EGFR.

2900,"('Picaridin', 'Lcaridin', 'Icaridin', 'Pikaridin', 'Propidine')",Medical,"Icaridin, also known as picaridin, is an insect repellent which can be used directly on skin or clothing. It has broad efficacy against various arthropods such as mosquitos, ticks, gnats, flies and fleas, and is almost colorless and odorless. A study performed in 2010 showed that picaridin spray and cream at the 20% concentration provided 12 hours of protection against ticks. Unlike DEET, icaridin does not dissolve plastics, synthetics or sealants, is odorless and non-greasy and presents a lower risk of toxicity when used with sunscreen, as it may reduce skin absorption of both compounds. The name picaridin was proposed as an International Nonproprietary Name (INN) to the World Health Organization (WHO), but the official name that has been approved by the WHO is icaridin. The chemical is part of the piperidine family, along with many pharmaceuticals and alkaloids such as piperine, which gives black pepper its spicy taste. Trade names include Bayrepel and Saltidin among others. The compound was developed by the German chemical company Bayer in the 1980s and was given the name Bayrepel. In 2005, Lanxess AG and its subsidiary Saltigo GmbH were spun off from Bayer and the product was renamed Saltidin in 2008. Having been sold in Europe (where it is the best-selling insect repellent) since 1998, on 23 July 2020, icaridin was approved again by the EU Commission for use in repellent products. The approval entered into force on 1 February 2022 and is valid for ten years. == Effectiveness == Icaridin and DEET are the most effective insect repellents available. A 2018 systematic review found no consistent performance difference between icaridin and DEET in field studies and concluded that they are equally preferred mosquito repellents, noting that 50% DEET offers longer protection but is not available in some countries. Icaridin has been reported to be as effective as DEET at a 20% concentration without the irritation associated with DEET. According to the WHO, icaridin “demonstrates excellent repellent properties comparable to, and often superior to, those of the standard DEET.” Icaridin-based products have been evaluated by Consumer Reports in 2016 as among the most effective insect repellents when used at a 20% concentration. Icaridin was earlier reported to be effective by Consumer Reports (7% solution) and the Australian Army (20% solution). Consumer Reports retests in 2006 gave as result that a 7% solution of icaridin offered little or no protection against Aedes mosquitoes (vector of dengue fever) and a protection time of about 2.5 hours against Culex (vector of West Nile virus), while a 15% solution was good for about one hour against Aedes and 4.8 hours against Culex. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using repellents based on icaridin, DEET, ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (containing p-menthane-3,8-diol, PMD) for effective protection against mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis and other illnesses. == Adverse effects == Icaridin can cause mild to moderate eye irritation on contact and is slightly toxic if ingested. == Environmental impact == A 2018 study found that a commercial repellent product containing 20% icaridin, in what the authors described as ""conservative exposure doses"", is highly toxic to larval salamanders, a major predator of mosquito larvae. The study observed high larval salamander mortality occurring delayed after the four days of exposure. Because the widely used LC50 test for assessing a chemical's environmental toxicity is based on mortality within four days, the authors suggested that icaridin would be incorrectly deemed as ""safe"" under the test protocol. However, icaridin was also non-toxic in a 21-day reproduction test on the water flea Daphnia magna and a 32-day early life-stage test in zebrafish. Since only the icaridin content of the tested repellent product is known, the observed effects cannot be readily attributed to icaridin. Furthermore, the effects of the repellent product showed no dose-response relationship, i.e., there was neither an increase of the magnitude or severity of the observed effects (mortality, tail deformation), nor did the effects occur at earlier time points. The study has been regarded as invalid by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, which has evaluated icaridin prior to its approval under the EU Biocidal Product Regulation. The reasons for rejection were the testing of a mixture of undisclosed composition, the use of a non-standard test organism, the lack of analytical verification of actual test concentrations, and the fact that the test solution was never renewed with the 25 days of study duration. == Mechanism of action == In 2014, a potential odorant receptor for icaridin (and DEET), CquiOR136•CquiOrco, was suggested for Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito. Recent crystal and solution studies showed that icaridin binds to Anopheles gambiae odorant binding protein 1 (AgamOBP1). The crystal structure of AgamOBP1•icaridin complex (PDB: 5EL2) revealed that icaridin binds to the DEET-binding site in two distinct orientations and also to a second binding site (sIC-binding site) located at the C-terminal region of the AgamOBP1. Research on Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes suggests icaridin does not strongly activate their olfactory receptor neurons, but instead reduces the volatility of the odorants with which it is mixed. By reducing their volatility, icaridin effectively ""masks"" odorants attractive to mosquitoes on the skin, preventing them from reaching the olfactory receptors to some extent. == Chemistry == Icaridin contains two stereocenters: one where the hydroxyethyl chain attaches to the ring, and one where the sec-butyl attaches to the oxygen of the carbamate. The commercial material contains a mixture of all four stereoisomers. == Commercial products == Commercial products containing icaridin include Cutter Advanced, Muskol, Repeltec, Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus, Sawyer Picaridin Insect Repellent, Off!

Strategically regulating MV release may increase drug retention within cancer cells and allow for lower doses of chemotherapeutic drugs. The contribution of exosomes to drug retention still remains unknown. Potential exosome and MV (EMV) biogenesis inhibitors, tested on human prostate cancer (PC3) cells for their capacity to inhibit EMV release, were also tested on PC3 and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cells for improving chemotherapy. Agents inhibiting EMV release most significantly, whilst maintaining cell viability, were chloramidine (Cl-amidine; 50 µM) and bisindolylmaleimide-I (10 µM). Apoptosis mediated by the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was significantly enhanced in PC3 cells in the presence of both these EMV inhibitors, resulting in a 62% (Cl-amidine + 5-FU) and 59% (bisindolylmaleimide-I + 5-FU) decrease in numbers of viable PC3 cells compared to 5-FU alone after 24 h. For MCF-7 cells, there were similar increased reductions of viable cells compared to 5-FU treatment alone ranging from 67% (Cl-amidine + 5-FU) to 58% (bisindolylmaleimide-I + 5-FU). Using combinatory treatment, the two EMV inhibitors further reduced the number of viable cancer cells tested. Neither inhibitor affected cell viability. Combining selected EMV inhibitors may pose as a novel strategy to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug-mediated apoptosis. Bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM-I) is a competitive pan protein kinase C inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and anti-metastatic properties, suggested to treat inflammatory diseases and various cancer entities. However, despite its therapeutic potential, BIM-I has two major drawbacks, i.e., it has a poor water solubility, and it binds the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) ion channels, potentially causing deadly arrhythmias. In this case, a targeted delivery of BIM-I is imperative to minimize peripheral side effects. To circumvent these drawbacks BIM-I was encapsulated into nanoparticles prepared from poly(lactic- We examined the effects of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM) (I), on voltage-dependent K+ (K(V)) channels in rabbit coronary arterial smooth muscle cells using whole-cell patch clamp technique. BIM (I) reversibly and dose-dependently inhibited the K(V) currents with an apparent Kd value of 0.27 microM. The inhibition of the K(V) current by BIM (I) was highly voltage-dependent between -30 and +10 mV (voltage range of channel activation), and the additive inhibition of the K(V) current by BIM (I) was voltage-dependence in the full activation voltage range. The rate constants of association and dissociation for BIM (I) were 18.4 microM(-1) s(-1) and 4.7 s(-1), respectively. BIM (I) had no effect on the steady-state activation and inactivation of K(V) channels. BIM (I) caused use-dependent inhibition of K(V) current, which was consistent with the slow recovery from inactivation in the presence of BIM (I) (recovery time constants were 856.95 +/- 282.6 ms for control, and 1806.38 +/- 110.0 ms for 300 nM BIM (I)). ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)), inward rectifier K+ (K(IR)), Ca2+-activated K+ (BK(Ca)) channels, which regulate the membrane potential and arterial tone, were not affected by BIM (I). The PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine, and protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, PKA-IP, had little effect on the K(V) current and did not significantly alter the inhibitory effects of BIM (I) on the K(V) current.

This disease exhibits a poor patient prognosis and is considered a challenge due to the limited treatment options encountered in clinical practice. Previous studies have shown that ruscogenin, a saponin found in the root of Ophiopogon japonicus, exerts a wide range of biological functions including anticancer activity. In the present study, the effects of ruscogenin were investigated on pancreatic cancer cells and the potential molecular mechanism of this compound was explored. Cell viability was assessed using the 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl)‑2,5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell death was measured by trypan blue staining and by flow cytometry. The number of iron oxide nanoparticles was measured using Prussian blue staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed using flow cytometry with dihydroethidium staining. Protein expression of the associated genes was assayed by western blotting. Furthermore, in vivo experiments were conducted to confirm the antitumor effects and assay the potential toxicity of ruscogenin in a nude mouse xenograft model. The results indicated that ruscogenin significantly repressed cell viability and induced cell death of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro in a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner. Furthermore, ruscogenin increased the concentration of intracellular ferrous irons and the production of ROS. This effect was inhibited by deferoxamine (DFO). Ruscogenin induced ferroptosis by regulating the levels of transferrin and ferroportin. These two proteins were involved in ruscogenin‑induced pancreatic cancer cell death. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrated the antitumor effect of ruscogenin on pancreatic cancer xenografts in the absence of apparent toxicity. Taken collectively, the data demonstrated that ruscogenin exhibited anticancer effects in pancreatic cancer cells by inducing ferroptosis. The findings suggested that this compound may be further developed as a promising anticancer candidate for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Pulmonary endothelial barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of clinical pulmonary edema and contributes to the development of acute lung injury (ALI). Here we reported that ruscogenin (RUS), an effective steroidal sapogenin of Radix Ophiopogon japonicus, attenuated lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced pulmonary endothelial barrier disruption through mediating non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC IIA)‒Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) interactions.

To investigate whether Ruscogenin attenuates progressive degeneration of articular cartilage in rats with anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)-induced osteoarthritis (OA) by modulating macrophage reprogramming and to explore its specific mechanism of action. In vitro, SW1353 cells and RAW264.7 cells were applied to elucidate the mechanisms by which Ruscogenin protects articular cartilage. Specifically, the expression levels of molecules related to cartilage ECM synthesis and degradation enzymes and macrophages were analysed. In vivo, a rat osteoarthritis model was established using ACLT. The protective effect of Ruscogenin on articular cartilage was observed. Ruscogenin significantly reversed LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response and promoted cartilage regeneration-related factors. In addition, Ruscogenin had a significant protective effect on the knee joint of ACLT rats, effectively preventing cartilage degeneration. These positive therapeutic effects were achieved on the one hand by Ruscogenin regulating macrophage reprogramming by targeting Sirt3, and on the other hand Ruscogenin could attenuate the ROS level of chondrocytes thereby inhibiting chondrocyte ferroptosis.

2904,"('Alanine', '(r)-alanine', 'Ba 2776', 'Œ±-alanine', '(2r)-2-aminopropanoic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Alanine (symbol Ala or A), or α-alanine, is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an amine group and a carboxylic acid group, both attached to the central carbon atom which also carries a methyl group side chain. Consequently it is classified as a non-polar, aliphatic α-amino acid. Under biological conditions, it exists in its zwitterionic form with its amine group protonated (as −NH+3) and its carboxyl group deprotonated (as −CO−2). It is non-essential to humans as it can be synthesized metabolically and does not need to be present in the diet. It is encoded by all codons starting with GC (GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG). The L-isomer of alanine (left-handed) is the one that is incorporated into proteins. L-alanine is second only to L-leucine in rate of occurrence, accounting for 7.8% of the primary structure in a sample of 1,150 proteins. The right-handed form, D-alanine, occurs in peptides in some bacterial cell walls: 131 (in peptidoglycan) and in some peptide antibiotics, and occurs in the tissues of many crustaceans and molluscs as an osmolyte. == History and etymology == Alanine was first synthesized in 1850 when Adolph Strecker combined acetaldehyde and ammonia with hydrogen cyanide. The amino acid was named Alanin in German, in reference to aldehyde, with the interfix -an- for ease of pronunciation, the German ending -in used in chemical compounds being analogous to English -ine. == Structure == Alanine is an aliphatic amino acid, because the side-chain connected to the α-carbon atom is a methyl group (-CH3). Alanine is the simplest α-amino acid after glycine. The methyl side-chain of alanine is non-reactive and is therefore hardly ever directly involved in protein function. Alanine is a nonessential amino acid, meaning it can be manufactured by the human body, and does not need to be obtained through the diet. Alanine is found in a wide variety of foods, but is particularly concentrated in meats. == Sources == === Biosynthesis === Alanine can be synthesized from pyruvate and branched chain amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Alanine is produced by reductive amination of pyruvate, a two-step process. In the first step, α-ketoglutarate, ammonia and NADH are converted by glutamate dehydrogenase to glutamate, NAD+ and water. In the second step, the amino group of the newly formed glutamate is transferred to pyruvate by an aminotransferase enzyme, regenerating the α-ketoglutarate, and converting the pyruvate to alanine. The net result is that pyruvate and ammonia are converted to alanine, consuming one reducing equivalent.: 721 Because transamination reactions are readily reversible and pyruvate is present in all cells, alanine can be easily formed and thus has close links to metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle. === Chemical synthesis === L-Alanine is produced industrially by decarboxylation of L-aspartate by the action of aspartate 4-decarboxylase. Fermentation routes to L-alanine are complicated by alanine racemase. Racemic alanine can be prepared by the condensation of acetaldehyde with ammonium chloride in the presence of sodium cyanide by the Strecker reaction, or by the ammonolysis of 2-bromopropanoic acid. === Degradation === Alanine is broken down by oxidative deamination, the inverse reaction of the reductive amination reaction described above, catalyzed by the same enzymes. The direction of the process is largely controlled by the relative concentration of the substrates and products of the reactions involved.: 721 == Alanine world hypothesis == Alanine is one of the twenty canonical α-amino acids used as building blocks (monomers) for the ribosome-mediated biosynthesis of proteins. Alanine is believed to be one of the earliest amino acids to be included in the genetic code standard repertoire. On the basis of this fact the ""alanine world"" hypothesis was proposed. This hypothesis explains the evolutionary choice of amino acids in the repertoire of the genetic code from a chemical point of view. In this model the selection of monomers (i.e. amino acids) for ribosomal protein synthesis is rather limited to those alanine derivatives that are suitable for building α-helix or β-sheet secondary structural elements. Dominant secondary structures in life as we know it are α-helices and β-sheets and most canonical amino acids can be regarded as chemical derivatives of alanine. Therefore, most canonical amino acids in proteins can be exchanged with alanine by point mutations while the secondary structure remains intact. The fact that alanine mimics the secondary structure preferences of the majority of the encoded amino acids is practically exploited in alanine scanning mutagenesis. In addition, classical X-ray crystallography often employs the polyalanine-backbone model to determine three-dimensional structures of proteins using molecular replacement—a model-based phasing method. == Physiological function == === Glucose–alanine cycle === In mammals, alanine plays a key role in glucose–alanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group to pyruvate, a product of muscle glycolysis, through the action of alanine aminotransferase, forming alanine and α-ketoglutarate. The alanine enters the bloodstream, and is transported to the liver. The alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in reverse in the liver, where the regenerated pyruvate is used in gluconeogenesis, forming glucose which returns to the muscles through the circulation system. Glutamate in the liver enters mitochondria and is broken down by glutamate dehydrogenase into α-ketoglutarate and ammonium, which in turn participates in the urea cycle to form urea which is excreted through the kidneys. The glucose–alanine cycle enables pyruvate and glutamate to be removed from muscle and safely transported to the liver. Once there, pyruvate is used to regenerate glucose, after which the glucose returns to muscle to be metabolized for energy: this moves the energetic burden of gluconeogenesis to the liver instead of the muscle, and all available ATP in the muscle can be devoted to muscle contraction. It is a catabolic pathway, and relies upon protein breakdown in the muscle tissue. Whether and to what extent it occurs in non-mammals is unclear. === Link to diabetes === Alterations in the alanine cycle that increase the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are linked to the development of type II diabetes. == Chemical properties == Alanine is useful in loss of function experiments with respect to phosphorylation. Some techniques involve creating a library of genes, each of which has a point mutation at a different position in the area of interest, sometimes even every position in the whole gene: this is called ""scanning mutagenesis"". The simplest method, and the first to have been used, is so-called alanine scanning, where every position in turn is mutated to alanine. Hydrogenation of alanine gives the amino alcohol alaninol, which is a useful chiral building block. === Free radical === The deamination of an alanine molecule produces the free radical CH3C•HCO2−. Deamination can be induced in solid or aqueous alanine by radiation that causes homolytic cleavage of the carbon–nitrogen bond. This property of alanine is used in dosimetric measurements in radiotherapy. When normal alanine is irradiated, the radiation causes certain alanine molecules to become free radicals, and, as these radicals are stable, the free radical content can later be measured by electron paramagnetic resonance in order to find out how much radiation the alanine was exposed to. This is considered to be a biologically relevant measure of the amount of radiation damage that living tissue would suffer under the same radiation exposure. Radiotherapy treatment plans can be delivered in test mode to alanine pellets, which can then be measured to check that the intended pattern of radiation dose is correctly delivered by the treatment system. == References ==",Alanine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -6.575563020305708e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -9.639096970204264e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.03804688900709152), (' FOOD', -3.297462171758525e-05), (',', -0.20151235163211823), (' INDUSTR', -0.0009138475870713592), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.027269072830677032), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -6.318072337307967e-06), ('OUS', -2.145764938177308e-06), (',', -0.00043215948971919715), ('ĠFOOD', -9.083335316972807e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00673630740493536)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -1.676292231422849e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS,FOOD,PERSONAL CARE;https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/alanine,https://inci.guide/amino-acids/alanine,https://www.americaninternationalingredients.com/ingredient-categories/amino-acids/l-alanine/ ', [])"
2905,"('Alanine', '(s)-alanine', 'Alpha-alanine', '(s)-2-aminopropanoic acid', 'H-ala-oh')","Endogenous, Medical","Alanine (symbol Ala or A), or α-alanine, is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an amine group and a carboxylic acid group, both attached to the central carbon atom which also carries a methyl group side chain. Consequently it is classified as a non-polar, aliphatic α-amino acid. Under biological conditions, it exists in its zwitterionic form with its amine group protonated (as −NH+3) and its carboxyl group deprotonated (as −CO−2). It is non-essential to humans as it can be synthesized metabolically and does not need to be present in the diet. It is encoded by all codons starting with GC (GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG). The L-isomer of alanine (left-handed) is the one that is incorporated into proteins. L-alanine is second only to L-leucine in rate of occurrence, accounting for 7.8% of the primary structure in a sample of 1,150 proteins. The right-handed form, D-alanine, occurs in peptides in some bacterial cell walls: 131 (in peptidoglycan) and in some peptide antibiotics, and occurs in the tissues of many crustaceans and molluscs as an osmolyte. == History and etymology == Alanine was first synthesized in 1850 when Adolph Strecker combined acetaldehyde and ammonia with hydrogen cyanide. The amino acid was named Alanin in German, in reference to aldehyde, with the interfix -an- for ease of pronunciation, the German ending -in used in chemical compounds being analogous to English -ine. == Structure == Alanine is an aliphatic amino acid, because the side-chain connected to the α-carbon atom is a methyl group (-CH3). Alanine is the simplest α-amino acid after glycine. The methyl side-chain of alanine is non-reactive and is therefore hardly ever directly involved in protein function. Alanine is a nonessential amino acid, meaning it can be manufactured by the human body, and does not need to be obtained through the diet. Alanine is found in a wide variety of foods, but is particularly concentrated in meats. == Sources == === Biosynthesis === Alanine can be synthesized from pyruvate and branched chain amino acids such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine. Alanine is produced by reductive amination of pyruvate, a two-step process. In the first step, α-ketoglutarate, ammonia and NADH are converted by glutamate dehydrogenase to glutamate, NAD+ and water. In the second step, the amino group of the newly formed glutamate is transferred to pyruvate by an aminotransferase enzyme, regenerating the α-ketoglutarate, and converting the pyruvate to alanine. The net result is that pyruvate and ammonia are converted to alanine, consuming one reducing equivalent.: 721 Because transamination reactions are readily reversible and pyruvate is present in all cells, alanine can be easily formed and thus has close links to metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the citric acid cycle. === Chemical synthesis === L-Alanine is produced industrially by decarboxylation of L-aspartate by the action of aspartate 4-decarboxylase. Fermentation routes to L-alanine are complicated by alanine racemase. Racemic alanine can be prepared by the condensation of acetaldehyde with ammonium chloride in the presence of sodium cyanide by the Strecker reaction, or by the ammonolysis of 2-bromopropanoic acid. === Degradation === Alanine is broken down by oxidative deamination, the inverse reaction of the reductive amination reaction described above, catalyzed by the same enzymes. The direction of the process is largely controlled by the relative concentration of the substrates and products of the reactions involved.: 721 == Alanine world hypothesis == Alanine is one of the twenty canonical α-amino acids used as building blocks (monomers) for the ribosome-mediated biosynthesis of proteins. Alanine is believed to be one of the earliest amino acids to be included in the genetic code standard repertoire. On the basis of this fact the ""alanine world"" hypothesis was proposed. This hypothesis explains the evolutionary choice of amino acids in the repertoire of the genetic code from a chemical point of view. In this model the selection of monomers (i.e. amino acids) for ribosomal protein synthesis is rather limited to those alanine derivatives that are suitable for building α-helix or β-sheet secondary structural elements. Dominant secondary structures in life as we know it are α-helices and β-sheets and most canonical amino acids can be regarded as chemical derivatives of alanine. Therefore, most canonical amino acids in proteins can be exchanged with alanine by point mutations while the secondary structure remains intact. The fact that alanine mimics the secondary structure preferences of the majority of the encoded amino acids is practically exploited in alanine scanning mutagenesis. In addition, classical X-ray crystallography often employs the polyalanine-backbone model to determine three-dimensional structures of proteins using molecular replacement—a model-based phasing method. == Physiological function == === Glucose–alanine cycle === In mammals, alanine plays a key role in glucose–alanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of glutamate by transamination. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group to pyruvate, a product of muscle glycolysis, through the action of alanine aminotransferase, forming alanine and α-ketoglutarate. The alanine enters the bloodstream, and is transported to the liver. The alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in reverse in the liver, where the regenerated pyruvate is used in gluconeogenesis, forming glucose which returns to the muscles through the circulation system. Glutamate in the liver enters mitochondria and is broken down by glutamate dehydrogenase into α-ketoglutarate and ammonium, which in turn participates in the urea cycle to form urea which is excreted through the kidneys. The glucose–alanine cycle enables pyruvate and glutamate to be removed from muscle and safely transported to the liver. Once there, pyruvate is used to regenerate glucose, after which the glucose returns to muscle to be metabolized for energy: this moves the energetic burden of gluconeogenesis to the liver instead of the muscle, and all available ATP in the muscle can be devoted to muscle contraction. It is a catabolic pathway, and relies upon protein breakdown in the muscle tissue. Whether and to what extent it occurs in non-mammals is unclear. === Link to diabetes === Alterations in the alanine cycle that increase the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are linked to the development of type II diabetes. == Chemical properties == Alanine is useful in loss of function experiments with respect to phosphorylation. Some techniques involve creating a library of genes, each of which has a point mutation at a different position in the area of interest, sometimes even every position in the whole gene: this is called ""scanning mutagenesis"". The simplest method, and the first to have been used, is so-called alanine scanning, where every position in turn is mutated to alanine. Hydrogenation of alanine gives the amino alcohol alaninol, which is a useful chiral building block. === Free radical === The deamination of an alanine molecule produces the free radical CH3C•HCO2−. Deamination can be induced in solid or aqueous alanine by radiation that causes homolytic cleavage of the carbon–nitrogen bond. This property of alanine is used in dosimetric measurements in radiotherapy. When normal alanine is irradiated, the radiation causes certain alanine molecules to become free radicals, and, as these radicals are stable, the free radical content can later be measured by electron paramagnetic resonance in order to find out how much radiation the alanine was exposed to. This is considered to be a biologically relevant measure of the amount of radiation damage that living tissue would suffer under the same radiation exposure. Radiotherapy treatment plans can be delivered in test mode to alanine pellets, which can then be measured to check that the intended pattern of radiation dose is correctly delivered by the treatment system. == References ==",Alpha-alanine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -7.016616291366518e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0002615742268972099), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.023251881822943687), (' FOOD', -0.00028016636497341096), (',', -0.31351640820503235), (' INDUSTR', -0.002599557163193822), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.03235512226819992), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.576214658096433e-05), ('OUS', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.0015066235791891813), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0001746263587847352), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018190348520874977)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.001677675754763186), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.842555426876061e-06), (' FOOD', -2.15310683415737e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/alanine?utm_source=openai), [draxe.com](https://draxe.com/nutrition/alanine-benefits/?utm_source=openai), [lookchem.com](https://www.lookchem.com/casno56-41-7.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=269, start_index=33, title='Alanine | Amino Acid, Protein, Metabolism | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/alanine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=269, start_index=33, title='', type='url_citation', url='https://draxe.com/nutrition/alanine-benefits/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=269, start_index=33, title='Cas 56-41-7,L-alpha-Alanine | lookchem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.lookchem.com/casno56-41-7.html?utm_source=openai')])"

2908,"('Apixaban', 'Eliquis', 'Apixaban-13c,d3', 'Eliquis (tn)', 'Apixabanum')",Medical,"Apixaban, sold under the brand name Eliquis, is an anticoagulant medication used to treat and prevent blood clots and to prevent stroke in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation through directly inhibiting factor Xa. It is used as an alternative to warfarin to prevent blood clots following hip or knee replacement and in those with a history of prior clots and does not require monitoring by blood tests or dietary restrictions. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include bleeding and nausea. Other side effects may include bleeding around the spine and allergic reactions. Use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Use appears to be relatively safe in those with mild kidney problems. Compared to warfarin it has fewer interactions with other medications. It is a direct factor Xa inhibitor. In 2007, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb began the development of apixaban as an anticoagulant. Apixaban was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2011, and in the United States in December 2012. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 27th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 19 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication, although not in the United States. == Medical uses == Apixaban is indicated for the following: To lower the risk of stroke and embolism in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention. DVTs may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in knee or hip replacement surgery patients. Treatment of both DVT and PE. To reduce the risk of recurring DVT and PE after initial therapy. In the EU, apixaban is indicated for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adults who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery, the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with one or more risk factors, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in adults, and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults. === Atrial fibrillation === Apixaban is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and at least one of the following risk factors: prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, age 75 years or older, diabetes, or symptomatic heart failure. Apixaban and other anticoagulants (dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) appear equally effective as warfarin in preventing non-hemorrhagic stroke in people with atrial fibrillation and are associated with lower risk of intracranial bleeding. While apixaban may be used in people with severely decreased kidney function and those on hemodialysis it has not been studied in these groups. == Side effects == === Bleeding === Apixaban can increase the risk of bleeding which may be serious and potentially fatal. Concurrent use with other medications that affect blood clotting can further increase this risk. This includes medications such as other anticoagulants, heparin, aspirin, antiplatelet medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Andexanet alfa is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antidote for apixaban in people with uncontrolled and life-threatening bleeding events. === Spinal puncture === Following spinal anesthesia or puncture, people who are being treated with anti-thrombotic agents are at higher risk for developing a hematoma, which causes long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of this may be increased by using epidural or intrathecal catheters after a surgical operation or from the concurrent use of medicinal agents that affect hemostasis. == Mechanism of action == Apixaban is a highly selective, orally bioavailable, and reversible direct inhibitor of free and clot-bound factor Xa. Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, the final enzyme in the coagulation cascade that is responsible for fibrin clot formation. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but by inhibiting factor Xa, it indirectly decreases clot formation induced by thrombin. == History == Apixaban was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2011. A new drug application (NDA) for the approval of apixaban was submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and Pfizer jointly after the conclusion of the ARISTOTLE clinical trial in 2011. Apixaban was approved for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation in December 2012. In March 2014, it was approved for the additional indication of preventing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in people who have recently undergone knee or hip replacement. In August 2014, the FDA approved apixaban for the additional indication of the treatment of recurring deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. During its development the drug was known as BMS-562247-01. By late 2019, sales of the product by BMS accounted for thirty percent of their quarterly revenue. == Society and culture == === Economics === In December 2019, the US FDA approved a generic version of apixaban produced jointly by Mylan and Micro Labs. BMS and Pfizer worked quickly to block generics from being created, and in August 2020, they won a patent infringement lawsuit against Sigmapharm, Sunshine Lake, and Unichem, after previously settling patent cases against 25 other companies. In September 2021, a Federal Circuit Court upheld the ruling. The result is that apixaban generics will most likely not be available in the United States until at least 2026, but possibly 2031. In July 2022, the Canadian generic drug company, Apotex Inc., obtained approval for marketing of apixaban. Pfizer reported revenue of US$6.747 billion for Eliquis in 2023. Apixaban is one of ten medications covered by price negotiations in the US under the Inflation Reduction Act. The negotiations, conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, apply to pricing for Medicare recipients. The results of the negotiations were announced in August 2024, and Medicare's negotiated price for a 30-day supply of Eliquis is $231, a 56% decrease from the 2023 list price of $521. The pricing is set to take effect in 2026. == References ==",Eliquis,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.556489552167477e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010072677832795307)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/eliquis.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Eliquis: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects Information - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/eliquis.html?utm_source=openai')])"
2909,"('Gadopentetate (dimeglumine)', 'Sh-l-451a', 'Gadopentetic acid dimeglumine salt', 'Pentetic acid', 'Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid')",Medical,"Pentetic acid or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) is an aminopolycarboxylic acid consisting of a diethylenetriamine backbone with five carboxymethyl groups. The molecule can be viewed as an expanded version of EDTA and is used similarly. It is a white solid with limited solubility in water. == Coordination properties == The conjugate base of DTPA has a high affinity for metal cations. Thus, the penta-anion DTPA5− is potentially an octadentate ligand assuming that each nitrogen centre and each –COO− group counts as a centre for coordination. The formation constants for its complexes are about 100 greater than those for EDTA. As a chelating agent, DTPA wraps around a metal ion by forming up to eight bonds. Its complexes can also have an extra water molecule that coordinates the metal ion. Transition metals, however, usually form less than eight coordination bonds. So, after forming a complex with a metal, DTPA still has the ability to bind to other reagents, as is shown by its derivative pendetide. For example, in its complex with copper(II), DTPA binds in a hexadentate manner utilizing the three amine centres and three of the five carboxylates. == Chelating applications == Like the more common EDTA, DTPA is predominantly used as chelating agent for complexing and sequestering metal ions. DTPA has been considered for treatment of radioactive materials such as plutonium, americium, and other actinides. In theory, these complexes are more apt to be eliminated in urine. It is normally administered as the calcium or zinc salt (Ca or Zn-DTPA), since these ions are readily displaced by more highly charged cations and mainly to avoid to depleting them in the organism. DTPA forms complexes with thorium(IV), uranium(IV), neptunium(IV), and cerium(III/IV). In August, 2004 the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) determined zinc-DTPA and calcium-DTPA to be safe and effective for treatment of those who have breathed in or otherwise been contaminated internally by plutonium, americium, or curium. The recommended treatment is for an initial dose of calcium-DTPA, as this salt of DTPA has been shown to be more effective in the first 24 hours after internal contamination by plutonium, americium, or curium. After that time has elapsed both calcium-DTPA and zinc-DTPA are similarly effective in reducing internal contamination with plutonium, americium or curium, and zinc-DTPA is less likely to deplete the body's normal levels of zinc and other metals essential to health. Each drug can be administered by nebulizer for those who have breathed in contamination, and by intravenous injection for those contaminated by other routes. DTPA is also used as MRI contrasting agent. DTPA improves the resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by forming a soluble complex with a gadolinium (Gd3+) ion, which alters the magnetic resonance behavior of the protons of the nearby water molecules and increases the images contrast. DTPA under the form of iron(II) chelate (Fe-DTPA, 10 – 11 wt. %) is also used as aquarium plants fertilizer. The more soluble form of iron, Fe(II), is a micronutrient needed by aquatic plants. By binding to Fe2+ ions DTPA prevents their precipitation as Fe(OH)3, or Fe2O3 · n H2O poorly soluble oxy-hydroxides after their oxidation by dissolved oxygen. It increases the solubility of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions in water, and therefore the bioavailability of iron for aquatic plants. It contributes so to maintain iron under a dissolved form (probably a mix of Fe(II) and Fe(III) DTPA complexes) in the water column. It is unclear to what extent does DTPA really contribute to protect dissolved Fe2+ against air oxidation and if the Fe(III)-DTPA complex cannot also be directly assimilated by aquatic plants simply because of its enhanced solubility. Under natural conditions, i.e., in the absence of complexing DTPA, Fe2+ is more easily assimilated by most organisms, because of its 100-fold higher solubility than that of Fe3+. In pulp and paper mills DTPA is also used to remove dissolved ferrous and ferric ions (and other redox-active metal ions, such as Mn or Cu) that otherwise would accelerate the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 reduction by Fe2+ ions according to the Fenton reaction mechanism). This helps preserving the oxidation capacity of the hydrogen peroxide stock which is used as oxidizing agent to bleach pulp in the chlorine-free process of paper making. Several thousands tons of DTPA are produced annually for this purpose in order to limit the non-negligible losses of H2O2 by this mechanism. DTPA chelating properties are also useful in deactivating calcium and magnesium ions in hair products. DTPA is used in over 150 cosmetic products. == Biochemistry == DTPA is more effective than EDTA to deactivate redox-active metal ions such as Fe(II)/(III), Mn(II)/(IV) and Cu(I)/(II) perpetuating oxidative damages induced in cells by superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. DTPA is also used in bioassays involving redox-active metal ions. == Environmental impact == An unexpected negative environmental impact of chelating agents, as DTPA, is their toxicity for the activated sludges in the treatment of Kraft pulping effluents. Most of the DTPA worldwide production (several thousands of tons) is intended to avoid hydrogen peroxide decomposition by redox-active iron and manganese ions in the chlorine-free Kraft pulping processes (total chlorine free (TCF) and environmental chlorine free (ECF) processes). DTPA decreases the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of activated sludges and therefore their microbial activity. == Related compounds == Compounds that are structurally related to DTPA are used in medicine, taking advantage of the high affinity of the triaminopentacarboxylate scaffold for metal ions. In ibritumomab tiuxetan, the chelator tiuxetan is a modified version of DTPA whose carbon backbone contains an isothiocyanatobenzyl and a methyl group. In capromab pendetide and satumomab pendetide, the chelator pendetide (GYK-DTPA) is a modified DTPA containing a peptide linker used to connect the chelate to an antibody. Pentetreotide is a modified DTPA attached to a peptide segment. DTPA and derivatives are used to chelate gadolinium to form an MRI contrast agent, such as Magnevist. Technetium-99m is chelated with DTPA for ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scans and radioisotope renography nuclear medicine scans. == See also == Nuclear medicine Radiopharmaceutical Hydrogen peroxide decomposition DTPA in chlorine-free Kraft pulping == References == This article incorporates material from Facts about DTPA, a fact sheet produced by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.1604231595993042), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.5822644233703613), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' INDUSTR', -3.5954712075181305e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.1283295452594757), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -0.0005620330339297652), ('ĠINDU', -0.001862221397459507), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -3.099436753473128e-06), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.5759947299957275), ('ĠPERSON', -0.012324369512498379), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.1086402082582936e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02985270321369171)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.3868752717971802), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.1472419600977446e-06), (' INDUSTR', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([fishersci.com](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/diethylenetriaminepentaacetic-acid-98-thermo-scientific-1/AAA1092630?utm_source=openai), [kelewell.de](https://www.kelewell.de/en/post/what-is-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic-acid-dtpa-and-what-are-its-areas-of-application?utm_source=openai), [nouryon.com](https://www.nouryon.com/product/dissolvine-d-50/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=416, start_index=36, title='Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 98+%, Thermo Scientific Chemicals, Quantity: 250 g | Fisher Scientific', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/diethylenetriaminepentaacetic-acid-98-thermo-scientific-1/AAA1092630?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=416, start_index=36, title='What is Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic Acid (DTPA) and what are its areas of application?', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kelewell.de/en/post/what-is-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic-acid-dtpa-and-what-are-its-areas-of-application?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=416, start_index=36, title='Dissolvine D-50 Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pentasodium salt', type='url_citation', url='https://www.nouryon.com/product/dissolvine-d-50/?utm_source=openai')])"
2910,"('Phenazopyridine (hydrochloride)', 'Phenazopyridine', 'Gastracid', 'Pyrazofen', 'Pyridiate')",Medical,"Phenazopyridine is a medication which, when excreted by the kidneys into the urine, has a local analgesic effect on the urinary tract. It is often used to help with the pain, irritation, or urgency caused by urinary tract infections, surgery, or injury to the urinary tract. In 2021, it was the 285th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Phenazopyridine is prescribed for its local analgesic effects on the urinary tract. It is sometimes used in conjunction with an antibiotic (usually norfloxacin) or other anti-infective medication at the beginning of treatment to help provide immediate symptomatic relief. Phenazopyridine does not treat infections or injury; it is only used for symptom relief. It is recommended that it be used for no longer than the first two days of antibacterial treatment, as longer treatment may mask symptoms. Phenazopyridine is prescribed for other cases requiring relief from irritation or discomfort during urination; for example, after the use of an in-dwelling Foley catheter, endoscopic (cystoscopy) procedures, or after urethral, prostate, or urinary bladder surgeries that may result in irritation of the epithelial lining of the urinary tract. This medication is not used to treat infection and may mask symptoms of inappropriately treated UTI. It provides symptom relief during a UTI, following surgery, or injury to the urinary tract. UTI therapy should be limited to one to two days. Long-term use of phenazopyridine can mask symptoms. == Side effects == Phenazopyridine produces a vivid color change in urine, typically to a dark orange to reddish color. This effect is common and harmless and indeed a key indicator of the presence of the medication in the body. Users of phenazopyridine are warned not to wear contact lenses, as phenazopyridine has been known to permanently discolor them. Furthermore, it tends to leave an orange-yellow stain on surfaces (including fabrics) it comes in contact with. These color changes can be concerning for patients, who may mistake them for the presence of blood in the urine. Phenazopyridine can cause headaches, upset stomach (especially when not taken with food), or dizziness. Less frequently it can cause a noticeable yellowish pigment change in the skin or eyes. This is due to a depressed excretion via the kidneys causing a buildup of the medication in the skin, and normally indicates a need to discontinue usage. Other such side effects include fever, confusion, shortness of breath, skin rash, and swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or legs. Long-term use may cause yellowing of nails. Phenazopyridine should be avoided by people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, because it can cause hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) due to oxidative stress. It has been reported to cause methemoglobinemia after overdose and even normal doses. In at least one case, the patient had pre-existing low levels of methemoglobin reductase, which likely predisposed her to the condition. It has also been reported to cause sulfhemoglobinemia. Phenazopyridine is an azo dye. Other azo dyes, which were previously used in textiles, printing, and plastic manufacturing, have been implicated as carcinogens that can cause bladder cancer. While phenazopyridine has never been shown to cause cancer in humans, evidence from animal models suggests that it is potentially carcinogenic. === Pregnancy === This medication has shown no adverse events in animal models, but no human trials have been conducted. It is not known if phenazopyridine is excreted in breast milk. == Pharmacokinetics == The full pharmacokinetic properties of phenazopyridine have not been determined. It has mostly been studied in animal models, but they may not be very representative of humans. Rat models have shown its half-life to be 7.35 hours, and 40% is metabolized hepatically (by the liver). == Mechanism of action == Phenazopyridine's mechanism of action is not well known, and only basic information on its interaction with the body is available. It is known that the chemical has a direct topical analgesic effect on the mucosa lining of the urinary tract. It is rapidly excreted by the kidneys directly into the urine. Hydroxylation is the major form of metabolism in humans, and the azo bond is usually not cleaved. On the order of 65% of an oral dose will be secreted directly into the urine chemically unchanged. == Brand names == In addition to its generic form, phenazopyridine is distributed under the following brand names: == References ==",Pyridiate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.010259863920509815), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019657351076602936)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.014169624075293541), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/cons/pyridiate.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=9, title='Pyridiate Advanced Patient Information - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/cons/pyridiate.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Icotinib is approved for use in China as first-line monotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer with somatic EGFR mutations. == Development == Icotinib was first synthesized in 2002 by the company Betta Pharma. The US patent application for the preparation of icotinib and icotinib hydrochloride was filed on December 28, 2012, and granted on July 21, 2015. == Mechanism of action == Icotinib is a quinazoline derivative that competitively inhibits the ATP binding site of the EGFR receptor protein. EGFR drives malignant growth of cells when mutations occur within the tyrosine kinase domain of this protein. Such mutations cause unchecked cell proliferation, which inappropriately activates the anti-apoptotic Ras signaling pathway. By blocking the binding of ATP to EGFR, icotinib prevents activity of the signal transduction cascade that initiates mitosis. == Indications == Icotinib is approved in China for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in patients with an EGFR mutation who have advanced or metastatic disease. == Clinical research == The ICOGEN trial was a double-blind, head-to-head phase III study comparing icotinib with gefitinib in 399 patients across 27 centers in China. Results showed icotinib to have a median progression-free survival of 4.6 months (95% CI 3.5 – 6.3) as compared to gefitinib which has a PFS of 3.4 months (95% CI 2.3 – 3.8). Post-hoc analysis found fewer adverse events with icotinib than gefitinib (61% versus 70% respectively, p = 0.046).

2914,"('Itopride (hydrochloride)', 'Itopride', 'N-(4-(2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy)benzyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzamide', 'Itopride free base', 'Itopride [inn]')",Medical,"Itopride (INN; brand name Ganaton) is a prokinetic benzamide derivative. These drugs inhibit dopamine and acetylcholine esterase enzyme and have a gastrokinetic effect. Itopride is indicated for the treatment of functional dyspepsia and other gastrointestinal conditions. It is a combined D2 receptor antagonist and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Itopride is the dimethoxy analog of trimethobenzamide. == Medical uses == Typically, itopride is indicated in the treatment of GI symptoms caused by reduced GI motility: dyspepsia of a non-ulcer/dysmotility type (gastric ""fullness"", discomfort, and possible pain) gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying) anorexia heartburn regurgitation bloating nausea and vomiting other possible gastric, prolactin, or dopamine related conditions Itopride was shown to significantly improve symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia and motility disorders in placebo-controlled trials. These studies concluded that the reduction in the severity of symptoms of functional dyspepsia after 8 weeks of treatment with itopride indicated that itopride was significantly superior to placebo and that itopride yielded a greater rate of response than placebo in significantly reducing pain and fullness. == Adverse drug reactions == Central nervous system adverse effects do not tend to occur due to poor penetration across the blood brain barrier, although a slight raising of prolactin levels may occur. Raising of prolactin levels is more common with high dose regimes of itopride. === Cardiac studies === Itopride belongs to the same benzamide group as cisapride, a drug found to affect QT interval and possibly predispose those using it to cardiac arrhythmias. However, itopride does not have any adverse effect on the QT interval. Later, in a study conducted with healthy adult volunteers, itopride was shown as unlikely to cause cardiac arrhythmias or ECG changes in part to the lack of significant interaction and metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway, unlike cisapride and mosapride, as it is metabolized by a different enzyme set. New molecular studies on guinea pig ventricular myocytes also supported the cardiac safety profile of itopride, as it did not affect certain potassium mechanisms that may have been affected by cisapride or mosapride. Moreover, itopride has no affinity for the 5-HT4 receptors, unlike other benzamides such as cisapride and mosapride, which are 5-HT4 agonists. The affinity of cisapride for 5-HT4 receptors in the heart has been implicated in the undesirable cardiac effects of cisapride itself. The conclusion of this study revealed that itopride is devoid of any abnormal effect on QT interval. Therefore, it may be possible that itopride could be considered as a better and certainly safer prokinetic agent than either cisapride or mosapride, and itopride should also be considered a welcome treatment addition for symptomatic nonulcer dyspepsia and other gastric motility disorders. == Pharmacology == Itopride acts as a selective dual D2 receptor antagonist and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. There is evidence that itopride may have prokinetic effects throughout the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach to the end of the colon. The pharmacokinetics of itopride appear to differ between Asian and Caucasian populations, with Caucasians having 30-50 percent lower blood levels of itopride after oral administration. Itopride poorly penetrates across the blood brain barrier because of its high polarity and thus itopride does not tend to cause any central nervous system adverse effects. Itopride has no effect on potassium channels. Similarly to other D2 receptor antagonists, itopride has been found to dose-dependently increase prolactin levels. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral administration itopride undergoes rapid and extensive absorption with levels of itopride peaking in the blood plasma after only 35 minutes. Itopride is primarily eliminated via the kidneys having an elimination half-life of approximately 6 hours. === Mechanism of action === Itopride increases acetylcholine concentrations by inhibiting dopamine D2 receptors and acetylcholinesterase. Higher acetylcholine increases GI peristalsis, increases the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, stimulates gastric motility, accelerates gastric emptying, and improves gastro-duodenal coordination. Itopride given as a single dose study found that it also raises levels of motilin, somatostatin and lowers levels of cholecystokinin, as well as adrenocorticotropic hormone. These effects may also contribute to itopride's pharmacology. == Society and culture == === Names === Itopride is available under various brand names including Ganaton (Japan, Czech Republic, Russian Federation), Itoprid PMCS (Czech Republic, Slovakia), Itomed (Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan), Prokit (Poland), and Itogard (Nepal). In Mexico, itopride is sold by Takeda Laboratories under the brand name Dagla.

2915,"('Tropinone', 'Tropanon', 'Tropanone', 'Tropinon', 'Tropionone')",Medical,"Tropinone is an alkaloid, famously synthesised in 1917 by Robert Robinson as a synthetic precursor to atropine, a scarce commodity during World War I. Tropinone and the alkaloids cocaine and atropine all share the same tropane core structure. Its corresponding conjugate acid at pH 7.3 major species is known as tropiniumone. == Synthesis == The first synthesis of tropinone was by Richard Willstätter in 1901. It started from the seemingly related cycloheptanone, but required many steps to introduce the nitrogen bridge; the overall yield for the synthesis path is only 0.75%. Willstätter had previously synthesized cocaine from tropinone, in what was the first synthesis and elucidation of the structure of cocaine. === Robinson's ""double Mannich"" reaction === The 1917 synthesis by Robinson is considered a classic in total synthesis due to its simplicity and biomimetic approach. Tropinone is a bicyclic molecule, but the reactants used in its preparation are fairly simple: succinaldehyde, methylamine and acetonedicarboxylic acid (or even acetone). The synthesis is a good example of a biomimetic reaction or biogenetic-type synthesis because biosynthesis makes use of the same building blocks. It also demonstrates a tandem reaction in a one-pot synthesis. Furthermore, the yield of the synthesis was 17% and with subsequent improvements exceeded 90%. This reaction is described as an intramolecular ""double Mannich reaction"" for obvious reasons. It is not unique in this regard, as others have also attempted it in piperidine synthesis. In place of acetone, acetonedicarboxylic acid is known as the ""synthetic equivalent"" the 1,3-dicarboxylic acid groups are so-called ""activating groups"" to facilitate the ring forming reactions. The calcium salt is there as a ""buffer"" as it is claimed that higher yields are possible if the reaction is conducted at ""physiological pH"". === Reaction mechanism === The main features apparent from the reaction sequence below are: Nucleophilic addition of methylamine to succinaldehyde, followed by loss of water to create an imine Intramolecular addition of the imine to the second aldehyde unit and first ring closure Intermolecular Mannich reaction of the enolate of acetone dicarboxylate New enolate formation and new imine formation with loss of water for Second intramolecular Mannich reaction and second ring closure Loss of 2 carboxylic groups to tropinone Some authors have actually tried to retain one of the CO2H groups. CO2R-tropinone has 4 stereoisomers, although the corresponding ecgonidine alkyl ester has only a pair of enantiomers. === From cycloheptanone === IBX dehydrogenation (oxidation) of cycloheptanone (suberone) to 2,6-cycloheptadienone [1192-93-4] followed by reaction with an amine is versatile a way of forming tropinones. The mechanism evoked is clearly delineated to be a double Michael reaction (i.e. conjugate addition). === Biochemistry method === === Reduction of tropinone === The reduction of tropinone is mediated by NADPH-dependent reductase enzymes, which have been characterized in multiple plant species. These plant species all contain two types of the reductase enzymes, tropinone reductase I and tropinone reductase II. TRI produces tropine and TRII produces pseudotropine. Due to differing kinetic and pH/activity characteristics of the enzymes and by the 25-fold higher activity of TRI over TRII, the majority of the tropinone reduction is from TRI to form tropine. == See also == Benztropine Daturaolone 2-Carbomethoxytropinone (2-CMT) an intermediate in the creation of ecgonine cocaine analogues Ecgonidine == References == == External links == MSDS for tropinone",Tropanone,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0003357006062287837)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.5975923538208008), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.31335654854774475), ('ĠMED', -0.16448867321014404), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018208257853984833)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.00861456897109747), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([chemicalbook.com](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/tropinone-properties-applications-and-safety.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=131, start_index=6, title='Tropinone: properties, applications and safety_Chemicalbook', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/tropinone-properties-applications-and-safety.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

However, the mechanism of cellular senescence is not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of curcumol on hepatocyte senescence in NAFLD and the molecular mechanisms implicated. LVG Golden Syrian hamsters, C57BL/6J mice and human hepatocyte cell line LO2 were used. Cellular senescence was assessed by analyses of senescence marker SA-β-gal, p16 and p21, H3K9me3, γ-H2AX and telomerase activity. The results showed that curcumol could inhibit hepatocyte senescence in both in vivo and in vitro NAFLD models, and the mechanism might be related to its regulation of ferritinophagy and subsequent alleviation of iron overload. Moreover, overexpression of nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) weakened the effect of curcumol on ferritinophagy-mediated iron overload and cellular senescence. Furthermore, we demonstrated that curcumol reduced the expression of NCOA4 by Yes-associated protein (YAP). In addition, depression of YAP could impair the effect of curcumol on iron overload and cellular senescence. Our results clarified the mechanism of curcumol inhibition of hepatocyte senescence through YAP/NCOA4 regulation of ferritinophagy in NAFLD. These findings provided a promising option of curcumol to regulate cellular senescence by target YAP/NCOA4 for the treatment of NAFLD. Natural products, an infinite treasure of bioactive scaffolds, have provided an excellent reservoir for the discovery of drugs since millennium. These naturally occurring, biologically active and therapeutically effective chemical entities have emerged as novel paradigm for the prevention of various diseases.

However, the pathogenesis of cardiac remodeling is not fully understood, and specific treatment schemes are currently unavailable. Curcumol is a bioactive sesquiterpenoid that has anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrotic properties. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of curcumol on cardiac remodeling and elucidate its relevant underlying mechanism. Curcumol significantly attenuated cardiac dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, and hypertrophy in the animal model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac remodeling. Curcumol also alleviated cardiac electrical remodeling, thereby reducing the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF) after heart failure. Inflammation and apoptosis are critical pathological processes involved in cardiac remodeling. Curcumol inhibited the inflammation and apoptosis induced by ISO and TGF-β1 in mouse myocardium and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Furthermore, the protective effects of curcumol were found to be mediated through the inhibition of the protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. The administration of an AKT agonist reversed the anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects of curcumol and restored the inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation in TGF-β1-induced NRCMs. Our study suggests that curcumol is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cardiac remodeling.",Curcumol,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00380281126126647), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.12694701552391052), (' FOOD', -4.0722858102526516e-05)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.47581952810287476), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.3869877755641937), ('ĠFOOD', -0.08115725964307785), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0381232351064682)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01814994215965271)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38520574/?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6643219/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=187, start_index=6, title='Curcumol: a review of its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, drug delivery systems, structure-activity relationships, and potential applications - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38520574/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=187, start_index=6, title='Curcumol: From Plant Roots to Cancer Roots - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6643219/?utm_source=openai')])"
2917,"('Temsavir', 'Temsavir (bms-626529)', 'Temsavir [usan:inn]', 'Temsavir (usan)', 'Temsavirbms-626529')",Medical,"Fostemsavir, sold under the brand name Rukobia, is an antiretroviral medication for adults living with HIV/AIDS who have tried multiple HIV medications and whose HIV infection cannot be successfully treated with other therapies because of resistance, intolerance or safety considerations. The most common adverse reaction is nausea. Severe adverse reactions included elevations in liver enzymes among participants also infected with hepatitis B or C virus, and changes in the immune system (immune reconstitution syndrome). Fostemsavir is an HIV entry inhibitor and a prodrug of temsavir (BMS-626529). Fostemsavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120-directed attachment inhibitor. It was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2020, and in the European Union in February 2021. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Fostemsavir in combination with other antiretroviral(s), is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen due to resistance, intolerance, or safety considerations. == Adverse effects == Fostemsavir may cause a serious condition called immune reconstitution syndrome, similar to other approved drugs for treatment of HIV-1 infection. This condition can happen at the beginning of HIV-1 treatment when the immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in the body for a long time. Other serious side effects include heart rhythm problems due to prolongation of heart electrical activity (QT prolongation) and an increase of liver enzymes in patients with hepatitis B or C virus co-infection. == History == It was under development by ViiV Healthcare / GlaxoSmithKline for use in the treatment of HIV infection. When the active form of fostemsavir binds to the gp120 protein of the virus, it prevents initial viral attachment to the host CD4+ T cell and entry into the host immune cell; its method of action is a first for HIV drugs. Because it targets a different step of the viral lifecycle, it offers promise for individuals with virus that has become highly resistant to other HIV drugs. Since the function of gp120 that this drug inhibits is highly conserved, the drug is unlikely to promote resistance to itself. Investigators found that enfuvirtide-resistant and ibalizumab-resistant HIV envelopes remained susceptible to fostemsavir. Conversely, fostemsavir-resistant HIV remained susceptible to all the entry inhibitors. Furthermore, HIV isolates that do not require the CD4 receptor for cell entry were also susceptible to fostemsavir, and the virus did not escape the attachment inhibitor by becoming CD4-independent. Prior in vitro studies showed that fostemsavir inhibits both CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic HIV. Fostemsavir was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2020. The safety and efficacy of fostemsavir, taken twice daily by mouth, were evaluated in a clinical trial of 371 heavily treatment-experienced adult participants who continued to have high levels of virus (HIV-RNA) in their blood despite being on antiretroviral drugs. Two hundred seventy-two participants were treated in the main trial arm, and an additional 99 participants received fostemsavir in a different arm of the trial. Most participants had been treated for HIV for more than 15 years (71 percent), had been exposed to five or more different HIV treatment regimens before entering the trial (85 percent) and/or had a history of AIDS (86 percent). Participants in the main cohort of the trial received either fostemsavir or a placebo twice daily for eight days, in addition to their failing antiretroviral regimen. On the eighth day, participants treated with fostemsavir had a significantly greater decrease in levels of HIV-RNA in their blood compared to those taking the placebo. After the eighth day, all participants received fostemsavir with other antiretroviral drugs. After 24 weeks of fostemsavir plus other antiretroviral drugs, 53 percent of participants achieved HIV RNA suppression, where levels of HIV were low enough to be considered undetectable. After 96 weeks, 60 percent of participants continued to have HIV RNA suppression. The clinical trial (NCT02362503) was conducted at 108 sites in 23 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Australia, Taiwan and South Africa. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for fostemsavir fast track, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designations. The FDA granted the approval of Rukobia to ViiV Healthcare. On 10 December 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Rukobia, intended for the treatment of multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection. The applicant for this medicinal product is ViiV Healthcare B.V.

2918,"('Isoniazid', 'Isonicotinic acid hydrazide', 'Isonicotinic hydrazide', 'Isonicotinohydrazide', 'Pyridine-4-carbohydrazide')",Medical,"Isoniazid, also known as isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH), is an antibiotic used for the treatment of tuberculosis. For active tuberculosis, it is often used together with rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. For latent tuberculosis, it is often used alone. It may also be used for atypical types of mycobacteria, such as M. avium, M. kansasii, and M. xenopi. It is usually taken by mouth, but may be used by injection into muscle. == History == After F. Raschig developed a method to synthesize hydrazine, Hans Meyer and his doctoral student at the German University in Prague Josef Mally studied hydrazides of pyridinecarboxylic acids. By reacting ethyl isonicotinate with hydrazine hydrate they obtained a compound which, after a recrystallization, had a melting point of 163°C. Despite their results published in 1912, its pharmaceutical properties weren't investigated for decades. In the 1940s French physicians discovered that nicotinamide had some activity against tubercle bacilli in vitro and in infected guinea pigs. At the same time, German chemists led by G. Domagk investigating sulfo drugs at Bayer developed thioacetazone. After their findings were made public, in 1950 A. Girard modified it to the less toxic thiosemicarbazone of nicotinaldehyde while H. H. Fox developed similar isonicotinaldehyde thiosemicarbazone. Soon, multiple laboratories discovered anti-TB activity of isoniazid. It's believed that Soviet physicians A. Kachugin and Bella Keyfman also discovered this activity in 1949 but neither published their findings in a peer-reviewed article nor applied for an inventor's certificate. Three pharmaceutical companies unsuccessfully attempted to patent the drug at the same time, the most prominent one being Roche in January 1951, which launched its version, Rimifon, in 1952. The drug was first tested at Many Farms, a Navajo community in Arizona, due to the Navajo reservation's tuberculosis problem and because the population had not previously been treated with streptomycin, the main tuberculosis treatment at the time. The research was led by Walsh McDermott, an infectious disease researcher with an interest in public health, who had previously taken isoniazid to treat his own tuberculosis. Isoniazid and a related drug, iproniazid, were among the first drugs to be referred to as antidepressants. Psychiatric use stopped in 1961 following reports of hepatotoxicity. Use against tuberculosis continued, as isoniazid's effectiveness against the disease outweighs its risks. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies isoniazid as critically important for human medicine. Isoniazid is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === Tuberculosis === Isoniazid is often used to treat latent and active tuberculosis infections. In persons with isoniazid-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid are usually effective when persons adhere to the prescribed treatment. However, in persons with isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid have a high rate of failure. Isoniazid has been approved as prophylactic therapy for the following populations: People with HIV infection and a PPD (purified protein derivative) reaction of at least 5 mm induration Contacts of people with tuberculosis and who have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration People whose PPD reactions convert from negative to positive in a two-year period – at least 10 mm induration for those up to 35 years of age, and at least 15 mm induration for those at least 35 years old People with pulmonary damage on their chest X-ray that is likely to be due to healed tuberculosis and also have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration Injection drug users whose HIV status is negative who have a PPD reaction at least 10 mm induration People with a PPD of greater than or equal to 10 mm induration who are foreign-born from high prevalence geographical regions, low-income populations, and patients residing in long-term facilities Isoniazid can be used alone or in combination with Rifampin for treatment of latent tuberculosis, or as part of a four-drug regimen for treatment of active tuberculosis. The drug regimen typically requires daily or weekly oral administration for a period of three to nine months, often under Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) supervision. === Non-tuberculous mycobacteria === Isoniazid was widely used in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex as part of a regimen including rifampicin and ethambutol. Evidence suggests that isoniazid prevents mycolic acid synthesis in M. avium complex as in M. tuberculosis and although this is not bactericidal to M. avium complex, it greatly potentiates the effect of rifampicin. The introduction of macrolides led to this use greatly decreasing. However, since rifampicin is broadly underdosed in M. avium complex treatment, this effect may be worth re-investigating. === Special populations === It is recommended that women with active tuberculosis who are pregnant or breastfeeding take isoniazid. Preventive therapy should be delayed until after giving birth. Nursing mothers excrete a relatively low and non-toxic concentration of INH in breast milk, and their babies are at low risk for side effects. Both pregnant women and infants being breastfed by mothers taking INH should take vitamin B6 in its pyridoxine form to minimize the risk of peripheral nerve damage. Vitamin B6 is used to prevent isoniazid-induced B6 deficiency and neuropathy in people with a risk factor, such as pregnancy, lactation, HIV infection, alcoholism, diabetes, kidney failure, or malnutrition. People with liver dysfunction are at a higher risk for hepatitis caused by INH, and may need a lower dose. Levels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers, pregnant women, IV drug users, people over 35, and those who have chronic liver disease, severe kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH. == Side effects == Up to 20% of people taking isoniazid experience peripheral neuropathy when taking daily doses of 6 mg/kg of body weight or higher. Gastrointestinal reactions include nausea and vomiting. Aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis due to lack of production of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells by the bone marrow respectively, can also occur. Hypersensitivity reactions are also common and can present with a maculopapular rash and fever. Gynecomastia may occur. Asymptomatic elevation of serum liver enzyme concentrations occurs in 10% to 20% of people taking INH, and liver enzyme concentrations usually return to normal even when treatment is continued. Isoniazid has a boxed warning for severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis, which is age-dependent at a rate of 0.3% in people 21 to 35 years old and over 2% in those over age 50. Symptoms suggestive of liver toxicity include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, and loss of appetite. Black and Hispanic women are at higher risk for isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity. When it happens, isoniazid-induced liver toxicity has been shown to occur in 50% of patients within the first 2 months of therapy. Some recommend that liver function should be monitored carefully in all people receiving it, but others recommend monitoring only in certain populations. Headache, poor concentration, weight gain, poor memory, insomnia, and depression have all been associated with isoniazid use. All patients and healthcare workers should be aware of these serious side effects, especially if suicidal ideation or behavior are suspected. Isoniazid is associated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency because of its similar structure. Isoniazid is also associated with increased excretion of pyridoxine. Pyridoxal phosphate (a derivative of pyridoxine) is required for δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in heme synthesis. Therefore, isoniazid-induced pyridoxine deficiency causes insufficient heme formation in early red blood cells, leading to sideroblastic anemia. Isoniazid was found to significantly elevate the in vivo concentration of GABA and homocarnosine in a single subject via magnetic resonance spectroscopy. == Drug interactions == People taking isoniazid and acetaminophen are at risk of acetaminophen toxicity. Isoniazid is thought to induce a liver enzyme which causes a larger amount of acetaminophen to be metabolized to a toxic form. Isoniazid decreases the metabolism of carbamazepine, thus slowing down its clearance from the body. People taking carbamazepine should have their carbamazepine levels monitored and, if necessary, have their dose adjusted accordingly. It is possible that isoniazid may decrease the serum levels of ketoconazole after long-term treatment. This is seen with the simultaneous use of rifampin, isoniazid, and ketoconazole. Isoniazid may increase the amount of phenytoin in the body. The doses of phenytoin may need to be adjusted when given with isoniazid. Isoniazid may increase the plasma levels of theophylline. There are some cases of theophylline slowing down isoniazid elimination. Both theophylline and isoniazid levels should be monitored. Valproate levels may increase when taken with isoniazid. Valproate levels should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary. == Mechanism of action == Isoniazid is a prodrug that inhibits the formation of the mycobacterial cell wall. Isoniazid must be activated by KatG, a bacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. KatG catalyzes the formation of the isonicotinic acyl radical, which spontaneously couples with NADH to form the nicotinoyl-NAD adduct. This complex binds tightly to the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase InhA, thereby blocking the natural enoyl-AcpM substrate and the action of fatty acid synthase. This process inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are required components of the mycobacterial cell wall. A range of radicals are produced by KatG activation of isoniazid, including nitric oxide, which has also been shown to be important in the action of another antimycobacterial prodrug pretomanid. Isoniazid is bactericidal to rapidly dividing mycobacteria, but is bacteriostatic if the mycobacteria are slow-growing. It inhibits the cytochrome P450 system and hence acts as a source of free radicals. Isoniazid is a mild non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I). It inhibits diamine oxidase more strongly. These two actions are possible explanations for its antidepressant action as well as its ability to cause mania. == Metabolism == Isoniazid reaches therapeutic concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and within caseous granulomas. It is metabolized in the liver via acetylation into acetylhydrazine. Two forms of the enzyme are responsible for acetylation, so some patients metabolize the drug more quickly than others. Hence, the half-life is bimodal, with ""slow acetylators"" and ""fast acetylators"". A graph of number of people versus time shows peaks at one and three hours. The height of the peaks depends on the ethnicities of the people being tested. The metabolites are excreted in the urine. Doses do not usually have to be adjusted in case of renal failure. == Preparation == Isoniazid is an isonicotinic acid derivative. It is manufactured using 4-cyanopyridine and hydrazine hydrate. In another method, isoniazid was claimed to have been made from citric acid starting material. It can in theory be made from methyl isonicotinate, which is labelled a semiochemical. == Brand names == Hydra, Hyzyd, Isovit, Laniazid, Nydrazid, Rimifon, and Stanozide. == Other uses == === Chromatography === Isonicotinic acid hydrazide is also used in chromatography to differentiate between various degrees of conjugation in organic compounds barring the ketone functional group. The test works by forming a hydrazone which can be detected by its bathochromic shift. === Dogs === Isoniazid may be used for dogs, but there have been concerns it can cause seizures. == References == == Further reading == Romero JA, Kuczler FJ (February 1998).

2920,"('Maprotiline (hydrochloride)', 'Maprotiline', 'Maprotylina [polish]', 'Maprotylina', 'Maprotilinum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Maprotiline, sold under the brand name Ludiomil among others, is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) that is used in the treatment of depression. It may alternatively be classified as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), specifically a secondary amine. In terms of its chemistry and pharmacology, maprotiline is closely related to such-other secondary-amine TCAs as nortriptyline and protriptyline and has similar effects to them, albeit with more distinct anxiolytic effects. Additionally, whereas protriptyline tends to be somewhat more stimulating and in any case is distinctly more-or-less non-sedating, mild degrees of sedation may be experienced with maprotiline. == Medical uses == Maprotiline is used in the treatment of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety and has similar efficacy to the antidepressant drug moclobemide. This finding has also been validated by a group of general practitioners who compared the respective efficacy and tolerability of maprotiline and moclobemide. Treatment of depression of all forms and severities (endogenous, psychotic, involutional, and neurotic), especially depression associated with agitation or anxiety Panic disorder Neuropathic pain, including painful polyneuropathy in diabetics and non-diabetics alike. Treatment of the depressive phase of bipolar affective disorder For the symptomatic relief of anxiety, tension or insomnia The use of maprotiline in the treatment of enuresis in pediatric patients has so far not been systematically explored and its use is not recommended. Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population in general have not been established. Anyone considering the use of maprotiline in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. A very small body of research has also explored the potential of maprotiline in treating diabetic kidney disease and it has been measured against amitriptyline in this regard. Maprotiline and fluoxetine have also been found, among certain lines of research, to have quite potent anti-profilerative effects against certain forms of cancer of the Burkitt lymphoma type. One study also bore ought a certain level of evidence regarding maprotiline’s ability to suppress both cholesterol biosynthesis and hepatocellular carcinoma liver-cancer progression. Maprotiline was also measured against imipramine, fluoxetine and ketamine in an experiment-model involving two different kinds of chicken differently-conditioned against stress, including (black) Australorps in the proposed treatment of treatment-resistant depression in humans. In general, lower dosages are recommended for patients over 60 years of age. Dosages of 50 mg to 75 mg daily are usually satisfactory as maintenance therapy for elderly patients who do not tolerate higher amounts. In any case, 225 m.g./d. is the absolute-maximum highest recommended dose for this drug, as any more can predispose more significantly to seizures. 150 m.g. is the average optimal daily dose for otherwise-healthy patients who can tolerate a full dose. === Available forms === Coated tablets: 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg Injectable concentrate, 25 mg == Contraindications == In generalised theory, maprotiline (as with other tricyclic antidepressants, besides trimipramine and possibly clomipramine) may somewhat worsen certain features of schizophrenia, necessitating caution in prescribing them to someone with it and continuation of the antipsychotic treatment (e.g., with risperidone or olanzapine). However, certain bodies of evidence have found maprotiline a useful augment in treating some of the negative, or ""anaesthetic"", symptoms of schizophrenia and in probable extension pronounced schizoidia (including the characteristic deterioration in personal grooming/appearance). It has also been weighed against fluvoxamine in this overall regard (i.e., treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia), with fluvoxamine evidencing clear superiority therein. Maprotiline, however, may be specifically useful for the ""negative symptom"" of alogia (poverty of thought and/or speech) and in this regard was found demonstrably superior to the other control-drugs (alprazolam, bromocriptine, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nortriptyline) in one study. Citalopram, clomipramine and fluvoxamine appeared particularly useful in the study for reducing affective blunting, with alprazolam (Xanax) and maprotiline ranking joint-next. Patients with bipolar affective disorder should not receive antidepressants whilst in a manic phase (including hypomania) under any circumstances whatsoever. (By the same analogy, people with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type should not be taking maprotiline or other antidepressants while manic.) This is because antidepressants are known to come with the risk of worsening acute mania or precipitating it in so vulnerably-predisposed people. They (antidepressants) may also negatively interfere with the treatment of mixed bipolar states (pure or schizo-affective), where electro-convulsive therapy (generally bilateral), valproate and antipsychotics prove more beneficial (lithium should not be administered concurrently with E.C.T. treatment, as it may induce severe confusion). However, maprotiline (at a high dose) was put to good use in one particular case, of one young man presenting with what was very-possibly a mixed-manic episode with a heavy preponderance of depressive symptoms (appearing as depression with significant narcissistic traits; including extrapunitive tendencies/blame-shifting, entitlement and interpersonal exploitation; and provisionally considered narcissistic depression). The maprotiline was combined with mirtazapine (low-dose), sodium valproate and aripiprazole. === Absolute === Hypersensitivity to maprotiline or to other TCAs and TeCAs Hypertrophy of the prostate gland with urine hesitancy Closed angle glaucoma === Special caution needed === Concomitant treatment with a MAO inhibitor Serious impairment of liver and kidney function Epilepsy and other conditions that lower the seizure threshold (active brain tumors, alcohol withdrawal, other medications) Serious cardiovascular conditions (arrhythmias, heart insufficiency, state after myocardial infarction etc.) Treatment of patients under age 18 === Suicidal patients === As with other antidepressants, maprotiline increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of maprotiline or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Maprotiline is not approved for use in pediatric patients. === Pregnancy and lactation === Reproduction studies have been performed in female laboratory rabbits, mice, and rats at doses up to 1.3, 7, and 9 times the maximum daily human dose respectively and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to maprotiline. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Maprotiline is excreted in breast milk. At steady-state, the concentrations in milk correspond closely to the concentrations in whole blood. Caution should be exercised when maprotiline hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. == Side effects == The side-effect profile is comparable to other TCAs and TeCAS and many of the following are due to anticholinergic (which are less prominent than those of most TCAs) and antihistamine effects. Most often seen are: Dizziness Drowsiness Somnolence Fatigue Dry mouth (and complications of long-term uncontrolled dry mouth such as dental caries) Constipation Vertigo Nausea (rare, incidence of ~2%) and vomiting Increased appetite and weight gain Orthostatic hypotension, hypertension, sinus tachycardia, heart-block, arrhythmias and other cardiac effects Sexual dysfunction in men: impotence, priapism, delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, decreased libido Sexual dysfunction in women: decreased libido, vaginal dryness, painful sexual intercourse, anorgasmia Allergic skin reactions such as rash or urticaria (more often than with other antidepressants). Rarely, severe skin reactions such as erythema multiforme can occur. Photosensitivity Agitation, confusion Induction of hypomania or mania in patients with underlying bipolar affective disorder Psychotic symptoms Tremor Extrapyramidal symptoms Headache Seizures (at high doses) Rare haematological complications: leukopenia and agranulocytosis (dangerous fall in white blood cells) Fever Urinary retention Maprotiline causes a strong initial sedation (first 2 to 3 weeks of therapy) and is therefore indicated to treat agitated patients or those with suicidal risks. It causes anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary hesitancy, etc.) with much lower incidence than amitriptyline. Originally, the manufacturer claimed that maprotiline is better tolerated than other TCAs and TeCAs. However, seizures, leukopenia and skin reactions occur more often with maprotiline than with comparable drugs (e.g., amitriptyline, protriptyline, mirtazapine). Indeed, seizures are greater risk for concern with maprotiline than with all other tricyclic antidepressants (rising from 75 mg, becoming significant at daily doses ≥ 200 m.g.), including clomipramine. It should thus be prescribed with particular, if not extreme, caution to people with a history of epilepsy/seizures of any other kind. In any case, the total daily dose should be kept to ≤ 225 milligrams. Maprotiline has no known potential for abuse and psychological dependence. === Withdrawal === Withdrawal symptoms frequently seen when treatment with maprotiline is stopped abruptly (agitation, anxiety, insomnia, sometimes activation of mania or rebound depression) can be avoided by reducing the daily dose of maprotiline gradually by approximately 25% each week. If treatment has to be stopped at once for medical reasons, the use of a benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam, diazepam) for a maximum of 4 weeks as needed will usually suppress withdrawal symptoms. == Interactions == Maprotiline does have a wide range of possible interactions. Some are typical for TCAs and TeCAs, others are caused by specific metabolic effects (e.g., high plasma-protein-binding) of maprotiline: Increased drug actions: Other antidepressants, barbiturates, narcotics, sedating antihistamines, anticonvulsive drugs, alcohol – resulting in increased central depression and necessitating some caution when using any of these drugs alongside maprotiline Drugs with potential anti-muscarinic/anti-cholinergic activity (antiparkinsonian agents, atropine, amantadine, clozapine and tricyclic antidepressants besides maprotiline) – resulting in increased anti-muscarinic effects (dry mouth, constipation, etc.) Sympathomimetics (also those used in local anesthetics like noradrenaline) – sympathomimetic effects increased (increased blood-pressure, pulse-rate, paleness of skin, etc.) Nitrates and antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers) – increased antihypertensive action with pronounced fall in blood pressure Although concurrent administration of tricyclic antidepressants (likewise with SSRIs) and MAOIs has been considered particularly dangerous, even fatal, across various medical and pharmaceutical lines across the decades, the premise for this line of thinking, although commonly accepted, may be erroneous. Specialist-research into this and practical clinical experience involving the co-administration of tricyclics and MAOIs have suggested that it is only tricyclics with strong specific serotonin-reuptake inhibitory action (clomipramine and, to a lesser extent, imipramine) that are dangerous to give in combination with MAOIs. Other antidepressants; which may or may not have a significant serotoninergic background otherwise but either way lack in particularly appreciable reuptake-inhibition therein specifically (e.g., mirtazapine, amitriptyline, trazodone, lofepramine, nortriptyline); may be safe to take alongside MAOIs, where the likes of venlafaxine, SSRIs and clomipramine are not. With maprotiline, this has been demonstrated to be the case with moclobemide, a drug it is often compared and considered somewhat analogous (along certain lines) to, and, tentatively, brofaromine (a research-agent MAOI which was never brought to full marketing development). Moclobemide specifically, however, may increase maprptiline plasma-levels and may necessitate dose-modification(s). In any case, however, it is very-strongly advised that an MAOI is added to the (compatible) tricyclic and not the other way around, as adding a tricyclic to an existing treatment-regime involving an MAOI may significantly increase the risk of going into hypertensive crisis. Decreased drug actions: Guanethidine, reserpine, guanfacine: anti-hypertensive effects decreased Clonidine: anti-hypertensive effects decreased and risk of (massive) rebound hypertension. Other types of interaction: Drugs which induce certain enzymes in the liver, e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine and oral anti-conceptive drugs, enhance the elimination of maprotiline and decrease its antidepressant effects. Additionally the blood-concentrations of phenytoin or carbamazepine may be increased, leading to a higher incidents of side effects. The concomitant use of maprotiline and neuroleptics can lead to increased maprotiline blood-levels and to seizures. Combining maprotiline and thioridazine could induce severe arrhythmias. Additionally, increased blood-levels of maprotiline are possible, if certain beta-blocking agents (e.g., propranolol) are given concomitantly. Maprotiline may amplify the actions of coumarin-type anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, phenprocoumon). The plasma-prothrombin-activity must be assessed closely in order to avoid overt bleedings. Maprotiline can increase the actions of oral antidiabetic drugs (sulfonylureas) and insulin. Diabetic patients should have regular assessments of their blood-glucose-levels. The concomitant application with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine may lead to significantly increased plasma-levels of maprotiline, with a correspondingly (and substantially) incidence of maprotiline side effects. Owing to the long half-lives of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, this effect may persist for quite-some time. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Maprotiline exhibits strong effects as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with only weak actions the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine. It is also a strong antagonist of the H1 receptor, a moderate antagonist of the 5-HT2 and α1-adrenergic receptors, and a weak antagonist of the D2 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Maprotiline has also more recently been identified as a potent antagonist of the 5-HT7 receptor, with this action potentially playing an important role in its antidepressant effectiveness. The drug is a strong antihistamine, but unlike most TCAs, has minimal anticholinergic effects. The pharmacological profile of maprotiline explains its antidepressant, sedative, anxiolytic, and sympathomimetic activities. In accordance to the pharmacological characteristics it is used in the treatment of depression, such as depression associated with agitation or anxiety. Additionally, it shows strong antagonism against reserpine-induced effects in animal studies, as do the other 'classical' antidepressants. Although maprotiline behaves in most regards as a 'first-generation antidepressant' it is commonly referred to as 'second-generation antidepressant'. The postulated mechanism of maprotiline is that it acts primarily by potentiation of central adrenergic synapses by blocking reuptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings. This pharmacological action is thought to be primarily responsible for the drug's antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. It is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with only weak effects on serotonin and dopamine reuptake. At higher doses, however, maprotiline increases serotonergic transmission and increases the level of serotonin available. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral use absorption is good. It binds to plasma proteins 80–90%. Maximal plasma concentration is reached 6 hours after use. The mean time to peak is 12 hours. The terminal half-life of averages 51 hours. == Chemistry == Maprotiline is a tetracyclic compound and is grouped with the TeCAs. Its chemical name is N-methyl-9,10-ethanoanthracen-9(10H)-propylamine. The drug has a dibenzobicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene (9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethanoanthracene) ring system; that is, a tricyclic anthracene ring system with an ethylene bridge across the central ring. This results in it having a unique three-dimensional central ring (a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane or 1,4-endoethylenecyclohexane ring) and being a tetracyclic rather than a tricyclic compound. However, it could also or alternatively be considered to be a tricyclic and hence a TCA. In addition to its heterocyclic ring system, maprotiline has an alkylamine side chain attached similarly to other TCAs (but notably unlike other TeCAs). In terms of the side chain, it is a secondary amine, and its chemical structure, aside from the ethylene link in the central ring, is similar to that of secondary amine TCAs like nortriptyline and protriptyline. In accordance, the pharmacology of maprotiline is very similar to that of secondary amine TCAs. Maprotiline is very similar in structure to the anxiolytic, sedative, and muscle relaxant drug benzoctamine (Tacitin). The only structural difference between the two compounds is in the length of their side chain. However, this modification results in considerable differences in their pharmacological and therapeutic effects. == History == Maprotiline was developed by Ciba (now operated by Novartis). It was patented in 1966 and was first described in the literature in 1969. The drug was introduced for medical use in 1974. Generics are now widely available. It was introduced after most of the other TCAs but was the first TeCA to be developed and marketed, with the TeCAs mianserin and amoxapine following shortly thereafter and mirtazapine being introduced later on. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Maprotiline is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while maprotiline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are maprotilina, in German is maprotilin, and in Latin is maprotilinum. The methanesulfonate (mesylate) salt is known unofficially as maprotiline methanesulfonate. === Brand names === Maprotiline is marketed throughout the world, mainly under the brand name Ludiomil. It is also available under a variety of other brand names including Deprilept, Maprolu, and Psymion among others. Although it remains available across the world, it was discontinued in the United Kingdom in July 2006. Mylan, a key manufacturer of maprotiline in the United States, discontinued production in June 2021. == References ==",Maprotiline,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.390948667307384e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005609607324004173)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682158.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Maprotiline: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682158.html?utm_source=openai')])"

2922,"('Ethylene dimethanesulfonate', 'Ethylene methanesulfonate', 'Ethylene bis(methanesulfonate)', 'Ethane dimethanesulphonate', 'Ethylene glycol dimesylate')",Medical," The dose-dependent effects of ethylene dimethanesulfonate (EDS) on transferrin production and viability of Sertoli cells in culture have been investigated. Sertoli cells, isolated from the testes of 20-day-old rats, exhibited decreased transferrin production in response to EDS at a dose of 0.3 mM. The suppression of transferrin synthesis by EDS reached a maximum (15% of control) with a dose of 1.1 mM, without significant cell mortality. An EDS dose of 2.7 mM proved lethal to Sertoli cells, reducing the number of viable cells per well by 85%. Sertoli cells preincubated with a sublethal dose of EDS (0.3-0.5 mM) appeared to recover upon removal of EDS from the culture medium, as evidenced by an increase in transferrin mRNA levels. Sertoli cells given 2.7 mM EDS did not recover. These data demonstrate a direct cytotoxic effect of EDS on Sertoli cell function at relatively low doses and a lethal effect of the alkylating agent at high doses. These results also indicate that EDS may affect Sertoli cells in vivo and, consequently, directly affect the function of the seminiferous epithelium. Ethylene dimethanesulfonate (EDS) is a molecule with known selective cytotoxicity on adult Leydig cells. A single intraperitoneal injection in rats but not mice, leads to male androgen deprivation and infertility.  Ultrastructural changes in the interstitial cells of the adult rat testis were studied up to 45 days after administration of a single dose (100 mg/kg) of the antifertility compound ethylene dimethanesulfonate (EDS). Most Leydig cells showed degenerative changes 12 h after treatment. Twenty-four and 48 h after injection, all Leydig cells observed showed gross degenerative changes. At 4 and 14 days, intact Leydig cells could not be identified in the interstitial spaces. Twenty-one days after treatment with EDS, small Leydig cells were visible, and at 45 days, Leydig cells appeared normal. The seminiferous epithelium appeared morphologically normal until 4 days after injection of EDS, when slight abnormalities were observed. At 14 and 21 days, the seminiferous epithelium was grossly abnormal, but at 48 days, spermatogenesis appeared normal. Twelve, 24, and 48 h after treatment, large quantities of material, presumably from dead Leydig cells, were observed within the macrophage cytoplasm. The predominant cell in the interstitial space 4 and 14 days after EDS was the macrophage. Inclusions from the dead Leydig cells within the cytoplasm of the macrophages had almost disappeared. LH receptors (hCG binding) in testicular homogenates were consistent with the cytological changes in Leydig cells. Receptor concentration was low at 24 h and was almost zero at 4 days. This change was accompanied by a decrease in serum testosterone to castrate levels by 2 days. The responses of the endocrine system to destruction of the Leydig cell by EDS, as monitored by serum FSH, LH, and testosterone, were slower than those after castration, indicating that the response to EDS reflects the time required to kill the Leydig cell rather than direct impairment of the steroidogenic pathway. These experiments demonstrate that Leydig cells can be specifically destroyed by a cytotoxic drug. The availability of a specific cytotoxic agent for Leydig cells offers further opportunities to study the interrelationships between the Leydig cell and the seminiferous tubule.",Ethylene dimethanesulfonate,PUBMED,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.42937391996383667), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.8694177269935608), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0056341420859098434)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.12692810595035553), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
2923,"('Chromium(iii) acetate', 'Chromium acetate', 'Chromic acetate', 'Chromium triacetate', 'Acetic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Acetic acid , systematically named ethanoic acid , is an acidic, colourless liquid and organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H, C2H4O2, or HC2H3O2). Vinegar is at least 4% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. It has been used, as a component of vinegar, throughout history from at least the third century BC. Acetic acid is the second simplest carboxylic acid (after formic acid). It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical across various fields, used primarily in the production of cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, and synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in descaling agents. In the food industry, acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code E260 as an acidity regulator and as a condiment. In biochemistry, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. The global demand for acetic acid as of 2023 is about 17.88 million metric tonnes per year (t/a). Most of the world's acetic acid is produced via the carbonylation of methanol. Its production and subsequent industrial use poses health hazards to workers, including incidental skin damage and chronic respiratory injuries from inhalation. == Nomenclature == The trivial name ""acetic acid"" is the most commonly used and preferred IUPAC name. The systematic name ""ethanoic acid"", a valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the substitutive nomenclature. The name ""acetic acid"" derives from the Latin word for vinegar, ""acetum"", which is related to the word ""acid"" itself. ""Glacial acetic acid"" is a name for water-free (anhydrous) acetic acid. Similar to the German name ""Eisessig"" (""ice vinegar""), the name comes from the solid ice-like crystals that form with agitation, slightly below room temperature at 16.6 °C (61.9 °F). Acetic acid can never be truly water-free in an atmosphere that contains water, so the presence of 0.1% water in glacial acetic acid lowers its melting point by 0.2 °C. A common symbol for acetic acid is AcOH (or HOAc), where Ac is the pseudoelement symbol representing the acetyl group CH3−C(=O)−; the conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO−), is thus represented as AcO−. Acetate is the ion resulting from loss of H+ from acetic acid. The name ""acetate"" can also refer to a salt containing this anion, or an ester of acetic acid. (The symbol Ac for the acetyl functional group is not to be confused with the symbol Ac for the element actinium; context prevents confusion among organic chemists). To better reflect its structure, acetic acid is often written as CH3−C(O)OH, CH3−C(=O)−OH, CH3COOH, and CH3CO2H. In the context of acid–base reactions, the abbreviation HAc is sometimes used, where Ac in this case is a symbol for acetate (rather than acetyl). The carboxymethyl functional group derived from removing one hydrogen from the methyl group of acetic acid has the chemical formula −CH2−C(=O)−OH. == History == Vinegar was known early in civilization as the natural result of exposure of beer and wine to air because acetic acid-producing bacteria are present globally. The use of acetic acid in alchemy extends into the third century BC, when the Greek philosopher Theophrastus described how vinegar acted on metals to produce pigments useful in art, including white lead (lead carbonate) and verdigris, a green mixture of copper salts including copper(II) acetate. Ancient Romans boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called sapa. Sapa that was produced in lead pots was rich in lead acetate, a sweet substance also called sugar of lead or sugar of Saturn, which contributed to lead poisoning among the Roman aristocracy. In the 16th-century German alchemist Andreas Libavius described the production of acetone from the dry distillation of lead acetate, ketonic decarboxylation. The presence of water in vinegar has such a profound effect on acetic acid's properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and the acid found in vinegar were two different substances. French chemist Pierre Adet proved them identical. In 1845 German chemist Hermann Kolbe synthesised acetic acid from inorganic compounds for the first time. This reaction sequence consisted of chlorination of carbon disulfide to carbon tetrachloride, followed by pyrolysis to tetrachloroethylene and aqueous chlorination to trichloroacetic acid, and concluded with electrolytic reduction to acetic acid. By 1910, most glacial acetic acid was obtained from the pyroligneous liquor, a product of the distillation of wood. The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of glacial acetic acid, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye. Because both methanol and carbon monoxide are commodity raw materials, methanol carbonylation long appeared to be attractive precursors to acetic acid. Henri Dreyfus at British Celanese developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925. However, a lack of practical materials that could contain the corrosive reaction mixture at the high pressures needed (200 atm or more) discouraged commercialization of these routes. The first commercial methanol carbonylation process, which used a cobalt catalyst, was developed by German chemical company BASF in 1963. In 1968, a rhodium-based catalyst (cis−[Rh(CO)2I2]−) was discovered that could operate efficiently at lower pressure with almost no by-products. US chemical company Monsanto Company built the first plant using this catalyst in 1970, and rhodium-catalyzed methanol carbonylation became the dominant method of acetic acid production (see Monsanto process). In the late 1990s, BP Chemicals commercialised the Cativa catalyst ([Ir(CO)2I2]−), which is promoted by iridium for greater efficiency. Known as the Cativa process, the iridium-catalyzed production of glacial acetic acid is greener, and has largely supplanted the Monsanto process, often in the same production plants. === Interstellar medium === Interstellar acetic acid was discovered in 1996 by a team led by David Mehringer using the former Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory and the former Millimeter Array located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. It was first detected in the Sagittarius B2 North molecular cloud (also known as the Sgr B2 Large Molecule Heimat source). Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections. == Properties == === Acidity === The hydrogen centre in the carboxyl group (−COOH) in carboxylic acids such as acetic acid can separate from the molecule by ionization: CH3COOH ⇌ CH3CO−2 + H+ Because of this release of the proton (H+), acetic acid has acidic character. Acetic acid is a weak monoprotic acid. In aqueous solution, it has a pKa value of 4.76. Its conjugate base is acetate (CH3COO−). A 1.0 M solution (about the concentration of domestic vinegar) has a pH of 2.4, indicating that merely 0.4% of the acetic acid molecules are dissociated. === Structure === In solid acetic acid, the molecules form chains of individual molecules interconnected by hydrogen bonds. In the vapour phase at 120 °C (248 °F), dimers can be detected. Dimers also occur in the liquid phase in dilute solutions with non-hydrogen-bonding solvents, and to a certain extent in pure acetic acid, but are disrupted by hydrogen-bonding solvents. The dissociation enthalpy of the dimer is estimated at 65.0–66.0 kJ/mol, and the dissociation entropy at 154–157 J mol−1 K−1. Other carboxylic acids engage in similar intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. === Solvent properties === Liquid acetic acid is a hydrophilic (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils as well as polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not miscible at all compositions, and solubility of acetic acid in alkanes declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent in the production of dimethyl terephthalate. === Biochemistry === At physiological pHs, acetic acid is usually fully ionised to acetate in aqueous solution. The acetyl group, formally derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. Typically, it is bound to coenzyme A by acetyl-CoA synthetase enzymes, where it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the fatty acids), acetic acid does not occur in natural triglycerides. Most of the acetate generated in cells for use in acetyl-CoA is synthesized directly from ethanol or pyruvate. However, the artificial triglyceride triacetin (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines; this additive is metabolized to glycerol and acetic acid in the body. Acetic acid is produced and excreted by acetic acid bacteria, notably the genus Acetobacter and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid is produced naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid is also a component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent. == Production == Acetic acid is produced industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made for use in the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid can be purified via fractional freezing using an ice bath. The water and other impurities will remain liquid while the acetic acid will precipitate out. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5 Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1 Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7 Mt/a. Another 1.5 Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5 Mt/a. Since then, the global production has increased from 10.7 Mt/a in 2010 to 17.88 Mt/a in 2023. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi. === Methanol carbonylation === Most acetic acid is produced by methanol carbonylation. In this process, methanol and carbon monoxide react to produce acetic acid according to the equation: The process involves iodomethane as an intermediate, and occurs in three steps. A metal carbonyl catalyst is needed for the carbonylation (step 2). CH3OH + HI → CH3I + H2O CH3I + CO → CH3COI CH3COI + H2O → CH3COOH + HI Two related processes exist for the carbonylation of methanol: the rhodium-catalyzed Monsanto process, and the iridium-catalyzed Cativa process. The latter process is greener and more efficient and has largely supplanted the former process. Catalytic amounts of water are used in both processes, but the Cativa process requires less, so the water-gas shift reaction is suppressed, and fewer by-products are formed. By altering the process conditions, acetic anhydride may also be produced in plants using rhodium catalysis. === Acetaldehyde oxidation === Prior to the commercialization of the Monsanto process, most acetic acid was produced by oxidation of acetaldehyde. This remains the second-most-important manufacturing method, although it is usually not competitive with the carbonylation of methanol. The acetaldehyde can be produced by hydration of acetylene. This was the dominant technology in the early 1900s. Light naphtha components are readily oxidized by oxygen or even air to give peroxides, which decompose to produce acetic acid according to the chemical equation, illustrated with butane: 2 C4H10 + 5 O2 → 4 CH3CO2H + 2 H2O Such oxidations require metal catalyst, such as the naphthenate salts of manganese, cobalt, and chromium. The typical reaction is conducted at temperatures and pressures designed to be as hot as possible while still keeping the butane a liquid. Typical reaction conditions are 150 °C (302 °F) and 55 atm. Side-products may also form, including butanone, ethyl acetate, formic acid, and propionic acid. These side-products are also commercially valuable, and the reaction conditions may be altered to produce more of them where needed. However, the separation of acetic acid from these by-products adds to the cost of the process. Similar conditions and catalysts are used for butane oxidation, the oxygen in air to produce acetic acid can oxidize acetaldehyde. 2 CH3CHO + O2 → 2 CH3CO2H Using modern catalysts, this reaction can have an acetic acid yield greater than 95%. The major side-products are ethyl acetate, formic acid, and formaldehyde, all of which have lower boiling points than acetic acid and are readily separated by distillation. === Ethylene oxidation === Acetaldehyde may be prepared from ethylene via the Wacker process, and then oxidised as above. In more recent times, chemical company Showa Denko, which opened an ethylene oxidation plant in Ōita, Japan, in 1997, commercialised a cheaper single-stage conversion of ethylene to acetic acid. The process is catalyzed by a palladium metal catalyst supported on a heteropoly acid such as silicotungstic acid. A similar process uses the same metal catalyst on silicotungstic acid and silica: C2H4 + O2 → CH3CO2H It is thought to be competitive with methanol carbonylation for smaller plants (100–250 kt/a), depending on the local price of ethylene. === Oxidative fermentation === For most of human history, acetic acid bacteria of the genus Acetobacter have made acetic acid, in the form of vinegar. Given sufficient oxygen, these bacteria can produce vinegar from a variety of alcoholic foodstuffs. Commonly used feeds include apple cider, wine, and fermented grain, malt, rice, or potato mashes. The overall chemical reaction facilitated by these bacteria is: C2H5OH + O2 → CH3COOH + H2O A dilute alcohol solution inoculated with Acetobacter and kept in a warm, airy place will become vinegar over the course of a few months. Industrial vinegar-making methods accelerate this process by improving the supply of oxygen to the bacteria. The first batches of vinegar produced by fermentation probably followed errors in the winemaking process. If must is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on the grapes. As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe and ready for processing into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners did not understand the process. One of the first modern commercial processes was the ""fast method"" or ""German method"", first practised in Germany in 1823. In this process, fermentation takes place in a tower packed with wood shavings or charcoal. The alcohol-containing feed is trickled into the top of the tower, and fresh air supplied from the bottom by either natural or forced convection. The improved air supply in this process cut the time to prepare vinegar from months to weeks. Nowadays, most vinegar is made in submerged tank culture, first described in 1949 by Otto Hromatka and Heinrich Ebner. In this method, alcohol is fermented to vinegar in a continuously stirred tank, and oxygen is supplied by bubbling air through the solution. Using modern applications of this method, vinegar of 15% acetic acid can be prepared in only 24 hours in batch process, even 20% in 60-hour fed-batch process. === Anaerobic fermentation === Species of anaerobic bacteria, including members of the genus Clostridium or Acetobacterium, can convert sugars to acetic acid directly without creating ethanol as an intermediate. The overall chemical reaction conducted by these bacteria may be represented as: C6H12O6 → 3 CH3COOH These acetogenic bacteria produce acetic acid from one-carbon compounds, including methanol, carbon monoxide, or a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen: 2 CO2 + 4 H2 → CH3COOH + 2 H2O This ability of Clostridium to metabolize sugars directly, or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs, suggests that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol-oxidizers like Acetobacter. However, Clostridium bacteria are less acid-tolerant than Acetobacter. Even the most acid-tolerant Clostridium strains can produce vinegar in concentrations of only a few per cent, compared to Acetobacter strains that can produce vinegar in concentrations up to 20%. At present, it remains more cost-effective to produce vinegar using Acetobacter, rather than using Clostridium and concentrating it. As a result, although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940, their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications. == Uses == Acetic acid is a chemical reagent for the production of chemical compounds. The largest single use of acetic acid is in the production of vinyl acetate monomer, closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester production. The volume of acetic acid used in vinegar is comparatively small. === Vinyl acetate monomer === The primary use of acetic acid is the production of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM). In 2008, this application was estimated to consume a third of the world's production of acetic acid. The reaction consists of ethylene and acetic acid with oxygen over a palladium catalyst, conducted in the gas phase. 2 H3C−COOH + 2 C2H4 + O2 → 2 H3C−CO−O−CH=CH2 + 2 H2O Vinyl acetate can be polymerised to polyvinyl acetate or other polymers, which are components in paints and adhesives. === Ester production === The major esters of acetic acid are commonly used as solvents for inks, paints and coatings. The esters include ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, and propyl acetate. They are typically produced by catalyzed reaction from acetic acid and the corresponding alcohol: CH3COO−H + HO−R → CH3COO−R + H2O, R = general alkyl group For example, acetic acid and ethanol gives ethyl acetate and water. CH3COO−H + HO−CH2CH3 → CH3COO−CH2CH3 + H2O Most acetate esters, however, are produced from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates are used as solvents for nitrocellulose, acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers are produced from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, have been shown to be harmful to human reproduction. === Acetic anhydride === The product of the condensation of two molecules of acetic acid is acetic anhydride. The worldwide production of acetic anhydride is a major application, and uses approximately 25% to 30% of the global production of acetic acid. The main process involves dehydration of acetic acid to give ketene at 700–750 °C. Ketene is thereafter reacted with acetic acid to obtain the anhydride: CH3CO2H → CH2=C=O + H2O CH3CO2H + CH2=C=O → (CH3CO)2O Acetic anhydride is an acetylation agent. As such, its major application is for cellulose acetate, a synthetic textile also used for photographic film. Acetic anhydride is also a reagent for the production of heroin and other compounds. === Use as solvent === As a polar protic solvent, acetic acid is frequently used for recrystallization to purify organic compounds. Acetic acid is used as a solvent in the production of terephthalic acid (TPA), the raw material for polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In 2006, about 20% of acetic acid was used for TPA production. Acetic acid is often used as a solvent for reactions involving carbocations, such as Friedel-Crafts alkylation. For example, one stage in the commercial manufacture of synthetic camphor involves a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of camphene to isobornyl acetate; here acetic acid acts both as a solvent and as a nucleophile to trap the rearranged carbocation. Glacial acetic acid is used in analytical chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid, such as perchloric acid. === Medical use === Acetic acid injection into a tumor has been used to treat cancer since the 1800s. Acetic acid is used as part of cervical cancer screening in many areas in the developing world. The acid is applied to the cervix and if an area of white appears after about a minute the test is positive. Acetic acid is an effective antiseptic when used as a 1% solution, with broad spectrum of activity against streptococci, staphylococci, pseudomonas, enterococci and others. It may be used to treat skin infections caused by pseudomonas strains resistant to typical antibiotics. While diluted acetic acid is used in iontophoresis, no high quality evidence supports this treatment for rotator cuff disease. As a treatment for otitis externa, it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. === Foods === Acetic acid has 349 kcal (1,460 kJ) per 100 g. Vinegar is typically no less than 4% acetic acid by mass. Legal limits on acetic acid content vary by jurisdiction. Vinegar is used directly as a condiment, and in the pickling of vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar tends to be more diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated. The proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large as industrial uses, but it is by far the oldest and best-known application. == Reactions == === Organic chemistry === Acetic acid undergoes the typical chemical reactions of a carboxylic acid. Upon treatment with a standard base, it converts to metal acetate and water. With strong bases (e.g., organolithium reagents), it can be doubly deprotonated to give LiCH2COOLi. Reduction of acetic acid gives ethanol. The OH group is the main site of reaction, as illustrated by the conversion of acetic acid to acetyl chloride. Other substitution derivatives include acetic anhydride; this anhydride is produced by loss of water from two molecules of acetic acid. Esters of acetic acid can likewise be formed via Fischer esterification, and amides can be formed. When heated above 440 °C (824 °F), acetic acid decomposes to produce carbon dioxide and methane, or to produce ketene and water: CH3COOH → CH4 + CO2 CH3COOH → CH2=C=O + H2O === Reactions with inorganic compounds === Acetic acid is mildly corrosive to metals including iron, magnesium, and zinc, forming hydrogen gas and salts called acetates: Mg + 2 CH3COOH → (CH3COO)2Mg + H2 Because aluminium forms a passivating acid-resistant film of aluminium oxide, aluminium tanks are used to transport acetic acid. Containers lined with glass, stainless steel or polyethylene are also used for this purpose. Metal acetates can also be prepared from acetic acid and an appropriate base, as in the popular ""baking soda + vinegar"" reaction giving off sodium acetate: NaHCO3 + CH3COOH → CH3COONa + CO2 + H2O A colour reaction for salts of acetic acid is iron(III) chloride solution, which results in a deeply red colour that disappears after acidification. A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which can be detected by its malodorous vapours. === Other derivatives === Organic or inorganic salts are produced from acetic acid. Some commercially significant derivatives: Sodium acetate, used in the textile industry and as a food preservative (E262). Copper(II) acetate, used as a pigment and a fungicide. Aluminium acetate and iron(II) acetate—used as mordants for dyes. Palladium(II) acetate, used as a catalyst for organic coupling reactions such as the Heck reaction. Halogenated acetic acids are produced from acetic acid. Some commercially significant derivatives: Chloroacetic acid (monochloroacetic acid, MCA), dichloroacetic acid (considered a by-product), and trichloroacetic acid. MCA is used in the manufacture of indigo dye. Bromoacetic acid, which is esterified to produce the reagent ethyl bromoacetate. Trifluoroacetic acid, which is a common reagent in organic synthesis. Amounts of acetic acid used in these other applications together account for another 5–10% of acetic acid use worldwide. == Health and safety == === Vapour === Prolonged inhalation exposure (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. In 12 workers exposed for two or more years to an airborne average concentration of 51 ppm acetic acid (estimated), symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis were produced. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm has been reported. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of the skin of the hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines). === Solution === Concentrated acetic acid (≥ 25%) is corrosive to skin. These burns or blisters may not appear until hours after exposure. The hazardous properties of acetic acid are dependent on the concentration of the (typically aqueous) solution, with the most significant increases in hazard levels at thresholds of 25% and 90% acetic acid concentration by weight. The following table summarizes the hazards of acetic acid solutions by concentration: Concentrated acetic acid can be ignited only with difficulty at standard temperature and pressure, but becomes a flammable risk in temperatures greater than 39 °C (102 °F), and can form explosive mixtures with air at higher temperatures with explosive limits of 5.4–16% concentration. == See also == Acetic acid (data page) Acids in wine == Notes == == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0363 National Pollutant Inventory – Acetic acid fact sheet NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards Method for sampling and analysis 29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-1 (US Permissible exposure limits) ChemSub Online: Acetic acid Calculation of vapor pressure, liquid density, dynamic liquid viscosity, surface tension of acetic acid Acetic acid bound to proteins in the PDB Swedish Chemicals Agency.

2925,"('Articaine (hydrochloride)', 'Hoe-045', 'Articaine', 'Carticaine', 'Methyl 4-methyl-3-[2-(propylamino)propanoylamino]thiophene-2-carboxylate')",Medical,"Articaine is a dental amide-type local anesthetic. It is the most widely used local anesthetic in a number of European countries and is available in many countries. It is the only local anaesthetic to contain a thiophene ring, meaning it can be described as 'thiophenic'; this conveys lipid solubility. == History == This drug was synthesized by pharmacologist Roman Muschaweck and chemist Robert Rippel. Muschaweck received a ""O. Schmiedeberg"" medal by the German Society for Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology for his work in 2002. It was brought to the German market in 1976 by Hoechst AG, a life-sciences German company (now Sanofi-Aventis), under the brand name Ultracain. This drug was also referred to as ""carticaine"" until 1984.: 71 In 1983 it was brought into the North American market, to Canada, under the name Ultracaine for dental use, manufactured in Germany and distributed by Hoechst-Marion-Roussel. This brand is currently manufactured in Germany by Sanofi-Aventis and distributed in North America by Hansamed Limited (since 1999). After Ultracaine's patent protection expired, new generic versions arrived to the Canadian market: (in order of appearance) Septanest (Septodont), Astracaine, (originally by AstraZeneca and now a Dentsply product), Zorcaine (Carestream Health/Kodak) and Orabloc (Pierrel). It was approved by the FDA in April 2000, and became available in the United States of America two months later under the brand name Septocaine, an anesthetic/vasoconstrictor combination with Epinephrine 1:100,000 (trade name Septodont). Zorcaine became available there a few years later, also. Articadent (Dentsply) became available in the United States in October 2010. The three brands currently available in the United States are all manufactured for these companies by Novocol Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Canada). Ubistesin and Ubistesin Forte (3M ESPE) are also widely used in the United States and Europe. Orabloc (Pierrel) is aseptically manufactured and was approved by the FDA in 2010, became available in Canada in 2011, and in Europe from 2013. Articaine is currently available for the North American dental market: In Canada: As articaine hydrochloride 4% with epinephrine 1:100,000 (0,01 mg/ml) Ubistesin Forte Ultracaine DSF Septanest SP Astracaine Forte Zorcaine Orabloc (articaine hydrochloride 4% and epinephrine 1:100,000) As articaine hydrochloride 4% with epinephrine 1:200,000 (0,005 mg/ml) Ubistesin Ultracaine DS Septanest N Astracaine Orabloc (articaine hydrochloride 4% and epinephrine 1:200,000) In the USA: As articaine hydrochloride 4% with epinephrine 1:100,000 Septocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 Zorcaine Articadent with epinephrine 1:100,000 Orabloc (articaine hydrochloride 4% and epinephrine 1:100,000) As articaine hydrochloride 4% with epinephrine 1:200,000 Septocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 Articadent with epinephrine 1:200,000 Orabloc (articaine hydrochloride 4% and epinephrine 1:200,000) An epinephrine-free (adrenaline-free) version is available in Europe under the brand name Ultracain D. However, version with epinephrine (adrenaline) is available in Europe under the brand name Supracain 4% with epinephrine concentration of 1:200,000. == Structure and metabolism == The amide structure of articaine is similar to that of other local anesthetics, but its molecular structure differs through the presence of a thiophene ring instead of a benzene ring. Articaine is exceptional because it contains an additional ester group that is metabolized by esterases in blood and tissue. The elimination of articaine is exponential with a half-life of 20 minutes. Since articaine is hydrolized very quickly in the blood, the risk of systemic intoxication seems to be lower than with other anesthetics, especially if repeated injection is performed. == Clinical use == Articaine is used for pain control. Like other local anesthetic drugs, articaine causes a transient and completely reversible state of anesthesia (loss of sensation) during (dental) procedures.: 3 In dentistry, articaine is used mainly for infiltration injections. Articaine, while not proven, has been associated with higher risk of nerve damage when used as a block technique. However, articaine is able to penetrate dense cortical bone — as found in the lower jaw (mandible) — more than most other local anaesthetics. In people with hypokalemic sensory overstimulation, lidocaine is not very effective, but articaine works well. Studies comparing lidocaine and articaine found that articaine is more effective than lidocaine in anaesthetising the posterior first molar region. Articaine has been found to be 3.81 times more likely than lidocaine to produce successful anaesthesia when used for infiltration injections. However, there is no evidence to support the use of articaine over lidocaine for inferior alveolar nerve blocks. Furthermore, articaine has been demonstrated to be superior to lidocaine for use of supplementary infiltration following persistent pain despite a successful inferior dental nerve block with lidocaine. == Contraindications == Allergy to amide-type anesthetics Allergy to metabisulfites: 320 Idiopathic or congenital methemoglobinemia (not a concern in dental practice due to the small volumes of articaine used): 73 Hemoglobinopathy, such as sickle cell disease Articaine is not contraindicated in patients with sulfa allergies, as there is no cross-allergenicity between articaine's sulphur-bearing thiophene ring and sulfonamides. Methylparaben is no longer present in any dental local anesthetic formula available in North America.: 73 == Paresthesia controversy == Paresthesia, a short-to-long-term numbness or altered sensation affecting a nerve, is a well-known complication of injectable local anesthetics and has been present even before articaine was available. An article by Haas and Lennon published in 1993 seems to be the original source for the controversy surrounding articaine. This paper analyzed 143 cases reported in to the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario (RCDSO) over a 21-year period. The results from their analysis seemed to indicate that 4% local anesthetics had a higher incidence of causing paresthesia, an undesirable temporary or permanent complication, after the injection. The authors concluded that “...the overall incidence of paresthesia following local anesthetic administration for non-surgical procedures in dentistry in Ontario is very low, with only 14 cases being reported out of an estimated 11,000,000 injections in 1993. However if paresthesia does occur, the results of this study are consistent with the suggestion that it is significantly more likely to do so if either articaine or prilocaine is used.” In another paper by the same authors, 19 reported paresthesia cases in Ontario for 1994 were reviewed, concluding that the incidence of paresthesia was 2.05 per million injections of 4% anesthetic drugs. Another follow up study by Miller and Haas published in 2000, concluded that the incidence of paresthesia from either prilocaine or articaine (the only two 4% drugs in the dental market) was close to 1:500,000 injections. (An average dentist gives around 1,800 injections in a year). Almost all recorded cases of long-term numbness or altered sensation (paresthesia) seem only to be present when this anesthetic is used for dental use (no PubMed references for paresthesia with articaine for other medical specialties). Also, in the vast majority of the reports, only the lingual nerve was affected. Nonetheless, direct damage to the nerve caused by 4% drugs has never been scientifically proven. Some research points to needle trauma as the cause of the paresthesia events. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Articaine hydrochloride"". PubChem.

Nanosecond pulse radiolysis was used to obtain the spectra of the reaction intermediates and their kinetics. Depending on the pH, and the concentration of S-methylglutathione, pulse irradiation leads to different transients. The transients observed were an intramolecularly bonded [>S thereforeNH2]+ intermediate, intermolecularly S thereforeS-bonded radical cation, alpha-(alkylthio)alkyl radicals, alpha-amino-alkyl-type radical, and an intramolecularly (S thereforeO)+-bonded intermediate. The latter radical is of particular note in that it supports recent observations of sulfur radical cations complexed with the oxygen atoms of peptide bonds and thus has biological and medical implications. This (S thereforeO)+-bonded intermediate had an absorption maximum at 390 nm, and we estimated its formation rate to be >or=6x10(7) s(-1). It is in equilibrium with the intermolecularly S thereforeS-bonded radical cation, and they decay together on the time scale of a few hundred microseconds. The S thereforeS-bonded radical cation is formed from the monomeric sulfur radical cation (>S*+) and an unoxidized S-methylglutathione molecule with the rate constant of 1.0x10(9) M(-1) s(-1). The short-lived [>S thereforeNH2]+ intermediate is a precursor of decarboxylation, absorbs at approximately 390 nm, and decays on the time scale of hundreds of nanoseconds.

Conclusions from experimental observations were supported by molecular modeling calculations. Glutathione-S-transferase T1 (GSTT1-1) is a major isoenzyme for the biotransformation of halomethanes. The enzyme activity is located, among other places, in human liver and erythrocytes and is subject to a genetic polymorphism. Metabolism of the halomethanes via GSTT1-1 yields S-methylglutathione (MeSG). A new HPLC assay for the enzymatic formation of MeSG was developed. The glutathione conjugate was derivatized with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate, followed by reverse-phase HPLC with gradient elution and fluorescence detection. The limit of detection was as low as about 39 pmol MeSG on-column. Including derivatization and HPLC analysis, samples could be run at 42-min intervals, thus enabling a high sample throughput. The entire method was validated for analyte recovery (78.2%) and for variations in detector response with replicated injections (11.8%) and with analyses on each of 11 consecutive days (15.2%) with erythrocyte lysate incubations as the matrix. The time-, protein-, and substrate-dependences of the enzymatic catalysis with the model substrates methyl bromide (MeBr) and methyl chloride (MeCl) were studied. Due to its strong electrophilic character, MeBr caused a high level of spontaneous MeSG formation from glutathione in a protein-free medium and a substrate-trapping side reaction in the presence of proteins. Therefore, enzymatic MeSG formation rates may only be determined with MeBr concentrations of at least 3000 ppm in the presence of limited amounts of protein (e.g. 100 microl erythrocyte lysate). In contrast, MeCl showed a lower alkylating potential allowing enzymatic catalysis to be the dominant reaction in incubations with 10,000 ppm MeCl and 2 ml erythrocyte lysate. Tentacle ball formation (TBF) in Hydra elicited by S-methylglutathione (GSM) was modulated by a number of biologically active peptides. Hydra fed on Artemia, which had been hatched in a common salt solution supplemented with LiCl and ZnCl(2), easily induced TBF in response to GSM after pretreatment with trypsin. After Hydra were treated with 100 pg/ml trypsin for 10 min, the response to GSM (TBF) was sensitively suppressed by acidic fibroblast growth factor and other biologically active peptides for >10 h. Various peptides, but not transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), suppressed GSM-induced TBF in a specific pattern for each peptide. However, TGF-beta was unique in that it did not suppress the response to GSM, but nullified the suppressive effect of other peptides. Only active TGF-beta nullified the suppressive effect of the peptides, and the latent form of TGF-beta neither suppressed GSM-induced TBF nor nullified the suppressive effect of other peptides. Members of the TGF-beta family suppressed GSM-induced TBF. These results indicate that all peptides examined, except for TGF-beta suppressed the response to GSM in a manner specific to each peptide. This assay system would be useful in identification of biologically active peptides.",S-methylglutathione,PUBMED,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.06614723056554794), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0003370118502061814), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.04643779620528221), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03849117085337639)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.04858816787600517), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([sigmaaldrich.com](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/m4139?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=6, title='S-Methylglutathione 2922-56-7', type='url_citation', url='https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/m4139?utm_source=openai')])"

It is the major component of the protoberberine extract from Enantia chlorantha. It has been studied for its potential use in the treatment of jaundice, dysentery, hypertension, inflammation, and liver-related diseases. This compound also has weak in vitro activity against flavivirus. == Pharmacology == === Neuroprotective activity === Palmatine can be used to treat Alzheimer’s disease, mainly by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and neuraminidase-1 (NA-1). It was found, that the positively charged nitrogen on palmatine binds in the gorge of active sire of AChE. Research show that palmatine had antidepressant effect. It was achieved by regulating brain catalase levels, monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) activity, lipid peroxidation, plasma nitrite and corticosterone levels. === Regulating blood lipid activity === Palmatine achieved hypoglycemic effects by inducing insulin release and insulin-mimicking activity. In addition, studies found that palmatine also inhibited the activity of lens aldose reductase, sucrase and maltase. In vivo research showed that palmatine reduced serum total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) and increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. === Anticancer activity === Research showed that palmatine had broad anti-cancer activity. Palmatine had significant growth inhibitory effects on seven human cancer cell lines: 7701QGY, SMMC7721, HepG2, CEM, CEM/VCR, K III and Lewis. In addition, palmatine also had anti-cancer activity on MCF-7, U251, KB, CHOK-1, HT-29 and SiHacell lines. Palmatine induced apoptosis in human skin epithelial carcinoma cells (A431) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner via damaging severely to DNA and inhibiting the activity of Bcl-2 protein. In addition, palmatine can inhibit the proliferation and infiltration of cancer cells. === Antibacterial and antiviral activity === Palmitine has inhibitory effect on Gram-positive bacteria which is significantly stronger than that on Gram-negative bacteria, and 9-O-substituted palmatine derivatives exhibited stronger antibacterial activity. === Anti-inflammatory activity === Studies have shown that palmatine can decrease the production of pro-inflammatory factors and increase the production of anti-inflammatory factors. === Other pharmacological activity === Studies have shown that palmatine chave antioxidant activity, had a protective effect on gastric ulcer, derivatives of palmatine were more effective against ulcerative colitis, including low cytotoxicity to intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, palmatine might have the antiarrhythmic effect, and provideprotection from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. == Toxicity == A large number of studies have shown that palmatine has a complex effect on the metabolism of enzymes in the liver, and that palmatine has significant DNA toxicity. However, some 9-O-substituted palmatine derivatives exhibited less toxic than palmatine. In addition, palmatine had higher affinity to nucleic acids than serum proteins, which make them suitable candidates for delivery by serum proteins. == See also == Berberine Jatrorrhizine Phellodendrine == References ==",Palmatine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.002951793372631073), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00026169343618676066), (' FOOD', -0.00015920029545668513)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.1861850470304489), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -0.029813479632139206), ('ĠFOOD', -0.051408495754003525), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12739624083042145)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.20168755948543549)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmatine ', [])"

Specifically, it is used to treat multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis along with other medications for tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, joint pains, headaches, and chest pain. Serious side effects include QT prolongation, liver dysfunction, and an increased risk of death. While harm during pregnancy has not been found, it has not been well studied in this population. It is in the diarylquinoline antimycobacterial class of medications. It works by blocking the ability of M. tuberculosis to make adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). Bedaquiline was approved for medical use in the United States in 2012. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Its use was approved in December 2012 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, as part of a fast-track accelerated approval, for use only in cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and the more resistant extensively drug resistant tuberculosis. As of 2013, both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend (provisionally) that bedaquiline be reserved for people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis when an otherwise recommended regimen cannot be designed. == Side effects == The most common side effects of bedaquiline in studies were nausea, joint and chest pain, and headache. The drug also has a black-box warning for increased risk of death and arrhythmias, as it may prolong the QT interval by blocking the hERG channel. Everyone on bedaquiline should have monitoring with a baseline and repeated ECGs. There is considerable controversy over the approval for the drug, as one of the largest studies to date had more deaths in the group receiving bedaquiline that those receiving placebo. Ten deaths occurred in the bedaquiline group out of 79, while two occurred in the placebo group, out of 81. Of the 10 deaths on bedaquiline, one was due to a motor vehicle accident, five were judged as due to progression of the underlying tuberculosis and three were well after the person had stopped receiving bedaquiline. There remains significant concern for the higher mortality in people treated with bedaquiline, leading to the recommendation to limit its use to situations where a four drug regimen cannot otherwise be constructed, limit use with other medications that prolong the QT interval, and the placement of a prominent black box warning. == Drug interactions == Bedaquiline should not be co-administered with other drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4, the liver enzyme responsible for oxidative metabolism of the drug. Co-administration with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, results in a 52% decrease in the AUC of the drug. This reduces the exposure of the body to the drug and decreases the antibacterial effect. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, results in a 22% increase in the AUC, and potentially an increase in the rate of adverse effects experienced. == Mechanism of action == Bedaquiline blocks the proton pump for ATP synthase of mycobacteria. It is the first member of a class of drugs called the diarylquinolines. Bedaquiline is bactericidal. ATP production is required for cellular energy production and its loss leads inhibition of mycobacterial growth within hours of the addition of bedaquiline. The onset of bedaquiline-induced mycobacterial cell death does not occur until several days after treatment, but nonetheless kills consistently thereafter. === Resistance === The specific part of ATP synthase affected by bedaquiline is subunit c which is encoded by the gene atpE. Mutations in atpE can lead to resistance. Mutations in drug efflux pumps have also been linked to resistance. == History == Bedaquiline was described for the first time in 2004 at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) meeting, after the drug had been in development for over seven years. It was discovered by a team led by Koen Andries at Janssen Pharmaceutica. Bedaquiline was approved for medical use in the United States in 2012. It is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson (J&J), who sought accelerated approval of the drug, a type of temporary approval for diseases lacking other viable treatment options. By gaining approval for a drug that treats a neglected disease, J&J is now able to request expedited FDA review of a future drug. When it was approved by the FDA in December 2012, it was the first new medicine for TB in more than 40 years. In 2016, the WHO came under criticism for recommending it as an essential medicine. The WHO TB program director has pointed out that Janssen will donate $30 million worth (30,000 treatment courses) of bedaquiline over a four-year period. In 2023, a request to extend the patent on bedaquiline until 2027, was rejected by the Indian patent office. The patent was supposed to expire in July 2023, but J&J's evergreening practices will not allow the distribution of generics in several countries heavily afflicted by tuberculosis. In July 2023, the WHO's Stop TB program and Johnson & Johnson came to an agreement allowing for Stop TB Partnership's Global Drug Facility to produce generic bedaquiline for the majority of low and middle income countries. In July 2024, the Indian Patent Office’s rejected Johnson & Johnson's application for a pediatric version of bedaquiline, paving the way for more affordable generic alternatives, potentially reducing treatment costs by 80% beyond the primary patent’s expiration in July 2023. == Society and culture == === Economics === The cost for six months is approximately US$900 in low-income countries, $3,000 in middle-income countries, and $30,000 in high-income countries. The public sector invested $455–747 million in developing bedaquiline. This is thought to be 1.6x to 5.1x what the owner, Janssen Biotech, invested (estimated at $90–240 million). If capitalized and risk-adjusted, these costs become $647–1,201 million and $292–772 million, respectively. == Research == In vitro experiments have indicated that bedaquiline may also target the mitochondrial ATP synthase of malignant mammalian cells and reduce the rate of metastasis. Bedaquiline has been studied in phase IIb studies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis while phase III studies are currently underway. It has been shown to improve cure rates of smear-positive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, though with some concern for increased rates of death. Small studies have also examined its use as salvage therapy for non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections. It is a component of the experimental BPaMZ combination treatment (bedaquiline + pretomanid + moxifloxacin + pyrazinamide). == References ==",Sirturo,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2159273865108844e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -7.712543447269127e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([jnj.com](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-receives-approval-from-u-s-fda-and-european-commission-for-sirturo-bedaquiline?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=182, start_index=9, title='Johnson & Johnson Receives Approval from U.S. FDA and European Commission for SIRTURO® (bedaquiline)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-receives-approval-from-u-s-fda-and-european-commission-for-sirturo-bedaquiline?utm_source=openai')])"
2931,"('H-hoarg-oh', 'Homoarginine', 'Homo-l-arginine', 'N6-amidino-lysine', 'N(sup 6)-amidinolysine')",Medical,"Homoarginine is an nonproteinogenic alpha-amino acid. It is structurally equivalent to a one-methylene group-higher homolog of arginine and to the guanidino derivative of lysine. L-Homoarginine is the naturally-occurring enantiomer. Physiologically, homoarginine increases nitric oxide (NO) supply and betters endothelial functions in the body, with a particular correlation and effect towards cardiovascular outcome and mortality. At physiological pH, homoarginine is cationic: the guanidino group is protonated. == Occurrences == Homoarginine is a growth inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia Coli and Candida albicans, indicating it inhibits particular microbial growth and germination pathways. Homoarginine is assumed to be an antimetabolite of arginine. Many studies have shown that it acts as a competitive inhibitor in most cases, but there are also controversial studies showing that it is also an organ specific, non-competitive inhibitor as well. Studies have also shown that it is toxic when targeting Insecta and Rattus norvegicus. In its inhibition, is also often found in occurrences with the lungs, cervix, testis and is an inhibitor of bone and liver-specific alkaline phosphatase enzymes. This amino acid derivative is also found in occurrence with murine osteosarcoma cell proliferation. Levels of homoarginine have been found to increase during pregnancy, but more studies are underway to confirm this thoroughly. == Production == Homoarginine is formed as a derivative from lysine through reactions similar to those of the urea cycle. Just as in the urea cycle, in its synthesis, ornithine is replaced by lysine. Ornithine transcarbamylase is the main enzyme for homoarginine synthesis. The production of homoarginine is based around the activity of this enzyme. Although ornithine transcarbamylase has a higher affinity to ornithine, it ends up catalyzing the transaminidation reaction of lysine as well, which starts homoarginine production. The reason it also catalyzes this reaction with lysine is because of the low substrate selectivity in the reaction. Another pathway for the production of Homoarginine includes glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT). This enzyme normally acts through the transfer of an amidino group from arginine to glycine, resulting in formation of guanidinoacetic acid, which is subsequently methylated by guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) to form creatine. However, glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) sometimes acts by using lysine instead of glycine in the reaction, therefore lysine becomes the acceptor of the amidino group, resulting in the production of homoarginine. == Reactions == Homoarginine can increase the availability of nitric oxide, and this is the basis of many of its functions. It can serve as a substrate for NO synthase itself. It can also inhibit arginase, an enzyme that competes with NO synthase for arginine. The resulting increase in the intracellular concentration of arginine leads to increased production of NO from it by NO synthase. == Uses == Homoarginine is used clinical studies, often with rats, to explore its effects on cardiovascular health by acting as an inhibitor for organ-specific reactions as well as a stimulator in some cases. A recent study was done on the topic of homoarginine related to heart failure and sudden cardiac death in haemodialysis patients. The study was done on 1255 diabetic haemodialysis patients throughout a median of 4 years of follow-up. Results showed a range of different events such as sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and even death due to heart failure. The study calculations showed that the risk of sudden cardiac death had a threefold increase in the presence of per unit decrease of homoarginine. This explained the strong association of congestive heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy with low homoarginine levels. Furthermore, this study presented evidence towards increased risk of stroke with low concentrations of homoarginine. Yet, some cases such as myocardial infarction did not show any significance towards low levels of homoarginine correlation. == References == Huynh, Ngan Ngoc; Chin-Dusting, Jaye (2006).

2932,"('Alofanib', 'Alofanib [inn]', 'Alofanib(rpt835)', 'Syn007154', 'Ex-a2731')",Medical," Alofanib (RPT835) is a novel selective allosteric inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). We showed previously that alofanib could bind to the extracellular domain of FGFR2 and has an inhibitory effect on FGF2-induced phoshphorylation of FRS2α. In the present study, we further showed that alofanib inhibited phosphorylation of FRS2α with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 7 and 9 nmol/l in cancer cells expressing different FGFR2 isoforms. In a panel of four cell lines representing several tumour types (triple-negative breast cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer), alofanib inhibited FGF-mediated proliferation with 50% growth inhibition (GI50) values of 16-370 nmol/l. Alofanib dose dependently inhibited the proliferation and migration of human and mouse endothelial cells (GI50 11-58 nmol/l) compared with brivanib and bevacizumab. Treatment with alofanib ablated experimental FGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo. In a FGFR-driven human tumour xenograft model, oral administration of alofanib was well tolerated and resulted in potent antitumour activity. Importantly, alofanib was effective in FGFR2-expressing models. These results show that alofanib is a potent FGFR2 inhibitor and provide strong rationale for its evaluation in patients with FGFR2-driven cancers. Purpose Early data suggest that combining FGFR2 inhibitors with platinum-containing cytotoxic agents for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer may yield increased antitumor activity. We investigated antitumor activity of alofanib (RPT835), a novel allosteric FGFR2 inhibitor, in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Methods Equal amounts of ovarian cancer cell (SKOV3) lysates were analyzed for FGFR1-3 protein expression using Wes. To assess the efficacy of alofanib on FGF-mediated cell proliferation, SKOV3 cells were incubated and were treated with serially diluted alofanib. Basic FGF was added at a concentration of 25 ng/ml. Control wells were left untreated. Cell growth inhibition was determined using Promega's Cell Titer-Glo® assay. Immunocompromised mice were used for xenotransplantation of SKOV3 cancer cells. Seventy animals with measurable tumors were selected on day 10 and randomized into control groups (no treatment or chemotherapy alone (paclitaxel + carboplatin) and treatment groups (alofanib orally or intravenously (different dose levels) in combination with chemotherapy). Measurements of tumor volume (mm3) were performed by digital calipers every 3 days during 31 days after tumor inoculation. Number of tumor vessels and Ki-67 index were calculated. Results SKOV3 cells express FGFR1 and FGFR2 but not FGFR3. Basic FGF increased proliferation of the ovarian cancer cells in untreated control group (P = 0.001). Alofanib inhibited growth of FGFR2-expressing SKOV3 cells with GI50 value of 0.37 μmol/L. Treatment with alofanib in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin resulted in tumor growth delay phenotype in all treatment groups compared to control non-treatment groups. Compound exhibited a dose-dependent effect on tumor growth. Daily intravenous regimen of alofanib (total maximum dose per week was 350 mg/kg) demonstrated significant effect (inhibiting growth by 80 % and by 53 % in comparison with vehicle and chemotherapy group alone, respectively (P < 0.001). Alofanib decreased number of vessels in tumor (-49 %; P < 0.0001) and number of Ki-67-positive SKOV3 cells (-42 %, P < 0.05). There were tumor necrosis and cell degeneration in alofanib group. Conclusions We suggest that FGFR2 inhibition has potent effects on ovarian cancer growth in preclinical studies. Alofanib is a potential allosteric inhibitor of FGFR2 used in oncology. The inhibitor blocks the extracellular part of the receptor and prevents its binding with the ligand. Alofanib suppressed proliferation of endothelial cells, their migration activity, and ability to form vessellike structures in vitro and significantly decreased the number of microvessels in Matrigel implant and in ovarian cancer (SKOV-3) xenograft in vivo.

Its name is derived from the word ""hesperidium"", for fruit produced by citrus trees. Hesperidin was first isolated in 1828 by French chemist M. Lebreton from the white inner layer of citrus peels (mesocarp, albedo). Hesperidin is believed to play a role in plant defense. == Sources == === Rutaceae === 700–2,500 ppm in fruit of Citrus aurantium (bitter orange, petitgrain) in orange juice (Citrus sinensis) in Zanthoxylum gilletii in lemon in lime in leaves of Agathosma serratifolia === Lamiaceae === Peppermint contains hesperidin. === Content in foods === Approximate hesperidin content per 100 ml or 100 g 481 mg peppermint, dried 44 mg blood orange, pure juice 26 mg orange, pure juice 18 mg lemon, pure juice 14 mg lime, pure juice 1 mg grapefruit, pure juice == Metabolism == Hesperidin 6-O-α-L-rhamnosyl-β-D-glucosidase, an enzyme that uses hesperidin and water to produce hesperetin and rutinose, is found in the Ascomycetes species. == Research == As a flavanone found in the rinds of citrus fruits (such as oranges or lemons), hesperidin is under preliminary research for its possible biological properties in vivo. One review did not find evidence that hesperidin affected blood lipid levels or hypertension. Another review found that hesperidin may improve endothelial function in humans, but the overall results were inconclusive. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of hesperidin stems from the phenylpropanoid pathway, in which the natural amino acid L-phenylalanine undergoes a deamination by phenylalanine ammonia lyase to afford (E)-cinnamate. The resulting monocarboxylate undergoes an oxidation by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase to afford (E)-4-coumarate, which is transformed into (E)-4-coumaroyl-CoA by 4-coumarate-CoA ligase. (E)-4-coumaroyl-CoA is then subjected to the type III polyketide synthase naringenin chalcone synthase, undergoing successive condensation reactions and ultimately a ring-closing Claisen condensation to afford naringenin chalcone. The corresponding chalcone undergoes an isomerization by chalcone isomerase to afford (2S)-naringenin, which is oxidized to (2S)-eriodictyol by flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase. After O-methylation by caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, the hesperitin product undergoes a glycosylation by flavanone 7-O-glucosyltransferase to afford hesperitin-7-O-β-D-glucoside. Finally, a rhamnosyl moiety is introduced to the monoglycosylated product by 1,2-rhamnosyltransferase, forming hesperidin. == See also == Diosmin List of phytochemicals in food List of MeSH codes (D03) List of food additives == References == == External links == Media related to Hesperidin at Wikimedia Commons",Hesperetin 7-rutinoside,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.005002363119274378), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.018452061340212822), ('OD', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5761198401451111)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -1.676292231422849e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperidin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Hesperidin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperidin?utm_source=openai')])"

It is not effective in angioedema caused by medication from the ACE inhibitor class. It is a peptidomimetic consisting of ten amino acids, which is a selective and specific antagonist of bradykinin B2 receptors. == Mechanism of action == Bradykinin is a peptide-based hormone that is formed locally in tissues, very often in response to a trauma. It increases vessel permeability, dilates blood vessels and causes smooth muscle cells to contract. Bradykinin plays an important role as the mediator of pain. Surplus bradykinin is responsible for the typical symptoms of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, overheating and pain. These symptoms are mediated by activation of bradykinin B2 receptors. Icatibant acts as a bradykinin inhibitor by blocking the binding of native bradykinin to the bradykinin B2 receptor. Little is known about the effects of icatibant on the bradykinin B1 receptor. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Icatibant received orphan drug status in Australia, the EU, Switzerland, and the US for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). In the EU, the approval by the European Commission (July 2008) allows Jerini to market Firazyr in the European Union's 27 member states, as well as Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Iceland, making it the first product to be approved in all EU countries for the treatment of hereditary angioedema.

Like all other vipers, they are venomous. They are distinguished by the presence of a heat-sensing pit organ located between the eye and the nostril on both sides of the head. Currently, 23 genera and 155 species are recognized: These are also the only viperids found in the Americas. The groups of snakes represented here include rattlesnakes, lanceheads, and Asian pit vipers. The type genus for this subfamily is Crotalus, of which the type species is the timber rattlesnake, C. horridus. These snakes range in size from the diminutive hump-nosed viper, Hypnale hypnale, that grows to a typical total length (including tail) of only 30–45 cm (12–18 in), to the bushmaster, Lachesis muta, a species known to reach a maximum total length of 3.65 m (12.0 ft) in length. This subfamily is unique in that all member species share a common characteristic – a deep pit, or fossa, in the loreal area between the eye and the nostril on either side of the head. These loreal pits are the external openings to a pair of extremely sensitive infrared-detecting organs, which in effect give the snakes a sixth sense to help them find and perhaps even judge the size of the small, warm-blooded prey on which they feed. The pit organ is complex in structure and is similar to the thermoreceptive labial pits found in boas and pythons. It is deep and located in a maxillary cavity. The membrane is like an eardrum that divides the pit into two sections of unequal size, with the larger of the two facing forwards and exposed to the environment. The two sections are connected via a narrow tube, or duct, that can be opened or closed by a group of surrounding muscles. By controlling this tube, the snake can balance the air pressure on either side of the membrane. The membrane has many nerve endings packed with mitochondria. Succinic dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, adenosine triphosphate, monoamine oxidase, generalized esterases, and acetylcholine esterase have also been found in it. When prey comes into range, infrared radiation falling onto the membrane allows the snake to determine its direction. Having one of these organs on either side of the head produces a stereo effect that indicates distance, as well as direction. Experiments have shown, when deprived of their senses of sight and smell, these snakes can strike accurately at moving objects less than 0.2 °C (0.36 °F) warmer than the background. The paired pit organs provide the snake with thermal rangefinder capabilities. These organs are of great value to a predator that hunts at night, as well as for avoiding the snake’s own predators. Among vipers, these snakes are also unique in that they have a specialized muscle, called the muscularis pterigoidius glandulae, between the venom gland and the head of the ectopterygoid. Contraction of this muscle, together with that of the muscularis compressor glandulae, forces venom out of the gland. == Evolution == The earliest known fossil pit viper remains are from the Early Miocene of Nebraska. As pit vipers are thought to have had an Asian origin before eventually colonizing the Americas, this suggests that they must have originated and diversified even earlier. During the Late Miocene, they reached as far west as eastern Europe, where they are no longer found; it is thought that they did not expand further into Europe. == Geographic range == The subfamily Crotalinae is found from Central Asia eastward and southward to Japan, China, Indonesia, peninsular India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In the Americas, they range from southern Canada southward to Central America to southern South America. == Habitat == Crotalines are a versatile subfamily, with members found in habitats ranging from parched desert (e.g., the sidewinder, Crotalus cerastes) to rainforests (e.g., the bushmaster, Lachesis muta). They may be either arboreal or terrestrial, and at least one species (the cottonmouth, Agkistrodon piscivorus) is semiaquatic. The altitude record is held jointly by Crotalus triseriatus in Mexico and Gloydius strauchi in China, both of which have been found above the treeline at over 4,000 m above sea level. == Behavior == Although a few species of crotalines are highly active by day, such as Trimeresurus trigonocephalus, a bright green pit viper endemic to Sri Lanka, most are nocturnal, preferring to avoid high daytime temperatures and to hunt when their favored prey are also active. The snakes' heat-sensitive pits are also thought to aid in locating cooler areas in which to rest. As ambush predators, crotalines typically wait patiently somewhere for unsuspecting prey to wander by. At least one species, the arboreal Gloydius shedaoensis of China, is known to select a specific ambush site and return to it every year in time for the spring migration of birds. Studies have indicated these snakes learn to improve their strike accuracy over time. Many temperate species of pit vipers (e.g. most rattlesnakes) congregate in sheltered areas or ""dens"" to overwinter (brumate, see hibernation), the snakes benefiting from the combined heat. In cool temperatures and while pregnant, pit vipers also bask on sunny ledges. Some species do not mass together in this way, for example the copperhead, Agkistrodon contortrix, or the Mojave rattlesnake, Crotalus scutulatus. Like most snakes, crotalines keep to themselves and strike only if cornered or threatened. Smaller snakes are less likely to stand their ground than larger specimens. Pollution and the destruction of rainforests have caused many pit viper populations to decline. Humans also threaten pit vipers, as many are hunted for their skins or killed by cars when they wander onto roads. == Reproduction == With few exceptions, crotalines are ovoviviparous, meaning that the embryos develop within eggs that remain inside the mother's body until the offspring are ready to hatch, when the hatchlings emerge as functionally free-living young. In such species, the eggshells are reduced to soft membranes that the young shed, either within the reproductive tract, or immediately after emerging. Among the oviparous (egg-laying) pit vipers are Lachesis, Calloselasma, and some Trimeresurus species. All egg-laying crotalines are believed to guard their eggs. Brood sizes range from two for very small species, to as many as 86 for the fer-de-lance, Bothrops atrox, which is among the most prolific of all live-bearing snakes. Many young crotalines have brightly coloured tails that contrast dramatically with the rest of their bodies. These tails are known to be used by a number of species in a behavior known as caudal luring; the young snakes make worm-like movements with their tails to lure unsuspecting prey within striking distance. == Taxonomy == In the past, the pit vipers were usually classed as a separate family: the Crotalidae. Today, however, the monophyly of the viperines and the crotalines as a whole is undisputed, which is why they are treated here as a subfamily of the Viperidae. == Genera == *) Not including the nominate subspecies.

Although cimetropium bromide and other antispasmodic agents are commonly administered as premedication to inhibit peristalsis during EGD examination, there are few data regarding the benefits of cimetropium bromide for the detection of gastric neoplasms. To investigate the association between the use of cimetropium bromide as premedication and gastric neoplasm detection rates during EGD examination. This propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study included 67 683 participants who received EGD screening at the Health Promotion Center of Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, from January 2, 2010, to June 30, 2017. Data were analyzed from April 1 to December 30, 2021. Participants were divided into 2 groups: those who received cimetropium bromide before EGD examination (intervention group) and those who did not (control group). Gastric neoplasm detection rates. Among 67 683 participants, the mean (SD) age was 48.6 (10.8) years, and 36 517 participants (54.0%) were male; all participants were Asian (a racially homogenous population). Of those, 28 280 participants (41.8%; mean [SD] age, 50.3 [10.6] years; 57.8% male) received cimetropium bromide, and 39 403 participants (58.2%; mean [SD] age, 47.4 [10.8] years; 51.2% male) did not. Propensity score matching based on confounding variables yielded 41 670 matched participants (20 835 pairs). Detected lesions included 52 dysplasias (0.12%), 40 early cancers (0.10%), 7 advanced cancers (0.02%), and 3 lymphomas (0.01%). Gastric neoplasm detection rates were significantly higher in the intervention group (63 participants [0.30%]) vs the control group (39 participants [0.19%]; P = .02). A significant difference in the combined detection rate of dysplasia and early gastric cancer was found between those in the intervention group (57 participants [0.27%]) vs the control group (35 participants [0.17%]; P = .02). For small gastric lesions (<1 cm), those who received cimetropium bromide had higher detection rates (24 participants [0.12%]) than those who did not (11 participants [0.05%]; P = .03). Lesions in the gastric body were detected significantly more often in the intervention group (34 participants [0.16%]) vs the control group (15 participants [0.07%]; P = .007). In multivariate analyses involving all 67 683 participants, the use of cimetropium bromide was more likely to detect gastric neoplasms compared with nonuse (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.95; P = .03). In this study, the use of cimetropium bromide as premedication was significantly associated with increased gastric neoplasm detection rates during EGD screening, and lesions in the gastric body were detected more frequently among those who received cimetropium bromide compared with those who did not. These findings suggest that cimetropium bromide may be considered as premedication before EGD examination among individuals with no contraindications. Endoscopic inspection of colonic mucosa is disturbed by colonic folds and peristalsis, which may result in missed polyps. Cimetropium bromide, an antispasmodic agent, inhibits peristalsis and colonic spasms, which may improve polyp detection. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to investigate whether cimetropium bromide could improve polyp and adenoma detection in the colorectum and right colon. Patients undergoing screening or diagnostic colonoscopy were randomized to receive intravenous cimetropium bromide (5 mg) or placebo after cecal intubation. The primary outcomes were the number of polyps per patient (PPP) and adenomas per patient (APP); secondary outcomes were the polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma detection rate (ADR), and advanced neoplasm detection rate (ANDR). A total of 181 patients were analyzed; 91 patients received cimetropium bromide and 90 patients received placebo. Cimetropium bromide and placebo groups did not significantly differ in the PPP and APP for the colorectum (1.38 ± 1.58 vs 1.69 ± 2.28, P = .298; 0.96 ± 1.27 vs 1.11 ± 1.89, P = .517, respectively) and right colon (0.70 ± 0.95 vs 0.78 ± 1.21, P = .645; 0.47 ± 0.81 vs 0.51 ± 0.81, P = .757, respectively). Two groups also did not significantly differ in the PDR, ADR, and ANDR for the colorectum and right colon. Furthermore, there were no difference between groups in the PPP, APP, PDR, ADR, and ADNR in a sub-analysis of expert and non-expert endoscopists. Cimetropium bromide did not improve polyp and adenoma detection in the colorectum and right colon during colonoscope withdrawal, regardless of the expertness of the endoscopist. However, its use may be helpful in patients with active peristalsis or for beginning endoscopists during standard colonoscopy without a transparent cap. Treatment of infantile colic remains an open issue. In Italy, cimetropium bromide is used extensively to treat infantile colic. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was to investigate the effectiveness and side effects of cimetropium bromide in the treatment of infants with colic crisis. Ninety-seven infants with colic were enrolled. The diagnosis of infantile colic in healthy infants with regular growth, aged 15 to 60 days was made according to the criteria of Wessel. The infants were divided into two groups, one treated with cimetropium bromide (1.2 mg/kg) and the other treated with placebo at onset of each crisis for 3 days. Duration of crying and side effects were recorded daily in a structured diary for the 3 days of therapy. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square and t tests. Eighty-six infants completed the trial. The average duration of crying for each crisis was 17.3 +/- 12.6 minutes in the cimetropium bromide group and 47.5 +/- 28.5 minutes in the placebo group (P < 0.005). Response to cimetropium bromide was 74%. Response to placebo was 33% (P < 0.05). Side effects did not differ significantly between the two groups, except sleepiness, which increased in the infants treated with cimetropium bromide. Cimetropium bromide was more effective than placebo in reducing the duration of crying in children with infantile colic.

2938,"('Orphenadrine (citrate)', 'Orphenadrine', 'Orphenadrin', 'Disipal', 'Orphenadine')",Medical,"Orphenadrine (sold under many brand names) is an anticholinergic drug of the ethanolamine antihistamine class; it is closely related to diphenhydramine. It is a muscle relaxant that is used to treat muscle pain and to help with motor control in Parkinson's disease, but has largely been superseded by newer drugs. It is considered a dirty drug due to its multiple mechanisms of action in different pathways. It was discovered and developed in the 1940s. == Medical use == Orphenadrine is a skeletal muscle relaxant. It is used to relieve pain caused by muscle injuries such as strains and sprains, in combination with rest and physical therapy. A 2004 review found fair evidence that orphenadrine is effective for acute back or neck pain, but found insufficient evidence to establish the relative efficacy of the drug in relation to other drugs in the study. Orphenadrine and other muscle relaxants are sometimes used to treat pain arising from rheumatoid arthritis but there is no evidence they are effective for that purpose. In 2003, a Cochrane Review of the use of anticholinergic drugs to improve motor function in Parkinson's disease found that as a class, the drugs are useful for that purpose; it identified one single-site randomised, cross-over study of orphenadrine vs placebo. Although orphenadrine and other anticholinergics have largely been superseded by other drugs; they have a use in alleviating motor function symptoms, and appear to help about 20% of people with Parkinson's. == Side effects == Orphenadrine has the side effects of the other common antihistamines in large part. Stimulation is somewhat more common than with other related antihistamines, and is especially common in the elderly. Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, urine retention, blurred vision, and headache. Its use in Parkinson's is especially limited by these factors. Orphenadrine is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, sphincter relaxation disorders, digestive problems such as peptic ulcers, bowel obstruction, or with enlarged prostate, bladder disorders; that is, they should not consume this drug. Continuous and/or cumulative use of anticholinergic medications, including first-generation antihistamines, is associated with higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older people. == Pharmacology == Orphenadrine is known to have these pharmacological properties: Nonselective mACh receptor antagonist (anticholinergic, 58% as potent as atropine) Various monographs and package inserts, nursing manuals, journal articles and so forth have proposed the theory that this anticholinergic (atropine-like) activity, NMDA antagonism and possible local anaesthetic and miscellaneous analgesic effects may be the reason for orphenadrine's efficacy against muscle and other pain. These reasons are behind the use of orphenadrine and other drugs of a number of types which are used with paracetamol, aspirin, naproxen, and similar agents with or without opioid analgesics to more effectively manage pain of various types. H1 receptor antagonist (antihistamine) NMDA receptor antagonist (Ki value of 6.0 ± 0.7 μM, one hundred times less potent than phencyclidine, which binds with a Ki of 59 nM) NDRI (norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor) Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 sodium channel blocker HERG potassium channel blocker == History == George Rieveschl was a professor of chemistry at the University of Cincinnati and led a research program working on antihistamines. In 1943, one of his students, Fred Huber, synthesized diphenhydramine. Rieveschl worked with Parke-Davis to test the compound, and the company licensed the patent from him. In 1947 Parke-Davis hired him as their Director of Research. While he was there, he led the development of orphenadrine, an analog of diphenhydramine. Prior to the development of amantadine in the late 1960s and then other drugs, anticholinergics like orphenadrine were the mainstay of Parkinson's treatment. == Formulation == Orphenadrine has been available as a citrate salt and a hydrochloride salt; in the US as of February 2016 the citrate form was available in tablets, extended release tablets, compounding powder and by injection for acute use in a hospital setting.

2940,"('Saquinavir', 'Ro 31-8959', 'Invirase', 'Fortovase', 'Ro 318959')",Medical,"Saquinavir, sold under the brand name Invirase among others, is an antiretroviral medication used together with other medications to treat or prevent HIV/AIDS. Typically it is used with ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir to increase its effect. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and feeling tired. More serious side effects include problems with QT prolongation, heart block, high blood lipids, and liver problems. It appears to be safe in pregnancy. It is in the protease inhibitor class and works by blocking the HIV protease. Saquinavir was patented in 1988 and first sold in 1995. == Medical uses == Saquinavir is used together with other medications to treat or prevent HIV/AIDS. Typically it is used with ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir to increase its effect. == Side effects == The most frequent adverse events with saquinavir in either formulation are mild gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, nausea, loose stools and abdominal discomfort. Invirase is better tolerated than Fortovase. == Bioavailability and drug interactions == Saquinavir, in the Invirase formulation, has a low and variable oral bioavailability, when given alone. The Fortovase formulation at the standard dosage delivers approximately eightfold more active drug than Invirase, also at the standard dosage. In the clinic, it was found that the oral bioavailability of saquinavir in both formulations significantly increases when patients also receive the PI ritonavir. For patients, this has the major benefit that they can take less saquinavir, while maintaining sufficient saquinavir blood plasma levels to efficiently suppress the replication of HIV. The mechanism behind this welcome observation was not directly known, but later it was determined that ritonavir inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme. Normally, this enzyme metabolizes saquinavir to an inactive form, but with the ritonavir inhibiting this enzyme, the saquinavir blood plasma levels increased considerably. Additionally, ritonavir also inhibits multidrug transporters, although to a much lower extent. Unlike other protease inhibitors, the absorption of saquinavir seems to be improved by omeprazole. == Mechanism of action == Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor. Proteases are enzymes that cleave protein molecules into smaller fragments. HIV protease is vital for both viral replication within the cell and release of mature viral particles from an infected cell. Saquinavir binds to the active site of the viral protease and prevents cleavage of viral polyproteins, preventing maturation of the virus. Saquinavir inhibits both HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. == History == Saquinavir was developed by the pharmaceutical company Roche. Saquinavir was the sixth antiretroviral and the first protease inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), leading ritonavir and indinavir by a few months. This new class of antiretrovirals played a critical role in the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which helped significantly lower the risk of death from AIDS-related causes, as seen by a reduction of the annual U.S. HIV-associated death rate, from over 50,000 to about 18,000 over a period of two years. Roche requested and received approval of Invirase via the FDA's ""Accelerated Approval"" program—a process designed to speed drugs to market for the treatment of serious diseases—a decision that was controversial, as AIDS activists disagreed over the benefits of thorough testing versus early access to new drugs. It was approved again on November 7, 1997, as Fortovase, a soft gel capsule reformulated for improved bioavailability. Roche announced in May 2005 that, given reduced demand, Fortovase would cease being marketed early in 2006, in favor of Invirase boosted with ritonavir, owing to the ability of the latter co-formulated drug to inhibit the enzyme that metabolizes the AIDS drugs. == Society and culture == === Economics === As of 2015, it is not available as a generic medication. === Formulations === Two formulations have been marketed: a hard-gel capsule formulation of the mesylate, with trade name Invirase, which requires combination with ritonavir to increase the saquinavir bioavailability; a soft-gel capsule formulation of saquinavir (microemulsion, orally-administered formulation), with trade name Fortovase, which was discontinued worldwide in 2006. == References == == External links == ""Saquinavir"".

2944,"('Buspirone (hydrochloride)', 'Buspirone', 'Buspirona', 'Buspironum', 'Buspironum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Buspirone, sold under the brand name Buspar among others, is an anxiolytic, a medication primarily used to treat anxiety disorders, particularly generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, increasing action at serotonin receptors in the brain. It is taken orally and takes two to six weeks to be fully effective. Common side effects of buspirone include nausea, headaches, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating. Serious side effects may include movement disorders, serotonin syndrome, and seizures. Its use in pregnancy appears to be safe but has not been well studied, and use during breastfeeding has not been well studied either. Buspirone was developed in 1968 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1986. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 54th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Anxiety === Buspirone is used for the short-term and long-term treatment of anxiety disorders or symptoms of anxiety. It is generally preferred over benzodiazepines because it does not activate the receptors that make drugs like alprazolam addictive. Buspirone has no immediate anxiolytic effects, and hence has a delayed onset of action; its full clinical effectiveness may require 2–4 weeks to manifest itself. The drug is similarly effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) to benzodiazepines including diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, and clorazepate. Buspirone is not known to be effective in the treatment of other anxiety disorders besides GAD. === Other uses === ==== Sexual dysfunction ==== There is some evidence that buspirone on its own may be useful in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women. Buspirone may also be effective in treating antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction. ==== Miscellaneous ==== Buspirone is not effective as a treatment for benzodiazepine withdrawal, barbiturate withdrawal, or alcohol withdrawal. SSRI and SNRI antidepressants such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, respectively, may cause jaw pain/jaw spasm reversible syndrome, although it is not common, and buspirone appears to be successful in treating antidepressant-induced bruxism. == Contraindications == Buspirone has these contraindications: Hypersensitivity to buspirone Metabolic acidosis, as in diabetes Should not be used with MAO inhibitors Severely compromised liver and/or kidney function == Side effects == Known side effects associated with buspirone include dizziness, headaches, nausea, tinnitus, and paresthesia. Buspirone is relatively well tolerated and is not associated with sedation, cognitive and psychomotor impairment, muscle relaxation, physical dependence, or anticonvulsant effects. In addition, buspirone does not produce euphoria and is not a drug of abuse. == Overdose == Buspirone appears to be relatively benign in cases of single-drug overdose, although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available. In one clinical trial, buspirone was administered to healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375 mg/day, and produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. In early clinical trials, buspirone was given at dosages even as high as 2,400 mg/day, with akathisia, tremor, and muscle rigidity observed. Deliberate overdoses with 250 mg and up to 300 mg buspirone have resulted in drowsiness in about 50% of individuals. One death has been reported in a co-ingestion of 450 mg buspirone with alprazolam, diltiazem, alcohol, and cocaine. == Interactions == Buspirone has been shown in vitro to be metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4. This finding is consistent with the in vivo interactions observed between buspirone and these inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), among others: Itraconazole: Increased plasma level of buspirone Rifampicin: Decreased plasma levels of buspirone Nefazodone: Increased plasma levels of buspirone Haloperidol: Increased plasma levels of buspirone Carbamazepine: Decreased plasma levels of buspirone Grapefruit: Significantly increases the plasma levels of buspirone. See grapefruit–drug interactions. Fluvoxamine: Moderately increased plasma levels of buspirone. Elevated blood pressure has been reported when buspirone has been administered to patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Buspirone has been found to markedly reduce the hallucinogenic effects of the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin in humans. This parallels findings in which serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists like 8-OH-DPAT attenuate the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, induced by serotonergic psychedelics in rodents. Paradoxically however, buspirone enhances the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, induced by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) plus pargyline in rodents. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Buspirone acts as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor with high affinity. It is a partial agonist of both presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which are inhibitory autoreceptors, and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. It is thought that the main effects of buspirone are mediated via its interaction with the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptor, thus reducing the firing of serotonin-producing neurons. Buspirone also seems to have lower affinities for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, 5-HT7 receptors where it probably acts as an antagonist. In addition to binding to serotonin receptors, buspirone is an antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor with weak affinity. It preferentially blocks inhibitory presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, and antagonizes postsynaptic D2 receptors only at higher doses. In accordance, buspirone has been found to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway at low doses, whereas at higher doses, postsynaptic D2 receptors are blocked and antidopaminergic effects such as hypoactivity and reduced stereotypy, though notably not catalepsy, are observed in animals. Buspirone has also been found to bind with much higher affinity to the dopamine D3 and D4 receptors, where it is similarly an antagonist. A major metabolite of buspirone, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP), occurs at higher circulating levels than buspirone itself and is known to act as a potent α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist. This metabolite may be responsible for the increased noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity observed with buspirone in animals. Buspirone also has very weak and probably clinically unimportant affinity for the α1-adrenergic receptor. However, buspirone has been reported to have shown ""significant and selective intrinsic efficacy"" at the α1-adrenergic receptor expressed in a ""tissue- and species-dependent manner"". Unlike benzodiazepines, buspirone does not interact with the GABAA receptor complex. === Pharmacokinetics === Buspirone has a low oral bioavailability of 3.9% relative to intravenous injection due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The time to peak plasma levels following ingestion is 0.9 to 1.5 hours. It is reported to have an elimination half-life of 2.8 hours, although a review of 14 studies found that the mean terminal half-life ranged between 2 and 11 hours, and one study even reported a terminal half-life of 33 hours. Buspirone is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, and prominent drug interactions with inhibitors and inducers of this enzyme have been observed. Major metabolites of buspirone include 5-hydroxybuspirone, 6-hydroxybuspirone, 8-hydroxybuspirone, and 1-PP. 6-Hydroxybuspirone has been identified as the predominant hepatic metabolite of buspirone, with plasma levels that are 40-fold greater than those of buspirone after oral administration of buspirone to humans. The metabolite is a high-affinity partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki=25 nM) similarly to buspirone, and has demonstrated occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor in vivo. As such, it is likely to play an important role in the therapeutic effects of buspirone. 1-PP has also been found to circulate at higher levels than those of buspirone itself and may similarly play a significant role in the clinical effects of buspirone. == Chemistry == Buspirone is a member of the azapirone chemical class, and consists of azaspirodecanedione and pyrimidinylpiperazine components linked together by a butyl chain. === Analogues === Structural analogues of buspirone include other azapirones like gepirone, ipsapirone, perospirone, and tandospirone. A number of analogues are recorded. === Synthesis === A number of methods of synthesis have also been reported. One method begins with alkylation of 1-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazine (1) with 3-chloro-1-cyanopropane (4-chlorobutyronitrile) (2) to give (3). Next, reduction of the nitrile group is performed either by catalytic hydrogenation or with lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) giving (4). The primary amine is then reacted with 3,3-tetramethyleneglutaric anhydride (5) in order to yield buspirone (6). == History == Buspirone was first synthesized by a team at Mead Johnson in 1968 but was not patented until 1980. It was initially developed as an antipsychotic acting on the D2 receptor but was found to be ineffective in the treatment of psychosis; it was then used as an anxiolytic instead. In 1986, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained FDA approval for buspirone in the treatment of GAD. The patent expired in 2001, and buspirone is now available as a generic drug. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Buspirone is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana of buspirone, while buspirone hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Buspirone was primarily sold under the brand name Buspar. Buspar is currently listed as discontinued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2010, in response to a citizen petition, the FDA determined that Buspar was not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness. == References == == External links == Media related to Buspirone at Wikimedia Commons",Buspirone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.6702524337451905e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00013672371278516948)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buspirone,https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/buspirone,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531477/ ', [])"

2946,"('Methoxsalen', 'Xanthotoxin', 'Ammoidin', 'Meladinine', 'Oxypsoralen')",Medical,"Methoxsalen (or Xanthotoxin, 8-methoxypsoralen) sold under the brand name Oxsoralen among others, is a medication used to treat psoriasis, eczema, vitiligo, and some cutaneous lymphomas in conjunction with exposing the skin to ultraviolet (UVA) light from lamps or sunlight. Methoxsalen modifies the way skin cells receive the UVA radiation, allegedly clearing up the disease. Levels of individual patient PUVA exposure were originally determined using the Fitzpatrick scale. The scale was developed after patients demonstrated symptoms of phototoxicity after oral ingestion of methoxsalen followed by PUVA therapy. Chemically, methoxsalen is a derivative of psoralen and belongs to a class of organic natural molecules known as furanocoumarins. They consist of coumarin annulated with furan. It can also be injected and used topically. == Natural sources == In 1947, methoxsalen was isolated (under the name ""ammoidin"") from the plant Ammi majus, bishop's weed. In 1970, Nielsen extracted 8-methoxypsoralen from four species of the genus Heracleum in the carrot family Apiaceae, including Heracleum mantegazzianum and Heracleum sphondylium. An additional 32 species of the genus Heracleum were found to contain 5-methoxypsoralen (bergapten) or other furanocoumarins. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthetic pathway is a combination of the shikimate pathway, which produces umbelliferone, and the mevalonate pathway. === Synthesis of umbelliferone === Umbelliferone is a phenylpropanoid and as such is synthesized from L-phenylalanine, which in turn is produced via the shikimate pathway. Phenylalanine is lysated into cinnamic acid, followed by hydroxylation by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase to yield 4-coumaric acid. The 4-coumaric acid is again hydroxylated by cinnamate/coumarate 2-hydroxylase to yield 2,4-dihydroxy-cinnamic acid (umbellic acid) followed by a bond rotation of the unsaturated bond adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. Finally an intramolecular attack from the hydroxyl group of C2' to the carboxylic acid group closes the ring and forms the lactone umbelliferone. === Synthesis of methoxsalen === The biosynthetic route then continues with the activation of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), produced via the mevalonate pathway, to form a carbo-cation via the cleavage of the diphosphates. Once activated, the enzyme umbelliferone 6-prenyltransferase catalyzes a C-alkylation between DMAPP and umbelliferone at the activated position ortho to the phenol, yielding demethylsuberosin. This is then followed by a hydroxylation catalyzed by the enzyme marmesin synthase to yield marmesin. Another hydroxylation is catalyzed by psoralen synthase to yield psoralen. A third hydroxylation by the enzyme psoralen 8-monooxygenase yields xanthotoxol which is followed by a methylation via the enzyme xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl methionine to yield methoxsalen. == Risks and side effects == Patients with high blood pressure or a history of liver problems are at risk for inflammation and irreparable damage to both liver and skin. The eyes must be protected from UVA radiation. Side effects include nausea, headaches, dizziness, and in rare cases insomnia. Methoxsalen has also been classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen (known to cause cancer) but is only cancerous when combined with light - UVA radiation. == Society and culture == Author John Howard Griffin (1920–1980) used the chemical to darken his skin in order to investigate racial segregation in the American South. He wrote the book Black Like Me (1961) about his experiences. == References ==",Oxypsoralen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.20142056047916412), (' FOOD', -5.1093578804284334e-05)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00020525732543319464), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.47416508197784424), ('ĠFOOD', -0.19803132116794586), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0298442579805851)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00033546582562848926), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.drugs.com/cdi/oxsoralen.html,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1578011/,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/methoxsalen-topical-route/description/drg-20064753 ', [])"
2947,"('Pelitrexol', 'Ag 2037')",Medical,"Pelitrexol (development code AG2037) is a purine biosynthesis inhibitor used in cancer treatment research, specifically targeting the enzyme glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). It has been studied for its potential in inhibiting tumor growth by reducing purine nucleotide pools, which in turn suppresses mTORC1 activity and disrupts cancer cell proliferation. == Mechanism of action == Pelitrexol inhibits the GARFT enzyme, an essential component of de novo purine biosynthesis. This leads to a reduction in intracellular guanine nucleotides, which impairs Rheb activation, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 activity. The drug disrupts both protein synthesis and tumor growth by impacting cell cycle progression and nucleotide availability. == Antitumor activity == Pelitrexol has shown significant tumor-suppressive effects in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models. In preclinical studies, the drug reduced mTORC1 activity, leading to robust inhibition of tumor growth in mice with NSCLC xenografts. However, development was discontinued due to limited single-agent efficacy in clinical trials. == Applications == Pelitrexol has been primarily investigated in the context of non-small-cell lung cancer and other tumors where purine biosynthesis is essential for cancer cell proliferation. While it has not advanced to widespread clinical use, the compound remains a valuable research tool in understanding cancer metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways. == Risks and limitations == The major limitation of pelitrexol is its lack of efficacy as a standalone treatment in clinical trials.

2948,"('Epothilone b', 'Patupilone', 'Epo b', 'Epothilon b', 'Patupilone (epothilone b)')",Medical," Epothilones are a class of 16-membered macrolide compounds targeting microtubules. They have good anticancer activity and their mechanism of action is similar to that of paclitaxel. Epothilones are also highly active against cancer cells that are resistant to paclitaxel and other anticancer drugs. They have good water solubility, simple structure, and are relatively easy to totally synthesize and or semi-synthesize. These results immediately attracted great interest and research enthusiasm from pharmaceutical companies and academia. Herein, the various synthetic methods of epothilone B and its anticancer activity were summarized and analyzed. Epothilones are naturally occurring 16-membered macrolides with the ability to promote tubulin polymerization in vitro and to stabilize preformed microtubules against Ca(2+)- or cold-induced depolymerization. In contrast to paclitaxel (Taxol((R))) epothilones are also active in vitro against multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines as well as cell lines whose paclitaxel-resistance is derived from specific beta-tubulin mutations. Based on their attractive in vitro biological profile epothilones have turned into important lead structures in anticancer drug discovery and hundreds of analogs and derivatives of epothilone A and B have been prepared and biologically characterized over the past four years. A number of compounds, including natural epothilone B, deoxyepothilone B, and epothilone B lactam (BMS-247550) have also been reported to exhibit profound in vivo antitumor activity in animal models. Apart from providing a brief summary of the SAR that has emerged from the above in vitro studies, this minireview will largely focus on the biology and chemistry of those analogs for which in vivo antitumor activity has been reported in the literature. Two of these compounds, natural epothilone B and epothilone B lactam (BMS-247550) have advanced to clinical studies in humans. Epothilones are microtubule inhibitors that are promising alternatives to paclitaxel due to enhanced anticancer efficacy. While epothilones are slightly more water soluble than paclitaxel and more active against paclitaxel-resistant cells, they still require formulation with Cremophor EL and/or cosolvents and drug resistance still limits therapeutic efficacy. In this report, we showed that the combinational treatment of epothilone B (EpoB), 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG, Hsp90 inhibitor), and rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) displays strong anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. To address the poor water solubility of this 3 drug-combination, they were co-loaded into poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA) micelles, and the 3-in-1 loaded PEG-b-PLA micelle (m-EAR) was characterized in terms of drug loading efficiency, particle size, release kinetics. The m-EAR achieved high levels of all three drugs in water; formed micelles with hydrodynamic diameters at ca. 30nm and released the drugs in a sustained manner in vitro at rates slower than individually loaded PEG-b-PLA micelles. In A549-derived xenograft mice, m-EAR (2.0, 15.0, and 7.5mg/kg) caused tumor regression after four weekly injections, whereas EpoB alone (2.0mg/kg) was the same as control. No severe changes in body weight relative to PBS control were observed, attesting to the safety of m-EAR. Collectively, these results suggest that m-EAR provides a simple, but effective and safe EpoB-based combination nanomedicine for cancer therapy.",Epothilone b,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.696889623621246e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.003434594254940748), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07891751080751419)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -5.836499985889532e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.10020732134580612), (' INDUSTR', -0.0001584850688232109), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15367426/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12570848/,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.117.007626/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epothilone ', [])"

2950,"('Droxidopa', 'Dops', 'Northera', '(2s,3r)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid', 'Threo-droxidopa')",Medical,"Droxidopa, also known as L-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS) and sold under the brand names Northera and Dops among others, is sympathomimetic medication which is used in the treatment of hypotension (low blood pressure) and for other indications. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of droxidopa include headache, dizziness, nausea, and hypertension, among others. Droxidopa is a synthetic amino acid precursor which acts as a prodrug to the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Hence, it acts as a non-selective agonist of the α- and β-adrenergic receptors. Unlike norepinephrine, but similarly to levodopa (L-DOPA), droxidopa is capable of crossing the protective blood–brain barrier (BBB). Droxidopa was first described by 1971. It was approved for use in Japan in 1989 and was introduced in the United States in 2014. == Medical uses == Droxidopa is approved for use in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension, intradialytic hypotension (IDH; hemodialysis-induced hypotension), dizziness, and amyloid polyneuropathy. For hypotension, it is specifically used in the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) in dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency, as well as NOH associated with multiple system atrophy (MSA), familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), and pure autonomic failure (PAF). The drug is also used off-label in the treatment of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease. == Side effects == With over 20 years on the market, droxidopa has proven to have few side effects of which most are mild. The most common side effects reported in clinical trials include headache, dizziness, nausea, hypertension and fatigue. == Pharmacology == Droxidopa is a prodrug of norepinephrine used to increase the concentrations of these neurotransmitters in the body and brain. It is metabolized by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), also known as DOPA decarboxylase (DDC). Patients with NOH have depleted levels of norepinephrine which leads to decreased blood pressure or hypotension upon orthostatic challenge. Droxidopa works by increasing the levels of norepinephrine in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), thus enabling the body to maintain blood flow upon and while standing. Droxidopa can also cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) where it is converted to norepinephrine from within the brain. Increased levels of norepinephrine in the central nervous system (CNS) may be beneficial to patients in a wide range of indications. Droxidopa can be coupled with a peripheral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (AAADI) or DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DDC) such as carbidopa (Lodosyn) to increase central norepinephrine concentrations while minimizing increases of peripheral levels. == Chemistry == Droxidopa, also known as (–)-threo-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-L-serine (L-DOPS), is a substituted phenethylamine and is chemically analogous to levodopa (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; L-DOPA). Whereas levodopa functions as a precursor and prodrug to dopamine, droxidopa is a precursor and prodrug of norepinephrine. == History == Droxidopa was first described in the scientific literature by 1971. Droxidopa was developed by Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of hypotension, including NOH, and NOH associated with various disorders such as MSA, FAP, and PD, as well as IDH. The drug has been used in Japan and some surrounding Asian areas for these indications since 1989. Following a merger with Dainippon Pharmaceuticals in 2006, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma licensed droxidopa to Chelsea Therapeutics to develop and market it worldwide except in Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. In February 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved droxidopa for the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. === Clinical trials === A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted on clinical trials comparing the clinical use of droxidopa and midodrine have found that midodrine was more likely to cause supine hypertension than droxidopa in patients with NOH. Midodrine was also found to be slightly more effective at raising blood pressure but not statistically significantly. Chelsea Therapeutics obtained orphan drug status (ODS) for droxidopa in the US for NOH, and that of which associated with PD, PAF, and MSA. In 2014, Chelsea Therapeutics was acquired by Lundbeck along with the rights to droxidopa which was launched in the US in Sept 2014. == Society and culture == === Names === Droxidopa is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name.

2951,"('Selexipag', 'Uptravi', 'Ns 304', 'Selexipag [usan:inn]', 'Uptravi (tn)')",Medical,"Selexipag, sold under the brand name Uptravi, is a medication developed by Actelion for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Selexipag and its active metabolite, ACT-333679 (or MRE-269, the free carboxylic acid), are agonists of the prostacyclin receptor, which leads to vasodilation in the pulmonary circulation. It is taken by mouth or administered intravenously. The most common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, jaw pain, myalgia (muscle pain), pain in the limbs, arthralgia (joint pain) and flushing. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Selexipag is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. == Contraindications == In the European Union, use of selexipag together with strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP2C8, such as gemfibrozil, is contraindicated because it increases concentrations of selexipag twofold, and its active metabolite 11-fold, potentially leading to more adverse effects. == Adverse effects == The adverse effects of selexipag are similar to those of intravenous prostacyclins used for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Common side effects include headache and jaw pain. An increased risk for hyperthyroidism has also been noted in people taking selexipag. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Selexipag and its active metabolite ACT-333679 act on the prostacyclin receptor of lung tissue, with the latter being 37-fold more potent. They are selective for the prostacyclin receptor. Binding to this receptor leads to three major effects: increased vasodilation of the arteries, decreased cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation, all beneficial in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. === Pharmacokinetics === Selexipag is quickly absorbed from the gut and hydrolyzed in the intestines and the liver to ACT-333679 by carboxylesterases. Absolute bioavailability is about 49%, most likely because of a high first-pass effect. Highest concentrations in the blood plasma are reached after one to three hours for selexipag and after three to four hours for the active metabolite. When in the circulation, about 99% of both substances are bound to plasma proteins, namely to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein to equal amounts. The liver enzymes CYP2C8 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A4, hydroxylate and dealkylate the active substance, thereby inactivating it. Besides, ACT-333679 is glucuronidized by the enzymes UGT1A3 and UGT2B7. The terminal half-life of selexipag is 0.8 to 2.5 hours, that of the active metabolite is 6.2 to 13.5 hours. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === The synthesis of celexipag begins from two inexpensive compounds, glycine hydrochloride and benzil, condensed under basic conditions. == History == The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted selexipag orphan drug designation for pulmonary arterial hypertension and for the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. It was approved by the FDA in December 2015.

2952,"('Agmatine (sulfate)', 'Agmatine', '(4-aminobutyl)guanidine', 'Argmatine', 'Guanidine, (4-aminobutyl)-')","Endogenous, Medical","Agmatine, also known as 4-aminobutyl-guanidine, was discovered in 1910 by Albrecht Kossel. It is a chemical substance which is naturally created from the amino acid arginine. Agmatine has been shown to exert modulatory action at multiple molecular targets, notably: neurotransmitter systems, ion channels, nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and polyamine metabolism and this provides bases for further research into potential applications. == History == The term agmatine stems from A- (for amino-) + g- (from guanidine) + -ma- (from ptomaine) + -in (German)/-ine (English) suffix with insertion of -t- apparently for euphony. A year after its discovery, it was found that agmatine could increase blood flow in rabbits; however, the physiological relevance of these findings were questioned given the high concentrations (high μM range) required. In the 1920s, researchers in the diabetes clinic of Oskar Minkowski showed that agmatine can exert mild hypoglycemic effects. In 1994, endogenous agmatine synthesis in mammals was discovered. == Metabolic pathways == Agmatine is a cationic amine formed by decarboxylation of L-arginine by the mitochondrial enzyme arginine decarboxylase (ADC). Agmatine degradation occurs mainly by hydrolysis, catalyzed by agmatinase into urea and putrescine, the diamine precursor of polyamine biosynthesis. An alternative pathway, mainly in peripheral tissues, is by diamine oxidase-catalyzed oxidation into agmatine-aldehyde, which is in turn converted by aldehyde dehydrogenase into guanidinobutyrate and secreted by the kidneys. == Mechanisms of action == Agmatine was found to exert modulatory actions directly and indirectly at multiple key molecular targets underlying cellular control mechanisms of cardinal importance in health and disease. It is considered capable of exerting its modulatory actions simultaneously at multiple targets. The following outline indicates the categories of control mechanisms, and identifies their molecular targets: Neurotransmitter receptors and receptor ionophores. Nicotinic, imidazoline I1 and I2, α2-adrenergic, glutamate NMDAr, and serotonin 5-HT2A and 5HT-3 receptors. Ion channels. Including: ATP-sensitive K+ channels, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). Membrane transporters. Agmatine specific-selective uptake sites, organic cation transporters (mostly OCT2 subtype), extraneuronal monoamine transporters (ENT), polyamine transporters, and mitochondrial agmatine specific-selective transport system. Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis modulation. Both differential inhibition and activation of NO synthase (NOS) isoforms is reported. Polyamine metabolism. Agmatine is a precursor for polyamine synthesis, competitive inhibitor of polyamine transport, inducer of spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT), and inducer of antizyme. Protein ADP-ribosylation. Inhibition of protein arginine ADP-ribosylation. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Indirect down-regulation of the enzymes MMP 2 and 9. Advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation. Direct blockade of AGEs formation. NADPH oxidase. Activation of the enzyme leading to H2O2 production. == Food consumption == Agmatine sulfate injection can increase food intake with carbohydrate preference in satiated, but not hungry, rats and this effect may be mediated by neuropeptide Y. However, supplementation in rat drinking water results in slight reductions in water intake, body weight, and blood pressure. In addition, force feeding with agmatine leads to a reduction in body weight gain during rat development. It is also found that many fermented foods contain agmatine. == Pharmacokinetics == Agmatine is present in small amounts in plant-, animal-, and fish-derived foodstuff, and gut microbial production is an added source for agmatine. Oral agmatine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and readily distributed throughout the body. Rapid elimination from non-brain organs of ingested (un-metabolized) agmatine by the kidneys has indicated a blood half life of about 2 hours. == Research == A number of potential medical uses for agmatine have been suggested. Agmatine is also used as a prototrophy selection marker in Microbiology for the study of Sulfolobus and Thermococcus genus. === Cardiovascular === Agmatine produces mild reductions in heart rate and blood pressure, apparently by activating both central and peripheral control systems via modulation of several of its molecular targets including: imidazoline receptors subtypes, norepinephrine release and NO production. === Glucose regulation === Agmatine hypoglycemic effects are the result of simultaneous modulation of several molecular mechanisms involved in blood glucose regulation. === Kidney functions === Agmatine has been shown to enhance glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and to exert nephroprotective effects. === Neurotransmission === Agmatine has been discussed as a putative neurotransmitter. It is synthesized in the brain, stored in synaptic vesicles, accumulated by uptake, released by membrane depolarization, and inactivated by agmatinase. Agmatine binds to α2-adrenergic receptor and imidazoline receptor binding sites, and blocks NMDA receptors and other cation ligand-gated channels. However, while agmatine binds to α2-adrenergic receptors, it exerts neither an agonistic nor antagonistic effect on these receptors, lacking any intrinsic activity. Short only of identifying specific (""own"") post-synaptic receptors, agmatine fulfills Henry Dale's criteria for a neurotransmitter and is hence considered a neuromodulator and co-transmitter. The existence of theoretical agmatinergic-mediated neuronal systems has not yet been demonstrated although the existence of such receptors is implied by its prominence in the mediation of both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Research into agmatine-specific receptors and transmission pathways continues. Due to its ability to pass through open cationic channels, agmatine has also been used as a surrogate metric of integrated ionic flux into neural tissue upon stimulation. When neural tissue is incubated in agmatine and an external stimulus is applied, only cells with open channels will be filled with agmatine, allowing identification of which cells are sensitive to that stimuli and the degree to which they opened their cationic channels during the stimulation period. === Opioid liability === Systemic agmatine can potentiate opioid analgesia, and prevent tolerance to chronic morphine in laboratory rodents.

2953,"('Piroxicam', 'Feldene', 'Piroxicamum', 'Pyroxycam', 'Roxicam')",Medical,"Piroxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class used to relieve the symptoms of painful inflammatory conditions like arthritis. Piroxicam works by preventing the production of endogenous prostaglandins which are involved in the mediation of pain, stiffness, tenderness and swelling. The medicine is available as capsules, tablets and, in some countries, as a prescription-free gel 0.5%. It is also available in a betadex formulation, which allows a more rapid absorption of piroxicam from the digestive tract. Piroxicam is one of the few NSAIDs that can be given parenteral routes. It was patented in 1968 by Pfizer and approved for medical use in 1979. It became generic in 1992, and is marketed worldwide under many brand names. == Medical uses == It is used in the treatment of certain inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, primary dysmenorrhoea, and postoperative pain; it acts as an analgesic, especially where there is an inflammatory component. The European Medicines Agency issued a review of its use in 2007 and recommended that its use be limited to the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, as it is only in these circumstances that its risk-benefit ratio proves to be favourable. == Adverse effects == As with other NSAIDs the principal side effects include: digestive complaints like nausea, discomfort, diarrhoea and bleeds or ulceration of the stomach, as well as headache, dizziness, nervousness, depression, drowsiness, insomnia, vertigo, hearing disturbances (such as tinnitus), high blood pressure, oedema, light sensitivity, skin reactions (including, albeit rarely, Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and rarely, kidney failure, pancreatitis, liver damage, visual disturbances, pulmonary eosinophilia and fibrosing alveolitis. Compared to other NSAIDs it is more prone to causing gastrointestinal disturbances and serious skin reactions. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == Mechanism of action == Piroxicam is an NSAID and, as such, is a non-selective COX inhibitor possessing both analgesic and antipyretic properties. == Chemical properties == Piroxicam exists as alkenol tautomer in organic solvents and as zwitterionic form in water. == History == The project that produced piroxicam began in 1962 at Pfizer; the first clinical trial results were reported in 1977, and the product launched in 1980 under the brand name ""Feldene"". Major patents expired in 1992 and the drug is marketed worldwide under many brandnames. == See also == Meloxicam Isoxicam Lornoxicam == References == == Further reading ==",Roxicam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.008420558646321297), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004531234968453646)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5759394764900208)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/piroxicam-oral-route/description/drg-20069771?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=137, start_index=9, title='Piroxicam (oral route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/piroxicam-oral-route/description/drg-20069771?utm_source=openai')])"

2955,"('Serotonin hydrochloride', 'Serotonin', 'Enteramine', 'Thrombotonin', 'Thrombocytin')","Endogenous, Medical","Serotonin (), also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a monoamine neurotransmitter with a wide range of functions in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. It is involved in mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, and physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction. In the CNS, serotonin regulates mood, appetite, and sleep. Most of the body's serotonin—about 90%—is synthesized in the gastrointestinal tract by enterochromaffin cells, where it regulates intestinal movements. It is also produced in smaller amounts in the brainstem's raphe nuclei, the skin's Merkel cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, and taste receptor cells of the tongue. Once secreted, serotonin is taken up by platelets in the blood, which release it during clotting to promote vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. Around 8% of the body's serotonin is stored in platelets, and 1–2% is found in the CNS. Serotonin acts as both a vasoconstrictor and vasodilator depending on concentration and context, influencing hemostasis and blood pressure regulation. It plays a role in stimulating myenteric neurons and enhancing gastrointestinal motility through uptake and release cycles in platelets and surrounding tissue. Biochemically, serotonin is an indoleamine synthesized from tryptophan and metabolized primarily in the liver to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Serotonin is targeted by several classes of antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which block reabsorption in the synapse to elevate its levels. It is found in nearly all bilateral animals, including insects and worms, and also occurs in fungi and plants. In plants and insect venom, it serves a defensive function by inducing pain. Serotonin released by pathogenic amoebae may cause diarrhea in the human gut, while its presence in seeds and fruits is thought to stimulate digestion and facilitate seed dispersal. == Molecular structure == Biochemically, the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan, via the (rate-limiting) hydroxylation of the 5 position on the ring (forming the intermediate 5-hydroxytryptophan), and then decarboxylation to produce serotonin. Preferable conformations are defined via ethylamine chain, resulting in six different conformations. == Crystal structure == Serotonin crystallizes in P212121 chiral space group forming different hydrogen-bonding interactions between serotonin molecules via N-H...O and O-H...N intermolecular bonds. Serotonin also forms several salts, including pharmaceutical formulation of serotonin adipate. == Biological role == Serotonin is involved in numerous physiological processes, including sleep, thermoregulation, learning and memory, pain, (social) behavior, sexual activity, feeding, motor activity, neural development, and biological rhythms. In less complex animals, such as some invertebrates, serotonin regulates feeding and other processes. In plants serotonin synthesis seems to be associated with stress signals. Despite its longstanding prominence in pharmaceutical advertising, the claim that low serotonin levels cause depression is not supported by scientific evidence. === Cellular effects === Serotonin primarily acts through its receptors and its effects depend on which cells and tissues express these receptors. Metabolism involves first oxidation by monoamine oxidase to 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAL). The rate-limiting step is hydride transfer from serotonin to the flavin cofactor. There follows oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the indole acetic-acid derivative. The latter is then excreted by the kidneys. ==== Receptors ==== The serotonin receptors are located on the cell membrane of nerve cells and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the endogenous ligand and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and psychedelic drugs. There are currently 14 known serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1 (1A, 1B, 1D, 1E, 1F), 5-HT2 (2A, 2B, 2C), 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5 (5A, 5B), 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. Except for the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, all other 5-HT receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (also called seven-transmembrane, or heptahelical receptors) that activate an intracellular second messenger cascade. The 5-HT5B receptor is present in rodents but not in humans. In addition to the serotonin receptors, serotonin is an agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) in some species. It is a weak TAAR1 partial agonist in rats, but is inactive at the TAAR1 in mice and humans. ==== Termination ==== Serotonergic action is terminated primarily via uptake of 5-HT from the synapse. This is accomplished through the specific monoamine transporter for 5-HT, SERT, on the presynaptic neuron. Various agents can inhibit 5-HT reuptake, including cocaine, dextromethorphan (an antitussive), tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A 2006 study found that a significant portion of 5-HT's synaptic clearance is due to the selective activity of the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) which actively transports the molecule across the membrane and back into the presynaptic cell. In contrast to the high affinity of SERT, the PMAT has been identified as a low-affinity transporter, with an apparent Km of 114 micromoles/l for serotonin, which is approximately 230 times higher than that of SERT. However, the PMAT, despite its relatively low serotonergic affinity, has a considerably higher transport ""capacity"" than SERT, ""resulting in roughly comparable uptake efficiencies to SERT ... in heterologous expression systems."" The study also suggests that the administration of SSRIs such as fluoxetine and sertraline may be associated with an inhibitory effect on PMAT activity when used at higher than normal dosages (IC50 test values used in trials were 3–4 fold higher than typical prescriptive dosage). ==== Serotonylation ==== Serotonin can also signal through a nonreceptor mechanism called serotonylation, in which serotonin modifies proteins. This process underlies serotonin's effects upon platelet-forming cells (thrombocytes) in which it links to the modification of signaling enzymes called GTPases that then trigger the release of vesicle contents by exocytosis. A similar process underlies the pancreatic release of insulin. The effects of serotonin upon vascular smooth muscle tone – the biological function after which serotonin was originally named – depend upon the serotonylation of proteins involved in the contractile apparatus of muscle cells. === Nervous system === The neurons of the raphe nuclei are the principal source of 5-HT release in the brain. There are nine raphe nuclei, designated B1–B9, which contain the majority of serotonin-containing neurons (some scientists chose to group the nuclei raphes lineares into one nucleus), all of which are located along the midline of the brainstem, and centered on the reticular formation. Axons from the neurons of the raphe nuclei form a neurotransmitter system reaching almost every part of the central nervous system. Axons of neurons in the lower raphe nuclei terminate in the cerebellum and spinal cord, while the axons of the higher nuclei spread out in the entire brain. It is the dorsal part of the raphe nucleus that contains neurons projecting to the central nervous system. Serotonin-releasing neurons in this area receive input from a large number of areas, notably from prefrontal cortex, lateral habenula, preoptic area, substantia nigra and amygdala. These neurons are thought to communicate the expectation of rewards in the near future, a quantity called state value in reinforcement learning. ==== Ultrastructure and function ==== The serotonin nuclei may also be divided into two main groups, the rostral and caudal containing three and four nuclei respectively. The rostral group consists of the caudal linear nuclei (B8), the dorsal raphe nuclei (B6 and B7) and the median raphe nuclei (B5, B8 and B9), that project into multiple cortical and subcortical structures. The caudal group consists of the nucleus raphe magnus (B3), raphe obscurus nucleus (B2), raphe pallidus nucleus (B1), and lateral medullary reticular formation, that project into the brainstem. The serotonergic pathway is involved in sensorimotor function, with pathways projecting both into cortical (Dorsal and Median Raphe Nuclei), subcortical, and spinal areas involved in motor activity. Pharmacological manipulation suggests that serotonergic activity increases with motor activity while firing rates of serotonergic neurons increase with intense visual stimuli. Animal models suggest that kainate signaling negatively regulates serotonin actions in the retina, with possible implications for the control of the visual system. The descending projections form a pathway that inhibits pain called the ""descending inhibitory pathway"" that may be relevant to a disorder such as fibromyalgia, migraine, and other pain disorders, and the efficacy of antidepressants in them. Serotonergic projections from the caudal nuclei are involved in regulating mood and emotion, and hypo- or hyper-serotonergic states may be involved in depression and sickness behavior. ==== Microanatomy ==== Serotonin is released into the synapse, or space between neurons, and diffuses over a relatively wide gap (>20 nm) to activate 5-HT receptors located on the dendrites, cell bodies, and presynaptic terminals of adjacent neurons. When humans smell food, dopamine is released to increase the appetite. But, unlike in worms, serotonin does not increase anticipatory behaviour in humans; instead, the serotonin released while consuming activates 5-HT2C receptors on dopamine-producing cells. This halts their dopamine release, and thereby serotonin decreases appetite. Drugs that block 5-HT2C receptors make the body unable to recognize when it is no longer hungry or otherwise in need of nutrients, and are associated with weight gain, especially in people with a low number of receptors. The expression of 5-HT2C receptors in the hippocampus follows a diurnal rhythm, just as the serotonin release in the ventromedial nucleus, which is characterised by a peak at morning when the motivation to eat is strongest. In macaques, alpha males have twice the level of serotonin in the brain as subordinate males and females (measured by the concentration of 5-HIAA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Dominance status and CSF serotonin levels appear to be positively correlated. When dominant males were removed from such groups, subordinate males begin competing for dominance. Once new dominance hierarchies were established, serotonin levels of the new dominant individuals also increased to double those in subordinate males and females. The reason why serotonin levels are only high in dominant males, but not dominant females has not yet been established. In humans, levels of 5-HT1A receptor inhibition in the brain show negative correlation with aggression, and a mutation in the gene that codes for the 5-HT2A receptor may double the risk of suicide for those with that genotype. Serotonin in the brain is not usually degraded after use, but is collected by serotonergic neurons by serotonin transporters on their cell surfaces. Studies have revealed nearly 10% of total variance in anxiety-related personality depends on variations in the description of where, when and how many serotonin transporters the neurons should deploy. === Outside the nervous system === ==== Digestive tract (emetic) ==== Serotonin regulates gastrointestinal (GI) function. The gut is surrounded by enterochromaffin cells, which release serotonin in response to food in the lumen. This makes the gut contract around the food. Platelets in the veins draining the gut collect excess serotonin. There are often serotonin abnormalities in gastrointestinal disorders such as constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. If irritants are present in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone that stimulate vomiting. Thus, drugs and toxins stimulate serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells in the gut wall can induce emesis. The enterochromaffin cells not only react to bad food but are also very sensitive to irradiation and cancer chemotherapy. Drugs that block 5HT3 are very effective in controlling the nausea and vomiting produced by cancer treatment, and are considered the gold standard for this purpose. ==== Lungs ==== The lung, including that of reptiles, contains specialized epithelial cells that occur as solitary cells or as clusters called neuroepithelial bodies or bronchial Kulchitsky cells or alternatively K cells. These are enterochromaffin cells that like those in the gut release serotonin. Their function is probably vasoconstriction during hypoxia. ==== Skin ==== Serotonin is also produced by Merkel cells which are part of the somatosensory system. ==== Bone metabolism ==== In mice and humans, alterations in serotonin levels and signalling have been shown to regulate bone mass. Mice that lack brain serotonin have osteopenia, while mice that lack gut serotonin have high bone density. In humans, increased blood serotonin levels have been shown to be a significant negative predictor of low bone density. Serotonin can also be synthesized, albeit at very low levels, in the bone cells. It mediates its actions on bone cells using three different receptors. Through 5-HT1B receptors, it negatively regulates bone mass, while it does so positively through 5-HT2B receptors and 5-HT2C receptors. There is very delicate balance between physiological role of gut serotonin and its pathology. Increase in the extracellular content of serotonin results in a complex relay of signals in the osteoblasts culminating in FoxO1/ Creb and ATF4 dependent transcriptional events. Following the 2008 findings that gut serotonin regulates bone mass, the mechanistic investigations into what regulates serotonin synthesis from the gut in the regulation of bone mass have started. Piezo1 has been shown to sense RNA in the gut and relay this information through serotonin synthesis to the bone by acting as a sensor of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) governing 5-HT production. Intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of mouse Piezo1 profoundly disturbed gut peristalsis, impeded experimental colitis, and suppressed serum 5-HT levels. Because of systemic 5-HT deficiency, conditional knockout of Piezo1 increased bone formation. Notably, fecal ssRNA was identified as a natural Piezo1 ligand, and ssRNA-stimulated 5-HT synthesis from the gut was evoked in a MyD88/TRIF-independent manner. Colonic infusion of RNase A suppressed gut motility and increased bone mass. These findings suggest gut ssRNA as a master determinant of systemic 5-HT levels, indicating the ssRNA-Piezo1 axis as a potential prophylactic target for treatment of bone and gut disorders. Studies in 2008, 2010 and 2019 have opened the potential for serotonin research to treat bone mass disorders. ==== Organ development ==== Since serotonin signals resource availability it is not surprising that it affects organ development. Many human and animal studies have shown that nutrition in early life can influence, in adulthood, such things as body fatness, blood lipids, blood pressure, atherosclerosis, behavior, learning, and longevity. Rodent experiment shows that neonatal exposure to SSRIs makes persistent changes in the serotonergic transmission of the brain resulting in behavioral changes, which are reversed by treatment with antidepressants. By treating normal and knockout mice lacking the serotonin transporter with fluoxetine scientists showed that normal emotional reactions in adulthood, like a short latency to escape foot shocks and inclination to explore new environments were dependent on active serotonin transporters during the neonatal period. Human serotonin can also act as a growth factor directly. Liver damage increases cellular expression of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, mediating liver compensatory regrowth (see Liver § Regeneration and transplantation) Serotonin present in the blood then stimulates cellular growth to repair liver damage. 5-HT2B receptors also activate osteocytes, which build up bone However, serotonin also inhibits osteoblasts, through 5-HT1B receptors. ==== Cardiovascular growth factor ==== Serotonin, in addition, evokes endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation and stimulates, through a 5-HT1B receptor-mediated mechanism, the phosphorylation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures. In blood, serotonin is collected from plasma by platelets, which store it. It is thus active wherever platelets bind in damaged tissue, as a vasoconstrictor to stop bleeding, and also as a fibrocyte mitotic (growth factor), to aid healing. ==== Adipose tissue ==== Serotonin also regulates white and brown adipose tissue function, and adipocytes are capable of producing 5-HT separately from the gut. Serotonin increases lipogenesis through HTR2A in white adipose tissue, and suppressed thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue via Htr3. == Pharmacology == Several classes of drugs target the serotonin system, including some antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, analgesics, antimigraine drugs, antiemetics, appetite suppressants, and anticonvulsants, as well as psychedelics and entactogens. === Mechanism of action === At rest, serotonin is stored within the vesicles of presynaptic neurons. When stimulated by nerve impulses, serotonin is released as a neurotransmitter into the synapse, reversibly binding to the postsynaptic receptor to induce a nerve impulse on the postsynaptic neuron. Serotonin can also bind to auto-receptors on the presynaptic neuron to regulate the synthesis and release of serotonin. Normally serotonin is taken back into the presynaptic neuron to stop its action, then reused or broken down by monoamine oxidase. === Antidepressants === Drugs that alter serotonin levels are used in treating depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) prevent the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters (including serotonin), and therefore increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the brain. MAOI therapy is associated with many adverse drug reactions, and patients are at risk of hypertensive emergency triggered by foods with high tyramine content, and certain drugs. Some drugs inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, making it stay in the synaptic cleft longer. The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine. The newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have fewer side-effects and fewer interactions with other drugs. Certain SSRI medications have been shown to lower serotonin levels below the baseline after chronic use, despite initial increases. The 5-HTTLPR gene codes for the number of serotonin transporters in the brain, with more serotonin transporters causing decreased duration and magnitude of serotonergic signaling. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism (l/l) causing more serotonin transporters to be formed is also found to be more resilient against depression and anxiety. Besides their use in treating depression and anxiety, certain serotonergic antidepressants are also approved and used to treat fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and chronic fatigue syndrome. === Anxiolytics === Azapirone anxiolytics like buspirone and tandospirone act as serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists. === Antipsychotics === Many antipsychotics bind to and modulate serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, among others. Activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and blockade of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors may contribute to the therapeutic antipsychotic effects of these agents, whereas antagonism of serotonin 5-HT2C receptors has been especially implicated in side effects of antipsychotics. === Antimigraine agents === Antimigraine agents such as the triptans like sumatriptan act as agonists of the serotonin 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and/or 5-HT1F receptors. Earlier antimigraine agents were the ergoline derivatives and ergot-related drugs such as ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, and methysergide, which act as non-selective serotonin receptor agonists. === Antiemetics === Some serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron, are important antiemetic agents. They are particularly important in treating the nausea and vomiting that occur during anticancer chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. === Appetite suppressants === Some serotonin releasing agents, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and/or serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonists, such as fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, chlorphentermine, sibutramine, and lorcaserin, have been approved and used as appetite suppressants for purposes of weight loss in the treatment of overweightness or obesity. Several of the preceding agents have been withdrawn from the market due to toxicity, such as cardiac fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension. === Anticonvulsants === Although it was previously withdrawn from the market as an appetite suppressant, fenfluramine was reintroduced as an anticonvulsant for treatment of seizures in certain rare forms of epilepsy like Dravet syndrome and Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. Selective serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonists, like lorcaserin, bexicaserin, and BMB-101, are also being developed for this use. === Psychedelics === Serotonergic psychedelics, including drugs like psilocybin (found in psilocybin mushrooms), dimethyltryptamine (DMT) (found in ayahuasca), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline (found in peyote cactus), and 5-MeO-DMT (found in Anadenanthera trees and the Bufo alvarius toad), are non-selective agonists of the serotonin receptors and mediate their hallucinogenic effects specifically by activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. This is evidenced by the fact that serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists and so-called ""trip killers"" like ketanserin block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics in humans, among many other findings. Some serotonergic psychedelics, like psilocin, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT, are substituted tryptamines and are very similar in chemical structure to serotonin. Serotonin itself, despite acting as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist, is thought to be non-hallucinogenic. The hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics appear to be mediated by activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors expressed in a population of cortical neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, unlike most serotonin and related receptors, are expressed intracellularly. In addition, the neurons containing them lack expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT), which normally transports serotonin from the extracellular space to the intracellular space within neurons. Serotonin itself is too hydrophilic to enter serotonergic neurons without the SERT, and hence these serotonin 5-HT2A receptors are inaccessible to serotonin. Conversely, serotonergic psychedelics are more lipophilic than serotonin and readily enter these neurons. In addition to explaining why serotonin does not show psychedelic effects, these findings may explain why drugs that increase serotonin levels, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and various other types of serotonergic agents, do not produce psychedelic effects. Artificial expression of the SERT in these medial prefrontal cortex neurons resulted in the serotonin releasing agent para-chloroamphetamine (PCA), which does not normally show psychedelic-like effects, being able to produce psychedelic-like effects in animals. Although serotonin itself is non-hallucinogenic, administration of very high doses of a serotonin precursor, like tryptophan or 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), or intracerebroventricular injection of high doses of serotonin directly into the brain, can produce psychedelic-like effects in animals. These psychedelic-like effects can be abolished by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) inhibitors, which block conversion of serotonin and other endogenous tryptamines into N-methylated tryptamines, including N-methylserotonin (NMS; norbufotenin), bufotenin (5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine; 5-HO-DMT), N-methyltryptamine (NMT), and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). These N-methyltryptamines are much more lipophilic than serotonin and, in contrast, are able to diffuse into serotonergic neurons and activate intracellular serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Another possible metabolite of serotonin with psychedelic-like effects in animals is 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT). DMT is a naturally occurring endogenous compound in the body. In relation to the fact that serotonin itself is unable to activate intracellular serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, it is possible that DMT might be the endogenous ligand of these receptors rather than serotonin. === Entactogens === The entactogen MDMA is a serotonin releasing agent and, while it also possesses other actions such as concomitant release of norepinephrine and dopamine and weak direct agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, its serotonin release plays a key role in its unique entactogenic effects. Entactogens like MDMA should be distinguished from other drugs such as stimulants like amphetamine and psychedelics like LSD, although MDMA itself also has some characteristics of both of these types of agents. Coadministration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which block the serotonin transporter (SERT) and prevent MDMA from inducing serotonin release, markedly reduce the subjective effects of MDMA, demonstrating the key role of serotonin in the effects of the drug. Serotonin releasing agents like MDMA achieve much greater increases in serotonin levels than SSRIs and have far more robust of subjective effects. Besides MDMA, many other entactogens also exist and are known. === Serotonin syndrome === Extremely high levels of serotonin or activation of certain serotonin receptors can cause a condition known as serotonin syndrome, with toxic and potentially fatal effects. In practice, such toxic levels are essentially impossible to reach through an overdose of a single antidepressant drug, but require a combination of serotonergic agents, such as an SSRI with a MAOI, which may occur in therapeutic doses. However, serotonin syndrome can occur with overdose of certain serotonin receptor agonists, like the NBOMe series of serotonergic psychedelics. The intensity of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome vary over a wide spectrum, and the milder forms are seen even at nontoxic levels. It is estimated that 14% of patients experiencing serotonin syndrome overdose on SSRIs; meanwhile the fatality rate is between 2% and 12%. === Cardiac fibrosis and other fibroses === Some serotonergic agonist drugs cause fibrosis anywhere in the body, particularly the syndrome of retroperitoneal fibrosis, as well as cardiac valve fibrosis. In the past, three groups of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive antimigraine drugs (ergotamine and methysergide), the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs (fenfluramine, chlorphentermine, and aminorex), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT2B receptors. These include pergolide and cabergoline, but not the more dopamine-specific lisuride. As with fenfluramine, some of these drugs have been withdrawn from the market after groups taking them showed a statistical increase of one or more of the side effects described. An example is pergolide. The drug was declining in use since it was reported in 2003 to be associated with cardiac fibrosis. Two independent studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January 2007 implicated pergolide, along with cabergoline, in causing valvular heart disease. As a result of this, the FDA removed pergolide from the United States market in March 2007. (Since cabergoline is not approved in the United States for Parkinson's Disease, but for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market. Treatment for hyperprolactinemia requires lower doses than that for Parkinson's Disease, diminishing the risk of valvular heart disease). == Comparative biology and evolution == === Unicellular organisms === Serotonin is used by a variety of single-cell organisms for various purposes. SSRIs have been found to be toxic to algae. The gastrointestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica secretes serotonin, causing a sustained secretory diarrhea in some people. Patients infected with E. histolytica have been found to have highly elevated serum serotonin levels, which returned to normal following resolution of the infection. E. histolytica also responds to the presence of serotonin by becoming more virulent. This means serotonin secretion not only serves to increase the spread of entamoebas by giving the host diarrhea but also serves to coordinate their behaviour according to their population density, a phenomenon known as quorum sensing. Outside the gut of a host, there is nothing that the entamoebas provoke to release serotonin, hence the serotonin concentration is very low. Low serotonin signals to the entamoebas they are outside a host and they become less virulent to conserve energy. When they enter a new host, they multiply in the gut, and become more virulent as the enterochromaffine cells get provoked by them and the serotonin concentration increases. === Edible plants and mushrooms === In drying seeds, serotonin production is a way to get rid of the buildup of poisonous ammonia. The ammonia is collected and placed in the indole part of L-tryptophan, which is then decarboxylated by tryptophan decarboxylase to give tryptamine, which is then hydroxylated by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, yielding serotonin. However, since serotonin is a major gastrointestinal tract modulator, it may be produced in the fruits of plants as a way of speeding the passage of seeds through the digestive tract, in the same way as many well-known seed and fruit associated laxatives. Serotonin is found in mushrooms, fruits, and vegetables. The highest values of 25–400 mg/kg have been found in nuts of the walnut (Juglans) and hickory (Carya) genera. Serotonin concentrations of 3–30 mg/kg have been found in plantains, pineapples, banana, kiwifruit, plums, and tomatoes. Moderate levels from 0.1–3 mg/kg have been found in a wide range of tested vegetables. Serotonin is one compound of the poison contained in stinging nettles (Urtica dioica), where it causes pain on injection in the same manner as its presence in insect venoms. It is also naturally found in Paramuricea clavata, or the Red Sea Fan. Serotonin and tryptophan have been found in chocolate with varying cocoa contents. The highest serotonin content (2.93 μg/g) was found in chocolate with 85% cocoa, and the highest tryptophan content (13.27–13.34 μg/g) was found in 70–85% cocoa. The intermediate in the synthesis from tryptophan to serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptophan, was not found. Root development in Arabidopsis thaliana is stimulated and modulated by serotonin – in various ways at various concentrations. Serotonin serves as a plant defense chemical against fungi. When infected with Fusarium crown rot (Fusarium pseudograminearum), wheat (Triticum aestivum) greatly increases its production of tryptophan to synthesize new serotonin. The function of this is poorly understood but wheat also produces serotonin when infected by Stagonospora nodorum – in that case to retard spore production. The model cereal Brachypodium distachyon – used as a research substitute for wheat and other production cereals – also produces serotonin, coumaroyl-serotonin, and feruloyl-serotonin in response to F. graminearum. This produces a slight antimicrobial effect. B. distachyon produces more serotonin (and conjugates) in response to deoxynivalenol (DON)-producing F. graminearum than non-DON-producing. Solanum lycopersicum produces many AA conjugates – including several of serotonin – in its leaves, stems, and roots in response to Ralstonia solanacearum infection. Serotonin occurs in several hallucinogenic mushrooms of the genus Panaeolus. === Invertebrates === Serotonin functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous systems of most animals. ==== Nematodes ==== For example, in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, which feeds on bacteria, serotonin is released as a signal in response to positive events, such as finding a new source of food or in male animals finding a female with which to mate. When a well-fed worm feels bacteria on its cuticle, dopamine is released, which slows it down; if it is starved, serotonin also is released, which slows the animal down further. This mechanism increases the amount of time animals spend in the presence of food. The released serotonin activates the muscles used for feeding, while octopamine suppresses them. Serotonin diffuses to serotonin-sensitive neurons, which control the animal's perception of nutrient availability. ==== Decapods ==== If lobsters are injected with serotonin, they behave like dominant individuals whereas octopamine causes subordinate behavior. A crayfish that is frightened may flip its tail to flee, and the effect of serotonin on this behavior depends largely on the animal's social status. Serotonin inhibits the fleeing reaction in subordinates, but enhances it in socially dominant or isolated individuals. The reason for this is social experience alters the proportion between serotonin receptors (5-HT receptors) that have opposing effects on the fight-or-flight response. The effect of 5-HT1 receptors predominates in subordinate animals, while 5-HT2 receptors predominates in dominants. ==== In venoms ==== Serotonin is a common component of invertebrate venoms, salivary glands, nervous tissues, and various other tissues, across molluscs, insects, crustaceans, scorpions, various kinds of worms, and jellyfish. Adult Rhodnius prolixus – hematophagous on vertebrates – secrete lipocalins into the wound during feeding. In 2003 these lipocalins were demonstrated to sequester serotonin to prevent vasoconstriction (and possibly coagulation) in the host. ==== Insects ==== Serotonin is evolutionarily conserved and appears across the animal kingdom. It is seen in insect processes in roles similar to in the human central nervous system, such as memory, appetite, sleep, and behavior. Some circuits in mushroom bodies are serotonergic. (See specific Drosophila example below, §Dipterans.) ===== Acrididae ===== Locust swarming is initiated but not maintained by serotonin, with release being triggered by tactile contact between individuals. This transforms social preference from aversion to a gregarious state that enables coherent groups. Learning in flies and honeybees is affected by the presence of serotonin. ===== Role in insecticides ===== Insect 5-HT receptors have similar sequences to the vertebrate versions, but pharmacological differences have been seen. Invertebrate drug response has been far less characterized than mammalian pharmacology and the potential for species selective insecticides has been discussed. ===== Hymenopterans ===== Wasps and hornets have serotonin in their venom, which causes pain and inflammation as do scorpions. Pheidole dentata takes on more and more tasks in the colony as it gets older, which requires it to respond to more and more olfactory cues in the course of performing them. This olfactory response broadening was demonstrated to go along with increased serotonin and dopamine, but not octopamine in 2006. ===== Dipterans ===== If flies are fed serotonin, they are more aggressive; flies depleted of serotonin still exhibit aggression, but they do so much less frequently. In their crops it plays a vital role in digestive motility produced by contraction. Serotonin that acts on the crop is exogenous to the crop itself and 2012 research suggested that it probably originated in the serotonin neural plexus in the thoracic-abdominal synganglion. In 2011 a Drosophila serotonergic mushroom body was found to work in concert with Amnesiac to form memories. In 2007 serotonin was found to promote aggression in Diptera, which was counteracted by neuropeptide F – a surprising find given that they both promote courtship, which is usually similar to aggression in most respects. === Vertebrates === Serotonin, also referred to as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter most known for its involvement in mood disorders in humans. It is also a widely present neuromodulator among vertebrates and invertebrates. Serotonin has been found having associations with many physiological systems such as cardiovascular, thermoregulation, and behavioral functions, including: circadian rhythm, appetite, aggressive and sexual behavior, sensorimotor reactivity and learning, and pain sensitivity. Serotonin's function in neurological systems along with specific behaviors among vertebrates found to be strongly associated with serotonin will be further discussed. Two relevant case studies are also mentioned regarding serotonin development involving teleost fish and mice. In mammals, 5-HT is highly concentrated in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and raphe nuclei. Lesser concentrated areas include other brain regions and the spinal cord. 5-HT neurons are also shown to be highly branched, indicating that they are structurally prominent for influencing multiple areas of the CNS at the same time, although this trend is exclusive solely to mammals. ==== 5-HT system in vertebrates ==== Vertebrates are multicellular organisms in the phylum Chordata that possess a backbone and a nervous system. This includes mammals, fish, reptiles, birds, etc. In humans, the nervous system is composed of the central and peripheral nervous system, with little known about the specific mechanisms of neurotransmitters in most other vertebrates. However, it is known that while serotonin is involved in stress and behavioral responses, it is also important in cognitive functions. Brain organization in most vertebrates includes 5-HT cells in the hindbrain. In addition to this, 5-HT is often found in other sections of the brain in non-placental vertebrates, including the basal forebrain and pretectum. Since location of serotonin receptors contribute to behavioral responses, this suggests serotonin is part of specific pathways in non-placental vertebrates that are not present in amniotic organisms. Teleost fish and mice are organisms most often used to study the connection between serotonin and vertebrate behavior. Both organisms show similarities in the effect of serotonin on behavior, but differ in the mechanism in which the responses occur. ===== Dogs / canine species ===== There are few studies of serotonin in dogs. One study reported serotonin values were higher at dawn than at dusk. In another study, serum 5-HT levels did not seem to be associated with dogs' behavioural response to a stressful situation. Urinary serotonin/creatinine ratio in bitches tended to be higher 4 weeks after surgery. In addition, serotonin was positively correlated with both cortisol and progesterone but not with testosterone after ovariohysterectomy. ===== Teleost fish ===== Like non-placental vertebrates, teleost fish also possess 5-HT cells in other sections of the brain, including the basal forebrain. Danio rerio (zebra fish) are a species of teleost fish often used for studying serotonin within the brain. Despite much being unknown about serotonergic systems in vertebrates, the importance in moderating stress and social interaction is known. It is hypothesized that AVT and CRF cooperate with serotonin in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis. These neuropeptides influence the plasticity of the teleost, affecting its ability to change and respond to its environment. Subordinate fish in social settings show a drastic increase in 5-HT concentrations. High levels of 5-HT long term influence the inhibition of aggression in subordinate fish. ===== Mice ===== Researchers at the Department of Pharmacology and Medical Chemistry used serotonergic drugs on male mice to study the effects of selected drugs on their behavior. Mice in isolation exhibit increased levels of agonistic behavior towards one another. Results found that serotonergic drugs reduce aggression in isolated mice while simultaneously increasing social interaction. Each of the treatments use a different mechanism for targeting aggression, but ultimately all have the same outcome. While the study shows that serotonergic drugs successfully target serotonin receptors, it does not show specifics of the mechanisms that affect behavior, as all types of drugs tended to reduce aggression in isolated male mice. Aggressive mice kept out of isolation may respond differently to changes in serotonin reuptake. ==== Behavior ==== Like in humans, serotonin is extremely involved in regulating behavior in most other vertebrates. This includes not only response and social behaviors, but also influencing mood. Defects in serotonin pathways can lead to intense variations in mood, as well as symptoms of mood disorders, which can be present in more than just humans. ===== Social interaction ===== One of the most researched aspects of social interaction in which serotonin is involved is aggression. Aggression is regulated by the 5-HT system, as serotonin levels can both induce or inhibit aggressive behaviors, as seen in mice (see section on Mice) and crabs. While this is widely accepted, it is unknown if serotonin interacts directly or indirectly with parts of the brain influencing aggression and other behaviors. Studies of serotonin levels show that they drastically increase and decrease during social interactions, and they generally correlate with inhibiting or inciting aggressive behavior. The exact mechanism of serotonin influencing social behaviors is unknown, as pathways in the 5-HT system in various vertebrates can differ greatly. ===== Response to stimuli ===== Serotonin is important in environmental response pathways, along with other neurotransmitters. Specifically, it has been found to be involved in auditory processing in social settings, as primary sensory systems are connected to social interactions. Serotonin is found in the IC structure of the midbrain, which processes specie specific and non-specific social interactions and vocalizations. It also receives acoustic projections that convey signals to auditory processing regions. Research has proposed that serotonin shapes the auditory information being received by the IC and therefore is influential in the responses to auditory stimuli. This can influence how an organism responds to the sounds of predatory or other impactful species in their environment, as serotonin uptake can influence aggression or social interaction. ===== Mood ===== We can describe mood not as specific to an emotional status, but as associated with a relatively long-lasting emotional state. Serotonin's association with mood is most known for various forms of depression and bipolar disorders in humans. Disorders caused by serotonergic activity potentially contribute to the many symptoms of major depression, such as overall mood, activity, suicidal thoughts and sexual and cognitive dysfunction. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) are a class of drugs demonstrated to be an effective treatment in major depressive disorder and are the most prescribed class of antidepressants. SSRI's function is to block the reuptake of serotonin, making more serotonin available to absorb by the receiving neuron. Animals have been studied for decades in order to understand depressive behavior among species. One of the most familiar studies, the forced swimming test (FST), was performed to measure potential antidepressant activity. Rats were placed in an inescapable container of water, at which point time spent immobile and number of active behaviors (such as splashing or climbing) were compared before and after a panel of anti-depressant drugs were administered. Antidepressants that selectively inhibit NE reuptake were shown to reduce immobility and selectively increase climbing without affecting swimming. However, results of the SSRI's also show reduced immobility but increased swimming without affecting climbing. This study demonstrated the importance of behavioral tests for antidepressants, as they can detect drugs with an effect on core behavior along with behavioral components of species. === Growth and reproduction === In the nematode C. elegans, artificial depletion of serotonin or the increase of octopamine cues behavior typical of a low-food environment: C. elegans becomes more active, and mating and egg-laying are suppressed, while the opposite occurs if serotonin is increased or octopamine is decreased in this animal. Serotonin is necessary for normal nematode male mating behavior, and the inclination to leave food to search for a mate. The serotonergic signaling used to adapt the worm's behaviour to fast changes in the environment affects insulin-like signaling and the TGF beta signaling pathway, which control long-term adaption. In the fruit fly insulin both regulates blood sugar as well as acting as a growth factor. Thus, in the fruit fly, serotonergic neurons regulate the adult body size by affecting insulin secretion. Serotonin has also been identified as the trigger for swarm behavior in locusts. In humans, though insulin regulates blood sugar and IGF regulates growth, serotonin controls the release of both hormones, modulating insulin release from the beta cells in the pancreas through serotonylation of GTPase signaling proteins. Exposure to SSRIs during pregnancy reduces fetal growth. Genetically altered C. elegans worms that lack serotonin have an increased reproductive lifespan, may become obese, and sometimes present with arrested development at a dormant larval state. === Aging and age-related phenotypes === Serotonin is known to regulate aging, learning, and memory. The first evidence comes from the study of longevity in C. elegans. During early phase of aging, the level of serotonin increases, which alters locomotory behaviors and associative memory. The effect is restored by mutations and drugs (including mianserin and methiothepin) that inhibit serotonin receptors. The observation does not contradict with the notion that the serotonin level goes down in mammals and humans, which is typically seen in late but not early phase of aging. == Biochemical mechanisms == === Biosynthesis === In animals and humans, serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid L-tryptophan by a short metabolic pathway consisting of two enzymes, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC), and the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate. The TPH-mediated reaction is the rate-limiting step in the pathway. TPH has been shown to exist in two forms: TPH1, found in several tissues, and TPH2, which is a neuron-specific isoform. Serotonin can be synthesized from tryptophan in the lab using Aspergillus niger and Psilocybe coprophila as catalysts. The first phase to 5-hydroxytryptophan would require letting tryptophan sit in ethanol and water for 7 days, then mixing in enough HCl (or other acid) to bring the pH to 3, and then adding NaOH to make a pH of 13 for 1 hour. Aspergillus niger would be the catalyst for this first phase. The second phase to synthesizing tryptophan itself from the 5-hydroxytryptophan intermediate would require adding ethanol and water, and letting sit for 30 days this time. The next two steps would be the same as the first phase: adding HCl to make the pH = 3, and then adding NaOH to make the pH very basic at 13 for 1 hour. This phase uses the Psilocybe coprophila as the catalyst for the reaction. Serotonin taken orally does not pass into the serotonergic pathways of the central nervous system, because it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. However, tryptophan and its metabolite 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), from which serotonin is synthesized, do cross the blood–brain barrier. These agents are available as dietary supplements and in various foods, and may be effective serotonergic agents. One product of serotonin breakdown is 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is excreted in the urine. Serotonin and 5-HIAA are sometimes produced in excess amounts by certain tumors or cancers, and levels of these substances may be measured in the urine to test for these tumors. == Analytical chemistry == Indium tin oxide is recommended for the electrode material in electrochemical investigation of concentrations produced, detected, or consumed by microbes. A mass spectrometry technique was developed in 1994 to measure the molecular weight of both natural and synthetic serotonins. == History and etymology == It had been known to physiologists for over a century that a vasoconstrictor material appears in serum when blood was allowed to clot. In 1935, Italian Vittorio Erspamer, working in Pavia, showed an extract from enterochromaffin cells made intestines contract. Some believed it contained adrenaline, but two years later, Erspamer was able to show it was a previously unknown amine, which he named ""enteramine"". In 1948, Maurice M. Rapport, Arda Green, and Irvine Page of the Cleveland Clinic discovered a vasoconstrictor substance in blood serum, and since it was a serum agent affecting vascular tone, they named it serotonin. In 1952, enteramine was shown to be the same substance as serotonin, and as the broad range of physiological roles was elucidated, the abbreviation 5-HT of the proper chemical name 5-hydroxytryptamine became the preferred name in the pharmacological field. Synonyms of serotonin include: 5-hydroxytriptamine, enteramine, substance DS, and 3-(β-aminoethyl)-5-hydroxyindole. In 1953, Betty Twarog and Page discovered serotonin in the central nervous system. Page regarded Erspamer's work on Octopus vulgaris, Discoglossus pictus, Hexaplex trunculus, Bolinus brandaris, Sepia, Mytilus, and Ostrea as valid and fundamental to understanding this newly identified substance, but regarded his earlier results in various models – especially those from rat blood – to be too confounded by the presence of other bioactive chemicals, including some other vasoactives. == Notes == == References == == Further reading == == External links == 5-Hydroxytryptamine MS Spectrum Serotonin bound to proteins in the PDB PsychoTropicalResearch Extensive reviews on serotonergic drugs and Serotonin Syndrome.

2956,"('Œ≤-lapachone', 'Beta-lapachone', 'Lapachone', '.beta.-lapachone', 'Lapachone, beta-')",Medical," β-Lapachone is a natural product that can promote ROS generation and ultimately triggers tumor cells death by inducing DNA damage. Recent studies have indicated that the targeting of ferroptosis or iron metabolism is a feasible strategy for treating cancer. In this study, bulk RNA-seq analysis suggested that β-Lapachone might induce ferroptosis in CRC cells. We further tested this hypothesis using a xenograft model of human colorectal cancer as an animal model and in SW620 and DLD-1 of CRC cell lines. Western blot was used to determine the key proteins of ferroptosis (SLC7A11, GPX4), autophagy (LC3B, P62, ATG7), ferritinophagy (NCOA4, FTH1, TFRC), and JNK pathway (p-JNK, JNK, p-c-Jun, c-Jun). The levels of MDA, GSH/GSSG, lipid ROS, and intracellular ferrous iron were determined after β-Lapachone treatment, and inhibitors of various pathways, including NAC, Ferrostatin-1, DFO, 3-MA, and SP600125 were utilized to explore the molecular mechanism underlying β-Lapachone-mediated ferroptosis. As the result, we identified that β-Lapachone inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, autophagy, and ROS generation. In addition, β-Lapachone induced ferroptosis as demonstrated by intra-cellular iron overload, increased levels of lipid ROS and MDA. Mechanistically, JNK signaling pathway was involved in β-Lapachone-induced xCT/GPX4-mediated ferroptosis and NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in CRC cells. In vivo experiments in nude mice demonstrated that β-Lapachone significantly inhibited CRC growth and induced ferroptosis and NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy. These findings not only identify a novel role for β-Lapachone in ferroptosis but also indicate that β-Lapachone may be a valuable candidate for the research and development of anti-cancer therapeutic agents. Nanotechnology shows the power to improve efficacy and reduce the adverse effects of anticancer agents. As a quinone-containing compound, beta-lapachone (LAP) is widely employed for targeted anticancer therapy under hypoxia. The principal mechanism of LAP-mediated cytotoxicity is believed due to the continuous generation of reactive oxygen species with the aid of NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). The cancer selectivity of LAP relies on the difference between NQO1 expression in tumors and that in healthy organs. Despite this, the clinical translation of LAP faces the problem of narrow therapeutic window that is challenging for dose regimen design. Herein, the multifaceted anticancer mechanism of LAP is briefly introduced, the advance of nanocarriers for LAP delivery is reviewed, and the combinational delivery approaches to enhance LAP potency in recent years are summarized. The mechanisms by which nanosystems boost LAP efficacy, including tumor targeting, cellular uptake enhancement, controlled cargo release, enhanced Fenton or Fenton-like reaction, and multidrug synergism, are also presented. The problems of LAP anticancer nanomedicines and the prospective solutions are discussed. The current review may help to unlock the potential of cancer-specific LAP therapy and speed up its clinical translation.",Beta-lapachone,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02324780821800232), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.10116635262966156), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31331098079681396)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.023400263860821724)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33667813/,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1509568/full,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5421748/,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.747282/full,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16822200/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7641181/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10975997/ ', [])"

However, MK intervention trials with vascular endpoints are lacking. We investigated long-term effects of MK-7 (180 µg MenaQ7/day) supplementation on arterial stiffness in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Healthy postmenopausal women (n=244) received either placebo (n=124) or MK-7 (n=120) for three years. Indices of local carotid stiffness (intima-media thickness IMT, Diameter end-diastole and Distension) were measured by echotracking. Regional aortic stiffness (carotid-femoral and carotid-radial Pulse Wave Velocity, cfPWV and crPWV, respectively) was measured using mechanotransducers. Circulating desphospho-uncarboxylated matrix Gla-protein (dp-ucMGP) as well as acute phase markers Interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and markers for endothelial dysfunction Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule (VCAM), E-selectin, and Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) were measured. At baseline dp-ucMGP was associated with IMT, Diameter, cfPWV and with the mean z-scores of acute phase markers (APMscore) and of markers for endothelial dysfunction (EDFscore). After three year MK-7 supplementation cfPWV and the Stiffness Index βsignificantly decreased in the total group, whereas distension, compliance, distensibility, Young's Modulus, and the local carotid PWV (cPWV) improved in women having a baseline Stiffness Index β above the median of 10.8. MK-7 decreased dp-ucMGP by 50 % compared to placebo, but did not influence the markers for acute phase and endothelial dysfunction. In conclusion, long-term use of MK-7 supplements improves arterial stiffness in healthy postmenopausal women, especially in women having a high arterial stiffness. We have investigated whether low-dose vitamin K2 supplements (menaquinone-7, MK-7) could beneficially affect bone health. Next to an improved vitamin K status, MK-7 supplementation significantly decreased the age-related decline in bone mineral density and bone strength. Low-dose MK-7 supplements may therefore help postmenopausal women prevent bone loss. Despite contradictory data on vitamin K supplementation and bone health, the European Food Safety Authorities (EFSA) accepted the health claim on vitamin K's role in maintenance of normal bone. In line with EFSA's opinion, we showed that 3-year high-dose vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and K2 (short-chain menaquinone-4) supplementation improved bone health after menopause. Because of the longer half-life and greater potency of the long-chain MK-7, we have extended these investigations by measuring the effect of low-dose MK-7 supplementation on bone health. Healthy postmenopausal women (n = 244) received for 3 years placebo or MK-7 (180 μg MK-7/day) capsules. Bone mineral density of lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck was measured by DXA; bone strength indices of the femoral neck were calculated. Vertebral fracture assessment was performed by DXA and used as measure for vertebral fractures. Circulating uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) and carboxylated OC (cOC) were measured; the ucOC/cOC ratio served as marker of vitamin K status. Measurements occurred at baseline and after 1, 2, and 3 years of treatment. MK-7 intake significantly improved vitamin K status and decreased the age-related decline in BMC and BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, but not at the total hip. Bone strength was also favorably affected by MK-7. MK-7 significantly decreased the loss in vertebral height of the lower thoracic region at the mid-site of the vertebrae. MK-7 supplements may help postmenopausal women to prevent bone loss. Whether these results can be extrapolated to other populations, e.g., children and men, needs further investigation.

2964,"('Imidazole', 'Glyoxaline', 'Imidazol', 'Iminazole', 'Miazole')","Endogenous, Medical","Imidazole (ImH) is an organic compound with the formula (CH)3(NH)N. It is a white or colourless solid that is soluble in water, producing a mildly alkaline solution. It can be classified as a heterocycle, specifically as a diazole. Many natural products, especially alkaloids, contain the imidazole ring. These imidazoles share the 1,3-C3N2 ring but feature varied substituents. This ring system is present in important biological building blocks, such as histidine and the related hormone histamine. Many drugs contain an imidazole ring, such as certain antifungal drugs, the nitroimidazole series of antibiotics, and the sedative midazolam. When fused to a pyrimidine ring, it forms a purine, which is the most widely occurring nitrogen-containing heterocycle in nature. The name ""imidazole"" was coined in 1887 by the German chemist Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch (1857–1935). == Structure and properties == Imidazole is a planar 5-membered ring, that exists in two equivalent tautomeric forms because hydrogen can be bound to one or another nitrogen atom. Imidazole is a highly polar compound, as evidenced by its electric dipole moment of 3.67 D, and is highly soluble in water. The compound is classified as aromatic due to the presence of a planar ring containing 6 π-electrons (a pair of electrons from the protonated nitrogen atom and one from each of the remaining four atoms of the ring). Some resonance structures of imidazole are shown below: === Amphoterism === Imidazole is amphoteric, which is to say that it can function both as an acid and as a base. As an acid, the pKa of imidazole is 14.5, making it less acidic than carboxylic acids, phenols, and imides, but slightly more acidic than alcohols. The acidic proton is the one bound to nitrogen. Deprotonation gives the imidazolide anion, which is symmetrical. As a base, the pKa of the conjugate acid (cited as pKBH+ to avoid confusion between the two) is approximately 7, making imidazole approximately sixty times more basic than pyridine. The basic site is the nitrogen with the lone pair (and not bound to hydrogen). Protonation gives the imidazolium cation, which is symmetrical. == Preparation == Imidazole was first reported in 1858 by the German chemist Heinrich Debus, although various imidazole derivatives had been discovered as early as the 1840s. It was shown that glyoxal, formaldehyde, and ammonia condense to form imidazole (glyoxaline, as it was originally named). This synthesis, while producing relatively low yields, is still used for generating C-substituted imidazoles. In one microwave modification, the reactants are benzil, benzaldehyde and ammonia in glacial acetic acid, forming 2,4,5-triphenylimidazole (""lophine""). Imidazole can be synthesized by numerous methods besides the Debus method. Many of these syntheses can also be applied to different substituted imidazoles and imidazole derivatives by varying the functional groups on the reactants. These methods are commonly categorized by which and how many bonds form to make the imidazole rings. For example, the Debus method forms the (1,2), (3,4), and (1,5) bonds in imidazole, using each reactant as a fragment of the ring, and thus this method would be a three-bond-forming synthesis. A small sampling of these methods is presented below. === Formation of one bond === The (1,5) or (3,4) bond can be formed by the reaction of an imidate and an α-aminoaldehyde or α-aminoacetal. The example below applies to imidazole when R1 = R2 = hydrogen. === Formation of two bonds === The (1,2) and (2,3) bonds can be formed by treating a 1,2-diaminoalkane, at high temperatures, with an alcohol, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. A dehydrogenating catalyst, such as platinum on alumina, is required. The (1,2) and (3,4) bonds can also be formed from N-substituted α-aminoketones and formamide with heat. The product will be a 1,4-disubstituted imidazole, but here since R1 = R2 = hydrogen, imidazole itself is the product. The yield of this reaction is moderate, but it seems to be the most effective method of making the 1,4 substitution. === Formation of four bonds === This is a general method that is able to give good yields for substituted imidazoles. In essence, it is an adaptation of the Debus method called the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis. The starting materials are substituted glyoxal, aldehyde, amine, and ammonia or an ammonium salt. === Formation from other heterocycles === Imidazole can be synthesized by the photolysis of 1-vinyltetrazole. This reaction will give substantial yields only if the 1-vinyltetrazole is made efficiently from an organotin compound, such as 2-tributylstannyltetrazole. The reaction, shown below, produces imidazole when R1 = R2 = R3 = hydrogen. Imidazole can also be formed in a vapor-phase reaction. The reaction occurs with formamide, ethylenediamine, and hydrogen over platinum on alumina, and it must take place between 340 and 480 °C. This forms a very pure imidazole product. The Van Leusen reaction can also be employed to form imidazoles starting from TosMIC and an aldimine. The Van Leusen Imidazole Synthesis allows the preparation of imidazoles from aldimines by reaction with tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC). The reaction has later been expanded to a two-step synthesis in which the aldimine is generated in situ: the Van Leusen Three-Component Reaction (vL-3CR). == Biological significance and applications == Imidazole is incorporated into many important biological compounds. The most pervasive is the amino acid histidine, which has an imidazole side-chain. Histidine is present in many proteins and enzymes, e.g. by binding metal cofactors, as seen in hemoglobin. Imidazole-based histidine compounds play an important role in intracellular buffering. Histidine can be decarboxylated to histamine. Histamine can cause urticaria (hives) when it is produced during allergic reaction. === Pharmaceutical derivatives === Imidazole substituents are found in many pharmaceuticals such as anticancer drug mercaptopurine. The imidazole group is present in many fungicides and antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antihypertensive medications. Imidazole is part of the theophylline molecule, found in tea leaves and coffee beans, that stimulates the central nervous system. A number of substituted imidazoles, including clotrimazole, are selective inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase. Other biological activities of the imidazole pharmacophore relate to the downregulation of intracellular Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, and interference with translation initiation. The substituted imidazole derivatives are valuable in treatment of many systemic fungal infections. Imidazoles belong to the class of azole antifungals, which includes ketoconazole, miconazole, and clotrimazole. For comparison, another group of azoles is the triazoles, which includes fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. The difference between the imidazoles and the triazoles involves the mechanism of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. The N3 of the imidazole compound binds to the heme iron atom of ferric cytochrome P450, whereas the N4 of the triazoles bind to the heme group. The triazoles have been shown to have a higher specificity for the cytochrome P450 than imidazoles, thereby making them more potent than the imidazoles. Some imidazole derivatives show effects on insects, for example sulconazole nitrate exhibits a strong anti-feeding effect on the keratin-digesting Australian carpet beetle larvae Anthrenocerus australis, as does econazole nitrate with the common clothes moth Tineola bisselliella. == Industrial applications == Imidazole itself has few direct applications. It is instead a precursor to a variety of agrichemicals, including enilconazole, climbazole, clotrimazole, prochloraz, and bifonazole. == Depolymerizing PET via Imidazolysis == Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used plastic found in clothing, food packaging, beverage bottles, and thermoplastic resins. The massive accumulation of PET waste, mostly from single-use beverage bottles and food packaging, creates serious environmental problems. As a type of polyester, PET can be broken down through a process called depolymerization which involves breaking its molecular chains using chemical methods. A method of depolymerization called ""imidazolysis,"" uses imidazole and similar compounds to break down PET. When PET reacts with an excess of imidazole, it produces 1,1′-terephthaloylbisimidazole (TBI). TBI can be further processed into smaller products, including amides, benzimidazoles, and esters, or even reused to create new polymers. TBI is a flexible intermediate compound, meaning it can be stored and later transformed into specific products as needed. This may allow manufacturers to delay deciding on the final products until after the depolymerization process, providing flexibility to meet different industrial demands. Imidazolysis can also be used to break down other polyesters and polyurethanes, making it a versatile approach for recycling plastics. == Coordination chemistry == Imidazole and its derivatives have high affinity for metal cations. One of the applications of imidazole is in the purification of His-tagged proteins in immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Imidazole is used to elute tagged proteins bound to nickel ions attached to the surface of beads in the chromatography column. An excess of imidazole is passed through the column, which displaces the His-tag from nickel coordination, freeing the His-tagged proteins. == Use in biological research == Imidazole is a suitable buffer for pH 6.2 to 7.8,. Pure imidazole has essentially no absorbance at protein relevant wavelengths (280 nm), however lower purities of imidazole can give notable absorbance at 280 nm. Imidazole can interfere with the Lowry protein assay. Imidazole is often used in protein purification, where recombinant proteins with polyhistidine tags are immobilized onto nickel resins and eluted with a high imidazole concentration. == Salts of imidazole == Salts of imidazole where the imidazole ring is the cation are known as imidazolium salts (for example, imidazolium chloride or nitrate). These salts are formed from the protonation or substitution at nitrogen of imidazole. These salts have been used as ionic liquids and precursors to stable carbenes. Salts where a deprotonated imidazole is an anion are also well known; these salts are known as imidazolates (for example, sodium imidazolate, NaC3H3N2). == Related heterocycles == Benzimidazole, an analog with a fused benzene ring Dihydroimidazole or imidazoline, an analog where the 4,5-double bond is saturated Pyrrole, an analog with only one nitrogen atom in position 1 Oxazole, an analog with the nitrogen atom in position 1 replaced by oxygen Thiazole, an analog with the nitrogen atom in position 1 replaced by sulfur Pyrazole, an analog with two adjacent nitrogen atoms Triazoles, analogs with three nitrogen atoms == Safety == Imidazole has low acute toxicity as indicated by the LD50 of 970 mg/kg (Rat, oral). == See also == 1-Methylimidazole 4-Methylimidazole Imidazoline (dihydroimidazole) == References ==",Imidazol,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('IND', -0.6296396851539612), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.20149365067481995), (' MED', -0.546154797077179), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.04875166714191437), (' FOOD', -0.5798789858818054), (',', -0.47498446702957153), (' END', -0.11463962495326996), ('OG', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ENO', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('IN', -0.7331814765930176), ('DU', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0011880489764735103), ('ĠMED', -0.0873597115278244), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.47434964776039124), ('ĠEND', -0.3407873809337616), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20166942477226257)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0004306692280806601)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL; https://www.britannica.com/science/imidazole-organic-compound-class,https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/imidazole,https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB6460617.htm ', [])"

Oxidation of these terpenoids was shown to occur via an induced enzyme system, as measured manometrically by oxygen uptake and prevention of protein synthesis with chloramphenicol or puromycin. Oxidation of terpin hydrate by cell suspensions appeared to be coincidentally induced by growth on alpha-terpineol, and oxidation of alpha-terpineol similarly appeared to be induced by growth on terpin hydrate. Culture fluids in which the TH-4 organism was grown at the expense of cis-terpin hydrate were found to contain (-)-alpha-terpineol in combined butanol-ether extracts.

2966,"('Methylene blue (trihydrate)', 'C.i. basic blue 9 trihydrate', 'Methylene blue', '[7-(dimethylamino)phenothiazin-3-ylidene]-dimethylazanium', 'N-[7-(dimethylamino)-3h-phenothiazin-3-ylidene]-n-methylmethanaminium')",Medical,"Methylthioninium chloride, commonly called methylene blue, is a salt used as a dye and as a medication. As a medication, it is mainly used to treat methemoglobinemia. It has previously been used for treating cyanide poisoning and urinary tract infections, but this use is no longer recommended. Methylene blue is typically given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, nausea, and vomiting. Methylene blue was first prepared in 1876, by Heinrich Caro. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Methemoglobinemia === Methylene blue is used to treat methemoglobinemia by chemically reducing the ferric iron in hemoglobin to ferrous iron. Methemoglobinemia can arise from ingestion of certain pharmaceuticals, toxins, or broad beans in those susceptible. Specifically, it is used to treat methemoglobin levels that are greater than 30% or in which there are symptoms despite oxygen therapy. Normally, through the NADH- or NADPH-dependent methemoglobin reductase enzymes, methemoglobin is reduced back to hemoglobin. When large amounts of methemoglobin occur secondary to toxins, methemoglobin reductases are overwhelmed. Methylene blue, when injected intravenously as an antidote, is itself first reduced to leucomethylene blue, which then reduces the heme group from methemoglobin to hemoglobin. Methylene blue can reduce the half life of methemoglobin from hours to minutes. At high doses, however, methylene blue actually induces methemoglobinemia, reversing this pathway. ==== Isobutyl nitrite toxicity ==== Isobutyl nitrite is one of the compounds used as poppers, an inhalant drug that induces a brief euphoria. Isobutyl nitrite is known to cause methemoglobinemia. Severe methemoglobinemia may be treated with methylene blue. === In a combination drug: Methylphen === === Cyanide poisoning === Since its reduction potential is similar to that of oxygen and can be reduced by components of the electron transport chain, large doses of methylene blue are sometimes used as an antidote to potassium cyanide poisoning, a method first successfully tested in 1933 by Matilda Moldenhauer Brooks in San Francisco, although first demonstrated by Bo Sahlin of Lund University, in 1926. === Shock === Methylene blue increases blood pressure in people with vasoplegic syndrome (redistributive shock), but does not improve delivery of oxygen to tissues or decrease mortality. Methylene blue has been used in calcium channel blocker toxicity as a possible rescue therapy for distributive shock unresponsive to first line agents. Limited to case reports, a 2024 review found low-quality evidence that methylene blue may reduce short-term mortality, duration of the need for vasopressors, and length of hospital stay. === Dye or stain === Methylene blue is used in endoscopic polypectomy as an adjunct to saline or epinephrine, and is used for injection into the submucosa around the polyp to be removed. This allows the submucosal tissue plane to be identified after the polyp is removed, which is useful in determining if more tissue needs to be removed, or if there has been a high risk for perforation. Methylene blue is also used as a dye in chromoendoscopy, and is sprayed onto the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract in order to identify dysplasia, or pre-cancerous lesions. Intravenously injected methylene blue is readily released into the urine and thus can be used to test the urinary tract for leaks or fistulas. In surgeries such as sentinel lymph node dissections, methylene blue can be used to visually trace the lymphatic drainage of tested tissues. Similarly, methylene blue is added to bone cement in orthopedic operations to provide easy discrimination between native bone and cement. Additionally, methylene blue accelerates the hardening of bone cement, increasing the speed at which bone cement can be effectively applied. Methylene blue is used as an aid to visualisation/orientation in a number of medical devices, including a surgical sealant film, TissuePatch. In fistulas and pilonidal sinuses, it is used to identify the tract for complete excision. It can also be used during gastrointestinal surgeries (such as bowel resection or gastric bypass) to test for leaks. It is sometimes used in cytopathology, in mixtures including Wright-Giemsa and Diff-Quik. It confers a blue color to both nuclei and cytoplasm, and makes the nuclei more visible. When methylene blue is ""polychromed"" (oxidized in solution or ""ripened"" by fungal metabolism, as originally noted in the thesis of Dr. D. L. Romanowsky in the 1890s), it gets serially demethylated and forms all the tri-, di-, mono- and non-methyl intermediates, which are Azure B, Azure A, Azure C, and thionine, respectively. This is the basis of the basophilic part of the spectrum of Romanowski-Giemsa effect. If only synthetic Azure B and Eosin Y is used, it may serve as a standardized Giemsa stain; but, without methylene blue, the normal neutrophilic granules tend to overstain and look like toxic granules. On the other hand, if methylene blue is used it might help to give the normal look of neutrophil granules and may also enhance the staining of nucleoli and polychromatophilic RBCs (reticulocytes). A traditional application of methylene blue is the intravital or supravital staining of nerve fibers, an effect first described by Paul Ehrlich in 1887. A dilute solution of the dye is either injected into tissue or applied to small freshly removed pieces. The selective blue coloration develops with exposure to air (oxygen) and can be fixed by immersion of the stained specimen in an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate. Vital methylene blue was formerly much used for examining the innervation of muscle, skin and internal organs. The mechanism of selective dye uptake is incompletely understood; vital staining of nerve fibers in skin is prevented by ouabain, a drug that inhibits the Na/K-ATPase of cell membranes. === Neurodegenerative disease === Methylene blue is highly lipophilic enabling it to readily cross the blood–brain barrier. Methylene blue becomes more highly concentrated in the brain than in the plasma and has a high affinity for mitochondria. Many studies have indicated beneficial effects on mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative disease, which are closely related. === Placebo === Methylene blue has been used as a placebo; physicians would tell their patients to expect their urine to change color and view this as a sign that their condition had improved. This same side effect makes methylene blue difficult to use in traditional placebo-controlled clinical studies, including those testing for its efficacy as a treatment. One approach is to use a low dose, just enough to turn urine blue, as the placebo group. However, a low dose does not guarantee inertness. == Side effects == Methylene blue is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and, if infused intravenously at doses exceeding 5 mg/kg, may result in serotonin syndrome if combined with any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other serotonergic drugs (e.g., duloxetine, sibutramine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, imipramine). It causes hemolytic anemia in carriers of the G6PD enzymatic deficiency (favism). The actual degree of this danger is a subject of controversy as the association was made based on very few cases. A 2018 meta-analysis on clinical trials against malaria in Africa, where the moderate A minus type of G6PD deficiency is prevalant, show no association between MB and hemolysis in such patients. There was, however, a clinically-insignificant reduction in hemoglobin. == Pregnancy == While use during pregnancy may harm the baby, not using it in methemoglobinemia is likely more dangerous. == Pharmacokinetics == After intravenous administration in humans, methylene blue shows a multiphasic change in concentration, with a terminal half-life of 5.25 hours. The initial disappearance from blood actually reflects its movement into organs, with brain, liver, and bile all showing significantly higher concentrations than blood in rats. The overall area under the curve in oral (dry gelatin capsule) administration is only 6.5% of the AUC for iv administration; judging from rat studies, the siginificantly altered organ distribution plays a key role in this difference. Administration as an oral solution (500 mg in 200 mL) greatly increases the bioavailbility to 72.3±23.9%. In this newer study, the terminal half-lives were reported as 18.5±11.8 hours for iv use and 18.3±7.2 for oral use. The tmax for oral use is 2.2 hours, compared to 0.5 hours for iv use. == Chemistry == Methylene blue is a formal derivative of phenothiazine. It is a dark green powder that yields a blue solution in water. The hydrated form has 3 molecules of water per unit of methylene blue. === Preparation === This compound is prepared by oxidation of 4-aminodimethylaniline in the presence of sodium thiosulfate to give the quinonediiminothiosulfonic acid, reaction with dimethylaniline, oxidation to the indamine, and cyclization to give the thiazine: A green electrochemical procedure, using only dimethyl-4-phenylenediamine and sulfide ions has been proposed. === Light absorption properties === The maximum absorption of light is near 670 nm. The specifics of absorption depend on a number of factors, including protonation, adsorption to other materials, and metachromasy - the formation of dimers and higher-order aggregates depending on concentration and other interactions: === Redox properties === Under reducing conditions, the blue-colored methylene blue cation (MB+) gains 1H+ and 2e− to become the electrically neutral and colorless leucomethylene blue (LMB). The redox midpoint potential E0' is +0.01 V. The redox properties can be seen in a classical demonstration of chemical kinetics in general chemistry, the ""blue bottle"" experiment. Typically, a solution is made of glucose (dextrose), methylene blue, and sodium hydroxide. Upon shaking the bottle, oxygen oxidizes methylene blue, and the solution turns blue. The dextrose will gradually reduce the methylene blue to its colorless, reduced form. Hence, when the dissolved dextrose is entirely consumed, the solution will turn blue again. In the mitochondrial electron transport chain reduced methylene blue (MBH2) directly reduces cytochrome c rather than to oxygen, limiting the formation of superoxide. Methylene blue has been shown to directly accept electrons from NADH, NADPH, and FADH2. == Other uses == === Redox indicator === Methylene blue is widely used as a redox indicator in analytical chemistry. Solutions of this substance are blue when in an oxidizing environment, but will turn colorless if exposed to a reducing agent. === Photosensitizer === Methylene blue is also a photosensitizer used to create singlet oxygen when exposed to both oxygen and light. It is used in this regard to make organic peroxides by a Diels-Alder reaction which is spin forbidden with normal atmospheric triplet oxygen. With the help of light, methylene blue can be used to kill some viruses and some bacteria. This kind of photo-disinfection has also been done inside of human bodies (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy). The same process can also be used to disinfect blood plasma. Methylene blue is theoretically also applicable to other forms of photodynamic therapy, i.e. the use of oxygen, light, and a photosentizer to kill cells. Research on using it to locally kill cancer cells is in a preclinical stage. === Sulfide analysis === The formation of methylene blue after the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and iron(III) at pH 0.4 – 0.7 is used to determine by photometric measurements sulfide concentration in the range 0.020 to 1.50 mg/L (20 ppb to 1.5 ppm). The test is very sensitive and the blue coloration developing upon contact of the reagents with dissolved H2S is stable for 60 min. Ready-to-use kits such as the Spectroquant sulfide test facilitate routine analyses. The methylene blue sulfide test is a convenient method often used in soil microbiology to quickly detect in water the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). In this colorimetric test, methylene blue is a product formed by the reaction and not a reagent added to the system. The addition of a strong reducing agent, such as ascorbic acid, to a sulfide-containing solution is sometimes used to prevent sulfide oxidation from atmospheric oxygen. Although it is certainly a sound precaution for the determination of sulfide with an ion selective electrode, it might however hamper the development of the blue color if the freshly formed methylene blue is also reduced, as described here above in the paragraph on redox indicator. === Test for milk freshness === Methylene blue is a dye behaving as a redox indicator that is commonly used in the food industry to test the freshness of milk and dairy products. A few drops of methylene blue solution added to a sample of milk should remain blue (oxidized form in the presence of enough dissolved O2), otherwise (discoloration caused by the reduction of methylene blue into its colorless reduced form) the dissolved O2 concentration in the milk sample is low indicating that the milk is not fresh (already abiotically oxidized by O2 whose concentration in solution decreases) or could be contaminated by bacteria also consuming the atmospheric O2 dissolved in the milk. In other words, aerobic conditions should prevail in fresh milk and methylene blue is simply used as an indicator of the dissolved oxygen remaining in the milk. === Water testing === The adsorption of methylene blue serves as an indicator defining the adsorptive capacity of granular activated carbon in water filters. Adsorption of methylene blue is very similar to adsorption of pesticides from water, this quality makes methylene blue serve as a good predictor for filtration qualities of carbon. It is as well a quick method of comparing different batches of activated carbon of the same quality. A color reaction in an acidified, aqueous methylene blue solution containing chloroform can detect anionic surfactants in a water sample. Such a test is known as an MBAS assay (methylene blue active substances assay). The MBAS assay cannot distinguish between specific surfactants, however. Some examples of anionic surfactants are carboxylates, phosphates, sulfates, and sulfonates. === Methylene blue value of fine aggregate === The methylene blue value is defined as the number of milliliter's standard methylene value solution decolorized 0.1 g of activated carbon (dry basis). Methylene blue value reflects the amount of clay minerals in aggregate samples. In materials science, methylene blue solution is successively added to fine aggregate which is being agitated in water. The presence of free dye solution can be checked with stain test on a filter paper. === Biological staining === In biology, methylene blue is used as a dye for a number of different staining procedures, such as Wright's stain and Jenner's stain. Since it is a temporary staining technique, methylene blue can also be used to examine RNA or DNA under the microscope or in a gel: as an example, a solution of methylene blue can be used to stain RNA on hybridization membranes in northern blotting to verify the amount of nucleic acid present. While methylene blue is not as sensitive as ethidium bromide, it is less toxic and it does not intercalate in nucleic acid chains, thus avoiding interference with nucleic acid retention on hybridization membranes or with the hybridization process itself. It can also be used as an indicator to determine whether eukaryotic cells such as yeast are alive or dead. The methylene blue is reduced in viable cells, leaving them unstained. However dead cells are unable to reduce the oxidized methylene blue and the cells are stained blue. Methylene blue can interfere with the respiration of the yeast as it picks up hydrogen ions made during the process. === Aquaculture === Methylene blue is used in aquaculture and by tropical fish hobbyists as a treatment for fungal infections. With the help of light it is also effective against bacteria and viruses. It can also be effective in treating fish infected with the parasitic protozoa Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (ich), although a combination of malachite green and formaldehyde is far more effective against it. Methylene blue also works against nitrite poisoning as it treats the resulting methemoglobinemia. Like in humans, it also treats cyanide poisoning. Non-professional sources also claim that it works for ammonia poisoning, but there is little medical literature to back this up. It is usually used to protect newly laid fish eggs from being infected by fungus. This is useful when the hobbyist wants to artificially hatch the fish eggs. For poisoning, injury (prevention of infection), or sickness, methylene blue is given as a ""medicated bath"" for the fish. Methylene blue is not without side effects to fish. == History == Methylene blue has been described as ""the first fully synthetic drug used in medicine"". Methylene blue was first prepared in 1876 by German chemist Heinrich Caro. Its use in the treatment of malaria was pioneered by Paul Guttmann and Paul Ehrlich in 1891. During this period before the first World War, researchers like Ehrlich believed that drugs and dyes worked in the same way, by preferentially staining pathogens and possibly harming them. Changing the cell membrane of pathogens is in fact how various drugs work, so the theory was partially correct, although far from complete. Methylene blue continued to be used in the second World War, where it was not well-liked by soldiers, who observed: ""Even at the loo, we see, we pee, navy blue."" It was discovered to be an antidote to carbon monoxide poisoning and cyanide poisoning in 1933 by Matilda Brooks. Methylene blue was the original prototype or lead compound for the design of many antimalarials including chloroquine, antihistamines, and antipsychotics including chlorpromazine. == Research == === Malaria === Antimalarial use of the drug has recently (2009) been revived. It simutaneously targets many biological processes in the apicomplexan pathogen though the main mechanism seems to be causing a lethal amount of redox cycling. A 2018 meta-analysis finds that it has proven effective against P. falciparum in Africa. It effectively reduces levels of the transmission-stage gametocyte and has synergy with the standard artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Its effects against other malarial species and P. falciparum populations in other locations are unclear. === Ifosfamide toxicity === Another use of methylene blue is to treat ifosfamide neurotoxicity. Methylene blue was first reported for treatment and prophylaxis of ifosfamide neuropsychiatric toxicity in 1994. A toxic metabolite of ifosfamide, chloroacetaldehyde (CAA), disrupts the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading to an accumulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH). Methylene blue acts as an alternative electron acceptor, and reverses the NADH inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis while also inhibiting the transformation of chloroethylamine into chloroacetaldehyde, and inhibits multiple amine oxidase activities, preventing the formation of CAA. The dosing of methylene blue for treatment of ifosfamide neurotoxicity varies, depending upon its use simultaneously as an adjuvant in ifosfamide infusion, versus its use to reverse psychiatric symptoms that manifest after completion of an ifosfamide infusion. Reports suggest that methylene blue up to six doses a day have resulted in improvement of symptoms within 10 minutes to several days. Alternatively, it has been suggested that intravenous methylene blue every six hours for prophylaxis during ifosfamide treatment in people with history of ifosfamide neuropsychiatric toxicity. Prophylactic administration of methylene blue the day before initiation of ifosfamide, and three times daily during ifosfamide chemotherapy has been recommended to lower the occurrence of ifosfamide neurotoxicity. === Neuropsychiatric disorders === Methylene blue inhibits monoamine oxidase, inhibits the glutamatergic system (via inhibition of NO synthase and soluble guanylate cyclase), modulates mitochondrial function (by acting as a electron acceptor), and decreases the activation of inflammasomes NLRP3 and NLRC4. As a result, it's been considered potentially useful in neuropsychiatric disorders. In humans it has been tried for (listed in decreasing order of evidence quality): bipolar disorder (especially depressive symptoms), Alzheimer's disease, claustrophobia, ifosfamide encephalopathy, and schizophrenia. With methylene blue, a higher dose does not necessarily work better than a lower dose. == Society and culture == In the late 2010s and early 2020s, a social media trend emerged promoting the use of methylene blue for various medical purposes, including anti-aging, metabolism enhancement, cognitive improvement, cancer treatment, and COVID-19 treatment. Currently there is no scientific consensus on, and no FDA approval for, its effectiveness and safety for these purposes. Medical experts cautioned that methylene blue can be toxic in high doses and may interact with other medications, potentially reducing their effectiveness or causing unforeseen side effects. Therefore, it should only be used under a doctor's prescription. This trend probably started following the publication of a few scientific papers exploring the potential of methylene blue for treating some medical conditions, such as progeria, and skin aging. It was also explored as part of anticancer photodynamic therapy using lasers. One systematic review of the studies expresses optimism but emphasizes the need for more extensive research to confirm methylene blue's clinical applications. Another review takes a more critical stance, stating that ""it is obvious that the clinical use of MB represents a rather controversial problem given the heterogeneity of available data and the lack of preclinical data, which is in conflict with standards of safe use of such substances in human medicinal practice"". In January 2025, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., then the U.S. health secretary nominee, was filmed adding droplets of an unidentified blue liquid to his drink during a flight. While many have speculated that it was methylene blue, Kennedy has not addressed the claims. == References == == External links == ""Methylene blue"". Drug Information Portal.

It is administered by intravenous injection. There is also an albumin-bound formulation. Common side effects include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, numbness, allergic reactions, muscle pains, and diarrhea. Other side effects include heart problems, increased risk of infection, and lung inflammation. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may cause birth defects. Paclitaxel is in the taxane family of medications. It works by interference with the normal function of microtubules during cell division. Paclitaxel was isolated in 1971 from the Pacific yew and approved for medical use in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It has been made from precursors, and through cell culture. == Medical use == Paclitaxel is approved in the UK for ovarian, breast, lung, bladder, prostate, melanoma, esophageal, and other types of solid tumor cancers as well as Kaposi's sarcoma. It is recommended in National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance of June 2001 for non-small-cell lung cancer in patients unsuitable for curative treatment, and in first-line and second-line treatment of ovarian cancer. In September 2001, NICE recommended paclitaxel for the treatment of advanced breast cancer after the failure of anthracyclic chemotherapy, but that its first-line use should be limited to clinical trials. In September 2006, NICE recommended paclitaxel should not be used in the adjuvant treatment of early node-positive breast cancer. It is approved in the United States for the treatment of breast, pancreatic, ovarian, Kaposi's sarcoma and non-small-cell lung cancers. === Similar compounds === Albumin-bound paclitaxel (brand name Abraxane, also called nab-paclitaxel) is an alternative formulation where paclitaxel is bound to albumin nanoparticles. Much of the clinical toxicity of paclitaxel is associated with the solvent Cremophor EL in which it is dissolved for delivery. Abraxis BioScience developed Abraxane, in which paclitaxel is bonded to albumin as an alternative delivery agent to the often toxic solvent delivery method. This was approved by the FDA in January 2005, for the treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. It has since been approved for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas as well. Taxanes, including paclitaxel, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, paclitaxel C, and 7-epipaclitaxel, have been found in the leaves and shells of hazel. The finding of these compounds in shells, which are considered discarded material and are mass-produced by many food industries, is of interest for the future availability of paclitaxel. === Restenosis === Paclitaxel is used as an antiproliferative agent for the prevention of restenosis (recurrent narrowing) of coronary and peripheral stents; locally delivered to the wall of the artery, a paclitaxel coating limits the growth of neointima (scar tissue) within stents. Paclitaxel drug-eluting stents for coronary artery placement are sold under the trade name Taxus by Boston Scientific in the United States. Paclitaxel drug-eluting stents for femoropopliteal artery placement are also available. == Side effects == Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, change in taste, thinned or brittle hair, pain in the joints of the arms or legs lasting two to three days, changes in the color of the nails, and tingling in the hands or toes. More serious side effects such as unusual bruising or bleeding, pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, hand-foot syndrome, change in normal bowel habits for more than two days, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, shortness of breath, severe exhaustion, skin rash, facial flushing, female infertility by ovarian damage, and chest pain can also occur. Neuropathy may also occur. Dexamethasone is given prior to paclitaxel infusion to mitigate some of the side effects. A number of these side effects are associated with the excipient used, Cremophor EL, a polyoxyethylated castor oil. Allergies to cyclosporine, teniposide, and other drugs delivered in polyoxyethylated castor oil may increase the risk of adverse reactions to paclitaxel. == Mechanism of action == Paclitaxel is one of several cytoskeletal drugs that target tubulin. Paclitaxel-treated cells have defects in mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cell division. Unlike other tubulin-targeting drugs, such as colchicine, that inhibit microtubule assembly, paclitaxel stabilizes the microtubule polymer and protects it from disassembly. Chromosomes are thus unable to achieve a metaphase spindle configuration. This blocks the progression of mitosis and prolonged activation of the mitotic checkpoint triggers apoptosis or reversion to the G0-phase of the cell cycle without cell division. The ability of paclitaxel to inhibit spindle function is generally attributed to its suppression of microtubule dynamics, but other studies have demonstrated that suppression of dynamics occurs at concentrations lower than those needed to block mitosis. At the higher therapeutic concentrations, paclitaxel appears to suppress microtubule detachment from centrosomes, a process normally activated during mitosis. Paclitaxel binds to the beta-tubulin subunits of microtubules. == Chemistry == The nomenclature for paclitaxel is structured on a tetracyclic 17-atom skeleton. There are a total of 11 stereocenters. The active stereoisomer is (−)-paclitaxel (shown here). == Production == === Bark processing === From 1967 to 1993, almost all paclitaxel produced was derived from bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, the harvesting of which kills the tree in the process. The processes used were descendants of the original isolation method of Monroe Wall and Mansukh Wani; by 1987, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) had contracted Hauser Chemical Research of Boulder, Colorado, to handle bark on the scale needed for phase II and III trials. While both the size of the wild population of the Pacific yew and the magnitude of the eventual demand for paclitaxel were uncertain, it was clear that an alternative, sustainable source of the natural product would be needed. Initial attempts to broaden its sourcing used needles from the tree, or material from other related Taxus species, including cultivated ones, but these attempts were challenged by the relatively low and often highly variable yields obtained. Early in the 1990s, coincident with increased sensitivity to the ecology of the forests of the Pacific Northwest, paclitaxel was extracted on a clinically useful scale from these sources. === Semisynthesis === Concurrently, synthetic chemists in the U.S. and France had been interested in paclitaxel, beginning in the late 1970s. As noted, by 1992 extensive efforts were underway to accomplish the total synthesis of paclitaxel, efforts motivated by the desire to generate new chemical understanding rather than to achieve practical commercial production. In contrast, the French group of Pierre Potier at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) addressed the matter of overall process yield, showing that it was feasible to isolate relatively large quantities of the compound 10-deacetylbaccatin from the European yew, Taxus baccata, which grew on the CNRS campus and whose needles were available in large quantity. By virtue of its structure, 10-deacetylbaccatin was seen as a viable starting material for a short semisynthesis to produce paclitaxel. By 1988, Poitier and collaborators had published a semisynthetic route from needles of the European yew to paclitaxel. The view of the NCI, however, was that even this route was not practical. The group of Robert A. Holton had also pursued a practical semisynthetic production route; by late 1989, Holton's group had developed a semisynthetic route to paclitaxel with twice the yield of the Potier process. The main innovation was ""Ojima−Holton coupling"", a ring-opening method independently discovered by Holton and Ojima. Florida State University, where Holton worked, signed a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) to license their semisynthesis and future patents. In 1992, Holton patented an improved process with an 80% yield, and BMS took the process in-house and started to manufacture paclitaxel in Ireland from 10-deacetylbaccatin isolated from the needles of the European yew. In early 1993, BMS announced that it would cease reliance on Pacific yew bark by the end of 1995, effectively terminating ecological controversy over its use. This announcement also made good their commitment to develop an alternative supply route, made to the NCI in their cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) application of 1989. As of 2013, BMS was using the semisynthetic method utilizing needles from the European yew to produce paclitaxel. Another company which worked with BMS until 2012, Phyton Biotech, Inc., uses plant cell fermentation (PCF) technology. By cultivating a specific Taxus cell line in fermentation tanks, they no longer need ongoing sourcing of material from actual yew tree plantations. Paclitaxel is then captured directly from the suspension broth by a resin allowing concentration to highly enriched powder containing about 40% paclitaxel. The compound is then purified by one chromatographic step followed by crystallization. Compared to the semisynthesis method, PCF eliminates the need for many hazardous chemicals and saves a considerable amount of energy. In 1993, paclitaxel was discovered as a natural product in Taxomyces andreanae, a newly described endophytic fungus living in the yew tree. It has since been reported in a number of other endophytic fungi, including Nodulisporium sylviforme, Alternaria taxi, Cladosporium cladosporioides MD2, Metarhizium anisopliae, Aspergillus candidus MD3, Mucor rouxianus, Chaetomella raphigera, Phyllosticta tabernaemontanae, Phomopsis, Pestalotiopsis pauciseta, Phyllosticta citricarpa, Podocarpus sp., Fusarium solani, Pestalotiopsis terminaliae, Pestalotiopsis breviseta, Botryodiplodia theobromae, Gliocladium sp., Alternaria alternata var. monosporus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Nigrospora sp. and Pestalotiopsis versicolor. However, there has been contradictory evidence for its production by endophytes, with other studies finding independent production is unlikely. === Biosynthesis === Taxol is a tetracyclic diterpene, and the biosynthesis of diterpenes starts with an FPP molecule being elongated by the addition of an IPP molecule in order to form geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). The biosynthesis of Taxol contains nineteen steps. These 19 steps can be considered in several steps, with the first step being the formation of the taxane skeleton, which then undergoes a series of oxygenations. Following the oxygenations, two acetylations and a benzoylation occur on the intermediate. The oxygenation of the taxane core is believed to occur on C5 and C10, C2 and C9, C13 followed by C7, and a C1 hydroxylation later on in the pathway. Later in the pathway, an oxidation at C9 forms a ketone functional group and an oxetane, forming the intermediate baccatin III. The final steps of the pathway include the formation of a C13-side chain which is attached to baccatin III. The biosynthesis of Taxol is illustrated in more detail in the figure, with steps 1-7 all occurring in the enzyme taxadiene synthase (TS on the figure). Taxol's biosynthesis begins with E,E,E-GGPP losing pyrophosphate via an SN1 mechanism (step 1 in the figure). The double-bond attacks the cation via electrophilic addition, yielding a tertiary cation and creating the first ring closure (step 2). Another electrophilic attack occurs, further cyclizing the structure by creating the first 6-membered ring and creating another tertiary cation (step 3). An intramolecular proton transfer occurs, attacking the verticillyl cation (step 4) and creating a double bond, yielding a tertiary cation. An electrophilic cyclization occurs in step 5, and an intramolecular proton transfer attacks the taxenyl cation (step 6). This forms the fused ring structure intermediate known as taxadiene. Taxadiene then undergoes a series of 10 oxidations via NADPH, forming the intermediate taxadiene-5α-acetoxy-10β-ol (multiple steps later in the figure). A series of hydroxylations and esterficiations occur, forming the intermediate 10-deacetyl-baccatin III, which undergoes a further series of esterifications and a side-chain hydroxylation. This finally yields the product taxol. === Total synthesis === By 1992, at least thirty academic research teams globally were working to achieve a total synthesis of this natural product, with the synthesis proceeding from simple natural products and other readily available starting materials. This total synthesis effort was motivated primarily by the desire to generate new chemical understanding, rather than with an expectation of the practical commercial production of paclitaxel. The first laboratories to complete the total synthesis from much less complex starting materials were the research groups of Robert A. Holton, who had the first article to be accepted for publication, and of K. C. Nicolaou who had the first article to appear in print (by a week, on 7 February 1994). Though the Holton submission preceded the Nicolaou by a month (21 December 1993 versus 24 January 1994), the near coincidence of the publications arising from each of these massive, multiyear efforts—11–18 authors appearing on each of the February 1994 publications—has led the ending of the race to be termed a ""tie"" or a ""photo finish"", though each group has argued that their synthetic strategy and tactics were superior. As of 2006, five additional research groups had reported total syntheses of paclitaxel: Wender et al. in 1997, and Kuwajima et al. and Mukaiyama et al. in 1998 with further linear syntheses, and Danishefsky et al. in 1996 and Takahashi et al. in 2006 with further convergent syntheses. As of that date, all strategies had aimed to prepare a 10-deacetylbaccatin-type core containing the ABCD ring system, followed generally by last stage addition of the ""tail"" to the 13-hydroxyl group. While the ""political climate surrounding [paclitaxel] and [the Pacific yew] in the early 1990s ... helped bolster [a] link between total synthesis and the [paclitaxel] supply problem,"" and though total synthesis activities were a requisite to explore the structure-activity relationships of paclitaxel via generation of analogs for testing, the total synthesis efforts were never seen ""as a serious commercial route"" to provide significant quantities of the natural product for medical testing or therapeutic use. == History == The discovery of paclitaxel began in 1962 as a result of a NCI-funded screening program. A number of years later it was isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, hence its name ""taxol"". The discovery was made by Monroe E. Wall and Mansukh C. Wani at the Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, in 1971. These scientists isolated the natural product from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, determined its structure and named it ""taxol"", and arranged for its first biological testing. The compound was then developed commercially by BMS, who had the generic name assigned as ""paclitaxel"". === Plant screening program === In 1955, the NCI in the United States set up the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center (CCNSC) to act as a public screening center for anticancer activity in compounds submitted by external institutions and companies. Although the majority of compounds screened were of synthetic origin, one chemist, Jonathan Hartwell, who was employed there from 1958 onwards, had experience with natural product derived compounds, and began a plant screening operation. After some years of informal arrangements, in July 1960, the NCI commissioned the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) botanists to collect samples from about 1,000 plant species per year. On 21 August 1962, one of those botanists, Arthur S. Barclay, collected bark from a single Pacific yew tree in a forest north of the town of Packwood, Washington, as part of a four-month trip to collect material from over 200 different species. The material was then processed by a number of specialist CCNSC subcontractors, and one of the tree's samples was found to be cytotoxic in a cellular assay on 22 May 1964. Accordingly, in late 1964 or early 1965, the fractionation and isolation laboratory run by Monroe E. Wall in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, began work on fresh Taxus samples, isolating the active ingredient in September 1966 and announcing their findings at an April 1967 American Chemical Society meeting in Miami Beach. They named the pure compound taxol in June 1967. Wall and his colleague Wani published their results, including the chemical structure, in 1971. The NCI continued to commission work to collect more Taxus bark and to isolate increasing quantities of taxol. By 1969, 28 kg (62 lb) of crude extract had been isolated from almost 1,200 kg (2,600 lb) of bark, although this ultimately yielded only 10 g (0.35 oz) of pure material, but for several years, no use was made of the compound by the NCI. In 1975, it was shown to be active in another in vitro system; two years later, a new department head reviewed the data and finally recommended taxol be moved on to the next stage in the discovery process. This required increasing quantities of purified taxol, up to 600 g (21 oz), and in 1977 a further request for 7,000 lb (3,200 kg) of bark was made. In 1978, two NCI researchers published a report showing that taxol was mildly effective in leukaemic mice. In November 1978, taxol was shown to be effective in xenograft studies. Meanwhile, taxol began to be well known in the cell biology, as well as the cancer communities, with a publication in early 1979 by Susan B. Horwitz, a molecular pharmacologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, showing that taxol had a previously unknown mechanism of action involving the stabilization of microtubules. Together with formulation problems, this increased interest from researchers meant that, by 1980, the NCI envisaged needing to collect 20,000 lb (9,100 kg) of bark. Animal toxicology studies were completed by June 1982, and in November, the NCI applied for the IND necessary to begin clinical trials in humans. === Early clinical trials, supply and the transfer to BMS === Phase I clinical trials began in April 1984, and the decision to start Phase II trials was made a year later. These larger trials needed more bark and collection of a further 12,000 pounds was commissioned, which enabled some phase II trials to begin by the end of 1986. But by then it was recognized that the demand for taxol might be substantial and that more than 60,000 pounds of bark might be needed as a minimum. This unprecedentedly large amount brought ecological concerns about the impact on yew populations into focus for the first time, as local politicians and foresters expressed unease at the program. The first public report from a phase II trial in May 1988 showed promising effects in melanoma and refractory ovarian cancer. At this point, Gordon Cragg of the NCI's Natural Product Branch calculated the synthesis of enough taxol to treat all the ovarian cancer and melanoma cases in the US would require the destruction of 360,000 trees annually. For the first time, serious consideration was given to the problem of supply. Because of the practical and, in particular, the financial scale of the program needed, the NCI decided to seek association with a pharmaceutical company, and in August 1989, it published a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) offering its current stock and supply from current bark stocks, and proprietary access to the data so far collected, to a company willing to commit to providing the funds to collect further raw material, isolate taxol, and fund a large proportion of clinical trials. In the words of Goodman and Welsh, authors of a substantial scholarly book on taxol, ""The NCI was thinking, not of collaboration, ... but of a hand-over of taxol (and its problems)"". Although the offer was widely advertised, only four companies responded to the CRADA, including the American firm Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), which was selected as the partner in December 1989. The choice of BMS later became controversial and was the subject of Congressional hearings in 1991 and 1992. While it seems clear the NCI had little choice but to seek a commercial partner, there was also controversy about the terms of the deal, eventually leading to a report by the General Accounting Office in 2003, which concluded the NIH had failed to ensure value for money. In related CRADAs with the USDA and Department of the Interior, Bristol-Myers Squibb was given exclusive first refusal on all Federal supplies of Taxus brevifolia. This exclusive contract lead to some criticism for giving BMS a ""cancer monopoly"". Eighteen months after the CRADA, BMS filed a new drug application (NDA), which was given FDA approval at the very end of 1992. Although there was no patent on the compound, the provisions of the Waxman-Hatch Act gave Bristol-Myers Squibb five years exclusive marketing rights. In 1990, BMS applied to trademark the name taxol as Taxol(R). This was controversially approved in 1992. At the same time, paclitaxel replaced taxol as the generic (INN) name of the compound. Critics, including the journal Nature, argued the name taxol had been used for more than two decades and in more than 600 scientific articles and suggested the trademark should not have been awarded and the BMS should renounce its rights to it. BMS argued changing the name would cause confusion among oncologists and possibly endanger the health of patients. BMS has continued to defend its rights to the name in the courts. BMS has also been criticized for misrepresentation by Goodman and Walsh, who quote from a company report saying ""It was not until 1971 that ... testing ... enabled the isolation of paclitaxel, initially described as 'compound 17"". This quote is, strictly speaking, accurate: the objection seems to be that this misleadingly neglects to explain that it was the scientist doing the isolation who named the compound taxol and it was not referred to in any other way for more than twenty years. Annual sales peaked in 2000 (the same year that several of BMS’s Taxol patents were invalidated via legal challenge from generic manufacturers), reaching US$1.6 billion; paclitaxel became available in generic form in 2000. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Paclitaxel was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2008. In November 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Naveruclif, intended for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and non-small cell lung cancer. The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare S.L.U. Naveruclif was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2024. In May 2024, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Apexelsin, intended for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and non-small cell lung cancer. The applicant for this medicinal product is WhiteOak Pharmaceutical B.V. Apexelsin was approved for medical use in the European Union in July 2024. === Economics === As of 2006, the cost to the NHS per patient in early breast cancer, assuming four cycles of treatment, was about £4,000 (approx. $6,000). == Research == Caffeine has been speculated to inhibit paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. In 2016, in vitro multi-drug resistant mouse tumor cells were treated with paclitaxel encased in exosomes. Doses 98% less than common dosing had the same effect. Also, dye-marked exosomes were able to mark tumor cells, potentially aiding in diagnosis. Aside from its direct clinical use, paclitaxel is also used extensively in biological and biomedical research as a microtubule stabilizer. In general, in vitro assays involving microtubules, such as motility assays, rely on paclitaxel to maintain microtubule integrity in the absence of the various nucleating factors and other stabilizing elements found in the cell. For example, it is used for in vitro tests of drugs that aim to alter the behavior of microtubule motor proteins, or for studies of mutant motor proteins. Paclitaxel has also been used in vitro to inhibit insulin fibrillation. In a molar ratio of 10:1 (insulin:paclitaxel), it hindered insulin fibrillation near 70%. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) findings indicated a spontaneous tendency of paclitaxel to interact with insulin through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. The inhibitory role of paclitaxel is attributed to its impact on the colloidal stability of protein solution, as it was observed that paclitaxel inhibited lysozyme fibrillation by inducing the formation of ""off-pathway"" oligomeric intermediates, subsequently increasing the colloidal stability. Paclitaxel is sometimes used for in vivo studies as well. It can be fed to test organisms, such as fruit flies, or injected into individual cells, to inhibit microtubule disassembly or to increase the number of microtubules in the cell. Paclitaxel induces remyelination in a demyelinating mouse in vivo and inhibits human peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (hPAD2) in vitro though its methyl ester side chain. In 1999, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc. began phase II clinical trials of micellar paclitaxel as treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, but reported in 2002 that the results showed no statistical significance. == Additional images == == References == === Bibliography === == External links == ""Paclitaxel"".

Paclitaxel kills cancer cells by preventing the normal breakdown of microtubules during cell division. In this formulation, paclitaxel is bonded to albumin as a delivery vehicle. It is manufactured and sold in the United States by Celgene under the trade name Abraxane where it is designated as an orphan drug as first-line treatment, in combination with gemcitabine, for the orphan disease ""metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas"". This treatment was approved in the United States in 2005, and the European Union in 2008, for breast cancer cases where cancer did not respond to other chemotherapy or has relapsed. In 2012, the FDA widened the approved uses to include treatment for NSCLC. In 2013, the FDA approved protein-bound paclitaxel for use in treating advanced pancreatic cancer as a less toxic (although less effective) alternative to FOLFIRINOX. == Society and culture == Abraxane is registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the breast after failure of anthracycline therapy. Abraxane is also included on the Schedule of the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme although the manufacturer was unable to convince the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee that the drug warranted a higher price than existing comparator drugs. Protein-bound paclitaxel was developed by VivoRx which became Abraxis BioScience as the first in its class of drugs to use the nanoparticle albumin bound (nab) technology platform. In 2010, Abraxis was acquired by Celgene, which now markets Abraxane. Total revenue from the sales of Abraxane for 2009 were $314.5 million. In 2013, Abraxane was FDA approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In 2014, Abraxane's sales were $848 million, 31 percent year-over-year increase. In 2019 Bristol Meyers Squibb aquired Celgene for $74 billion dollars, and thus aquired Abraxis Bioscience and the rights to manufacter and market Abraxane. The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced in 2015, that it would not support the routine use of protein-bound paclitaxel in advanced pancreatic cancer on the NHS.

2972,"('Cb 5083', 'Ex-a773')",Medical," Human p97 is a potential drug target in oncology. Mutation-driven drug resistance is an obstacle to the long-term efficacy of targeted therapy. We found that the ATPase activity for one of the CB-5083-resistant p97 mutants was reduced, which also attenuated the degradation of K48 ubiquitinated proteins in cells. To understand how p97 mutant cells with significantly reduced ATPase activity can still grow, we discovered reduced levels of CHOP and NF-κB activation in the p97 mutant cells and these cellular changes can potentially protect HCT116 cells from death due to lowered p97 activity. In addition, the NF-kB inhibitor Sulforaphane reduces proliferation of CB-5083 resistant cells and acts synergistically with CB-5083 to block proliferation of the parental HCT116 cells. The combination of Sulforaphane and CB-5083 may be a useful treatment strategy to combat CB-5083 resistance. Pathogenic gain of function variants in Valosin-containing protein (VCP) cause a unique disease characterized by inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (also known as Multisystem proteinopathy (MSP)). Previous studies in drosophila models of VCP disease indicate treatment with VCP inhibitors mitigates disease pathology. Earlier-generation VCP inhibitors display off-target effects and relatively low therapeutic potency. New generation of VCP inhibitors needs to be evaluated in a mouse model of VCP disease. In this study, we tested the safety and efficacy of a novel and potent VCP inhibitor, CB-5083 using VCP patient-derived myoblast cells and an animal model of VCP disease. First, we analyzed the effect of CB-5083 in patient-derived myoblasts on the typical disease autophagy and TDP-43 profile by Western blot. Next, we determined the maximum tolerated dosage of CB-5083 in mice and treated the 2-month-old VCP In vitro analyses using patient-derived myoblasts confirmed that CB-5083 can modulate expression of the proteins in the autophagy pathways. We found that chronic CB-5083 treatment is well tolerated in the homozygous mice harboring patient-specific VCP variant, R155H, and can ameliorate the muscle pathology characteristic of the disease. VCP-associated pathology biomarkers, such as elevated TDP-43 and p62 levels, were significantly reduced. Finally, to address the potential adverse effect of CB-5083 on visual function observed in a previous oncology clinical trial, we analyzed retinal function in mice treated with moderate doses of CB-5083 for 5 months and documented the absence of permanent ocular toxicity. Altogether, these findings suggest that long-term use of CB-5083 by moderate doses is safe and can improve VCP disease-associated muscle pathology. Our results provide translationally relevant evidence that VCP inhibitors could be beneficial in the treatment of VCP disease. CB-5083 is an inhibitor of p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP), for which phase I trials for cancer were terminated because of adverse effects on vision, such as photophobia and dyschromatopsia. Lower dose CB-5083 could combat inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia or multisystem proteinopathy caused by gain-of-function mutations in VCP. We hypothesized that the visual impairment in the cancer trial was due to CB-5083's inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE)-6, which mediates signal transduction in photoreceptors. To test our hypothesis, we used in vivo and ex vivo electroretinography (ERG) in mice and a PDE6 activity assay of bovine rod outer segment (ROS) extracts. Additionally, histology and optical coherence tomography were used to assess CB-5083's long-term ocular toxicity. A single administration of CB-5083 led to robust ERG signal deterioration, specifically in photoresponse kinetics. Similar recordings with known PDE inhibitors sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and zaprinast showed that only vardenafil had as strong an effect on the ERG signal in vivo as did CB-5083. In the biochemical assay, CB-5083 inhibited PDE6 activity with a potency higher than sildenafil but lower than that of vardenafil. Ex vivo ERG revealed a PDE6 inhibition constant of 80 nM for CB-5083, which is 7-fold smaller than that for sildenafil. Finally, we showed that the inhibitory effect of CB-5083 on visual function is reversible, and its chronic administration does not cause permanent retinal anomalies in aged VCP-disease model mice. Our results warrant re-evaluation of CB-5083 as a clinical therapeutic agent. We recommend preclinical ERG recordings as a routine drug safety screen. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This report supports the use of a valosin-containing protein (VCP) inhibitor drug, CB-5083, for the treatment of neuromuscular VCP disease despite CB-5083's initial clinical failure for cancer treatment due to side effects on vision. The data show that CB-5083 displays a dose-dependent but reversible inhibitory action on phosphodiesterase-6, an essential enzyme in retinal photoreceptor function, but no long-term consequences on retinal function or structure.",Cb 5083,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005576055962592363), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0232579093426466)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.12694281339645386)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.ncats.io](https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/591IV6UL6J?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='CB-5083', type='url_citation', url='https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/591IV6UL6J?utm_source=openai')])"
