1390,"('Cinnarizine', 'Stugeron', 'Dimitronal', 'Stutgin', 'Cinarizine')",Medical,"Cinnarizine is an antihistamine and calcium channel blocker of the diphenylmethylpiperazine group. It is prescribed for nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness or other sources such as chemotherapy, vertigo, or Ménière's disease. Cinnarizine is one of the leading causes of drug-induced parkinsonism. Cinnarizine was first synthesized as R1575 by Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1955. The nonproprietary name is derived from the cinnamyl substituent on the free nitrogen atom of the benzhydrylpiperazine core, combined with the generic ending ""-rizine"" for ""antihistaminics/cerebral (or peripheral) vasodilators"". It is not available in the United States or Canada. It has also been cited as one of the most used drugs for seasickness within the British Royal Navy. == Medical uses == Cinnarizine is predominantly used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, vertigo, Ménière's disease, or Cogan's syndrome. It is one of only a few drugs that has a beneficial effect in the chronic treatment of the vertigo and tinnitus associated with Ménière's disease. In a clinical study (n=181), treatment with cinnarizine reduced the occurrence of moderate vertigo experience by 65.8% and extreme vertigo by 89.8%. It acts by interfering with the signal transmission between vestibular apparatus of the inner ear and the vomiting centre of the hypothalamus by limiting the activity of the vestibular hair cells which send signals about movement. The disparity of signal processing between inner ear motion receptors and the visual senses is abolished, so that the confusion of brain whether the individual is moving or standing is reduced. Vomiting in motion sickness could be a physiological compensatory mechanism of the brain to keep the individual from moving so that it can adjust to the signal perception, but the true evolutionary reason for this malady is currently unknown. When prescribed for balance problems and vertigo, cinnarizine is typically taken two or three times daily depending on the amount of each dose and when used to treat motion sickness, the pill is taken at least two hours before travelling and then again every four hours during travel. However, a recent 2012 study comparing the effects of cinnarizine to transdermal scopolamine for the treatment of seasickness, concluded that scopolamine was reported as significantly more effective and as having fewer adverse side effects than cinnarizine. This led to the conclusion that transdermal scopolamine is likely a better option for the treatment of motion sickness in naval crew and other sea travelers. However, due to increased levels of drowsiness caused by the medication, it is generally of limited use in pilots and aircrew who must be dependably alert. Additionally, cinnarizine can be used in scuba divers without an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity which can result in seizures, and is a high risk in closed-circuit oxygen diving. This is also relevant to divers who could potentially have to undergo hypobaric decompression therapy, which uses high oxygen pressure and could also be affected by any cinnarizine-induced CNS oxygen toxicity risk. However, cinnarizine does not heighten toxicity risk, and in fact, evidence even seems to suggest that cinnarizine may be beneficial in helping delay O2 toxicity in the central nervous system. There is also evidence that cinnarizine may be used as an effective anti-asthma medication when taken regularly. Beyond an anti-vertigo treatment, cinnarizine could be also viewed as a nootropic drug because of its vasorelaxating abilities (due to calcium channel blockade), which happen mostly in brain, and the fact that it is also used as a labyrinthine sedative. Cinnarizine inhibits the flow of calcium into red blood cells, which increases the elasticity of the cell wall, thereby increasing their flexibility and making the blood less viscous. This allows the blood to travel more efficiently and effectively through narrowed vessels in order to bring oxygen to damaged tissue. It is also effectively combined with other nootropics, primarily piracetam; in such combination each drug potentiates the other in boosting brain oxygen supply. An animal study comparing the effectiveness of cinnarizine and flunarizine (a derivative of cinnarizine that is 2.5-15 times stronger for treatment of transient global cerebral ischemia), it was found that cinnarizine helped to improve the functional abnormalities of ischemia, but did not help with damage to the neurons. Flunarizine offered more neuronal protection, but was less effective in treating subsequent behavioral changes. Cinnarizine has also been found to be a valuable second-line treatment for idiopathic urticarial vasculitis. == Side effects == Side effects experienced while taking cinnarizine range from the mild to the quite severe. Possible side effects include drug-induced parkinsonism, drowsiness, sweating, dry mouth, headache, skin problems, lethargy, gastrointestinal irritation, hypersensitivity reactions, as well as movement problems, muscle rigidity, and tremor. Because cinnarizine can cause drowsiness and blurred vision, it is important that users make sure their reactions are normal before driving, operating machinery, or doing any other jobs which could be dangerous if they are not fully alert or able to see well. Cinnarizine causes acute and chronic parkinsonism due to its affinity for D2 receptors, which strongly counter-suggests its actual usefulness for improving neurological health. Cinnarizine's antagonistic effects of D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum leads to symptoms of depression, tremor, muscle rigidity, tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia. 17 of 100 new parkinsonism cases are linked to administration of either cinnarizine or flunarizine. Drug induced parkinsonism is the second leading cause of parkinsonism. Evidence suggests that it is one of the metabolites of cinnarizine, C-2, that has an active role in contributing to the development of drug-induced parkinsonism. Those people especially at risk are elderly patients, in particular women, and patients who have been taking the drug for a longer amount of time. There is also evidence that patients with a family history of Parkinson's or a genetic predisposition to the disease are more likely to develop the drug induced form of this disease as a result of cinnarizine treatment. In addition to antagonizing D2 receptors, treatment with cinnarizine leads to reduced presynaptic dopamine and serotonin, as well as alterations in vesicular transport of dopamine. Chronic treatment with cinnarizine builds the drug concentrations high enough that they interfere with the proton electrochemical gradient necessary for packaging dopamine into vesicles. Cinnarizine, pKa = 7.4, acts as a protonophore, which prevents the MgATP-dependent production of the electrochemical gradient crucial to the transport and storage of dopamine into vesicles, and thereby lowers the levels of dopamine in the basal ganglia neurons and leads to the Parkinson's symptoms. Several cases of pediatric and adult cinnarizine overdose have been reported, with effects including a range of symptoms such as somnolence, coma, vomiting, hypotonia, stupor, and convulsions. The cognitive complications likely result from the antihistaminic effects of cinnarizine, while the motor effects are a product of the antidopaminergic properties. In cases of overdose, the patient should be brought to and observed in a hospital for potential neurological complications. == Pharmacokinetics == Cinnarizine is most commonly taken orally, in tablet form, with frequency and amount of dosage varying depending on the reason for taking the medication. Once ingested, the substance is absorbed quite rapidly and reaches a peak plasma concentration in 1–3 hours post-administration. Cmax, the maximum level of the drug in the tested area (typically blood plasma), has been measured to be 275 ± 36 ng/mL; tmax, the time to maximum concentration, was 3.0 ± 0.5 hours. AUC∞, which can be used to estimate bioavailability, was 4437 ± 948 ng·h/mL. The half-life elimination varies from 3.4–60 hours, depending on age. However, the mean terminal half-life elimination for young volunteer subjects administered 75 mg cinnarizine, was found to be 23.6 ± 3.2 hours. A study that administered 75 mg doses of cinnarizine, twice a day for twelve days, to healthy volunteers, observed that cinnarizine did accumulate in the body, with a steady-state accumulation factor of 2.79 ± 0.23. However, the AUCT for this amount of time (T=12 days) was not significantly different from the AUC∞, which was estimated from the single dose administration. As a very weakly basic and also lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility, cinnarizine is able to cross the blood brain barrier by simple diffusion. It is because of this property that it is able to exert its effects on cerebral blood flow in the brain. Bioavailability of orally administered cinnarizine is typically low and variable due to high incidence of degradation. However, it has been found that when administered intravenously in lipid emulsion, better pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution were achieved. The lipid emulsion administration had a higher AUC and lower clearance than the solution form, which meant that there was an increased bioavailability of cinnarizine, allowing for an improved therapeutic effect. Plasma pharmacokinetics of cinnarizine administered intravenously follows a three-compartment model first with a fast distribution phase, followed by a slower distribution phase, and ending with a very slow elimination. The Vss (steady state apparent volume of distribution) for lipid emulsion administration was 2× lower (6.871 ± 1.432 L/kg) than that of cinnarizine given in solution (14.018 ± 5.598 L/kg) and it was found that significantly less cinnarizine was taken up into the lung and brain in the lipid emulsion condition. This is significant because it would reduce the likelihood of toxic side effects in the central nervous system. == Pharmacodynamics == Cinnarizine is classified as a selective antagonist of T-type voltage-operated calcium ion channels, because its binding blocks the channels and keeps them inert. It has a Ki (inhibitory constant) value of 22 nM. It is also known to have antihistaminic, antiserotoninergic and antidopaminergic effects, binding to H1 histamine receptors, and dopaminergic (D2) receptors. The IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of cinnarizine for smooth muscle contraction inhibition is 60 mM and it has been shown that this drug preferentially binds to its target calcium channels when they are in an open, as opposed to closed conformation. In treatment of nausea and motion sickness it was previously hypothesized that cinnarizine exerts its effects by inhibiting the calcium currents in voltage gated channels in type II vestibular hair cells within the inner ear. However, more recent evidence supports the idea that at pharmacologically relevant levels (0.3–0.5 μM), cinnarizine is not lessening vestibular vertigo by blocking calcium channels, but rather by inhibiting potassium (K+) currents that are activated by heightened hydrostatic pressure on the hair cells. It is true that cinnarizine does abolish calcium currents in vestibular hair cells as well; it is just that this only occurs at higher concentrations of drug (3 μM). The inhibition of these currents works to lessen the vertigo and motion-induced nausea by dampening the over-reactivity of the vestibular hair cells, which send information about balance and motion to the brain. == Elimination == After administration, cinnarizine is completely metabolized within the body and the metabolites are eliminated by one third in the urine and two thirds in solid waste. == See also == Cyclizine == References == == External links == Media related to Cinnarizine at Wikimedia Commons",Stutgin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.292907877039397e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.5775410532951355), ('ICAL', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014367112889885902)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/stutgeron?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=113, start_index=9, title='Stutgeron | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/stutgeron?utm_source=openai')])"

It has in vitro and in vivo activities against mouse models of polycystic kidney disease and pancreatic cancer, but its physical properties and severe toxicity limit its therapeutic potential. Consequently, a synthetic water-soluble prodrug, minnelide, is being studied clinically instead. Triptolide is a component of ContraPest, a contraceptive pest control liquid used to reduce rat populations in the United States. == Mechanism of action == Several putative target proteins of triptolide have been reported, including polycystin-2, ADAM10, DCTPP1, TAB1, and XPB. Multiple triptolide-resistant mutations exist in XPB (ERCC3) and its partner protein GTF2H4. However, no triptolide-resistant mutations were found in polycystin-2, ADAM10, DCTPP1 and TAB1. Cys342 of XPB was identified as the residue that undergoes covalent modification by the 12,13-epoxide group of triptolide, and the XPB-C342T mutant rendered the T7115 cell line nearly completely resistant to triptolide. The level of resistance conferred by the C342T mutation is about 100-fold higher than the most triptolide-resistant mutants previously identified. Together, these results validate XPB as a target responsible for the antiproliferative activity of triptolide. The disruption of super-enhancer networks has also been suggested as a mechanism of action. == Water-soluble prodrugs == Minnelide is a more water-soluble synthetic prodrug of triptolide which is converted to triptolide in vivo. In a preclinical mouse model of pancreatic cancer, it was ""even more effective than gemcitabine"". Its Phase II clinical trials are expected to conclude in February 2019. Glutriptolide, a glucose conjugate of triptolide with better solubility and lower toxicity, did not inhibit XPB activity in vitro, but exhibited tumor control in vivo, which is likely due to sustained stepwise release of active triptolide within cancer cells. A second generation glutriptolide has been recently reported for targeting hypoxic cancer cells with increased glucose transporter expression. == References ==",Triptolid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.010018255561590195), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.26945462822914124), ('ICAL', -7.867782187531702e-06), (',', -0.003185913898050785), ('ĠINDU', -0.0036640907637774944), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011083347722887993)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO; ', [])"

1393,"('Nicotinamide', 'Niacinamide', 'Nicotinic acid amide', 'Pyridine-3-carboxamide', 'Vitamin pp')","Endogenous, Food, Medical, Personal Care","Nicotinamide (INN, BAN UK) or niacinamide (USAN US) is a form of vitamin B3 found in food and used as a dietary supplement and medication. As a supplement, it is used orally (swallowed by mouth) to prevent and treat pellagra (niacin deficiency). While nicotinic acid (niacin) may be used for this purpose, nicotinamide has the benefit of not causing skin flushing. As a cream, it is used to treat acne, and has been observed in clinical studies to improve the appearance of aging skin by reducing hyperpigmentation and redness. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Side effects are minimal. At high doses, liver problems may occur. Normal amounts are safe for use during pregnancy. Nicotinamide is in the vitamin B family of medications, specifically the vitamin B3 complex. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. Foods that contain nicotinamide include yeast, meat, milk, and green vegetables. Nicotinamide was discovered between 1935 and 1937. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Nicotinamide is available as a generic medication and over the counter. Commercially, nicotinamide is made from either nicotinic acid (niacin) or nicotinonitrile. In some countries, grains have nicotinamide added to them. == Medical uses == === Niacin deficiency === Nicotinamide is the preferred treatment for pellagra, caused by niacin deficiency. === Acne === Nicotinamide cream is used as a treatment for acne. It has anti-inflammatory actions, which may benefit people with inflammatory skin conditions. Nicotinamide increases the biosynthesis of ceramides in human keratinocytes in vitro and improves the epidermal permeability barrier in vivo. The application of 2% topical nicotinamide for 2 and 4 weeks has been found to be effective in lowering the sebum excretion rate. Nicotinamide has been shown to prevent Cutibacterium acnes-induced activation of toll-like receptor 2, which ultimately results in the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory interleukin-8 production. === Skin cancer === Nicotinamide at doses of 500 to 1000 mg a day decreases the risk of skin cancers, other than melanoma, in those at high risk. == Side effects == Nicotinamide has minimal side effects. At very high doses above 3g/ day acute liver toxicity has been documented in at least one case. Normal doses are safe during pregnancy. == Chemistry == The structure of nicotinamide consists of a pyridine ring to which a primary amide group is attached in the meta position. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. As an aromatic compound, it undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions and transformations of its two functional groups. Examples of these reactions reported in Organic Syntheses include the preparation of 2-chloronicotinonitrile by a two-step process via the N-oxide, from nicotinonitrile by reaction with phosphorus pentoxide, and from 3-aminopyridine by reaction with a solution of sodium hypobromite, prepared in situ from bromine and sodium hydroxide. === Industrial production === The hydrolysis of nicotinonitrile is catalysed by the enzyme nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1, producing 3500 tons per annum of nicotinamide for use in animal feed. The enzyme allows for a more selective synthesis as further hydrolysis of the amide to nicotinic acid is avoided. Nicotinamide can also be made from nicotinic acid. According to Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, worldwide 31,000 tons of nicotinamide were sold in 2014. === Biochemistry === Nicotinamide, as a part of the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH / NAD+) is crucial to life. In cells, nicotinamide is incorporated into NAD+ and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). NAD+ and NADP+ are cofactors in a wide variety of enzymatic oxidation-reduction reactions, most notably glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. If humans ingest nicotinamide, it will likely undergo a series of reactions that transform it into NAD, which can then undergo a transformation to form NADP+. This method of creation of NAD+ is called a salvage pathway. However, the human body can produce NAD+ from the amino acid tryptophan and niacin without our ingestion of nicotinamide. NAD+ acts as an electron carrier that mediates the interconversion of energy between nutrients and the cell's energy currency, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In oxidation-reduction reactions, the active part of the cofactor is the nicotinamide. In NAD+, the nitrogen in the aromatic nicotinamide ring is covalently bonded to adenine dinucleotide. The formal charge on the nitrogen is stabilized by the shared electrons of the other carbon atoms in the aromatic ring. When a hydride atom is added onto NAD+ to form NADH, the molecule loses its aromaticity, and therefore a good amount of stability. This higher energy product later releases its energy with the release of a hydride, and in the case of the electron transport chain, it assists in forming adenosine triphosphate. When one mole of NADH is oxidized, 158.2 kJ of energy will be released. === Biological role === Nicotinamide occurs as a component of a variety of biological systems, including within the vitamin B family and specifically the vitamin B3 complex. It is also a critically important part of the structures of NADH and NAD+, where the N-substituted aromatic ring in the oxidised NAD+ form undergoes reduction with hydride attack to form NADH. The NADPH/NADP+ structures have the same ring, and are involved in similar biochemical reactions. Nicotinamide can be methylated in the liver to biologically active 1-Methylnicotinamide when there are sufficient methyl donors. == Food sources == Nicotinamide occurs in trace amounts mainly in meat, fish, nuts, and mushrooms, as well as to a lesser extent in some vegetables. It is commonly added to cereals and other foods. Many multivitamins contain 20–30 mg of vitamin B3 and it is also available in higher doses. == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia Japanese Pharmacopoeia == Research == A 2015 trial found nicotinamide to reduce the rate of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in a group of people at high risk for the conditions. Nicotinamide has been investigated for many additional disorders, including treatment of bullous pemphigoid nonmelanoma skin cancers. Nicotinamide may be beneficial in treating psoriasis. There is tentative evidence for a potential role of nicotinamide in treating acne, rosacea, autoimmune blistering disorders, ageing skin, and atopic dermatitis. Nicotinamide also inhibits poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP-1), enzymes involved in the rejoining of DNA strand breaks induced by radiation or chemotherapy. ARCON (accelerated radiotherapy plus carbogen inhalation and nicotinamide) has been studied in cancer. Research has suggested nicotinamide may play a role in the treatment of HIV. == References ==",Pyridine-3-carboxamide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.013812151737511158), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.32140710949897766), ('OG', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('ENO', -9.13388703338569e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.0002613358374219388), (',', -0.001929228543303907), (' PERSONAL', -0.00033546582562848926), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.10084254294633865), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.3869187831878662), (',', -0.029801445081830025), ('ĠEND', -0.09212386608123779), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06205500662326813)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.3878917992115021), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -6.2729995988775045e-06), (' FOOD', -4.961759259458631e-06)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It has been isolated from a variety of plant sources and is being studied for its variety of pharmacological properties. == History == Apocynin was first described by Oswald Schmiedeberg, a German pharmacologist, in 1883 and was first isolated by Horace Finnemore, in 1908, from the root of Canadian hemp (Apocynum cannabinum). At the time, this plant was already used for its known effectiveness against edema and heart problems. In 1971, apocynin was also isolated from Picrorhiza kurroa, a small plant that grows at high altitudes in the western Himalayas. P. kurroa was used for ages as a treatment for liver and heart problems, jaundice, and asthma. In 1990, Simons et al. isolated apocynin to a pharmacologically useful level using an actively guided isolation procedure. Apocynin's observed anti-inflammatory capabilities proved to be a result of its ability to selectively prevent the formation of free radicals, oxygen ions, and peroxides in the body. Apocynin has since been extensively studied to help determine its disease-fighting capabilities and applications. == Physical properties == Apocynin is a solid with a melting point of 115 °C and the faint odor of vanilla. It is soluble in hot water, alcohol, benzene, chloroform, DMSO and DMF. == Mode of action == NADPH oxidase is an enzyme that effectively reduces O2 to superoxide (O2–•), which can be used by the immune system to kill bacteria and fungi. Apocynin is an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase activity and thus is effective in preventing the production of the superoxide in human agranulocytes or neutrophilic granulocytes. It does not however obstruct the phagocytic or other defense roles of granulocytes. Due to the selectivity of its inhibition, apocynin can be widely used as an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase without interfering in other aspects of the immune system. Apocynin was used to determine whether ionic activation due to proton flux across the membrane of renal medulla cells was coupled to NADPH oxidase production of superoxide. Apocynin was introduced to the cells and completely blocked the production of superoxide, and was a key component in determining that the proton outflow was responsible for the activation of NADPH oxidase. The mechanism of action of apocynin is not understood. In the experimental studies, apocynin is shown to dimerize and form diapocynin. Although, diapocynin seems to have beneficial effect in reducing reactive oxygen species and anti-inflammatory properties, it is still yet to be shown as biologically relevant molecule. Biotransformation of apocynin predominantly leads to glycosylated form of apocynin. Another molecule that is shown to form under experimental conditions is nitroapocynin. == Research == Small scale early stage clinical trials for apocynin were conducted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2011 and asthma in 2012 but they did not progress any further. Other preliminary pre-clinical research includes: Anti-arthritic: Neutrophils are a key component of the pathogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis and in the mechanisms that lead to the start of inflammation of the joints. The action of apocynin reduces the presence of such cells before the inflammation has begun but it is unable to reverse inflammation that is already present. Bowel disease: Apocynin treatment in rats has been proven to lessen damage in the colon as well as the enzymatic activity of myeloperoxidase which is associated with inflammation. In addition, apocynin also decreased the number of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the colon. Anti-asthmatic: The glucoside of apocynin, androsin, is being investigated for the treatment of asthma for has been shown to prevent bronchial obstruction in guinea pigs. It is believed that the anti-asthmatic quality of apocynin comes from its interference with certain inflammatory processes. Atherosclerosis: Apocynin is used in the treatment of atherosclerosis in order to prevent the activity of NADPH oxidase activity, halting the production of reactive oxygen species. In effect, this inhibition stops initiation of disease in the endothelial cells. Familial ALS: Apocynin extended the lives of mutant mice and reduced glial cell toxicity of cultured cells lines with a defective superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene—a genetic defect found in some people with hereditary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease). Researchers believe the benefit derives from a newly discovered role for SOD1 as a self-regulating redox sensor for NADPH oxidase-derived O2• production. The findings in mice may point to new drug targets for hereditary ALS. Skin stem cells: Apocynin promotes the synthesis of collagen 17 and by doing this it increases the survival of the mother cells derived from stem cells. == References ==",Acetovanillone,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INFO', [('FO', -0.15667758882045746), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.04861053079366684), (' PERSONAL', -0.06555332988500595), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.10033261030912399), (' INFO', -0.10150229185819626)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.42215198278427124), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), (',', -0.008627640083432198), ('ĠFOOD', -0.1377352774143219), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25209230184555054)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.07888978719711304), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.07888989895582199), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('Acetovanillone, also known as apocynin, is classified as MEDICAL, FOOD, and PERSONAL CARE.

1396,"('Hyodeoxycholic acid', 'Hyodesoxycholic acid', 'Iodeoxycholic acid', '.alpha.-hyodeoxycholic acid', 'Hyodeoxycholic acid (hdca)')","Endogenous, Medical","Hyodeoxycholic acid, also known as 3α,6α-Dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid or HDCA, is a secondary bile acid, one of the metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria. It differs from deoxycholic acid in that the 6α-hydroxyl is in the 12 position in the former. The 6α-hydroxyl group makes HDCA a hydrophilic acid, a property it shares with hyocholic acid. HDCA is present in mammalian species in different proportions. It is the main acid constituent of hog bile, and for this reason it was used industrially as precursor for steroid synthesis before total synthesis became practical. == Metabolism == In rat intestinal microflora hyodeoxycholic acid is produced by a Gram-positive rod—termed HDCA-1—from several isomers of hyocholic acid and muricholic acid. In pigs with a normal gastrointestinal flora the majority of hyodeoxycholic acid found in bile is of secondary nature, but a small amount was also found in germ free pigs, which supports the hypothesis that HDCA may be a primary bile acid in this species. In healthy humans only traces of HDCA have been found in urine, but in patients with cholestatic liver disease or intestinal malabsorption a significant amount has been found excreted. Hyodeoxycholic acid undergoes glucuronidation in human liver and kidneys. Glucuronidation of hyodeoxycholic and hyocholic acids was observed to occur extensively at the 6α-hydroxyl group, unlike primary bile acids which form 3α-hydroxy-linked glucuronides. This suggests an important pathway for the elimination of toxic and cholestatic bile acids, e.g. lithocholic and chenodeoxycholic acids which can form hyodeoxycholic and hyocholic acids, respectively, after 6α-hydroxilation. The enzyme family responsible for glucosidation of hyodeoxycholic acid in human liver is UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. Both the UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 isoforms are able to glucuronidate HDCA. This is an example of redundancy in protection against harmful endogenous compounds provided by UGT isoforms, which present distinct but frequently overlapping substrate specificity. A common amino-acid residue that confers these two isoforms specificity to HDCA has been identified in 2006. Animal model studies support the concept that bile acids may play a role in the development of colon cancer. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) is believed to be tumor promoter, while ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was found to suppress the development of colon tumors. The mechanism that accounts for this difference in function is not clear. In vitro studies found that DCA induces apoptosis in some colon cancer cell lines, while UDCA arrests cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis. In these studies HDCA exhibited biological activity that is intermediate to DCA and UDCA, arresting growth for a time, but causing apoptosis after extended exposure. == Applications == It was known since 1939 that HDCA could be used to synthesize progesterone. A decade later, an analysis of the composition of hog bile determined that HDCA accounted for approximately 40% of its acid contents. In the 1950s, lacking access to vegetal precursors of steroids, like diosgenin, the East German company Jenapharm used hyodeoxycholic acid extracted from hog bile as the sole precursor for steroid synthesis. In the 1980s, hyodeoxycholic acid was investigated for its propensity to prevent cholesterol-induced gallstones in animals fed with a lithogenic diet. Another animal study determined that oral administration of HDCA leads to a decrease in LDL-cholesterol concentration, a strong stimulation of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis and an excessive loss of cholesterol in feces. Unlike ursodeoxycholic acid, which is an approved drug for the treatment of gallstones, HDCA is not marketed for any medical condition.

1400,"('Proglumide', 'Binoside', 'Xylamide', 'Gastrotopic', 'Midelid')",Medical,"Proglumide, sold under the brand name Milid, is a drug that inhibits gastrointestinal motility and reduces gastric secretions. It acts as a cholecystokinin antagonist, which blocks both the CCKA and CCKB subtypes. It was used mainly in the treatment of stomach ulcers, although it has now been largely replaced by newer drugs for this application. An interesting side effect of proglumide is that it enhances the analgesia produced by opioid drugs, and can prevent or even reverse the development of tolerance to opioid drugs. This can make it a useful adjuvant treatment to use alongside opioid drugs in the treatment of chronic pain conditions such as cancer, where opioid analgesics may be required for long periods and development of tolerance reduces clinical efficacy of these drugs. Proglumide has also been shown to act as a δ-opioid receptor (DOR) agonist, which may contribute to its analgesic effects. However, other studies show that proglumide has low affinity to the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) (13% of MOR and 17% of KOR occupancy at 100 μM), but no affinity to DOR. It is questionable whether this is clinically significant, since the concentration they used was very high, and the occupancies were low even at that point. Proglumide also works as a placebo effect amplifier for pain conditions. When injected visibly to a subject, its analgesic effect is bigger than a similarly administered placebo. When injected secretly, it does not have any effect, whereas standard pain drugs have an effect, even if they are administered without the subject's awareness. The supposed mechanism is an enhancement of the neural pathways of expectation as a result of dopamine and endogenous opioids being suddenly released throughout numerous structures of the brain and spinal cord. The ventral tegmental area is the structure believed to mediate proglumide's analgesic and euphoric effects, however dozens of areas with a wide range of physical and psychological functions are implicated in the mediation of the placebo effect (this accounts for proglumide's ability to produce physically measurable effects on vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and tidal volume which cannot be accounted for by its clinically insignificant δ-opioid affinity. == See also == Proglumetacin Benzotript == References ==",Proglumide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.483612312673358e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015141224721446633)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proglumide ', [])"
1401,"('Ferrous bisglycinate', 'Glycine', 'Aminoacetic acid', 'Glycocoll', 'Aminoethanoic acid')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Glycine (symbol Gly or G; ) is an amino acid that has a single hydrogen atom as its side chain. It is the simplest stable amino acid. Glycine is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is encoded by all the codons starting with GG (GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG). Glycine is integral to the formation of alpha-helices in secondary protein structure due to the ""flexibility"" caused by such a small R group. Glycine is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter – interference with its release within the spinal cord (such as during a Clostridium tetani infection) can cause spastic paralysis due to uninhibited muscle contraction. It is the only achiral proteinogenic amino acid. It can fit into both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments, due to its minimal side chain of only one hydrogen atom. == History and etymology == Glycine was discovered in 1820 by French chemist Henri Braconnot when he hydrolyzed gelatin by boiling it with sulfuric acid. He originally called it ""sugar of gelatin"", but French chemist Jean-Baptiste Boussingault showed in 1838 that it contained nitrogen. In 1847 American scientist Eben Norton Horsford, then a student of the German chemist Justus von Liebig, proposed the name ""glycocoll""; however, the Swedish chemist Berzelius suggested the simpler current name a year later. The name comes from the Greek word γλυκύς ""sweet tasting"" (which is also related to the prefixes glyco- and gluco-, as in glycoprotein and glucose). In 1858, the French chemist Auguste Cahours determined that glycine was an amine of acetic acid. == Production == Although glycine can be isolated from hydrolyzed proteins, this route is not used for industrial production, as it can be manufactured more conveniently by chemical synthesis. The two main processes are amination of chloroacetic acid with ammonia, giving glycine and hydrochloric acid, and the Strecker amino acid synthesis, which is the main synthetic method in the United States and Japan. About 15 thousand tonnes are produced annually in this way. Glycine is also co-generated as an impurity in the synthesis of EDTA, arising from reactions of the ammonia co-product. == Chemical reactions == Its acid–base properties are most important. In aqueous solution, glycine is amphoteric: below pH = 2.4, it converts to the ammonium cation called glycinium. Above about pH 9.6, it converts to glycinate. Glycine functions as a bidentate ligand for many metal ions, forming amino acid complexes. A typical complex is Cu(glycinate)2, i.e. Cu(H2NCH2CO2)2, which exists both in cis and trans isomers. With acid chlorides, glycine converts to the amidocarboxylic acid, such as hippuric acid and acetylglycine. With nitrous acid, one obtains glycolic acid (van Slyke determination). With methyl iodide, the amine becomes quaternized to give trimethylglycine, a natural product: H3N+CH2COO− + 3 CH3I → (CH3)3N+CH2COO− + 3 HI Glycine condenses with itself to give peptides, beginning with the formation of glycylglycine: 2 H3N+CH2COO− → H3N+CH2CONHCH2COO− + H2O Pyrolysis of glycine or glycylglycine gives 2,5-diketopiperazine, the cyclic diamide. Glycine forms esters with alcohols. They are often isolated as their hydrochloride, such as glycine methyl ester hydrochloride. Otherwise, the free ester tends to convert to diketopiperazine. As a bifunctional molecule, glycine reacts with many reagents. These can be classified into N-centered and carboxylate-center reactions. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Glycine is not essential to the human diet, as it is biosynthesized in the body from the amino acid serine, which is in turn derived from 3-phosphoglycerate. In most organisms, the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyses this transformation via the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate: serine + tetrahydrofolate → glycine + N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate + H2O In E. coli, antibiotics that target folate depletes the supply of active tetrahydrofolates, halting glycine biosynthesis as a consequence. In the liver of vertebrates, glycine synthesis is catalyzed by glycine synthase (also called glycine cleavage enzyme). This conversion is readily reversible: CO2 + NH+4 + N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate + NADH + H+ ⇌ Glycine + tetrahydrofolate + NAD+ In addition to being synthesized from serine, glycine can also be derived from threonine, choline or hydroxyproline via inter-organ metabolism of the liver and kidneys. === Degradation === Glycine is degraded via three pathways. The predominant pathway in animals and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway mentioned above. In this context, the enzyme system involved is usually called the glycine cleavage system: Glycine + tetrahydrofolate + NAD+ ⇌ CO2 + NH+4 + N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate + NADH + H+ In the second pathway, glycine is degraded in two steps. The first step is the reverse of glycine biosynthesis from serine with serine hydroxymethyl transferase. Serine is then converted to pyruvate by serine dehydratase. In the third pathway of its degradation, glycine is converted to glyoxylate by D-amino acid oxidase. Glyoxylate is then oxidized by hepatic lactate dehydrogenase to oxalate in an NAD+-dependent reaction. The half-life of glycine and its elimination from the body varies significantly based on dose. In one study, the half-life varied between 0.5 and 4.0 hours. == Physiological function == The principal function of glycine is it acts as a precursor to proteins. Most proteins incorporate only small quantities of glycine, a notable exception being collagen, which contains about 35% glycine due to its periodically repeated role in the formation of collagen's helix structure in conjunction with hydroxyproline. In the genetic code, glycine is coded by all codons starting with GG, namely GGU, GGC, GGA and GGG. === As a biosynthetic intermediate === In higher eukaryotes, δ-aminolevulinic acid, the key precursor to porphyrins, is biosynthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA by the enzyme ALA synthase. Glycine provides the central C2N subunit of all purines. === As a neurotransmitter === Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, especially in the spinal cord, brainstem, and retina. When glycine receptors are activated, chloride enters the neuron via ionotropic receptors, causing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). Strychnine is a strong antagonist at ionotropic glycine receptors, whereas bicuculline is a weak one. Glycine is a required co-agonist along with glutamate for NMDA receptors. In contrast to the inhibitory role of glycine in the spinal cord, this behaviour is facilitated at the (NMDA) glutamatergic receptors which are excitatory. The LD50 of glycine is 7930 mg/kg in rats (oral), and it usually causes death by hyperexcitability. === As a toxin conjugation agent === Glycine conjugation pathway has not been fully investigated. Glycine is thought to be a hepatic detoxifier of a number endogenous and xenobiotic organic acids. Bile acids are normally conjugated to glycine in order to increase their solubility in water. The human body rapidly clears sodium benzoate by combining it with glycine to form hippuric acid which is then excreted. The metabolic pathway for this begins with the conversion of benzoate by butyrate-CoA ligase into an intermediate product, benzoyl-CoA, which is then metabolized by glycine N-acyltransferase into hippuric acid. == Uses == In the US, glycine is typically sold in two grades: United States Pharmacopeia (""USP""), and technical grade. USP grade sales account for approximately 80 to 85 percent of the U.S. market for glycine. If purity greater than the USP standard is needed, for example for intravenous injections, a more expensive pharmaceutical grade glycine can be used. Technical grade glycine, which may or may not meet USP grade standards, is sold at a lower price for use in industrial applications, e.g., as an agent in metal complexing and finishing. === Animal and human foods === Glycine is not widely used in foods for its nutritional value, except in infusions. Instead, glycine's role in food chemistry is as a flavorant. It is mildly sweet, and it counters the aftertaste of saccharine. It also has preservative properties, perhaps owing to its complexation to metal ions. Metal glycinate complexes, e.g. copper(II) glycinate are used as supplements for animal feeds. As of 1971, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ""no longer regards glycine and its salts as generally recognized as safe for use in human food"", and only permits food uses of glycine under certain conditions. Glycine has been researched for its potential to extend life. The proposed mechanisms of this effect are its ability to clear methionine from the body, and activating autophagy. === Chemical feedstock === Glycine is an intermediate in the synthesis of a variety of chemical products. It is used in the manufacture of the herbicides glyphosate, iprodione, glyphosine, imiprothrin, and eglinazine. It is used as an intermediate of antibiotics such as thiamphenicol. === Laboratory research === Glycine is a significant component of some solutions used in the SDS-PAGE method of protein analysis. It serves as a buffering agent, maintaining pH and preventing sample damage during electrophoresis. Glycine is also used to remove protein-labeling antibodies from Western blot membranes to enable the probing of numerous proteins of interest from SDS-PAGE gel. This allows more data to be drawn from the same specimen, increasing the reliability of the data, reducing the amount of sample processing, and number of samples required. This process is known as stripping. == Presence in space == The presence of glycine outside the Earth was confirmed in 2009, based on the analysis of samples that had been taken in 2004 by the NASA spacecraft Stardust from comet Wild 2 and subsequently returned to Earth. Glycine had previously been identified in the Murchison meteorite in 1970. The discovery of glycine in outer space bolstered the hypothesis of so-called soft-panspermia, which claims that the ""building blocks"" of life are widespread throughout the universe. In 2016, detection of glycine within Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko by the Rosetta spacecraft was announced. The detection of glycine outside the Solar System in the interstellar medium has been debated. == Evolution == Glycine is proposed to be defined by early genetic codes.

Many patients exhibit cognitive deficits, particularly during disease flare. The connection between colonic inflammation and neuroinflammation remains unclear and characterization of the neuroinflammatory phenotype in the brain during colitis is ill-defined. Transgenic mice expressing a bioluminescent reporter of active caspase-1 were treated with 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days to induce acute colitis, and colonic, systemic and neuroinflammation were assessed. In some experiments, mice were prophylactically treated with paquinimod (ABR-215757) to inhibit S100A9 inflammatory signaling. As a positive control for peripheral-induced neuroinflammation, mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Colonic, systemic and brain inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured by cytokine bead array (CBA) and Proteome profiler mouse cytokine array. Bioluminescence was quantified in the brain and caspase activation was confirmed by immunoblot. Immune cell infiltration into the CNS was measured by flow cytometry, while light sheet microscopy was used to monitor changes in resident microglia localization in intact brains during DSS or LPS-induced neuroinflammation. RNA sequencing was performed to identify transcriptomic changes occurring in the CNS of DSS-treated mice. Expression of inflammatory biomarkers were quantified in the brain and serum by qRT-PCR, ELISA and WB. DSS-treated mice exhibited clinical hallmarks of colitis, including weight loss, colonic shortening and inflammation in the colon. We also detected a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines in the serum and brain, as well as caspase and microglia activation in the brain of mice with ongoing colitis. RNA sequencing of brains isolated from DSS-treated mice revealed differential expression of genes involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This inflammatory phenotype was similar to the signature detected in LPS-treated mice, albeit less robust and transient, as inflammatory gene expression returned to baseline following cessation of DSS. Pharmacological inhibition of S100A9, one of the transcripts identified by RNA sequencing, attenuated colitis severity and systemic and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that local inflammation in the colon drives systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, and this can be ameliorated by inhibition of the S100 alarmin, S100A9. S100A9 is a damage-associated molecular pattern protein that may play an important role in the inflammatory response and fibrotic processes. Paquinimod is an immunomodulatory compound that prevents S100A9 activity. Its safety and pharmacokinetics have been confirmed in human clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the effects of paquinimod in preventing the development of lung fibrosis in vivo and examined the prognostic values of circulatory and lung S100A9 levels in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The expression and localisation of S100A9 and the preventive effect of S100A9 inhibition on fibrosis development were investigated in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In this retrospective cohort study, the S100A9 levels in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 76 and 55 patients with IPF, respectively, were examined for associations with patient survival. S100A9 expression was increased in the mouse lungs, especially in the inflammatory cells and fibrotic interstitium, after bleomycin administration. Treatment with paquinimod ameliorated fibrotic pathological changes and significantly reduced hydroxyproline content in the lung tissues of mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, we found that paquinimod reduced the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils in BALF and suppressed endothelial-mesenchymal transition in vivo. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox hazard proportion analyses revealed that high levels of S100A9 in the serum and BALF were significantly associated with poor prognoses in patients with IPF (Kaplan-Meier curve analysis: p=0.037 (serum) and 0.019 (BALF); multivariate Cox hazard proportion analysis: HR=3.88, 95% CI=1.06 to 14.21, p=0.041 (serum); HR=2.73, 95% CI=1.05 to 7.10, p=0.039 (BALF)). The present results indicate that increased S100A9 expression is associated with IPF progression and that the S100A9 inhibitor paquinimod is a potential treatment for IPF. Quinoline-3-carboxamides (Q compounds) are immunomodulatory compounds that have shown efficacy both in autoimmune disease and cancer. We have in here investigated the impact of one such compound, paquinimod, on the development of diabetes in the NOD mouse model for type I diabetes (T1D). In cohorts of NOD mice treated with paquinimod between weeks 10 to 20 of age and followed up until 40 weeks of age, we observed dose-dependent reduction in incidence of disease as well as delayed onset of disease. Further, in contrast to untreated controls, the majority of NOD mice treated from 15 weeks of age did not develop diabetes at 30 weeks of age. Importantly, these mice displayed significantly less insulitis, which correlated with selectively reduced number of splenic macrophages and splenic Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes at end point as compared to untreated controls. Collectively, these results demonstrate that paquinimod treatment can significantly inhibit progression of insulitis to T1D in the NOD mouse. We propose that the effect of paquinimod on disease progression may be related to the reduced number of these myeloid cell populations.

It is an ester of phosphoric acid with the nucleoside uridine. UMP consists of the phosphate group, the pentose sugar ribose, and the nucleobase uracil; hence, it is a ribonucleotide monophosphate. As a substituent or radical its name takes the form of the prefix uridylyl-. The deoxy form is abbreviated dUMP. Covalent attachment of UMP (e.g., to a protein such as adenylyltransferase) is called uridylylation (or sometimes uridylation). == Biosynthesis == Uridine monophosphate is formed from Orotidine 5'-monophosphate (orotidylic acid) in a decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme orotidylate decarboxylase. Uncatalyzed, the decarboxylation reaction is extremely slow (estimated to occur on average one time per 78 million years). Adequately catalyzed, the reaction takes place once per second, an increase of 1017-fold. In humans, the orotidylate decarboxylase function is carried out by the protein UMP synthase. Defective UMP synthase can result in orotic aciduria, a metabolic disorder. == Effects on animal intelligence == In a study, gerbils fed a combination of uridine monophosphate, choline, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were found to have significantly improved performance in running mazes over those not fed the supplements, implying an increase in cognitive function. == In foods == In brain research studies, uridine monophosphate is used as a convenient delivery compound for uridine.

Pantethine was discovered by Gene Brown, a PhD student at the time. Pantethine is two molecules of pantetheine linked by a disulfide bridge. Pantetheine is an intermediate in the production of coenzyme A by the body. Most vitamin B5 supplements are in the form of calcium pantothenate, a salt of pantothenic acid, with doses in the range of 5 to 10 mg/day. In contrast, pantethine is sold as a dietary supplement for lowering blood cholesterol and triglycerides at doses of 500 to 1200 mg/day. == Dietary supplement == Pantethine is available in the United States as a dietary supplement because of evidence for lowering elevated LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and raising HDL-cholesterol. In multiple clinical trials of patients with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol were decreased by an average of 12%, triglycerides decreased by 19%, and HDL cholesterol was increased by 9% in clinical trials with daily intakes ranging from 600 to 1200 mg/day. == Physiological effects == Although pantethine can serve as a precursor for generation of vitamin B5 and consumption of therapeutic amounts of pantethine results in higher circulating concentrations of vitamin B5, this is not thought to be the mechanism of action. Vitamin B5 requirements are on the order of 5 mg/day. High doses of vitamin B5 do not result in the lipid changes seen with pantethine. Two mechanisms of action are proposed for pantethine. In the first, pantethine serves as the precursor for synthesis of coenzyme A. CoA is involved in the transfer of acetyl groups, in some instances to attach to proteins closely associated with activating and deactivating genes. By this theory, either the genes responsible for cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis are suppressed or the genes governing the catabolism of compounds are turned on. In the second theory, pantethine is converted to two pantetheine molecules which are in turn metabolized to form two pantothenic acid and two cysteamine molecules. Cysteamine is theorized to bind to and thus inactivate sulfur-containing amino acids in liver enzymes involved in the production of cholesterol and triglycerides.

1410,"('Menaquinone-4', 'Vitamin k2(mk-4)', 'Menaquinone k4', 'Menatetrenone', 'Vitamin k2')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Vitamin K2 or menaquinone (MK) () is one of three types of vitamin K, the other two being vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and K3 (menadione). K2 is both a tissue and bacterial product (derived from vitamin K1 in both cases) and is usually found in animal products or fermented foods. The number n of isoprenyl units in their side chain differs and ranges from 4 to 13, hence vitamin K2 consists of various forms. It is indicated as a suffix (-n), e. g. MK-7 or MK-9. The most common in the human diet is the short-chain, water-soluble menatetrenone (MK-4), which is usually produced by tissue and/or bacterial conversion of vitamin K1, and is commonly found in animal products. It is known that production of MK-4 from dietary plant vitamin K1 can be accomplished by animal tissues alone, as it proceeds in germ-free rodents. However, at least one published study concluded that ""MK-4 present in food does not contribute to the vitamin K status as measured by serum vitamin K levels. MK-7, however significantly increases serum MK-7 levels and therefore may be of particular importance for extrahepatic tissues."" Long-chain menaquinones (longer than MK-4) include MK-7, MK-8 and MK-9 and are more predominant in fermented foods such as natto and cheonggukjang. Longer-chain menaquinones (MK-10 to MK-13) are produced by anaerobic bacteria in the colon, but they are not well absorbed at this level and have little physiological impact. When there are no isoprenyl side chain units, the remaining molecule is vitamin K3. This is usually made synthetically, and is used in animal feed. It was formerly given to premature infants, but due to inadvertent toxicity in the form of hemolytic anemia and jaundice, it is no longer used for this purpose. K3 is now known to be a circulating intermediate in the animal production of MK-4. == Description == Vitamin K2, the main storage form in animals, has several subtypes, which differ in isoprenoid chain length. These vitamin K2 homologues are called menaquinones, and are characterized by the number of isoprenoid residues in their side chains. Menaquinones are abbreviated MK-n, where M stands for menaquinone, the K stands for vitamin K, and the n represents the number of isoprenoid side chain residues. For example, menaquinone-4 (abbreviated MK-4) has four isoprene residues in its side chain. Menaquinone-4 (also known as menatetrenone from its four isoprene residues) is the most common type of vitamin K2 in animal products since MK-4 is normally synthesized from vitamin K1 in certain animal tissues (arterial walls, pancreas, and testes) by replacement of the phytyl tail with an unsaturated geranylgeranyl tail containing four isoprene units, thus yielding menaquinone-4 which is water soluble in nature. This homolog of vitamin K2 may have enzyme functions distinct from those of vitamin K1. MK-7 and other long-chain menaquinones are different from MK-4 in that they are not produced by human tissue. MK-7 may be converted from phylloquinone (K1) in the colon by Escherichia coli bacteria. However, these menaquinones synthesized by bacteria in the gut appear to contribute minimally to overall vitamin K status. MK-4 and MK-7 are both found in the United States in dietary supplements for bone health. All K vitamins are similar in structure: they share a ""quinone"" ring, but differ in the length and degree of saturation of the carbon tail and the number of repeating isoprene units in the ""side chain"". The number of repeating units is indicated in the name of the particular menaquinone (e.g., MK-4 means that four isoprene units are repeated in the carbon tail). The chain length influences lipid solubility and thus transport to different target tissues. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action of vitamin K2 is similar to vitamin K1. K vitamins were first recognized as a factor required for coagulation, but the functions performed by this vitamin group were revealed to be much more complex. K vitamins play an essential role as cofactor for the enzyme γ-glutamyl carboxylase, which is involved in vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of the gla domain in ""gla proteins"" (i.e., in conversion of peptide-bound glutamic acid (glu) to γ-carboxy glutamic acid (Gla) in these proteins). Carboxylation of these vitamin K-dependent Gla-proteins, besides being essential for the function of the protein, is also an important vitamin recovery mechanism since it serves as a recycling pathway to recover vitamin K from its epoxide metabolite (KO) for reuse in carboxylation. Several human Gla-containing proteins synthesized in several different types of tissue have been discovered: Coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X), as well as anticoagulation proteins (C, S, Z). These Gla-proteins are synthesized in the liver and play an important role in blood homeostasis. Osteocalcin. This non-collagenous protein is secreted by osteoblasts and plays an essential role in the formation of mineral in bone. Matrix gla protein (MGP). This calcification inhibitory protein is found in numerous body tissues, but its role is most pronounced in cartilage and in arterial vessel walls. Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6). GAS6 is secreted by leucocytes and endothelial cells in response to injury and helps in cell survival, proliferation, migration, and adhesion. Proline-rich Gla-proteins (PRGP), transmembrane Gla-proteins (TMG), Gla-rich protein (GRP) and periostin. Their precise functions are still unknown. == Health effects == There is inconclusive clinical data whether specific vitamin K2 supplementation confers any beneficial effects compared to vitamin K1 which is the most common form in supplements. In vitro studies show certain cellular effects of vitamin K2 in bone which are not observed with the K1 variant (including bone marrow stem cell (BMSC) proliferation, and stimulation of osteoblast differentiation). The effects of vitamin K2 appear to be accentuated when combined with vitamin D and in the setting of osteoporosis. Research suggests that vitamin K2 (Menaquinone 7, MK-7]) may reduce the rate and severity of night time leg cramps. == Absorption profile == Vitamin K is absorbed along with dietary fat from the small intestine and transported by chylomicrons in the circulation. Most of vitamin K1 is carried by triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and rapidly cleared by the liver; only a small amount is released into the circulation and carried by LDL-C and HDL-C. MK-4 is carried by the same lipoproteins (TRL, LDL-C, and HDL-C) and cleared fast as well. The long-chain menaquinones are absorbed in the same way as vitamin K1 and MK-4 but are efficiently redistributed by the liver in predominantly LDL-C (VLDL-C). Since LDL-C has a long half-life in the circulation, these menaquinones can circulate for extended times resulting in higher bioavailability for extra-hepatic tissues as compared to vitamin K1 and MK-4. Accumulation of vitamin K in extra-hepatic tissues has direct relevance to vitamin K functions not related to hemostasis. == Dietary intake in humans == The European Food Safety Authority (EU) and the US Institute of Medicine, on reviewing existing evidence, have decided there is insufficient evidence to publish a dietary reference value for vitamin K or for K2. They have, however, published an Adequate Intake (AI) for vitamin K, but no value specifically for K2. Parts of the scientific literature, dating back to 1998, suggest that the AI values are based only on the hepatic requirements (i.e. related to the liver). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the majority of the Western population exhibits a substantial fraction of undercarboxylated extra-hepatic proteins. Thus, complete activation of coagulation factors is satisfied, but there does not seem to be enough vitamin K2 for the carboxylation of osteocalcin in bone and MGP in the vascular system. There is no known toxicity associated with high doses of menaquinones (vitamin K2). Unlike the other fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin K is not stored in any significant quantity in the liver. All data available as of 2017 demonstrate that vitamin K has no adverse effects in healthy subjects. The recommendations for the daily intake of vitamin K, as issued recently by the US Institute of Medicine, also acknowledge the wide safety margin of vitamin K: ""a search of the literature revealed no evidence of toxicity associated with the intake of either K1 or K2"". Animal models involving rats, if generalisable to humans, show that MK-7 is well tolerated. == Dietary sources == Apart from animal livers, the richest dietary source of menaquinones are fermented foods (from bacteria, not molds or yeasts); sources include cheeses consumed in Western diets (e.g., containing MK-9, MK-10, and MK-11) and fermented soybean products (e.g., in traditional nattō consumed in Japan, containing MK-7 and MK-8). (Here and following it is noteworthy that most food assays measure only fully unsaturated menaquinones.) MK-4 is synthesized by animal tissues and is found in meat, eggs, and dairy products. Cheeses have been found to contain MK-8 at 10–20 μg per 100 g and MK-9 at 35–55 μg per 100 g. In one report, no substantial differences in MK-4 levels were observed between wild game, free-range animals, and factory farm animals. In addition to its animal origins, menaquinones are synthesized by bacteria during fermentation and so, as stated, are found in most fermented cheese and soybean products. As of 2001, the richest known source of natural K2 was nattō fermented using the nattō strain of Bacillus subtilis, which is reportedly a good source of long-chain MK-7. In nattō, MK-4 is absent as a form of vitamin K, and in cheeses it is present among the vitamins K only in low proportions. Still it is unknown whether B. subtilis will produce K2 using other legumes (e.g., chickpeas, or lentils) or even B. subtilis fermented oatmeal. According to Rebecca Rocchi et al., 2024, creating natto by using Bacillus subtilis to ferment boiled red lentils, chickpeas, or green peas produced greater amounts of MK-7 than creating natto by using Bacillus subtilis to ferment boiled soybeans, lupins, or brown beans. Food frequency questionnaire-derived estimates of relative intakes of vitamins K in one northern European country suggest that for that population, about 90% of total vitamin K intakes are provided by K1, about 7.5% by MK-5 through MK-9 and about 2.5% by MK-4; the intense smell and strong taste of nattō appear to make this soya food a less attractive source of K2 for Western tastes. Supplement companies sell nattō extract reportedly standardized with regard to K2 content, in capsule form. === Analysis of foods === Notes: † – The reported amounts in comparable milk from the USA and the Netherlands differ by more than 40 times, so these numbers should be considered suspect. == Anticoagulants == Recent studies found a clear association between long-term oral (or intravenous) anticoagulant treatment (OAC) and reduced bone quality due to reduction of active osteocalcin. OAC might lead to an increased incidence of fractures, reduced bone mineral density or content, osteopenia, and increased serum levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin. Furthermore, OAC is often linked to undesired soft-tissue calcification in both children and adults. This process has been shown to be dependent upon the action of K vitamins. Vitamin K deficiency results in undercarboxylation of MGP. Also in humans on OAC treatment, two-fold more arterial calcification was found as compared to patients not receiving vitamin K antagonists. Among consequences of anticoagulant treatment: increased aortic wall stiffness, coronary insufficiency, ischemia, and even heart failure. Arterial calcification might also contribute to systolic hypertension and ventricular hypertrophy. Anticoagulant therapy is usually instituted to avoid life-threatening diseases, and high vitamin K intake interferes with anticoagulant effects. Patients on warfarin (Coumadin) or being treated with other vitamin K antagonists are therefore advised not to consume diets rich in K vitamins. == In other organisms == Many bacteria synthesize menaquinones from chorismic acid. They use it as a part of the electron transport chain, playing a similar role as other quinones such as ubiquinone. Oxygen, heme, and menaquinones are needed for many species of lactic acid bacteria to conduct respiration. Variations in biosynthetic pathways mean that bacteria also produce analogues of vitamin K2. For example, MK9(II-H), which replaces the second geranylgeranyl unit with a saturated phytyl, is produced by Mycobacterium phlei. There also exists a possibility of cis–trans isomerism due to the double bonds present. In M. phlei, the 3'-methyl-cis MK9(II-H) form seems to be more biologically active than trans MK9(II-H). However, with human enzymes, the naturally abundant trans form is more efficient. One hydrogenated MK that sees relevant amounts of human consumption is MK-9(4H), found in cheese fermented by Propionibacterium freudenreichii. This variation has the second and third units replaced with phytyl. == See also == Vitamin K Vitamin K1 Vitamin K3 == References ==",Vitamin k2,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.5886825919151306), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.25195688009262085), (' END', -0.18919280171394348), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -5.5577775128767826e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.3133437931537628), (' MED', -0.47517192363739014), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.045172449201345444), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0005558376433327794), ('ĠEND', -0.10368954390287399), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.3132818639278412), ('ĠMED', -0.0037841631565243006), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019363479223102331)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.6931489109992981), (' MED', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K2?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Vitamin K2', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K2?utm_source=openai')])"
1411,"('Amantadine (hydrochloride)', 'Amantadine', 'Adamantan-1-amine', 'Adamantanamine', 'Adamantylamine')",Medical,"Amantadine, sold under the brand name Gocovri among others, is a medication used to treat dyskinesia associated with parkinsonism and influenza caused by type A influenzavirus, though its use for the latter is no longer recommended because of widespread drug resistance. It is also used for a variety of other uses. The drug is taken by mouth. Amantadine has a mild side-effect profile. Common neurological side effects include drowsiness, lightheadedness, dizziness, and confusion. Because of its effects on the central nervous system (CNS), it should be combined cautiously with additional CNS stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Given that it is cleared by the kidneys, amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end-stage kidney disease. Due to its anticholinergic effects, it should be taken with caution by those with enlarged prostates or glaucoma. The pharmacology of amantadine is complex. It acts as a sigma σ1 receptor agonist, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor negative allosteric modulator, dopaminergic agent, and weak NMDA receptor antagonist, among other actions. The precise mechanism of action of its therapeutic effects in the treatment of CNS disorders is unclear. The antiviral mechanism of action is inhibition of the influenza virus A M2 proton channel, which prevents endosomal escape (i.e., the release of viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm). Amantadine is an adamantane derivative and is related to memantine and rimantadine. Amantadine was first used for the treatment of influenza A. After its antiviral properties were initially reported in 1963, amantadine received approval for prophylaxis against the influenza virus A in 1966. In 1968, its antiparkinsonian effects were serendipitously discovered. In 1973, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 2020, the extended-release formulation was approved for use in the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. == Medical uses == Amantadine was initially developed to prevent replication of the influenza A virus. Its main clinical use today is treatment of Parkinson's disease. Other uses include treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects, motor fluctuations during levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and autistic spectrum disorders. === Parkinson's disease === Amantadine is used to treat Parkinson's disease-related dyskinesia and drug-induced parkinsonism syndromes. Amantadine may be used alone or in combination with another anti-Parkinson's or anticholinergic drug. The specific symptoms targeted by amantadine therapy are dyskinesia and rigidity. The extended release amantadine formulation is commonly used to treat dyskinesias in people receiving levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease. A 2003 Cochrane review had concluded evidence was insufficient to prove the safety or efficacy of amantadine to treat dyskinesia. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported amantadine is not effective as a stand-alone parkinsonian therapy, but recommended it could be used in combination therapy with levodopa. === Influenza A === Amantadine is not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A in the United States. Amantadine has no effect preventing or treating influenza B infections. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found 100% of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples were resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) during the 2008–2009 flu season. The U.S. CDC guidelines recommend only neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza treatment and prophylaxis. The CDC recommends against amantadine and rimantadine to treat influenza A infections. Similarly, the 2011 WHO virology report showed all tested H1N1 influenza A viruses were resistant to amantadine. WHO guidelines recommend against use of M2 inhibitors for influenza A. The continued high rate of resistance observed in laboratory testing of influenza A has reduced the priority of M2 resistance testing. A 2014 Cochrane review did not find evidence for efficacy or safety of amantadine used for the prevention or treatment of influenza A. === Extrapyramidal symptoms === An extended-release formulation of amantadine is used to treat levodopa-induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease. The WHO recommends the use of amantadine as a combination therapy to reduce levodopa side effects. === Off-label uses === ==== Fatigue in multiple sclerosis ==== A 2007 Cochrane literature review concluded that no overall evidence supports the use of amantadine in treating fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). A follow-up 2012 Cochrane review stated that some amantadine-induced improvement in fatigue may occur in some people with MS. Despite multiple control trials that have also demonstrated improvements in subjective and objective ratings of fatigue, no final conclusion has been drawn regarding its effectiveness. Consensus guidelines from the German Multiple Sclerosis Society (GMSS) in 2006 state that amantadine produces moderate improvement in subjective fatigue, problem solving, memory, and concentration. Thus, in 2006, GMSS guidelines recommended the use of amantadine in MS-related fatigue. In the UK, NICE recommends considering amantadine for MS fatigue. ==== Disorders of consciousness ==== Disorders of consciousness (DoC) include coma, vegetative state (VS), and minimally conscious state (MCS). Amantadine has been shown to increase the rate of emergence from a MCS, defined by consistent demonstration of interactive communication and functional objective use. In traumatic brain injury patients in the intensive care unit, amantadine has also been shown in various randomized control trials to increase the rate of functional recovery and arousal, particularly in the time period immediately following an injury. Also, significantly improved consciousness has been reported in patients treated for nontraumatic cases of DoC, such as in the case of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, and hypoxic encephalopathy. In 2018, the American Academy of Neurology updated treatment guidelines on the use of amantadine for patients with prolonged DoC, recommending the use of amantadine (100–200 mg b.i.d.) for adults with DoC 4 to 16 weeks after injury to support early functional recovery and reduce disability. ==== Brain injury recovery ==== In various studies, amantadine and memantine have been shown to accelerate the rate of recovery from a brain injury. The time-limited window following a brain injury is characterized by neuroplasticity, or the capacity of neurons in the brain to adapt and compensate after injury. Thus, physiatrists often start patients on amantadine as soon as impairments are recognized. Some case reports also show improved functional recovery with amantadine treatment occurring years after the initial brain injury. Evidence is insufficient to determine if the functional gains are a result of effects through the dopamine or norepinephrine pathways. Some patients may benefit from direct dopamine stimulation with amantadine, while others may benefit more from other stimulants that act more on the norepinephrine pathway, such as methylphenidate. If treatment with amantadine improves long-term outcomes or simply accelerates recovery is unclear. Nonetheless, amantadine-induced acceleration of recovery reduces the burden of disability, lessens health-care costs, and minimizes psychosocial stressors in patients. == Contraindications == Amantadine is contraindicated in persons with end-stage kidney disease, as the drug is renally cleared. Amantadine may have anticholinergic side effects. Thus, patients with an enlarged prostate or glaucoma should use with caution. Live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated while taking amantadine. Amantadine might inhibit viral replication and reduce the efficacy of administered vaccines. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding amantadine for two weeks prior to vaccine administration and 48 hours afterward. == Side effects == Amantadine is generally well tolerated and has a mild side effect profile. === Neurological === Side effects include drowsiness (especially while driving), lightheadedness, falls, and dizziness. Patients on amantadine should avoid combination with other CNS-depressing agents, such as alcohol. Excessive alcohol usage may increase the potential for CNS effects such as dizziness, confusion, and light-headedness. Rare severe adverse effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, depression, convulsions, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. It has also been associated with disinhibited actions (gambling, sexual activity, spending, other addictions) and diminished control over compulsions. Amantadine may cause anxiety, feeling overexcited, hallucinations, and nightmares. === Cardiovascular === Amantadine may cause orthostatic hypotension, syncope, and peripheral edema. === Gastrointestinal === Amantadine has also been associated with dry mouth and constipation. === Skin === Rare cases of skin rashes, such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome and livedo reticularis have also been reported in patients treated with amantadine. === Kidney === Amantadine inhibits the kidney's active-transport removal and transfer of creatinine from blood to urine, which normally occurs in the proximal tubules of the nephrons. The active-transport removal mechanism accounts for about 15% of creatinine clearance, so amantadine may increase serum creatinine concentrations 15% above normal levels and give the false impression of mild kidney disease in patients whose kidneys are actually undamaged (because kidney function is often assessed by measuring the concentration of creatinine in blood.) Also, if the patient does have kidney disease, amantadine may cause it to appear as much as 15% worse than it actually is. === Pregnancy and lactation === Amantadine is USFDA category C for pregnancy. Teratogenic effects have been observed in humans (case reports) and animal reproduction studies. Amantadine may also be present in breast milk and negatively alter breast milk production or excretion. The decision to breastfeed during amantadine therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of the drug to the mother. == Interactions == Amantadine may affect the CNS because of its dopaminergic and anticholinergic properties. The mechanisms of action are not fully known. Because of the CNS effects, caution is required when prescribing additional CNS stimulants or anticholinergic drugs. Thus, concurrent use of alcohol with amantadine is not recommended because of enhanced CNS depressant effects. In addition, antidopaminergic drugs such as metoclopramide and typical antipsychotics should be avoided. These interactions are likely related to opposing dopaminergic mechanisms of action, which inhibits amantadine's anti-Parkinson effects. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === ==== Central nervous system disorders ==== The mechanism of action of the antiparkinsonian effects of amantadine is poorly understood. The effects of amantadine in Parkinson's disease were originally assumed to be anticholinergic or dopaminergic, but the situation soon proved more complicated than this. The pharmacodynamics of amantadine are complex, and it interacts with many different biological targets at a variety of concentrations and hence potencies. The drug is a weak antagonist of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, increases dopamine release, and blocks dopamine reuptake. It is a negative allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically the α4β2 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In 1993, amantadine was found to bind to the sigma σ1 receptor with relatively high affinity (Ki = 20.25 μM). In 2004, it was discovered that amantadine and memantine bind to and act as agonists of the sigma σ1 receptor (Ki = 7.44 μM and 2.60 μM, respectively) and that activation of the σ1 receptor is potentially involved in the dopaminergic effects of amantadine at therapeutically relevant concentrations. σ1 receptor activation is one of amantadine's more potent actions. σ1 receptor agonists enhance tyrosine hydroxylase activity, modulate NMDA-stimulated dopamine release, increase dopamine release in the striatum in vivo, and decrease dopamine reuptake. As such, σ1 receptor activation may be involved in the antiparkinsonian and other central nervous system effects of amantadine. Binding of amantadine to the NMDA receptor was first reported in 1989, and antagonism of the receptor was first reported in 1991. Despite some reports, the NMDA receptor antagonism of amantadine is probably not its primary mechanism of action. It occurs at relatively high concentrations and many of the effects of amantadine are different from those of NMDA receptor antagonists. Some of its effects, such as enhancement of dopamine release in the striatum, are even reversed by NMDA receptor antagonists, but NMDA receptor antagonism could still contribute to the effects of amantadine. Although some publications have reported that amantadine inhibits monoamine oxidase, the drug probably does not actually inhibit this enzyme. Amantadine shows amphetamine-like psychostimulant effects (e.g., stimulation of locomotor activity) in animals at sufficiently high doses. It has been found to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine and to induce the release of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The concentrations needed for these effects, though, are very high and may not be therapeutically relevant. It is about 1/25th to 1/50th as potent as amphetamines. Amantadine has been found to increase dopamine levels in the striatum. It does not act as a monoaminergic activity enhancer. Amantadine is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, for example of PDE1. Amantadine has been found to increase aromatic amino acid decarboxylase expression. This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of dopamine from L-DOPA. An imaging study in humans found that amantadine increased AADC activity in the striatum by up to 27%. Various additional actions of amantadine have been described. ==== Influenza ==== The mechanisms for amantadine's antiviral and antiparkinsonian effects are unrelated. Amantadine targets the influenza A M2 ion channel protein. The M2 protein's function is to allow the intracellular virus to replicate (M2 also functions as a proton channel for hydrogen ions to cross into the vesicle), and exocytose newly formed viral proteins to the extracellular space (viral shedding). By blocking the M2 channel, the virus is unable to replicate because of impaired replication, protein synthesis, and exocytosis. Amantadine and rimantadine function in a mechanistically identical fashion, entering the barrel of the tetrameric M2 channel and blocking pore function—i.e., proton translocation. Resistance to the drug class is a consequence of mutations to the pore-lining amino acid residues of the channel, preventing both amantadine and rimantadine from binding and inhibiting the channel in their usual way. === Pharmacokinetics === Amantadine is well-absorbed orally. The onset of action is usually within 48 hours when used for parkinsonian syndromes, including dyskinesia. As plasma concentrations of amantadine increase, the risk for toxicity increases. Half-life elimination averages eight days in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Amantadine is only minimally removed by hemodialysis. Amantadine is metabolized to a small extent (5–15%) by acetylation. It is mainly excreted (90%) unchanged in urine by kidney excretion. == Chemistry == Amantadine is the organic compound 1-adamantylamine or 1-aminoadamantane, which consists of an adamantane backbone with an amino group substituted at one of the four tertiary carbons. Rimantadine is a closely related adamantane derivative with similar biological properties; both target the M2 proton channel of influenza A virus. Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) is structurally related to other adamantanes including adapromine (1-(adamantan-1-yl)propan-1-amine), bromantane (N-(4-bromophenyl)adamantan-2-amine), memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane), and rimantadine (1-(1-aminoethyl)adamantane), among others. == History == === Influenza A === Antiviral properties were first reported in 1963 at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. In this amantadine trial study, volunteer college students were exposed to a viral challenge. The group who received amantadine (100 milligrams 18 hours before viral challenge) had less Asia influenza infections than the placebo group. Amantadine received approval for the treatment of influenza virus A in adults in 1976. It was first used in West Germany in 1966. Amantadine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 1968, as a prophylactic agent against Asian (H2N2) influenza and received approval for prophylactic use for influenza A in 1976. During the 1980 influenza A epidemic, the first amantadine-resistance influenza viruses were reported. The frequency of amantadine resistance among influenza A (H3N2) viruses from 1991 and 1995 was as low as 0.8%. In 2004, the resistance frequency increased to 12.3%. A year later, resistance increase significantly to 96%, 72%, and 14.5% in China, South Korea, and the United States, respectively. By 2006, 90.6% of H3N2 strains and 15.6% of H1N1 were amantadine resistant. A majority of the amantadine-resistant H3N2 isolates (98.2%) was found to contain an S31N mutation in the M2 transmembrane domain that confers resistance to amantadine. Currently, adamantane resistance is high among circulating influenza A viruses. Thus, they are no longer recommended for treatment of influenza A. === Parkinson's disease === An incidental finding in 1969 prompted investigations about amantadine's effectiveness for treating symptoms of Parkinson's disease. A woman with Parkinson's disease was prescribed amantadine to treat her influenza infection and reported her cogwheel rigidity and tremors improved. She also reported that her symptoms worsened after she finished the course of amantadine. The published case report was not initially corroborated by any other instances by the medical literature or manufacturer data. A team of researchers looked at a group of 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and gave them amantadine. Seven of them showed improvement, which was convincing evidence for the need of a clinical trial, which included 163 patients with Parkinson's disease; 66% experienced subjective or objective reduction of symptoms with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Additional studies followed patients for greater lengths of time and in different combinations of neurological drugs. It was found to be a safe drug that could be used over long periods of time with few side effects as monotherapy or in combination with L-dopa or anticholinergic drugs. By April 1973, the U.S. FDA approved amantadine for use in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In 2017, the U.S. FDA approved the use of amantadine in an extended-release formulation for the treatment of dyskinesia, an adverse effect of levodopa in people with Parkinson's disease. == Society and culture == === Names === Brand names of amantadine include Gocovri, Symadine, and Symmetrel. === Recreational use === Recreational use of amantadine at supratherapeutic doses has been reported. It is a weak NMDA receptor antagonist and is reported to produce dissociative and phencyclidine-like effects in animals and humans at sufficiently high doses. However, the very long duration of action of amantadine (>40 hours) has likely limited its misuse potential. Recreational use of the related drug memantine has similarly been reported. === Veterinary misuse === In 2005, Chinese poultry farmers were reported to have used amantadine to protect birds against avian influenza. In Western countries and according to international livestock regulations, amantadine is approved only for use in humans. Chickens in China have received an estimated 2.6 billion doses of amantadine. Avian flu (H5N1) strains in China and southeast Asia are now resistant to amantadine, although strains circulating elsewhere still seem to be sensitive. If amantadine-resistant strains of the virus spread, the drugs of choice in an avian flu outbreak will probably be restricted to neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which block the action of viral neuraminidase enzyme on the surface of influenza virus particles. Increasing incidence of oseltamivir resistance in circulating influenza strains (e.g., H1N1) exists, highlighting the need for new anti-influenza therapies. In September 2015, the U.S. FDA announced the recall of Dingo Chip Twists ""Chicken in the Middle"" dog treats because the product has the potential to be contaminated with amantadine. == Research == === Depression === Interest in and study of amantadine in the treatment of depression has arisen. A 2017 systematic review of off-label augmentation for treatment of unipolar depression found two open-label studies of amantadine for augmenting imipramine and found that it was effective. However, the quality of evidence was very low and no conclusions could be drawn about its effectiveness. A 2022 systematic review of randomized controlled trials of glutamatergic agents for treatment-resistant depression identified one clinical trial of amantadine for this use. Amantadine was found to be effective in treating depressive symptoms in the trial. The mechanism of action of amantadine in the treatment of depression is unclear, but various mechanisms have been postulated.

A 2010 randomized clinical trial showed similar improvements in ADHD symptoms in children treated with amantadine as in those treated with methylphenidate, with less frequent side effects. A 2021 retrospective study showed that amantadine may serve as an effective adjunct to stimulants for ADHD-related symptoms and appears to be a safer alternative to second- or third-generation antipsychotics. === COVID-19 === Amantadine has been studied in the treatment of COVID-19. == References == == External links ==",Adamantylamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3425219549390022e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0055541242472827435), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04863320291042328)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.6931471824645996), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1412,"('Vapendavir (diphosphate)', 'Vapendavir', 'Vapendavir [inn]')",Medical," Vapendavir is a rhino/enterovirus inhibitor that targets a hydrophobic pocket in the viral capsid preventing the virus from entering the cell. We set out to study and compare the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vapendavir among clinically relevant Picornavirus species. To this end in vitro resistance selection of drug-resistant isolates was applied in rhinovirus 2 and 14, enterovirus-D68 and Poliovirus 1 Sabin. Mutations in the drug-binding pocket in VP1 (C199R/Y in hRV14; I194F in PV1; M252L and A156T in EV-D68), typical for this class of compounds, were identified. Interestingly, we also observed mutations located outside the pocket (K167E in EV-D68 and G149C in hRV2) that contribute to the resistant phenotype. Remarkably, the G149C substitution rendered the replication of human rhinovirus 2 dependent on the presence of vapendavir. Our data suggest that the binding of vapendavir to the capsid of the G149C isolate may be required to stabilize the viral particle and to allow efficient dissemination of the virus. We observed the dependency of the G149C isolate on other compounds of this class, suggesting that this phenotype is common for capsid binders. In addition the VP1 region containing the G149C substitution has not been associated with antiviral resistance before. Our results demonstrate that the phenotype and genotype of clinically relevant vapendavir-resistant picornavirus species is more complex than generally believed. Antivirals against enterovirus 71 (EV71) are urgently needed. We demonstrate that the novel enteroviral protease inhibitor (PI) SG85 and capsid binder (CB) vapendavir efficiently inhibit the in vitro replication of 21 EV71 strains/isolates that are representative of the different genogroups A, B, and C. The PI rupintrivir, the CB pirodavir, and the host-targeting compound enviroxime, which were included as reference compounds, also inhibited the replication of all isolates. Remarkably, the CB compound pleconaril was devoid of any anti-EV71 activity. An in silico docking study revealed that pleconaril-unlike vapendavir and pirodavir-lacks essential binding interactions with the viral capsid. Vapendavir and SG85 (or analogues) should be further explored for the treatment of EV71 infections.

The four structures were optimized in gas and aqueous solution by using the hybrid B3LYP/6-31G* method. The self-consistent force field (SCRF) calculations together with the polarized continuum (PCM) model were used to study the systems in solution while the solvation energies were computed using the solvation model (SM). The calculated structural and vibrational properties could explain the anomerization of maltose in solution, as was reported in the literature while the natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses for those species support clearly the mutarotation equilibria between both forms in solution, evidencing the anhydrous forms the equilibrium: α (45%) ⇔ β (55%), similar to that experimentally reported at 20 °C. Bands of all the species observed in the vibrational spectra support the presence of the anomeric species of maltose in solution while the presence of dimeric species justify the intense IR bands observed in the higher wavenumbers region. The similar gap values for maltose and lactose probably justify that these sugars are reducing sugars while the high values in sucrose could explain that it is a non-reducing sugar. On the other hand, the sweeteners cyclamate and saccharine are most reactive in solution than the sugars maltose, lactose and sucrose, as expected due to their ionic characteristics. The predicted vibrational spectra for the four species of maltose show reasonable concordances with the corresponding experimental ones. The f(δC-O-C) force constants of the glycosidic bonds follow the tendency: maltose > lactose > sucrose. The structure of the title compound, C(13)H(24)O(10).H(2)O, is stabilized by hydrogen bonds situated adjacent to the glycoside linkage. A direct intramolecular hydrogen bond is present between the fucopyranosyl ring O atom and a glucopyranoside OH group, and a bridging water molecule mediates a hydrogen-bond-based interaction from a fucopyranosyl OH group to the methoxy O atom. The conformation of the disaccharide is described by the glycosidic torsion angles phi(H) = -41 degrees and psi(H) = -2 degrees .

When extruded at 150 and 160 °C, α-lactose monohydrate converted completely to α-lactose anhydrous that was mostly crystalline and only partially amorphous; the latter was indicated by glass transition observed in DSC scans. Tabletability of the material thus obtained by TSE was superior to anhydrous lactose available commercially or produced by hot air oven drying at 160 °C. The superior tabletability was attributed to the partial conversion to amorphous lactose. When samples of anhydrous lactose powders obtained by TSE or oven drying were exposed to 25 °C/60% RH and 40 °C/75% RH, they reverted to the monohydrate with decreased tabletability. However, when anhydrous lactose powders produced by TSE were first compressed into tablets with high tensile strength and then exposed to similar stability testing conditions, there was no decrease in the tensile strength of tablets. Rather, it further increased, possibly due to the interaction of the amorphous fraction of lactose with moisture. Thus, TSE not only increased tabletability of α-lactose monohydrate, the compressed tablets remained intact and hard during shelf-life. These results demonstrate that a new modified anhydrous lactose may be produced by TSE that has better tabletability and superior physical stability than α-lactose monohydrate and the commercially available anhydrous lactose. Lactose is an important additive because of its food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic applications. Among lactose polymorphs, anhydrous β-lactose stands out due to its thermodynamic stability. Thus, a simple method to produce the inter-conversion from monohydrate α-lactose to anhydrous β-lactose was investigated employing a methanolic solution and different reaction variables (catalyst type, temperature, and stirring). Pure β-lactose powders were synthesized in short reaction time (2-16 h), with a moderate temperature (reflux: 65 °C), and low concentration (0.014 M) of catalysts (NaOH and KOH). The SEM analysis revealed a change in the morphology from fine needles to tomahawk shape, which is dependent on the content of β-lactose. The products were appropriately characterized using common analytic procedures (XRD, FTIR, and MDSC). In addition, an exhaustive discussion of the obtained results is provided. Finally, it seems to be the first work, where the inter-conversion to pure β-lactose is reported successfully. The relationships between the physicochemical properties and functionality in dry powder inhaler (DPI) performance was investigated for inhalation grade anhydrous lactose and compared to monohydrate grades. The excipients were characterised using a range of techniques including particle size analysis, moisture sorption and powder rheometry. The inhalation anhydrous lactose grades were readily characterisable. The aerosolisation performance of capsule based DPI formulations containing budesonide (200microg) and different grades of lactose evaluated using inertial impaction measurements produced fine particle doses of budesonide ranging from 24 to 49microg. There were no apparent relationships between aerosolisation performance and excipient characteristics, such as particle size and powder density. However, formulations containing lactose grades which exhibit higher powder fluidisation energy values resulted in higher fine particle doses of budesonide.","Lactose, anhydrous",PUBMED,"('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.693996787071228), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -0.04937763139605522), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0009119403548538685), (' PERSONAL', -3.547789674485102e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.08785378187894821), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0022104373201727867), ('ĠMED', -0.1678910106420517), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.12697088718414307), ('ĠPERSON', -0.02996469847857952), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('ĠCARE', -6.556489552167477e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0040994188748300076)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD,MEDICAL; ', [])"

Ketoprofen topical patches are being used for treatment of musculoskeletal pain. Ketoprofen can also be used for treatment of some pain, especially nerve pain such as sciatica, postherpetic neuralgia and referred pain for radiculopathy, in the form of a cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain ketamine and lidocaine, along with other agents which may be useful, such as cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, acyclovir, gabapentin, orphenadrine and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment.

1418,"('Acetamide', 'Ethanamide', 'Acetic acid amide', 'Methanecarboxamide', 'Acetimidic acid')","Medical, Industrial","Acetamide (systematic name: ethanamide) is an organic compound with the formula CH3CONH2. It is an amide derived from ammonia and acetic acid. It finds some use as a plasticizer and as an industrial solvent. The related compound N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) is more widely used, but it is not prepared from acetamide. Acetamide can be considered an intermediate between acetone, which has two methyl (CH3) groups either side of the carbonyl (CO), and urea which has two amide (NH2) groups in those locations. Acetamide is also a naturally occurring mineral with the IMA symbol: Ace. == Production == === Laboratory scale === Acetamide can be produced in the laboratory from ammonium acetate by dehydration: [NH4][CH3CO2] → CH3C(O)NH2 + H2O Alternatively acetamide can be obtained in excellent yield via ammonolysis of acetylacetone under conditions commonly used in reductive amination. It can also be made from anhydrous acetic acid, acetonitrile and very well dried hydrogen chloride gas, using an ice bath, alongside more valuable reagent acetyl chloride. Yield is typically low (up to 35%), and the acetamide made this way is generated as a salt with HCl. === Industrial scale === In a similar fashion to some laboratory methods, acetamide is produced by dehydrating ammonium acetate or via the hydration of acetonitrile, a byproduct of the production of acrylonitrile: CH3CN + H2O → CH3C(O)NH2 == Uses == Acetamide is used as a plasticizer and an industrial solvent. Molten acetamide is good solvent with a broad range of applicability. Notably, its dielectric constant is higher than most organic solvents, allowing it to dissolve inorganic compounds with solubilities closely analogous to that of water. Acetamide has uses in electrochemistry and the organic synthesis of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and antioxidants for plastics. It is a precursor to thioacetamide. == Occurrence == Acetamide has been detected near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. This finding is potentially significant because acetamide has an amide bond, similar to the essential bond between amino acids in proteins. This finding lends support to the theory that organic molecules that can lead to life (as we know it on Earth) can form in space. On 30 July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the Philae lander on comet 67/P's surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which – acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate, and propionaldehyde – were seen for the first time on a comet. In addition, acetamide is found infrequently on burning coal dumps, as a mineral of the same name. == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0233 ""Acetamide"".

Ninety women, who were scheduled for LM due to symptomatic uterine myomas, were randomly divided into three groups. Twenty-four women were intramyometrially injected with 12 IU diluted vasopressin (vasopressin group), 30 cases received a deep intramuscular injection of 250 µg carboprost tromethamine 30 min prior to myomectomy (carboprost group), and 36 cases received an intramuscular injection of 250 µg carboprost tromethamine followed by a 20 IU oxytocin intravenous infusion at a rate of 120 mU/min during the procedure (carboprost plus oxytocin group). The procedure time, amount of hemorrhage, postoperative reduction in hemoglobin levels, adverse effects, bowel deflation time and time of postoperative hospital stay were compared. The procedure time, amount of hemorrhage and postoperative reduction in hemoglobin levels were not significantly different between the carboprost group and the vasopressin group (P>0.05). In the carboprost plus oxytocin group, the procedure time, amount of hemorrhage and postoperative reduction in hemoglobin levels were 24.3±2.6 min, 51.1±8.4 ml and 6.9±1.5 g/l, respectively, which were significantly less than those in the vasopressin and carboprost groups (all P<0.05). In the carboprost and carboprost plus oxytocin groups, the incidence of mild uterine contraction pain was significantly higher than in the vasopressin group (χ To investigate the clinical value of carboprost tromethamine injection combined with modified B-lynch suture and carboprost methylate suppositories in the treatment of placenta previa parturients with postpartum hemorrhage after cesarean section. A total of 102 parturients with placenta previa and postpartum hemorrhage after cesarean section in our hospital were selected as the study subjects, and they were divided into Group A (carboprost tromethamine injection combined with modified B-lynch suture, n=35), Group B (carboprost methylate suppositories, n=34), and Group C (carboprost tromethamine injection, n=33) in accordance with a random number table.

The amount of hemorrhaging in Group A was significantly lower than that in Groups B and C during surgery and 24 h after surgery ( Carboprost tromethamine injection combined with modified B-lynch suture and carboprost methylate suppositories can reduce the amount of hemorrhaging and the risk of postoperative infection in placenta previa patients with postpartum hemorrhage after cesarean section. Motherwort (YiMuCao), a traditional Chinese herb, has been shown beneficial effects for women's diseases. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of motherwort injection add-on therapy to carboprost tromethamine for prevention of post-partum blood loss. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang from their inception to December 2017. Randomized controlled trials that determined the add-on effects of motherwort injection to carboprost for prevention of post-partum blood loss were eligible. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to summarize the effect sizes. Eight trials including 1276 pregnant women fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Prophylactic use of motherwort injection add-on therapy significantly reduced the post-partum 2 h (MD -127.5 mL; 95% CI -149.13 to -105.88) and 24 h (MD -146.85 mL; 95% CI -179.77 to -113.94) blood loss and incidence of post-partum hemorrhage (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.17-0.45) than carboprost. Moreover, adjunctive treatment with motherwort injection significantly decreased the length of the third stage of labor (MD -3.41 min; 95% CI -4.33 to -2.49) and duration of lochia (MD -7.13 days; 95% CI -8.49 to -5.76). There was no statistical significant difference in the incidence of adverse events (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.50-1.16). Prophylactic use of motherwort injection add-on therapy to carboprost tromethamine could reduce post-partum blood loss.

1421,"('Meropenem (trihydrate)', 'Sm 7338 trihydrate', 'Meropenem', 'Merrem', 'Meropenem anhydrous')",Medical,"Meropenem, sold under the brand name Merrem among others, is an intravenous carbapenem antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Some of these include meningitis, intra-abdominal infection, pneumonia, sepsis, and anthrax. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, headache, rash, and pain at the site of injection. Serious side effects include Clostridioides difficile infection, seizures, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Those who are allergic to other β-lactam antibiotics are more likely to be allergic to meropenem as well. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. It is in the carbapenem family of medications. Meropenem usually results in bacterial death through blocking their ability to make a cell wall. It is resistant to breakdown by many kinds of β-lactamase enzymes, produced by bacteria to protect themselves from antibiotics. Meropenem was patented in 1983. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies meropenem as critically important for human medicine. == Medical uses == The spectrum of action includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (including Pseudomonas) and anaerobic bacteria. The overall spectrum is similar to that of imipenem, although meropenem is more active against Enterobacteriaceae and less active against Gram-positive bacteria. Meropenem is effective against bacteria producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases but may be more susceptible to hydrolysis by metallo-β-lactamases produced by bacteria. β-lactamases are enzymes that bacteria produce to hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics, breaking the β-lactam ring and rendering these antibiotics ineffective. This mechanism helps bacteria resist the effects of antibiotics like penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, making treatment more challenging. While β-lactam ring in meropenem is more accessible to water molecules than in the other β-lactam antibiotics, that facilitates the hydrolysis process and faster degradation of meropenem's antibacterial properties in aqueous solutions, it is more resistant to degradation by β-lactamase enzymes produced by bacteria than the other β-lactam antibiotics. Meropenem is frequently given in the treatment of febrile neutropenia. This condition frequently occurs in patients with hematological malignancies and cancer patients receiving anticancer drugs that suppress bone marrow formation. It is approved for complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and bacterial meningitis. Meropenem is effective in treating bacterial pneumonia, including hospital-acquired pneumonia. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval for the combination of meropenem and vaborbactam to treat adults with complicated urinary tract infections. == Administration == Meropenem is administered intravenously as an aqueous solution. Meropenem is stored in vials as white crystalline powder (containing meropenem as the trihydrate blended with anhydrous sodium carbonate). For intravenous administration, if pure meropenem powder is used (rather than the powder blended with sodium carbonate), meropenem is dissolved in 5% monobasic potassium phosphate solution, since meropenem is soluble in 5% monobasic potassium phosphate solution and only sparingly soluble in water (5.63 mg/mL). For intravenous bolus administration, injection vials (that contain meropenem blended with sodium carbonate) are reconstituted with sterile water for injection. Reconstituted (dissolved) meropenem degrades over time. The degradation may be associated with color change of the solution, typical for a hydrolysis of the amide bond of the β-lactam ring as seen with most β-lactam antibiotics, while particularly for meropenem the color is changing from colorless or pale yellow to vivid yellowish. Upon reconstitution, the meropenem infusion solution, prepared with 0.9% sodium chloride, exhibits both chemical and physical stability for a duration of 3 hours at a temperature up to 25°C. If refrigerated (2–8°C), the stability extends to 24 hours. However, when the product is reconstituted in a 5% dextrose solution, it is used immediately to ensure its efficacy. The degradation of meropenem in a water-based solution is affected by factors such as pH, temperature, initial concentration, and the specific type of infusion solution used. Meropenem solutions should not be frozen. There is a bit of a paradox with meropenem that the amide bond in the β-lactam ring of meropenem makes it resistant to many β-lactamases (penicillinases), which are enzymes produced by bacteria that can break down penicillin and related antibiotics such as meropenem. This resistance is due to the stability of the β-lactam ring in meropenem, which is less susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. However, meropenem is not stable in the presence of water. It can undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solutions, which can reduce its effectiveness. This means that while meropenem is designed to resist bacterial enzymes, it can still be broken down by water, which is a bit ironic. That's why meropenem requires frequent or prolonged slow administration to supply new drug to the bloodstream to replace what was hydrolyzed by the water component of blood. Meropenem is administered every 8 hours. Dosing must be adjusted for altered kidney function and for haemofiltration. Studies describe application of meropenem therapeutic drug monitoring (measurements of drug levels in the bloodstream at specific intervals) for optimal application. As with other β-lactams antibiotics, the effectiveness of treatment depends on the amount of time during the dosing interval that the meropenem concentration is above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacteria causing the infection. For β-lactams, including meropenem, prolonged intravenous administration is associated with lower mortality compared to bolus intravenous infusion, especially in severe infections or those caused by less sensitive bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Meropenem exhibits poor permeability across the gut and low oral bioavailability because of its hydrophilic properties, which inhibit its passive diffusion across the intestinal epithelium. The challenges related to research of oral delivery of meropenem are related to high susceptibility of meropenem to degradation through hydrolysis of the amide bond in the β-lactam ring, even at relatively low temperatures and humidity. This instability can result in the loss of meropenem's antibacterial activity. Besides that, meropenem is unstable in the acidic environment of the stomach, leading to extensive degradation and loss of the drug after oral administration. In addition, intestinal efflux (secretory) transport can pump the drug back into the gut: efflux transporters, particularly P-glycoprotein (P-gp), present in the gastrointestinal tract can actively pump meropenem back into the gut lumen, limiting its absorption and reducing oral bioavailability; in the attempts of oral administration bacteria can develop resistance to meropenem by enhancing the active efflux of the antibiotic through efflux transporters, such as the MexAB-OprM tripartite efflux system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. That's why meropenem is administered intravenously. There is insufficient data regarding the administration of meropenem during breastfeeding. However, it has been observed that, in general, the concentration of this β-lactam antibiotic in breast milk is relatively low, therefore, β-lactam antibiotics are not anticipated to induce detrimental effects in infants who are breastfed. Nonetheless, there have been sporadic reports of disturbances in the gastrointestinal flora of the infant, manifesting as diarrhea or oral candidiasis (thrush), associated with the use of β-lactam antibiotics, however, these potential side effects have not been thoroughly investigated specifically in the context of meropenem use, therefore, the safety profile of meropenem in breastfeeding mothers and their infants is unknown. Although meropenem is not approved for intramuscular or subcutaneous routes of administration in humans, there were studies that evaluated the drug bioavailability in cats and reported bioavailability of 99.69% for intramuscular route and 96.52 % for subcutaneous route of administration; these studies also compared elimination half-lives for intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes of administration in cats and reported duration of 1.35, 2.10 and 2.26 hours, respectively. There was also a small study on local tolerance of meropenem intramuscular administration in humans, and it was reported as generally good. == Side effects == Among antibiotic drugs, meropenem is relatively safe. The most common adverse effects are diarrhea (4.8%), nausea and vomiting (3.6%), injection-site inflammation (2.4%), headache (2.3%), rash (1.9%) and thrombophlebitis (0.9%). Many of these adverse effects were observed in severely ill individuals already taking many medications including vancomycin. Meropenem has a reduced potential for seizures in comparison with imipenem. Several cases of severe hypokalemia have been reported. == Interactions == Meropenem rapidly reduces serum concentrations of valproic acid. As a result, people who use valproic acid for epilepsy are at increased risk of seizures during treatment with meropenem. In situations where the use of meropenem cannot be avoided, prescription of an additional anticonvulsant should be considered. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Meropenem is bactericidal except against Listeria monocytogenes, where it is bacteriostatic. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis like other β-lactam antibiotics. In contrast to other β-lactams, it is highly resistant to degradation by β-lactamases or cephalosporinases. In general, resistance arises due to mutations in penicillin-binding proteins, production of metallo-β-lactamases, or resistance to diffusion across the bacterial outer membrane. Unlike imipenem, it is stable to dehydropeptidase-1, so can be given without cilastatin. In 2016, a synthetic peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) was found to inhibit the expression of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1, an enzyme that many drug-resistant bacteria use to destroy carbapenems. == Research directions == Nebulized meropenem (inhaled route) is researched, but is not approved, for prevention of bronchiectasis exacerbation. == Society and culture == === Trade names === == References ==",Meropenem,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.597391747054644e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044050050200894475)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meropenem,https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D08185,https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/meropenem ', [])"

The present experiments determined whether these responses are altered by pre-exposing rats to a regimen of systemic amphetamine (AMPH) injections known to produce locomotor sensitization. Rats in different groups were administered four injections of saline or AMPH (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), one injection every third day. Two weeks after the last injection, rats were challenged with microinjections of either saline, (RS)-MCPG (2.5 nmole/side) or (1S,3R)-ACPD (0.5 nmole/side) into the NAcc. While (1S,3R)-ACPD increased locomotor activity when injected into the NAcc, no significant difference between saline and AMPH pre-exposed rats was observed. However, and interestingly, (RS)-MCPG which had no effect on locomotor activity when given to saline pre-exposed rats induced significantly higher locomotor activity in AMPH compared to saline pre-exposed rats.

1424,"('(¬±)-1,2-propanediol', 'Propylene glycol', 'Propane-1,2-diol', 'Methylethyl glycol', 'Methylethylene glycol')","Food, Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Propylene glycol (IUPAC name: propane-1,2-diol) is a viscous, colorless liquid. It is almost odorless and has a faintly sweet taste. Its chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)CH2OH. As it contains two alcohol groups, it is classified as a diol. An aliphatic diol may also be called a glycol. It is miscible with a broad range of solvents, including water, acetone, and chloroform. In general, glycols are non-irritating and have very low volatility. For certain uses as a food additive, propylene glycol is considered as GRAS by the US Food and Drug Administration, and is approved for food manufacturing. In the European Union, it has E-number E1520 for food applications. For cosmetics and pharmacology, the number is E490. Propylene glycol is also present in propylene glycol alginate, which is known as E405. Propylene glycol is approved and used as a vehicle for topical, oral, and some intravenous pharmaceutical preparations in the US and Europe. == Structure == The compound is sometimes called (alpha) α-propylene glycol to distinguish it from the isomer propane-1,3-diol, known as (beta) β-propylene glycol. Propylene glycol is chiral. Commercial processes typically use the racemate. The S-isomer is produced by biotechnological routes. == Production == === Industrial === Industrially, propylene glycol is mainly produced from propylene oxide (for food-grade use). According to a 2018 source, 2.16 M tonnes are produced annually. Manufacturers use either non-catalytic high-temperature process at 200 °C (392 °F) to 220 °C (428 °F), or a catalytic method, which proceeds at 150 °C (302 °F) to 180 °C (356 °F) in the presence of ion exchange resin or a small amount of sulfuric acid or alkali. Final products contain 20% propylene glycol, 1.5% of dipropylene glycol, and small amounts of other polypropylene glycols. Further purification produces finished industrial grade or USP/JP/EP/BP grade propylene glycol that is typically 99.5% or greater. Use of USP (US Pharmacopoeia) propylene glycol can reduce the risk of Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) rejection. Propylene glycol can also be obtained from glycerol, a byproduct from the production of biodiesel. This starting material is usually reserved for industrial use because of the noticeable odor and taste that accompanies the final product. === Laboratory === (S)-Propanediol is synthesized via fermentation methods. Lactic acid and lactaldehyde are common intermediates. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate, one of the two products of breakdown (glycolysis) of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, is a precursor to methylglyoxal. This conversion is the basis of a potential biotechnological route to the commodity chemical 1,2-propanediol. Three-carbon deoxysugars are also precursor to the 1,2-diol. A small-scale, nonbiological route from D-mannitol is illustrated in the following scheme: == Applications == === Polymers === Forty-five percent of propylene glycol produced is used as a chemical feedstock for the production of unsaturated polyester resins. In this regard, propylene glycol reacts with a mixture of unsaturated maleic anhydride and isophthalic acid to give a copolymer. This partially unsaturated polymer undergoes further crosslinking to yield thermoset plastics. Related to this application, propylene glycol reacts with propylene oxide to give oligomers and polymers that are used to produce polyurethanes. Propylene glycol is used in water-based acrylic architectural paints to extend dry time which it accomplishes by preventing the surface from drying due to its slower evaporation rate compared to water. === Food and drug === In regulated amounts, propylene glycol is designated as safe for food manufacturing as an anticaking agent, emulsifier, flavor agent, humectant, texturizer, stabilizer, solvent, antioxidant, antimicrobial agent, and thickener. As regulated by the US FDA for substances deemed as GRAS, propylene glycol is ""not subject to premarket review and approval by FDA because it is generally recognized, by qualified experts, to be safe under the intended conditions of use."" The scientific panel evaluating propylene glycol for food manufacturing defined its conclusion as: ""There is no evidence in the available information on [propylene glycol] that demonstrates, or suggests reasonable grounds to suspect, a hazard to the public when they are used at levels that are now current or might reasonably be expected in the future."" The FDA law defined maximum limits for the use of propylene glycol in various food categories under good manufacturing practices: 2.0% for general food categories 2.5% for frozen dairy products 5% for alcoholic beverages 5% for nuts and nut products 24% for confections and frostings 97% for seasonings and flavorings The European Food Safety Authority authorizes propylene glycol for use in food manufacturing, establishing a safe daily intake of 25 mg per kg of body weight. Specifically for ice cream or ice milk products, Health Canada permits use of propylene glycol mono fatty acid esters as an emulsifier and stabilizer at a maximum level of use of 0.35% of the ice cream made from the ingredients mix. Propylene glycol is used in a variety of other edible items, such as baked goods, desserts, prepared meals, flavoring mixes, candy, popcorn, whipped dairy products, and soda. It is also used in beer to stabilize the foam. Vaporizers used for delivery of pharmaceuticals or personal-care products often include propylene glycol among the ingredients. In alcohol-based hand sanitizers, it is used as a humectant to prevent the skin from drying. Propylene glycol is used as a solvent in many pharmaceuticals, including oral, injectable, and topical formulations. Many pharmaceutical drugs which are insoluble in water utilize propylene glycol as a solvent and carrier; benzodiazepine tablets are one example. Propylene glycol is also used as a solvent and carrier for many pharmaceutical capsule preparations. Additionally, certain formulations of artificial tears use propylene glycol as an ingredient. === Antifreeze === The freezing point of water is depressed when mixed with propylene glycol. It is used as aircraft de-icing and anti-icing fluid. A 50% water-diluted and heated solution is used for removal of icing accretions from the fuselages of commercial aircraft on the ground (de-icing), and 100% undiluted cold solution is used only on wings and tail surfaces of an aircraft in order to prevent ice accretion from forming during a specific period of time before takeoff (anti-icing). Normally, such time-frame is limited to 15–90 minutes, depending on the severity of snowfall and outside air temperature. Water-propylene glycol mixtures dyed pink to indicate the mixture is relatively nontoxic are sold under the name of RV or marine antifreeze. Propylene glycol is frequently used as a substitute for ethylene glycol in low toxicity, environmentally friendly automotive antifreeze. It is also used to winterize the plumbing systems in vacant structures. The eutectic composition/temperature is 60:40 propylene glycol:water/−60 °C. The −50 °F/−45 °C commercial product is, however, water rich; a typical formulation is 40:60. === Electronic cigarettes liquid === Propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, or a mixture of both, are the main ingredients in e-liquid used in electronic cigarettes. They are aerosolized to resemble smoke and serve as carriers for substances such as nicotine and flavorants. == Miscellaneous applications == As a solvent for many substances, both natural and synthetic. As a humectant (E1520). As a freezing point depressant for slurry ice. In veterinary medicine as an oral treatment for hyperketonaemia in ruminants. In the cosmetics industry, where propylene glycol is very commonly used as a carrier or base for various types of makeup. For trapping and preserving insects (including as a DNA preservative). For the creation of theatrical smoke and fog in special effects for film and live entertainment. So-called 'smoke machines' or 'hazers' vaporize a mixture of propylene glycol and water to create the illusion of smoke. While many of these machines use a propylene glycol-based fluid, some use oil. Those which use propylene glycol do so in a process that is identical to how electronic cigarettes work; utilizing a heating element to produce a dense vapor. The vapor produced by these machines has the aesthetic look and appeal of smoke, but without exposing performers and stage crew to the harms and odors associated with actual smoke. As an additive in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to reduce the melting temperature of nucleic acids for targeting of GC rich sequences. As a surfactant, it is used to prevent water from beading up on objects. It is used in photography for this purpose to reduce the risk of water spots, or deposits of minerals from water used to process film or paper. == Safety in humans == When used in average quantities, propylene glycol has no measurable effect on development and/or reproduction on animals and probably does not adversely affect human development or reproduction without active use. The safety of electronic cigarettes—which utilize propylene glycol-based preparations of nicotine or THC and other cannabinoids—is the subject of much controversy. Vitamin E acetate has also been identified in this controversy. === Oral administration === The acute oral toxicity of propylene glycol is very low, and large quantities are required to cause perceptible health effects in humans; in fact, the toxicity of propylene glycol is one third that of ethanol. Propylene glycol is metabolized in the human body into pyruvic acid (a normal part of the glucose-metabolism process, readily converted to energy), acetic acid (handled by ethanol-metabolism), lactic acid (a normal acid generally abundant during digestion), and propionaldehyde (a potentially hazardous substance). According to the Dow Chemical Company, the LD50 (dose that kills 50% of the test population) for rats is 20 g/kg (oral/rat). Toxicity generally occurs at plasma concentrations over 4 g/L, which requires extremely high intake over a relatively short period of time, or when used as a vehicle for drugs or vitamins given intravenously or orally in large bolus doses. It would be nearly impossible to reach toxic levels by consuming foods or supplements, which contain at most 1 g/kg of PG, except for alcoholic beverages in the US which are allowed 5 percent = 50 g/kg. Cases of propylene glycol poisoning are usually related to either inappropriate intravenous administration or accidental ingestion of large quantities by children. The potential for long-term oral toxicity is also low. In a National Toxicology Program continuous breeding study, no effects on fertility were observed in male or female mice that received propylene glycol in drinking water at doses up to 10100 mg/kg bw/day. No effects on fertility were seen in either the first or second generation of treated mice. In a 2-year study, 12 rats were provided with feed containing as much as 5% propylene glycol, and showed no apparent ill effects. === Skin and eye contact === Propylene glycol may be non-irritating to the skin, see section Allergic reaction below for details on allergic reactions. Undiluted propylene glycol is minimally irritating to the eye, producing slight transient conjunctivitis; the eye recovers after the exposure is removed. A 2018 human volunteer study found that 10 male and female subjects undergoing 4 hours exposures to concentrations of up to 442 mg/m3 and 30 minutes exposures to concentrations of up to 871 mg/m3 in combination with moderate exercise did not show pulmonary function deficits, or signs of ocular irritation, with only slight symptoms of respiratory irritation reported. Propylene glycol has not caused sensitization or carcinogenicity in laboratory animal studies, nor has it demonstrated genotoxic potential. === Inhalation === Inhalation of propylene glycol vapors appears to present no significant hazard in ordinary applications. Due to the lack of chronic inhalation data, it is recommended that propylene glycol not be used in inhalation applications such as theatrical productions, or antifreeze solutions for emergency eye wash stations. Recently, propylene glycol (commonly alongside glycerol) has been included as a carrier for nicotine and other additives in e-cigarette liquids, the use of which presents a novel form of exposure. The potential hazards of chronic inhalation of propylene glycol or the latter substance as a whole are as-yet unknown. According to a 2010 study, the concentrations of PGEs (counted as the sum of propylene glycol and glycol ethers) in indoor air, particularly bedroom air, has been linked to increased risk of developing numerous respiratory and immune disorders in children, including asthma, hay fever, eczema, and allergies, with increased risk ranging from 50% to 180%. This concentration has been linked to use of water-based paints and water-based system cleansers. However, the study authors write that glycol ethers and not propylene glycol are the likely culprit. === Intravenous administration === Studies with intravenously administered propylene glycol have resulted in LD50 values in rats and rabbits of 7 mL/kg BW. Ruddick (1972) also summarized intramuscular LD50 data for rat as 13–20 mL/kg BW, and 6 mL/kg BW for the rabbit. Adverse effects to intravenous administration of drugs that use propylene glycol as an excipient have been seen in a number of people, particularly with large bolus dosages. Responses may include CNS depression, ""hypotension, bradycardia, QRS and T abnormalities on the ECG, arrhythmia, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, agitation, serum hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, and haemolysis"". A high percentage (12–42%) of directly-injected propylene glycol is eliminated or secreted in urine unaltered depending on dosage, with the remainder appearing in its glucuronide-form. The speed of renal filtration decreases as dosage increases, which may be due to propylene glycol's mild anesthetic / CNS-depressant properties as an alcohol. In one case, intravenous administration of propylene glycol-suspended nitroglycerin to an elderly man may have induced coma and acidosis. However, no confirmed lethality from propylene glycol was reported. === Animals === Propylene glycol is an approved food additive for dog and sugar glider food under the category of animal feed and is generally recognized as safe for dogs, with an LD50 of 9 mL/kg. The LD50 is higher for most laboratory animals (20 mL/kg). However, it is prohibited for use in food for cats due to links to Heinz body formation and a reduced lifespan of red blood cells. Heinz body formation from MPG has not been observed in dogs, cattle, or humans. PG has been used in the dairy industry since the 1950s for cows showing signs of ketosis. The negative energy balance during the early stages of lactation can cause the animal's body to have lower glucose levels, inducing the liver to make up for this by the conversion of body fat, leading to several health conditions, e.g. displaced abomasum. PG ""reduces the propionate ratio of acetate to acetaminophen, while increasing conversion of ruminal PG to propionate, and aid[s] in the closure of energy deficit in cattle."" === Allergic reaction === Estimates on the prevalence of propylene glycol allergy range from 0.8% (10% propylene glycol in aqueous solution) to 3.5% (30% propylene glycol in aqueous solution). The North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG) data from 1996 to 2006 showed that the most common site for propylene glycol contact dermatitis was the face (25.9%), followed by a generalized or scattered pattern (23.7%). Investigators believe that the incidence of allergic contact dermatitis to propylene glycol may be greater than 2% in patients with eczema or fungal infections, which are very common in countries with lesser sun exposure and lower-than-normal vitamin D balances. Therefore, propylene glycol allergy is more common in those countries. Because of its potential for allergic reactions and frequent use across a variety of topical and systemic products, propylene glycol was named the American Contact Dermatitis Society's Allergen of the Year for 2018. Recent publication from The Mayo Clinic reported 0.85% incidence of positive patch tests to propylene glycol (100/11,738 patients) with an overall irritant rate of 0.35% (41/11,738 patients) during a 20-year period of 1997–2016. 87% of the reactions were classified as weak and 9% as strong. The positive reaction rates were 0%, 0.26%, and 1.86% for 5%, 10%, and 20% propylene glycol respectively, increasing with each concentration increase. The irritant reaction rates were 0.95%, 0.24%, and 0.5% for 5%, 10%, and 20% propylene glycol, respectively. Propylene glycol skin sensitization occurred in patients sensitive to a number of other concomitant positive allergens, most common of which were: Myroxylon pereirae resin, benzalkonium chloride, carba mix, potassium dichromate, neomycin sulfate; for positive propylene glycol reactions, the overall median of 5 and mean of 5.6 concomitant positive allergens was reported. == Environmental impacts == Propylene glycol occurs naturally, probably as the result of anaerobic catabolism of sugars in the human gut. It is degraded by vitamin B12-dependent enzymes, which convert it to propionaldehyde. Propylene glycol is expected to degrade rapidly in water from biological processes, but is not expected to be significantly influenced by hydrolysis, oxidation, volatilization, bioconcentration, or adsorption to sediment. Propylene glycol is readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions in freshwater, in seawater and in soil. Therefore, propylene glycol is considered as not persistent in the environment. Propylene glycol exhibits a low degree of toxicity toward aquatic organisms. Several guideline studies available for freshwater fish with the lowest observed lethal concentration of 96-h LC50 value of 40,613 mg/L in a study with Oncorhynchus mykiss. Similarly, the lethal concentration determined in marine fish is a 96-h LC50 of >10,000 mg/L in Scophthalmus maximus. Although propylene glycol has low toxicity, it exerts high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) during degradation in surface waters. This process can adversely affect aquatic life by consuming oxygen needed by aquatic organisms for survival. Large quantities of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column are consumed when microbial populations decompose propylene glycol.: 2–23 == References == == External links == Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Alton E.

To date, some engineered and non-engineered microbes, such as Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum, have been used to produce 1,2-PDO. In this study, we demonstrated the production of R- and S-1,2-PDO using engineered Lactococcus lactis. The L- and D-lactic acid-producing L. lactis strains NZ9000 and AH1 were transformed with the plasmid pNZ8048-ppy harboring pct, pduP, and yahK genes for 1,2-PDO biosynthesis, resulting in L. lactis LL1 and LL2, respectively. These engineered L. lactis produced S- and R-1,2-PDO at concentrations of 0.69 and 0.50 g/L with 94.4 and 78.0% ee optical purities, respectively, from 1% glucose after 72 h of cultivation. Both 1% mannitol and 1% gluconate were added instead of glucose to the culture of L. lactis LL1 to supply NADH and NADPH to the 1,2-PDO production pathway, resulting in 75% enhancement of S-1,2-PDO production. Production of S-1,2-PDO from 5% mannitol and 5% gluconate was demonstrated using L. lactis LL1 with a pH-stat approach. This resulted in S-1,2-PDO production at a concentration of 1.88 g/L after 96 h of cultivation. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of R- and S-1,2-PDO using engineered lactic acid bacteria. Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important microorganism and is used as a cell factory for many chemicals production. When glycerol was used as the carbon source, 1,3-propanediol was the main catabolite of this bacterium. K. pneumoniae ΔtpiA lost the activity of triosephosphate isomerase and prevented glycerol catabolism through the glycolysis pathway. But this strain still utilized glycerol, and 1,2-propanediol became the main catabolite. Key enzymes of 1,2-propanediol synthesis from glycerol were investigated in detail. dhaD and gldA encoded glycerol dehydrogenases were both responsible for the conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone, but overexpression of the two enzymes resulted in a decrease of 1,2-propanediol production. There are two dihydroxyacetone kinases (I and II), but the dihydroxyacetone kinase I had no contribution to dihydroxyacetone phosphate formation. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate was converted to methylglyoxal, and methylglyoxal was then reduced to lactaldehyde or hydroxyacetone and further reduced to form 1,2-propanediol. Individual overexpression of mgsA, yqhD, and fucO resulted in increased production of 1,2-propanediol, but only the combined expression of mgsA and yqhD showed a positive effect on 1,2-propanediol production. The process parameters for 1,2-propanediol production by Kp ΔtpiA-mgsA-yqhD were optimized, with pH 7.0 and agitation rate of 350 rpm found to be optimal. In the fed-batch fermentation, 9.3 g/L of 1,2-propanediol was produced after 144 h of cultivation, and the substrate conversion ratio was 0.2 g/g. This study provides an efficient way of 1,2-propanediol production from glycerol via an endogenous pathway of K. pneumoniae.Key points• 1,2-Propanediol was synthesis from glycerol by a tpiA knocked out K. pneumoniae• Overexpression of mgsA, yqhD, or fucO promote 1,2-propanediol production• 9.3 g/L of 1,2-propanediol was produced in fed-batch fermentation. Native concentrations and enantiomeric distribution of 1,2-propanediol in various wines were studied in order to evaluate its merits as a potential marker for aroma adulteration in wine. Heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was applied to analyze 1,2-propanediol after salting-out of the polar phase, derivatization with phenyl boronic acid, and extraction with cyclohexane. The enantiomeric separation of the derivative was achieved with heptakis-(6-O-tert. butyl dimethylsilyl-2,3-di-O-acetyl)-β-cyclodextrin as the chiral selector. In all authentic wines studied, 1,2-propanediol showed a high enantiomeric ratio in favor of the (R)-enantiomer, proving its potential as a marker for the adulteration with flavor extracts based on industrial 1,2-propandiol as solvent. Usually, concentrations varied between 15 and 100 mg/L. Higher values (up to 170 mg/L) were found in wines made with high amounts of dry berries. However, despite the higher concentrations of 1,2-propanediol in such wines, no apparent influence on the enantiomeric distribution could be detected.

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of R- and S-1,2-PDO using engineered lactic acid bacteria. Clostridium strain AK1 was investigated for its capacity of producing 1,2-propanediol from l-rhamnose but not l-fucose. The maximum yields of 1,2-propanediol from rhamnose was 0.81 mol 1,2-PD/mol l-rhamnose. The influence of different initial substrate concentrations as well as the effect of temperature and pH on 1,2-PD production was investigated. The pure stereoisomers of 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) could be used as starting materials to synthesize high value-added specialty chemicals and chiral pharmaceutical products. As the stereoisomers of 1,2-PDO cannot be obtained by traditional chemical synthesis processes, biotechnological processes have gained increasing attention. However, to our knowledge, the production of S-1,2-PDO directly from glucose has not been previously reported. In this study, we demonstrate a novel artificial pathway to convert L-lactic acid to S-1,2-PDO and its integration into the genome of Escherichia coli strain BW25113∆poxB with synchronous deletion of genes responsible for branch metabolic pathways from glucose. L-lactate production was increased by replacing the native D-lactate dehydrogenase with the L-lactate dehydrogenase from Bacillus coagulans. The methylglyoxal bypass pathway was blocked to avoid synthesis of a racemic mixture of D- and L-lactate and prevent the accumulation of methylglyoxal, a toxic intermediate. To further improve the yield of S-1,2-PDO, a novel cofactor regeneration system was introduced by combining pyruvate decarboxylase and acetaldehyde-CoA dehydrogenase II to simultaneously regenerate NADH and the CoA donor of acetyl-CoA for the lactate conversion pathway. Finally, 13.7 mM S-1,2-PDO with >99 % enantiomeric purity was directly produced from glucose by disrupting the major carbon-competing pathways and strengthening the lactate transformation pathway.

It is a prescription, lotion-based medicine that is applied to the whole body to get rid of the scabies mite that burrows under the skin and causes itching. == Use == For treating scabies, crotamiton should be applied to the whole body rather than a localized area. It is applied two or three times, with a 24-hour delay between applications, and the patient is asked to take a shower no sooner than after 48 hours. For children under 3 years, it is applied once daily. It can also be used to treat itching stemming from other causes, e.g. insect bites, in which case it is applied to the itching areas only, and repeated if necessary after 4 to 8 hours. Use near the eyes, or breaks in the skin, should be avoided. == Pharmacology == Crotamiton is toxic to the scabies mite. It probably acts as a general antipruritic by inhibition of TRPV4, a sensory ion channel that is expressed in the skin and primary sensory neurons. == Pharmacokinetics == After topical application, crotamiton is absorbed systemically.

1428,"('Estrone', 'Oestrone', 'Folliculin', 'Theelin', 'Follicular hormone')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Estrone (E1), also spelled oestrone, is a steroid, a weak estrogen, and a minor female sex hormone. It is one of three major endogenous estrogens, the others being estradiol and estriol. Estrone, as well as the other estrogens, are synthesized from cholesterol and secreted mainly from the gonads, though they can also be formed from adrenal androgens in adipose tissue. Relative to estradiol, both estrone and estriol have far weaker activity as estrogens. Estrone can be converted into estradiol, and serves mainly as a precursor or metabolic intermediate of estradiol. It is both a precursor and metabolite of estradiol. In addition to its role as a natural hormone, estrone has been used as a medication, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy; for information on estrone as a medication, see the estrone (medication) article. == Biological activity == Estrone is an estrogen, specifically an agonist of the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. It is a far less potent estrogen than is estradiol, and as such, is a relatively weak estrogen. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. According to one study, the relative binding affinities of estrone for the human ERα and ERβ were 4.0% and 3.5% of those estradiol, respectively, and the relative transactivational capacities of estrone at the ERα and ERβ were 2.6% and 4.3% of those of estradiol, respectively. In accordance, the estrogenic activity of estrone has been reported to be approximately 4% of that of estradiol. In addition to its low estrogenic potency, estrone, unlike estradiol and estriol, is not accumulated in estrogen target tissues. Because estrone can be transformed into estradiol, most or all of the estrogenic potency of estrone in vivo is actually due to conversion into estradiol. As such, estrone is considered to be a precursor or prohormone of estradiol. In contrast to estradiol and estriol, estrone is not a ligand of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (affinity >10,000 nM). Clinical research has confirmed the nature of estrone as a relatively inert precursor of estradiol. With oral administration of estradiol, the ratio of estradiol levels to estrone levels is about 5 times higher on average than under normal physiological circumstances in premenopausal women and with parenteral (non-oral) routes of estradiol. Oral administration of menopausal replacement dosages of estradiol results in low, follicular phase levels of estradiol, whereas estrone levels resemble the high levels seen during the first trimester of pregnancy. In spite of markedly elevated levels of estrone with oral estradiol but not with transdermal estradiol, clinical studies have shown that dosages of oral and transdermal estradiol achieving similar levels of estradiol possess equivalent and non-significantly different potency in terms of measures including suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, inhibition of bone resorption, and relief of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. In addition, estradiol levels were found to correlate with these effects, while estrone levels did not. These findings confirm that estrone has very low estrogenic activity, and also indicate that estrone does not diminish the estrogenic activity of estradiol. This contradicts some cell-free in-vitro research suggesting that high concentrations of estrone might be able to partially antagonize the actions of estradiol. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === Estrone is biosynthesized from cholesterol. The principal pathway involves androstenedione as an intermediate, with androstenedione being transformed into estrone by the enzyme aromatase. This reaction occurs in both the gonads and in certain other tissues, particularly adipose tissue, and estrone is subsequently secreted from these tissues. In addition to aromatization of androstenedione, estrone is also formed reversibly from estradiol by the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) in various tissues, including the liver, uterus, and mammary gland. Mechanism of Action: The way estrone works is by entering the cells of certain tissues in the body and attaching to nuclear receptors. This interaction then influences how genes are expressed, leading to various physiological responses in the body. === Distribution === Estrone is bound approximately 16% to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and 80% to albumin in the circulation, with the remainder (2.0 to 4.0%) circulating freely or unbound. It has about 24% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol for SHBG. As such, estrone is relatively poorly bound to SHBG. === Metabolism === Estrone is conjugated into estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate and estrone glucuronide by sulfotransferases and glucuronidases, and can also be hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 enzymes into catechol estrogens such as 2-hydroxyestrone and 4-hydroxyestrone or into estriol. Both of these transformations take place predominantly in the liver. Estrone can also be reversibly converted into estradiol by 17β-HSD. The blood half-life of estrone is about 10 to 70 minutes and is similar to that of estradiol. === Excretion === Estrone is excreted in urine in the form of estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate. Following an intravenous injection of labeled estrone in women, almost 90% is excreted in urine and feces within 4 to 5 days. Enterohepatic recirculation causes a delay in excretion of estrone. It is one of the three primary types of estrogen and is produced in various parts of the body, including the placenta, ovaries, and peripheral tissues. === Levels === Toxicity: When estrone is used too much or taken in large amounts, it can cause toxicity, leading to symptoms like nausea and vomiting. Estrone should be stored in its original package or container to maintain its quality and effectiveness. == Chemistry == Estrone, also known as estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid with double bonds at the C1, C3, and C5 positions, a hydroxyl group at the C3 position, and a ketone group at the C17 position. The name estrone was derived from the chemical terms estrin (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and ketone. The chemical formula of estrone is C18H22O2 and its molecular weight is 270.366 g/mol. It is a white, odorless, solid crystalline powder, with a melting point of 254.5 °C (490 °F) and a specific gravity of 1.23. Estrone is combustible at high temperatures, with the products carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). == Medical use == Estrone has been available as an injected estrogen for medical use, for instance in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms, but it is now mostly no longer marketed. Estrone, as part of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), is frequently used to treat symptoms caused by estrogen deficiency in peri and post-menopausal women. This therapy aims to enhance overall health and relieve menopausal symptoms related to estrogen imbalance. Additionally, estrone and other estrogens are used to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of fractures and cannot tolerate alternative medications. Estrogens are absorbed efficiently by the body and subsequently inactivated in the liver, making them effective in HRT and osteoporosis prevention. == Contraindications == The use of estrone has several contraindications, some examples including: hypersensitivity, history of some cancers, stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and those currently pregnant or breastfeeding. Estrogens hold a boxed warning to be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest possible treatment period if used alone or with another hormone in the progestogen class. === Breast Cancer === Estrone is contraindicated for those that have or are suspected of having breast cancer. The use of estrogens hold a boxed warning with breast cancer for post-menopausal women as this can increase the risk of developing invasive breast cancer. Those with breast cancer become at a greater risk of hypercalcemia and bone metastases when taking estrogens. Post-menopausal women with breast cancer can be seen to develop frailty syndrome when there are changes in blood hormonal levels, including an increased level of estrone. Estrone, the major type of estrogen produced in post-menopausal women, was seen in greater concentrations from standard levels in those that were categorized as prefrail and in those that classified as frail. === Venous Thromboembolism === The risk of VTE is increased in those that use estrogens, those that currently have or have a history with VTE are at a greater risk of reoccurring VTE with the usage of estrogens. The use of estrogens within three weeks postpartum may increase the risk of developing a VTE. Risk of developing initial VTE is also increased with familial history, genetic mutations: factor V Leiden and prothrombin-G20210A, and pregnancy-postpartum with the use of estrogens. === Breastfeeding === The use of estrogens may affect the ability to breastfeed and can change the composition of breastmilk. Estrogens have been used to suppress lactation which can result in a reduced total duration of lactation and reduced volume or inability to produce breastmilk. Composition of breastmilk produced was also seen to be different resulting in a reduced concentration of proteins in the milk. Babies of mothers that were taking estrogens while breastfeeding were seen to experience slower weight gain. == Side effects == === Common === Some common side effects seen with the usage of estrogens include: breast swelling, breast tenderness, vaginal itching, abnormal uterine bleeding, weight gain, hair loss, jaundice, and anaphylaxis. === Adverse effect === Some adverse effects seen with the usage of estrogens include: increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), stroke, breast cancer, hypertension, and vaginitis. == History == Estrone was the first steroid hormone to be discovered. It was discovered in 1929 independently by the American scientists Edward Doisy and Edgar Allen and the German biochemist Adolf Butenandt, although Doisy and Allen isolated it two months before Butenandt. They isolated and purified estrone in crystalline form from the urine of pregnant women. Doisy and Allen named it theelin, while Butenandt named it progynon and subsequently referred to it as folliculin in his second publication on the substance. Butenandt was later awarded the Nobel Prize in 1939 for the isolation of estrone and his work on sex hormones in general. The molecular formula of estrone was known by 1931, and its chemical structure had been determined by Butenandt by 1932. Following the elucidation of its structure, estrone was additionally referred to as ketohydroxyestrin or oxohydroxyestrin, and the name estrone, on the basis of its C17 ketone group, was formally established in 1932 at the first meeting of the International Conference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones in London. A partial synthesis of estrone from ergosterol was accomplished by Russell Earl Marker in 1936, and was the first chemical synthesis of estrone. An alternative partial synthesis of estrone from cholesterol by way of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was developed by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg in 1939 or 1940, and a total synthesis of estrone was achieved by Anner and Miescher in 1948. Approval The FDA has approved estrone based on its safety and effectiveness as per the rules outlined in sections 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. == References ==",Follicular hormone,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.011209916323423386), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.3856492842023727e-06), (' MED', -0.0011724866926670074), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.06678218394517899), ('DO', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('GEN', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('OUS', -2.0265558760002023e-06), (',', -0.0001668790791882202), ('ĠMED', -8.34430247778073e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019401551689952612)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24638-follicle-stimulating-hormone-fsh,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535442/ ', [])"
1429,"('Daptomycin', 'Cubicin', 'Cidecin', 'Daptomicina', 'Daptomycine')",Medical,"Daptomycin, sold under the brand name Cubicin among others, is a lipopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of systemic and life-threatening infections caused by Gram-positive organisms. Daptomycin was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. The World Health Organization classifies daptomycin as critically important for human medicine. == Medical uses == In the United States, daptomycin is indicated for use in adults for skin and skin structure infections caused by Gram-positive infections, S. aureus bacteraemia, and right-sided S. aureus endocarditis. It binds avidly to pulmonary surfactant, so cannot be used in the treatment of pneumonia. There seems to be a difference in working daptomycin on hematogenous pneumonia. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions associated with daptomycin therapy include: Cardiovascular: low blood pressure, high blood pressure, swelling Central nervous system: insomnia Dermatological: rash Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, abdominal pain Hematological: eosinophilia Respiratory: dyspnea Other: injection site reactions, fever, hypersensitivity Less common, but serious adverse events reported in the literature include Hepatotoxicity: elevated transaminases Nephrotoxicity: acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis Also, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients simultaneously taking statins, but whether this is due entirely to the statin or whether daptomycin potentiates this effect is unknown. Due to the limited data available, the manufacturer recommends that statins be temporarily discontinued while the patient is receiving daptomycin therapy. Creatine kinase levels are usually checked regularly while individuals undergo daptomycin therapy. In July 2010, the FDA issued a warning that daptomycin could cause life-threatening eosinophilic pneumonia. The FDA said it had identified seven confirmed cases of eosinophilic pneumonia between 2004 and 2010 and an additional 36 possible cases. The seven confirmed cases were all older than 60 and symptoms appeared within two weeks of initiation of therapy. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Daptomycin has a distinct mechanism of action, disrupting multiple aspects of bacterial cell membrane function. It inserts into the cell membrane in a phosphatidylglycerol-dependent fashion, where it then aggregates. The aggregation of daptomycin alters the curvature of the membrane, which creates holes that leak ions. This causes rapid depolarization, resulting in a loss of membrane potential leading to inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death. It has been proposed that the formation of spherical micelles by daptomycin may affect the mode of action. == Microbiology == Daptomycin is bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria only. It has proven in vitro activity against enterococci (including glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE)), staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), streptococci, corynebacteria and stationary-phase Borrelia burgdorferi persisters. == Daptomycin resistance == Daptomycin resistance is still uncommon, but has been increasingly reported in GRE, starting in Korea in 2005, in Europe in 2010, in Taiwan 2011, and in the United States, where nine cases have been reported from 2007 to 2011. Daptomycin resistance emerged in five of the six cases while they were treated. The mechanism of resistance is unknown. A four-million year-old strain of Paenibacillus isolated from soil samples in Lechuguilla Cave was found to be naturally resistant to daptomycin. It has been suggested that co-administration of daptomycin with at least another active antibiotic might help prevent the emergence of resistance and increase the bactericidal effect. Data from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a tailored approach should be used taking into account both the causative agent and the site of infection. == Efficacy == Daptomycin has been shown to be non-inferior to standard therapies (nafcillin, oxacillin, flucloxacillin or vancomycin) in the treatment of bacteraemia and right-sided endocarditis caused by S. aureus. A study in Detroit, Michigan compared 53 patients treated for suspected MRSA skin or soft tissue infection with daptomycin against vancomycin, showing faster recovery (4 versus 7 days) with daptomycin. In Phase III clinical trials, limited data showed daptomycin to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with left-sided endocarditis. Daptomycin has not been studied in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis or meningitis. == Biosynthesis == Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces filamentosus. Daptomycin consists of 13 amino acids, 10 of which are arranged in a cyclic fashion, and three on an exocyclic tail. Two nonproteinogenic amino acids exist in the drug, the unusual amino acid L-kynurenine (Kyn), only known to daptomycin, and L-3-methylglutamic acid (mGlu). The N-terminus of the exocyclic tryptophan residue is coupled to decanoic acid, a medium-chain (C10) fatty acid. Biosynthesis is initiated by the coupling of decanoic acid to the N-terminal tryptophan, followed by the coupling of the remaining amino acids by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mechanisms. Finally, a cyclization event occurs, which is catalyzed by a thioesterase enzyme, and subsequent release of the lipopeptide is granted. The NRPS responsible for the synthesis of daptomycin is encoded by three overlapping genes, dptA, dptBC and dptD. The dptE and dptF genes, immediately upstream of dptA, are likely to be involved in the initiation of daptomycin biosynthesis by coupling decanoic acid to the N-terminal Trp. These novel genes (dptE, dptF ) correspond to products that most likely work in conjunction with a unique condensation domain to acylate the first amino acid (tryptophan). These and other novel genes (dptI, dptJ) are believed to be involved in supplying the nonproteinogenic amino acids L-3-methylglutamic acid and Kyn; they are located next to the NRPS genes. The decanoic acid portion of daptomycin is synthesized by fatty acid synthase machinery (Figure 2). Post-translational modification of the apo-acyl carrier protein (ACP, thiolation, or T domain) by a phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a flexible phosphopantetheine arm from coenzyme A to a conserved serine in the ACP domain through a phosphodiester linkage. The holo-ACP can provide a thiol on which the substrate and acyl chains are covalently bound during chain elongations. The two core catalytic domains are an acyltransferase (AT) and a ketosynthase (KS). The AT acts upon a malonyl-CoA substrate and transfers an acyl group to the thiol of the ACP domain. This net transthiolation is an energy-neutral step. Next, the acyl-S-ACP gets transthiolated to a conserved cysteine on the KS; the KS decarboxylates the downstream malonyl-S-ACP and forms a β-ketoacyl-S-ACP. This serves as the substrate for the next cycle of elongation. Before the next cycle begins, however, the β-keto group undergoes reduction to the corresponding alcohol catalyzed by a ketoreductase domain, followed by dehydration to the olefin catalyzed by a dehydratase domain, and finally reduction to the methylene catalyzed by an enoylreductase domain. Each KS catalytic cycle results in the net addition of two carbons. After three more iterations of elongation, a thioesterase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis, and thus release, of the free C-10 fatty acid. To synthesize the peptide portion of daptomycin, the mechanism of an NRPS is employed. The biosynthetic machinery of an NRPS system is composed of multimodular enzymatic assembly lines that contain one module for each amino acid monomer incorporated. Within each module are catalytic domains that carry out the elongation of the growing peptidyl chain. The growing peptide is covalently tethered to a thiolation domain; here it is termed the peptidyl carrier protein, as it carries the growing peptide from one catalytic domain to the next. Again, the apo-T domain must be primed to the holo-T domain by a PPTase, attaching a flexible phosphopantetheine arm to a conserved serine residue. An adenylation domain selects the amino acid monomer to be incorporated and activates the carboxylate with ATP to make the aminoacyl-AMP. Next, the A domain installs an aminoacyl group on the thiolate of the adjacent T domain. The condensation (C) domain catalyzes the peptide bond forming reaction, which elicits chain elongation. It joins an upstream peptidyl-S-T to the downstream aminoacyl-S-T (Figure 7). Chain elongation by one aminoacyl residue and chain translocation to the next T domain occurs in concert. The order of these domains is C-A-T. In some instances, an epimerization domain is necessary in those modules where L-amino acid monomers are to be incorporated and epimerized to D-amino acids. The domain organization in such modules is C-A-T-E. The first module has a three-domain C-A-T organization; these often occur in assembly lines that make N-acylated peptides. The first C domain catalyzes N-acylation of the initiating amino acid (tryptophan) while it is installed on T. An adenylating enzyme (Ad) catalyzes the condensation of decanoic acid and the N-terminal tryptophan, which incorporates decanoic acid into the growing peptide (Figure 3). The genes responsible for this coupling event are dptE and dptF, which are located upstream of dptA, the first gene of the Daptomycin NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster. Once the coupling of decanoic acid to the N-terminal tryptophan residue occurs, the condensation of amino acids begins, catalyzed by the NRPS. The first five modules of the NRPS are encoded by the dptA gene and catalyze the condensation of L-tryptophan, D-asparagine, L-aspartate, L-threonine, and glycine, respectively (Figure 4). Modules 6–11, which catalyze the condensation of L-ornithine, L-aspartate, D-alanine, L-aspartate, glycine, and D-serine are encoded for the dptBC gene (Figure 5). dptD catalyzes the incorporation of two nonproteinogenic amino acids, L-3-methylglutamic acid (mGlu) and Kyn, which is only known thus far to daptomycin, into the growing peptide (Figure 6). Elongation by these NRPS modules ultimately leads to macrocyclization and release in which an α-amino group, namely threonine, acts as an internal nucleophile during cyclization to yield the 10-amino-acid ring (Figure 6). The termination module in the NRPS assembly line has a C-A-T-TE organization. The thioesterase domain catalyzes chain termination and release of the mature lipopeptide. The molecular engineering of daptomycin, the only marketed acidic lipopeptide antibiotic to date (Figure 8), has seen many advances since its inception into clinical medicine in 2003. It is an attractive target for combinatorial biosynthesis for many reasons: second generation derivatives are currently in the clinic for development; Streptomyces roseosporus, the producer organism of daptomycin, is amenable to genetic manipulation; the daptomycin biosynthetic gene cluster has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in S. lividans; the lipopeptide biosynthetic machinery has the potential to be interrupted by variations of natural precursors, as well as precursor-directed biosynthesis, gene deletion, genetic exchange, and module exchange; the molecular engineering tools have been developed to facilitate the expression of the three individual NRPS genes from three different sites in the chromosome, using ermEp* for expression of two genes from ectopic loci; other lipopeptide gene clusters, both related and unrelated to daptomycin, have been cloned and sequenced, thus providing genes and modules to allow the generation of hybrid molecules; derivatives can be afforded via chemoenzymatic synthesis; and lastly, efforts in medicinal chemistry are able to further modify these products of molecular engineering. New derivatives of daptomycin (Figure 9) were originally generated by exchanging the third NRPS subunit (dptD) with the terminal subunits from the A54145 (Factor B1) or calcium-dependent antibiotic pathways to create molecules containing Trp13, Ile13, or Val13. dptD is responsible for incorporating the penultimate amino acid, 3-methyl-glutamic acid (3mGlu12), and the last amino acid, Kyn13, into the chain. This exchange was achieved without engineering the interpeptide docking sites. These whole-subunit exchanges have been coupled with the deletion of the Glu12-methyltransferase gene, with module exchanges at intradomain linker sites at Ala8 and Ser11, and with variations of natural fatty-acid side chains to generate over 70 novel lipopeptides in significant quantities; most of these resultant lipopeptides have potent antibacterial activities. Some of these compounds have in vitro antibacterial activities analogous to daptomycin. Further, one displayed ameliorated activity against an E. coli imp mutant that was defective in its ability to assemble its inherent lipopolysaccharide. A number of these compounds were produced in yields that spanned from 100 to 250 mg/liter; this, of course, opens up the possibility for successful scale-ups by fermentation techniques. Only a small percentage of the possible combinations of amino acids within the peptide core have been investigated thus far. == History == Daptomycin, originally designated as LY 146032, was discovered by researchers at Eli Lilly and Company in the late 1980s from the actinomycete Streptomyces roseosporus. LY 146032 showed promise in phase I/II clinical trials for treatment of infection caused by Gram-positive organisms. Lilly ceased development because high-dose therapy was associated with adverse effects on skeletal muscle, including myalgia. The rights to LY 146032 were acquired by Cubist Pharmaceuticals in 1997, which following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in September 2003, for use in people older than 18 years, began marketing the drug under the trade name Cubicin. Cubicin is marketed in the EU and in several other countries by Novartis following its purchase of Chiron Corporation, the previous licensee. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""FDA Rationale for Recognition Decision: Daptomycin"".

1430,"('Dicoumarol', 'Dicumarol', 'Bishydroxycoumarin', 'Dicoumarin', 'Melitoxin')",Medical,"Dicoumarol (INN) or dicumarol (USAN) is a naturally occurring anticoagulant drug that depletes stores of vitamin K (similar to warfarin, a drug that dicoumarol inspired). It is also used in biochemical experiments as an inhibitor of reductases. Dicoumarol is a natural chemical substance of combined plant and fungal origin. It is a derivative of coumarin, a bitter-tasting but sweet-smelling substance made by plants that does not itself affect coagulation, but which is (classically) transformed in mouldy feeds or silages by a number of species of fungi, into active dicoumarol. Dicoumarol does affect coagulation, and was discovered in mouldy wet sweet-clover hay, as the cause of a naturally occurring bleeding disease in cattle. See warfarin for a more detailed discovery history. Identified in 1940, dicoumarol became the prototype of the 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant drug class. Dicoumarol itself, for a short time, was employed as a medicinal anticoagulant drug, but since the mid-1950s has been replaced by its simpler derivative warfarin, and other 4-hydroxycoumarin drugs. It is given orally, and it acts within two days. == Uses == Dicoumarol was used, along with heparin, for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis. Unlike heparin, this class of drugs may be used for months or years. == Mechanism of action == Like all 4-hydroxycoumarin drugs it is a competitive inhibitor of vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme that recycles vitamin K, thus causing depletion of active vitamin K in blood. This prevents the formation of the active form of prothrombin and several other coagulant enzymes. These compounds are not antagonists of Vitamin K directly—as they are in pharmaceutical uses—but rather promote depletion of vitamin K in bodily tissues allowing vitamin K's mechanism of action as a potent medication for dicoumarol toxicity. The mechanism of action of Vitamin K along with the toxicity of dicoumarol are measured with the prothrombin time (PT) blood test. == Poisoning == Overdose results in serious, sometimes fatal uncontrolled hemorrhage. == History == Dicoumarol was isolated by Karl Link's laboratory at University of Wisconsin, six years after a farmer had brought a dead cow and a milk can full of uncoagulated blood to an agricultural extension station of the university. The cow had died of internal bleeding after eating moldy sweet clover; an outbreak of such deaths had begun in the 1920s during The Great Depression as farmers could not afford to waste hay that had gone bad. Link's work led to the development of the rat poison warfarin and then to the anticoagulants still in clinical use today. == See also == Ethyl biscoumacetate == References == == Further reading == == External links == Diseases Database (DDB): 30166",Melitoxin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3877512216567993)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.09337453544139862), ('ICAL', -5.245195097813848e-06), (',', -0.10069369524717331), ('ĠFOOD', -0.21247868239879608), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20273463428020477)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12010-023-04841-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38252207/,https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/M/Melitoxin.html ', [])"

1433,"('Dibutyl phthalate', 'Di-n-butyl phthalate', 'N-butyl phthalate', 'Butyl phthalate', 'Celluflex dpb')","Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is an organic compound which is commonly used as a plasticizer because of its low toxicity and wide liquid range. With the chemical formula C6H4(CO2C4H9)2, it is a colorless oil, although impurities often render commercial samples yellow. == Production and use == DBP is produced by the reaction of n-butanol with phthalic anhydride. DBP is an important plasticizer that enhances the utility of some major engineering plastics, such as PVC. Such modified PVC is widely used in plumbing for carrying sewage and other corrosive materials. == Degradation == Hydrolysis of DBP leads to phthalic acid and 1-butanol. Monobutyl phthalate (MBP) is its major metabolite. === Biodegradation === Biodegradation by microorganisms represents one route for remediation of DBP. For example, Enterobacter species can biodegrade municipal solid waste—where the DBP concentration can be observed at 1500 ppm—with a half-life of 2–3 hours. In contrast, the same species can break down 100% of dimethyl phthalate after a span of six days. The white rot fungus Polyporus brumalis degrades DBP. DBP is leached from landfills. === Physical properties relevant to biodegradation === As reflected by its octanol-water partition coefficient of around 4, it is lipophilic, which means that it is not readily mobilized (dissolved by) water. Nonetheless, dissolved organic compounds (DOC) increase its mobility in landfills. DBP has a low vapor pressure of 2.67 x 10−3 Pa. Thus DBP does not evaporate readily (hence its utility as a plasticizer). The Henry's Law constant is 8.83 x 10−7 atm-m3/mol. == Legislation == DBP is regarded as an endocrine disruptor. === European Union === The use of this substance in cosmetics, including nail polishes, is banned in the European Union under Directive 76/768/EEC 1976. The use of DBP has been restricted in the European Union for use in children's toys since 1999. An EU Risk Assessment has been conducted on DBP and the outcome has now been published in the EU Official Journal. To eliminate a potential risk to plants in the vicinity of processing sites and workers through inhalation, measures are to be taken within the framework of the IPPC Directive (96/61/EC) and the Occupational Exposure Directive (98/24/EC) Also includes the 2004 addendum. Based on urine samples from people of different ages, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) concluded that total exposures to DBP should be further reduced. Under European Union Directive 2011/65/EU revision 2015/863, DBP is limited to max 1000 ppm concentration in any homogenous material. === United States === Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is one of the six phthalic acid esters found on the Priority Pollutant List, which consists of pollutants regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). DBP was added to the California Proposition 65 (1986) list of suspected teratogens in November 2006. It is a suspected endocrine disruptor. It was used in many consumer products, e.g., nail polish, but such usages has declined since around 2006. It was banned in children's toys, in concentrations of 1000 ppm or greater, under section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). == Safety == Phthalates are noncorrosive with low acute toxicity. == See also == Phthalic acid Phthalates Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) Nail polish == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0036 Dibutyl Phthalate and Cosmetics Hazardous substance fact sheet Occupational safety and health guideline for dibutyl phthalate CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards",Butyl phthalate,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IN', -0.009555436670780182), ('DU', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.38719749450683594), ('ĠPERSON', -0.04161689057946205), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.7165990357170813e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023301932960748672)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibutyl_phthalate?utm_source=openai), [oehha.ca.gov](https://oehha.ca.gov/chemicals/di-n-butyl-phthalate?utm_source=openai), [alphachem.biz](https://www.alphachem.biz/di-butyl-phthalate-dbp-properties-uses-and-benefits/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=316, start_index=27, title='Dibutyl phthalate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibutyl_phthalate?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=316, start_index=27, title='Di-n-butyl Phthalate - OEHHA', type='url_citation', url='https://oehha.ca.gov/chemicals/di-n-butyl-phthalate?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=316, start_index=27, title='Di Butyl Phthalate (DBP): Properties, Uses, and Benefits', type='url_citation', url='https://www.alphachem.biz/di-butyl-phthalate-dbp-properties-uses-and-benefits/?utm_source=openai')])"
1434,"('Hydroxyprogesterone caproate', 'Primolut depot', 'Hydroxyprogesterone hexanoate', 'Hormofort', 'Delalutin')",Medical,"Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, sold under the brand name Delalutin among others, is a medication used to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with one baby who have a history of spontaneous preterm birth. In March 2023, the manufacturer, Covis Pharma, agreed to withdraw the drug from the US market. The approval of this drug substance was withdrawn by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2023. In May 2024, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency recommended suspending the marketing authorizations of medications containing 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the European Union. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is a progestin medication which was used to prevent preterm birth in pregnant women with a history of the condition and to treat gynecological disorders. It has also been formulated in combination with estrogens for various indications (brand names Gravibinon and Primosiston) and as a form of long-lasting injectable birth control (brand name Chinese Injectable No. 1). It is not used by mouth and is instead given by injection into muscle or fat. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is generally well tolerated and produces few side effects. Injection site reactions such as pain and swelling are the most common side effect of hydroxyprogesterone caproate. The medication may increase the risk of gestational diabetes when used in pregnant women. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has some antimineralocorticoid activity and no other important hormonal activity. The medication shows a number of differences from natural progesterone. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate was discovered in 1953 and was introduced for medical use in 1954 or 1955. It was marketed in the United States under the brand name Delalutin and throughout Europe under the brand name Proluton. The medication was discontinued in the United States in 1999. However, hydroxyprogesterone caproate was subsequently reintroduced in the United States under the brand name Makena for the treatment of preterm birth in 2011 until the FDA banned 17α-OHPC in 2023. == Medical uses == === Preterm birth === The use of hydroxyprogesterone caproate in pregnancy to prevent preterm birth in women with a history of preterm delivery between 20 weeks and 36 weeks and 6 days is supported by the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine Clinic Guidelines put out in May 2012 as Level I and III evidence, Level A recommendation. Level I evidence refers to a properly powered randomized controlled trial, and level III evidence is support from expert opinion, while a Level A recommendation confers that the recommendation is made based on good and consistent scientific evidence. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate 250 mg IM weekly preferably starting at 16–20 weeks until 36 weeks is recommended. In these women, if the transvaginal ultrasound cervical length shortens to <25 mm at < 24 weeks, cervical cerclage may be offered. In the 2013 study the guideline recommendation is based on, there was also a significant decrease of neonatal morbidity including lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (0 in the treatment group vs 4 in the control), intraventricular hemorrhage (4 in the treatment group compared with 8 in the control for a relative risk of 0.25), and need for supplemental oxygen (14% in the treatment group vs 24% in the placebo for a relative risk of 0.42). Furthermore, this study contained 463 women, 310 of whom received injection. Of these women, 9 had infants with congenital malformations (2%), but there was no consistent pattern and none involved internal organs. There is no evidence of fetal risk with use of hydroxyprogesterone caproate during pregnancy. A review concluded that information about the potential harms was lacking. Three clinical studies in singleton pregnancies of 250 mg/week of intramuscular hydroxyprogesterone caproate have all shown a trend for an increase in pregnancy loss due to miscarriage compared to placebo. One of them, a large National Institutes of Health (NIH) study in 2003, looked at the effect of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injections in women at risk for repeat premature birth and found that the treated group experienced premature birth in 37% versus 55% in the controls. A follow-up study of the offspring showed no evidence that hydroxyprogesterone caproate affected the children in the first years of life. Based on these NIH data, hydroxyprogesterone caproate was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011, as a medication to reduce the risk of premature birth in selected women at risk. The FDA expressed concern about miscarriage at the 2006 advisory committee meeting; the committee voted unanimously that further study was needed to evaluate the potential association of hydroxyprogesterone caproate with increased risk of second trimester miscarriage and stillbirth. A toxicology study in rhesus monkeys resulted in the death of all rhesus fetuses exposed to 1 and 10 times the human dose equivalent of hydroxyprogesterone caproate. As of 2008, hydroxyprogesterone caproate was a category D progestin according to the FDA (that is, there is evidence of fetal harm). There is speculation that the castor oil in the hydroxyprogesterone caproate formulation may not be beneficial for pregnancy. Of note, the above-mentioned NEJM study by Meirs et al. compares the effect of hydroxyprogesterone caproate (with the castor oil component) to castor oil injection as the placebo. A study published in February 2016, found amongst other findings: OPPTIMUM strongly suggests that the efficacy of progesterone in improving outcomes is either non-existent or weak. Given the heterogeneity of the preterm labour syndrome we cannot exclude benefit in specific phenotypic or genotypic subgroups of women at risk. However, the subgroups of women who might benefit do not appear to be easily identifiable by current selection strategies, including cervical length measurement and fibronectin testing. Reassuringly, our study suggests that progesterone is safe for those who wish to take it for preterm birth prophylaxis. The overall rate of maternal or child adverse events was similar in the progesterone and placebo groups. There were few differences in the incidence of adverse secondary outcomes in the two groups, with the exception of a higher rate of renal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory complications in childhood in the progesterone groups. Importantly, the absolute rates of these complications was low. Follow-up of other babies exposed in utero to vaginal progesterone would be helpful in determining whether the increased rate of some renal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory complications is a real effect or a type I error. The journal reviewer made the following notable commentary on the OPPTIMUM study: ""That's it. This story is ended, and nobody need ever use vaginal progesterone again to prevent preterm birth."" A Cochrane review on progestogen for preventing preterm birth concluded that there was little evidence that either vaginal or intramuscular progesterone helped to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a multiple pregnancy. === Gynecological disorders === Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is used in the treatment of threatened miscarriage, gynecological disorders such as dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, fibrocystic breast disease, adenosis, and breast pain. In addition, hydroxyprogesterone caproate is used in the treatment of endometrial cancer and has been found to be significantly effective in extending life in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with the disease. The medication was used widely in the 1950s through the 1970s for such indications, but hydroxyprogesterone caproate more recently has received the most attention in the prevention of preterm birth. === Birth control === Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is available in combination with estradiol valerate as a once-monthly combined injectable contraceptive in a some countries. === Other uses === Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been used as a component of menopausal hormone therapy in women. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia in men, although evidence of effectiveness is marginal and uncertain. It has also been used to treat prostate cancer, at a dosage of 1,500 mg twice per week. The mechanism of action of hydroxyprogesterone caproate in these uses is suppression of testicular androgen production via suppression of luteinizing hormone secretion, which are the result of the progestogenic and antigonadotropic activity of hydroxyprogesterone caproate. However, symptoms of hypogonadism may develop when hydroxyprogesterone caproate is used for this indication, with two-thirds of men reportedly experiencing impotence. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been used as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. Due to micronization, bioidentical progestogens are more commonly used. === Available forms === Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is available alone in the form of ampoules and vials of 125 and 250 mg/mL oil solutions for intramuscular injection (brand names Proluton, Makena). It is also available alone in the form of a 250 mg/mL autoinjector for use by subcutaneous injection (brand name Makena). Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is or was available in combination with estradiol valerate in the form of ampoules and vials of 250 mg/mL OHPC and 5 mg/mL estradiol valerate oil solutions for intramuscular injection (brand names Gravibinon, Chinese Injectable No. 1). The medication is or was available in combination with estradiol benzoate in the form of ampoules of 125–250 mg OHPC and 10 mg estradiol benzoate in oil solution for intramuscular injection (brand name Primosiston) as well.: 1045 In addition, hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been marketed in combination with estradiol dipropionate in the form of 50 mg/mL hydroxyprogesterone caproate and 1 mg/mL estradiol dipropionate (brand name EP Hormone Depot) in Japan. == Contraindications == Contraindications of hydroxyprogesterone caproate include previous or current thrombosis or thromboembolic disease, known or suspected breast cancer, past or present history of other hormone-sensitive cancer, undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding unrelated to pregnancy, cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy, liver tumors or active liver disease, and uncontrolled hypertension. A few relative contraindications also exist for hydroxyprogesterone caproate. == Side effects == Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is generally well tolerated and produces relatively few side effects. Injection site reactions such as pain, soreness, swelling, itching, bruising, and lumps are the most common side effect of hydroxyprogesterone caproate. In contrast to large doses of progesterone however, which produce moderate-to-severe such reactions, hydroxyprogesterone caproate is relatively free from injection site reactions. Side effects of hydroxyprogesterone caproate that occur in greater than or equal to 2% of users include injection site pain (34.8%), injection site swelling (17.1%), urticaria (12.3%), pruritus (7.7%), injection site pruritus (5.8%), nausea (5.8%), injection site nodules (4.5%), and diarrhea (2.3%). Numerically increased rates relative to controls of miscarriage (2.4% vs. 0%), stillbirth (2.0% vs. 1.3%), admission for preterm labor (16.0% vs. 13.8%), preeclampsia or gestational hypertension (8.8% vs. 4.6%), gestational diabetes (5.6% vs. 4.6%), and oligohydramnios (3.6% vs. 1.3%) have been observed with hydroxyprogesterone caproate in clinical trials in which it was given to pregnant women to prevent preterm birth. == Overdose == There have been no reports of overdose of hydroxyprogesterone caproate. In the event of overdose, treatment should be based on symptoms. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been studied in humans at high doses of 2,000 to 5,000 mg per week by intramuscular injection, without safety concerns. == Interactions == Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not likely to affect most cytochrome P450 enzymes at therapeutic concentrations. Drug interaction studies have not been performed with hydroxyprogesterone caproate. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has progestogenic activity, some antimineralocorticoid activity, and no other important hormonal activity. ==== Progestogenic activity ==== Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, also known as 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, is closer to progesterone in terms of structure and pharmacology than most other progestins, and is essentially a pure progestogen – that is, a selective agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) with minimal or no other hormonal activity. However, hydroxyprogesterone caproate has improved pharmacokinetics compared to progesterone, namely a much longer duration with intramuscular injection in oil solution. Administered by intramuscular injection, the endometrial transformation dosage of hydroxyprogesterone caproate per cycle is 250 to 500 mg, and the weekly substitution dosage of hydroxyprogesterone caproate is 250 mg, while the effective dosage of hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the menstrual delay test (Greenblatt) is 25 mg per week. An effective ovulation-inhibiting dosage of hydroxyprogesterone caproate is 500 mg once per month by intramuscular injection. However, the dose of hydroxyprogesterone caproate used in once-a-month combined injectable contraceptives is 250 mg, and this combination is effective for inhibition of ovulation similarly. For comparison, the dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 6α-methyl-17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate), a close analogue of hydroxyprogesterone caproate, used by intramuscular injection in microcrystalline aqueous suspension in once-a-month combined injectable contraceptives, is 25 mg. It has also been said that given by intramuscular injection, 250 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution is equivalent in progestogenic potency to 50 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate in microcrystalline aqueous suspension. Although the elimination half-life of intramuscular hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution in non-pregnant women is about 8 days, the elimination half-life of intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate in microcrystalline aqueous suspension in women is around 50 days. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is also to some degree less potent than the more closely related ester hydroxyprogesterone acetate (OHPA; 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate). 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone (OHP) has weak progestogenic activity, but C17α esterification results in higher progestogenic activity. Of a variety of different esters, the caproate (hexanoate) ester was found to have the strongest progestogenic activity, and this served as the basis for the development of hydroxyprogesterone caproate, as well as other caproate progestogen esters such as gestonorone caproate. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is a much more potent progestogen than 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, but does not have as high of affinity for the PR as progesterone. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has about 26% and 30% of the affinity of progesterone for the human PR-A and PR-B, respectively. The medication was no more efficacious than progesterone in activating these receptors and eliciting associated gene expression in vitro. ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== Due to activation of the PR, hydroxyprogesterone caproate has antigonadotropic effects, or produces suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, and can significantly suppress gonadotropin secretion and gonadal sex hormone production at sufficiently high doses. One study found that hydroxyprogesterone caproate by intramuscular injection at a dosage of 200 mg twice weekly for the first two weeks and then 200 mg once weekly for 12 weeks did not significantly influence urinary excretion of estrogens, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. In another study that used an unspecified dosage of intramuscular hydroxyprogesterone caproate, testosterone secretion was assessed in a single man and was found to decrease from 4.2 mg/day to 2.0 mg/day (or by approximately 52%) by 6 weeks of treatment, whereas secretion of luteinizing hormone remained unchanged in the man. Yet another study found that 3,000 mg/week hydroxyprogesterone caproate by intramuscular injection suppressed testosterone levels from 640 ng/dL to 320–370 ng/dL (by 42–50%) in a single man with prostate cancer, which was similar to the testosterone suppression with cyproterone acetate or chlormadinone acetate. Gestonorone caproate, a closely related progestin to hydroxyprogesterone caproate with about 5- to 10-fold greater potency in humans, was found to suppress testosterone levels by 75% at a dosage of 400 mg/week in men with prostate cancer. For comparison, orchiectomy decreased testosterone levels by 91%. In general, progestins are able to maximally suppress testosterone levels by about 70 to 80%. The antigonadotropic effects of hydroxyprogesterone caproate and hence its testosterone suppression are the basis of the use of hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer in men. Suppression of luteinizing hormone levels by hydroxyprogesterone caproate has also been observed in women. ==== Glucocorticoid activity ==== Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is said not to have any glucocorticoid activity. In accordance, hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been found not to alter cortisol levels in humans even with very high doses by intramuscular injection. This is of relevance because medications with significant glucocorticoid activity suppress cortisol levels due to increased negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been studied in humans at doses as high as 5,000 mg per week by intramuscular injection, with safety and without glucocorticoid effects observed. The medication does interact with the glucocorticoid receptor however; it has about 4% of the affinity of dexamethasone for the rabbit glucocorticoid receptor. But it acts as a partial agonist of the receptor and has no greater efficacy than progesterone in activating the receptor and eliciting associated gene expression in vitro. ==== Other activities ==== As a pure progestogen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate has no androgenic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, or glucocorticoid activity. The absence of androgenic and antiandrogenic activity with hydroxyprogesterone caproate is in contrast to most other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone-derivative progestins. Due to its lack of androgenic properties, similarly to progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate does not have any teratogenic effects on the fetus, making it safe for use during pregnancy. Although hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been described as a pure progestogen, there is evidence that it possesses some antimineralocorticoid activity, similarly to progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. This includes clinically important diuretic effects and reversal of estrogen-induced fluid retention and edema. Unlike progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate and its metabolites are not anticipated to interact with non-genomic receptors such as membrane progesterone receptors or the GABAA receptor. In accordance, hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not thought to possess the neurosteroid activities of progesterone or its associated sedative effects. In relation to cytochrome P450 enzymes, hydroxyprogesterone caproate has no effect on CYP1A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP3A4, but is a modest inducer of CYP2C19. ==== Differences from progesterone ==== There are pharmacodynamic differences between progesterone and hydroxyprogesterone caproate, which may have implications for obstetrical use. These include: Decreased myometrial activity with progesterone in vitro but no effect or increased myometrial activity with hydroxyprogesterone caproate Prevention of cervical ripening with progesterone but unknown effect with hydroxyprogesterone caproate A non-significantly increased rate of stillbirth and miscarriages with hydroxyprogesterone caproate (in one study) A possibly increased incidence of gestational diabetes with hydroxyprogesterone caproate (increased in two studies, no difference in one study) but no such effect with progesterone A significantly increased risk of perinatal adverse effects such as fetal loss and preterm delivery in multiple gestations with hydroxyprogesterone caproate (in two studies) Differences in the metabolism of progesterone and hydroxyprogesterone caproate and differences in the formation and activities of metabolites may be responsible for or involved in these observed biological and pharmacological differences. Progesterone is metabolized by 5α- and 5β-reductases, 3α- and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, and 20α- and 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in various tissues. In target tissues, particularly the cervix and myometrium, these enzymes regulate local progesterone concentrations and can activate or inactivate progesterone signaling. In addition, these enzymes catalyze the formation of metabolites of progesterone such as 5β-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone, which signal through their own non-genomic receptors such as membrane progesterone receptors and the GABAA receptor and have their own important effects in pregnancy. As examples, 5β-dihydroprogesterone has been found to play an important role in suppressing myometrial activity while allopregnanolone has potent sedative and anesthetic effects in the mother and especially the fetus and is involved in fetal nervous system development. In contrast to progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not metabolized by traditional steroid-transforming enzymes and instead is metabolized exclusively via oxidation at the caproate side chain by cytochrome P450 enzymes. As such, it is not thought to have the same tissue-specific activation and inactivation patterns that progesterone does nor the same non-genomic actions that progesterone and its metabolites possess. Further clinical research is anticipated to provide additional data to help clarify the issue of safety with hydroxyprogesterone caproate. In any case, it has been recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that pregnant women treated with hydroxyprogesterone caproate receive counseling about its risks and benefits. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== In animals, the bioavailability of hydroxyprogesterone caproate with intramuscular injection is nearly 100%, but its oral bioavailability is very low at less than 3%. In women, 70 mg/day oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate has similar endometrial potency as 70 mg/day oral OHPA and 2.5 mg/day oral medroxyprogesterone acetate, indicating that oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate and OHPA have almost 30-fold lower potency than medroxyprogesterone acetate via oral administration. Studies on progestogenic endometrial changes with oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women are mixed however, with one finding weak effects with 100 mg/day whereas another found that doses of 250 to 1,000 mg produced no effects. As a result of its low oral potency, hydroxyprogesterone caproate has not been used by the oral route and has instead been administered by intramuscular injection. However, a novel oral formulation of hydroxyprogesterone caproate (developmental code name LPCN-1107) is under development and has been found to be effective, though it required administration twice a day in a clinical study. A depot effect occurs when hydroxyprogesterone caproate is injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously, such that the medication has a prolonged duration of action. Following a single intramuscular injection of 1,000 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate in five women with endometrial cancer, peak levels of hydroxyprogesterone caproate were 27.8 ± 5.3 ng/mL and the time to peak concentrations was 4.6 ± 1.7 (3–7) days. Following 13 weeks of continuous administration of 1,000 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate per week, trough levels of hydroxyprogesterone caproate were 60.0 ± 14 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetic parameters of 250 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate once per week by intramuscular injection have also been studied in pregnant women with singleton and multiple (twin and triplet) gestation. Steady state levels of the medication are achieved within 4 to 12 weeks of administration in pregnant women. The duration of clinical biological effect of hydroxyprogesterone caproate by intramuscular injection has also been studied in women. A single intramuscular injection of 65 to 500 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate in oil solution has been found to have a duration of action of 5 to 21 days in terms of effect in the uterus and on body temperature in women. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been found to possess similar pharmacokinetics, including peak levels, time to peak levels, area-under-the-curve levels (i.e., total exposure), and elimination half-life, with administration via intramuscular injection or subcutaneous autoinjection. However, there was a higher incidence of injection site pain with subcutaneous autoinjection than with intramuscular injection (37.3% vs. 8.2%). ==== Distribution ==== Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is extensively bound to plasma proteins, of which include albumin. Unlike progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate has very low affinity for corticosteroid-binding globulin (less than 0.01% of that of cortisol). Progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone have low affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin, and for this reason, only a very small fraction of them (less than 0.5%) is bound to this protein in the circulation. ==== Metabolism ==== Hydroxyprogesterone caproate appears to be metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. It may also be metabolized by CYP3A7 in fetal liver and the placenta. Unlike progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not metabolized by traditional steroid-transforming enzymes and does not form similar metabolites. The metabolism of hydroxyprogesterone caproate is by reduction, hydroxylation, and conjugation, including glucuronidation, sulfation, and acetylation. The caproate ester of hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not cleaved during metabolism, so 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is not formed from hydroxyprogesterone caproate. As such, hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not a prodrug of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, nor of progesterone. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been found to have an elimination half-life of 7.8 days when given by intramuscular injection in an oil-based formulation to non-pregnant women. Its total duration is said to be 10 to 14 days, which is much longer than the duration of intramuscularly administered progesterone in an oil formulation (2 to 3 days). In pregnant women, the elimination half-life of hydroxyprogesterone caproate appears to be longer, about 16 or 17 days. However, in women pregnant with twins rather than a singlet, the elimination half-life of hydroxyprogesterone caproate was found to be shorter than this, at 10 days. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been detected in pregnant women up to 44 days after the last dose. ==== Elimination ==== Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is eliminated 50% in feces and 30% in urine when given by intramuscular injection to pregnant women. Both the free steroid and conjugates are excreted by these routes, with the conjugates more prominent in feces. ==== Time–concentration curves ==== == Chemistry == Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, also known as 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate or as 17α-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione 17α-hexanoate, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a hexanoate (caproate) ester at the C17α position. Analogues of hydroxyprogesterone caproate include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide), chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone heptanoate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, as well as the caproate esters chlormadinone caproate, gestonorone caproate (norhydroxyprogesterone caproate), medroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol caproate, and methenmadinone caproate. === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of hydroxyprogesterone caproate have been described.: 6 == History == Along with hydroxyprogesterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate was developed by Karl Junkmann of Schering AG in 1953 and was first reported by him in the medical literature in 1954. It was reportedly first marketed in Japan in 1954 or 1955, and was subsequently introduced as Delalutin in the United States in 1956. Due to its much longer duration than parenteral progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate had largely replaced progesterone in clinical practice by 1975. After decades of use, Squibb, the manufacturer, voluntarily withdrew the Delalutin product in the United States in 1999. Renewed interest in hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the United States was sparked with a large NIH-sponsored study in 2003 that found that hydroxyprogesterone caproate reduced the risk of premature birth in selected at-risk pregnant women. With follow-up data showing no evidence of harmful effects on the offspring, the FDA approved the medication Makena, sponsored by KV Pharmaceutical, as an orphan drug in February 2011 to reduce the risk of premature birth in women prior to 37 weeks gestation with a single fetus who had at least one previous premature birth. Under the FDA Accelerated Approval Programs, drugs that fill an unmet need for serious conditions can be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. The pharmaceutical company is required to conduct confirmatory studies to show the drug provides a clinical benefit. The confirmatory trial, the PROLONG study, was completed in 2019 and showed no benefit in preventing preterm birth. The FDA proposed withdrawal of approval for Makena in 2020. == Society and culture == === Names === Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is the generic name of OHPC and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while hydroxyprogesterone hexanoate was its former BANMTooltip British Approved Name. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is often mislabeled as and confused with progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. It should also not be confused with hydroxyprogesterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone heptanoate, or medroxyprogesterone acetate. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is marketed throughout the world under a variety of brand names including Proluton, Proluton Depot, and Makena, among many others. It was also formerly marketed under brand names including Delalutin, Prodrox, and Hylutin among others, but these formulations have been discontinued. It has been marketed under the brand names Gravibinon and Injectable No. 1 (or Chinese Injectable No. 1) in combination with estradiol valerate and under the brand name Primosiston in combination with estradiol benzoate. === Availability === Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is marketed in the United States and throughout Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. It is not available in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, or South Africa, and only veterinary formulations are available in Australia. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is also marketed in combination with estradiol valerate as a combined injectable contraceptive in a number of countries including in South America, Mexico, Japan, and China. It has been marketed as an injectable preparation in combination with estradiol benzoate in some countries as well. === Economics === With the designation of hydroxyprogesterone caproate as an orphan drug by the FDA and approval of Makena in 2011, the price of hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the United States was going to increase from US$15 to US$1,500 for a single dose, or from about US$300 to between US$25,000 and US$30,000 for a typical single month of treatment. This was about a 100-fold increase in cost, with ""minimal added clinical benefit"", and was a strongly criticized pricing strategy. The FDA subsequently announced that compounding pharmacies could continue to sell hydroxyprogesterone caproate at their usual cost of approximately US$10 to US$20 per dose without fear of enforcement action by the agency. KV Pharmaceutical also opted to reduced its price of Makena to US$690 per dose. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate continued to be available at low cost from compounding pharmacies until late 2016, after which time the FDA published new guidance documents prohibiting compounding pharmacies from selling products that are ""essentially copies"" of commercially available drug products. == Research == Cyclical therapy with 150 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate by intramuscular injection was found to be effective in the treatment of 76 women with persistent, treatment-refractory acne in a preliminary study, with 84% responding to the therapy and experiencing a ""good-to-excellent"" improvement in symptoms. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate was studied by Schering for use as a progestogen-only injectable contraceptive at a dose of 250 to 500 mg once a month by intramuscular injection but produced poor cycle control at these doses and was never marketed. Hydroxyprogesterone caproate by itself has been found to have little or no effectiveness in the treatment of breast cancer in women. Conversely, the combination of estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate has been found to be effective in the treatment of breast cancer in women. Initial research based on limited clinical data reported that the breast-cancer response rate with a combination of estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate seemed to be greater than with an estrogen alone (35% vs. 50%). However, subsequent research using the related but more potent progestin gestonorone caproate found that the combination of estradiol valerate and gestonorone caproate had effectiveness that was not significantly different from that of an estrogen alone in the treatment of breast cancer in women. == Veterinary uses == The pharmacokinetics of hydroxyprogesterone caproate in various ungulates including cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goat have been studied. == References == == Further reading ==",Delalutin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.319370302458992e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001358893496217206), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014171558432281017)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyprogesterone_caproate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=107, start_index=9, title='Hydroxyprogesterone caproate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyprogesterone_caproate?utm_source=openai')])"
1435,"('Terbinafine', 'Lamisil', 'Lamasil', '(e)-n,6,6-trimethyl-n-(naphthalen-1-ylmethyl)hept-2-en-4-yn-1-amine', 'Lamisil at')",Medical,"Terbinafine is an antifungal medication used to treat pityriasis versicolor, fungal nail infections, and ringworm including jock itch and athlete's foot. It is either taken by mouth or applied to the skin as a cream or ointment. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, diarrhea, headache, cough, rash, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. Liver injury is, however, unusual. Oral use during pregnancy is not typically recommended. The cream and ointment may result in itchiness but are generally well tolerated. Terbinafine is in the allylamines family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to synthesize ergosterol. It appears to result in fungal cell death. Terbinafine was discovered in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 255th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Terbinafine is mainly effective on molds of the order Onygenales and some yeasts in the genus Candida. As a cream or powder, it is used topically for superficial skin infections such as jock itch (tinea cruris), athlete's foot (tinea pedis), and other types of ringworm (tinea corporis). Tablets by mouth are often prescribed for the treatment of onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection, typically by a dermatophyte or Candida species. Fungal nail infections are located deep under the nail in the cuticle to which topically applied treatments are unable to penetrate in sufficient amounts. The tablets may, rarely, cause hepatotoxicity, so patients are warned of this and may be monitored with liver function tests. Alternatives to oral administration have been studied. Terbinafine may induce or exacerbate subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Persons with lupus erythematosus should first discuss possible risks with their doctor before initiation of therapy. == Side effects == Many side effects and adverse drug reactions have been reported with oral terbinafine hydrochloride, possibly due to its extensive biodistribution and the often extended durations involved in antifungal treatment (longer than two months). A comprehensive list of adverse events associated with terbinafine use includes: Gastrointestinal problems: Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, fullness, abdominal pain, indigestion, dyspepsia, gastritis, cholestasis, flatulence, altered stool colour, abdominal muscular pain Central nervous system or neurological problems: Headaches, dizziness, vertigo, light-headedness, decreased concentration levels, paraesthesia (pins and needles) Hepatic problems: Raised liver enzyme levels, liver inflammation (hepatitis), liver damage, liver failure Immune system problems: Decreased white blood cell counts including pancytopenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and neutropenia, autoimmune reactions such as lupus erythematosus Psychological problems: Depression, anxiety, insomnia, increased or unusual dream activity, malaise Sensory problems: Complete loss of taste (ageusia), decreased taste (hypogeusia) and distorted taste (dysgeusia), often involving a metallic taste sensation and dry mouth, visual disturbances including blurred vision, green vision and double vision. In extremely rare cases, the loss or impairment of taste is permanent Skin problems: Rashes, hives (urticaria), skin irritation, itching, jaundice, Stevens–Johnson syndrome Other side effects: Fatigue, increased heart rate (tachycardia), hair loss (alopecia), decreased red blood cell count (anemia), muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia) In 2015, physicians reported that a patient with an MTHFR enzyme mutation (specifically the C677T variant) had developed an adverse reaction to terbinafine (Lamisil) (headache, fatigue, and dizziness). Genetic testing revealed the MTHFR C677T mutation. It was noted that Lamisil interferes with the methylation cycle and that this can cause side effects in individuals with the MTHFR C677T mutation. == Pharmacology == Like other allylamines, terbinafine inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of squalene to lanosterol. In fungi, lanosterol is then converted to ergosterol; in humans, lanosterol becomes cholesterol. However, as fungi and animals diverged around 1.1 billion years ago - there is enough difference in this enzyme that terbinafine preferentially binds fungal squalene epoxidase, making it selective for inhibiting ergosterol production in fungi without significantly affecting cholesterol production in mammals. This is thought to fatally disrupt the fungal cell membrane. Terbinafine is highly lipophilic and tends to accumulate in hair, skin, nails, and fat cells. This accumulation results in therapeutic levels of terbinafine even after 80 days following one week treatment of 250 mg/day. Different dosing schedules have been proposed such as 500 mg/day for one week or 250 mg/day for two weeks each followed by a drug-free period of two or three weeks, totaling 3 months of treatment including the drug-free periods. Such intermittent dosing schedules appear to be as effective as continuous regimens. == Chemistry == Terbinafine hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol and dichloromethane, soluble in ethanol, and slightly soluble in water. Terbinafine is produced by coupling of 3,3-dimethyl-1-butyne (tert-butylacetylene) with acrolein as a key step, followed by coupling of the product of that reaction, 6,6-dimethylhept-1-en-4-yn-3-ol, with N-methyl-1-naphthalenemethanamine. Multiple patents and publication to alternate syntheses are available. Despite its name it does not contain terbium. == History == Terbinafine first became available in Europe in 1991 and in the United States in 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first generic versions of prescription Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) tablets. The remaining patent or exclusivity for Lamisil expired on June 30, 2007. On September 28, 2007, the FDA stated that terbinafine is now approved for use by children age four and up. The antifungal granules can be sprinkled on a child's food to treat scalp fungus. In the United States the price in 1999 was $547 for a 12-week course; this fell to $10 by 2015, after the patent had expired. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Terbinafine is sold in India as Terboderm by Omega Pharma and Tyza (Abbott Healthcare).

1437,"('Rosmarinic acid', 'Labiatenic acid', 'Rosemary acid', '(r)-rosmarinic acid', 'Rosmarinicacid')","Food, Medical","Rosmarinic acid, named after rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus Spenn.), is a polyphenol constituent of many culinary herbs, including rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus L.), perilla (Perilla frutescens L.), sage (Salvia officinalis L.), mint (Mentha arvense L.), and basil (Ocimum basilicum L.). == History == Rosmarinic acid was first isolated and characterized in 1958 by the Italian chemists Scarpatti and Oriente from rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), after which the acid is named. == Chemistry == Chemically, rosmarinic acid is a caffeic acid ester, with tyrosine providing another phenolic ring via dihydroxyphenyl-lactic acid. It has a molecular mass of 360 daltons. == Natural occurrences == Rosmarinic acid accumulation is shown in hornworts, in the fern family Blechnaceae, and in species of several orders of mono- and dicotyledonous angiosperms. It is found most notably in many Lamiaceae (dicotyledons in the order Lamiales), especially in the subfamily Nepetoideae. It is found in species used commonly as culinary herbs such as Ocimum basilicum (basil), Ocimum tenuiflorum (holy basil), Melissa officinalis (lemon balm), Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary), Origanum majorana (marjoram), Salvia officinalis (sage), thyme and peppermint. It is also found in plants in the family Marantaceae (monocotyledons in the order Zingiberales) such as species in the genera Maranta (Maranta leuconeura, Maranta depressa) and Thalia (Thalia geniculata). Rosmarinic acid and the derivative rosmarinic acid 3′-O-β-D-glucoside can be found in Anthoceros agrestis, a hornwort (Anthocerotophyta). == Metabolism == The biosynthesis of rosmarinic acid uses 4-coumaroyl-CoA from the general phenylpropanoid pathway as a hydroxycinnamoyl donor. The hydroxycinnamoyl acceptor substrate comes from the shikimate pathway: shikimic acid, quinic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid derived from L-tyrosine. Thus, chemically, rosmarinic acid is an ester of caffeic acid with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid, but biologically, it is formed from 4-coumaroyl-4′-hydroxyphenyllactate. Rosmarinate synthase is an enzyme that uses caffeoyl-CoA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid to produce CoA and rosmarinate. Hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase is also an enzyme involved in this biosynthesis. == Uses == When extracted from plant sources or synthesized in manufacturing, rosmarinic acid may be used in foods or beverages as a flavoring, in cosmetics, or as a dietary supplement. == References ==",Rosmarinic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -2.6776029699249193e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0005542247672565281), (' PERSONAL', -1.9385402993066236e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.0007085673278197646), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.007052172906696796), ('ĠPERSON', -0.0012584156356751919), ('AL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('ĠCARE', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03807664290070534)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.6931476593017578), (' PERSONAL', -0.05052071809768677), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosmarinic_acid,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25620368/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29110743/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12482446/ ', [])"

Scientists at 3M's pharmaceuticals division discovered the drug and 3M obtained the first FDA approval in 1997. As of 2015, imiquimod is generic and is available worldwide under many brands. In 2021, it was the 290th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Imiquimod is a patient-applied cream prescribed to treat genital warts, Bowens disease (squamous cell carcinoma in situ), and, secondary to surgery, for basal cell carcinoma, as well as actinic keratosis. Imiquimod 5% cream is indicated for the topical treatment of: external genital and perianal warts (condylomata acuminata) in adults; small superficial basal-cell carcinomas (sBCCs) in adults; clinically typical, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic actinic keratoses (AKs) on the face or scalp in immunocompetent adults when size or number of lesions limit the efficacy and / or acceptability of cryotherapy and other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate. Imiquimod 3.75% cream is indicated for the topical treatment of clinically typical, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic, visible or palpable actinic keratosis of the full face or balding scalp in immunocompetent adults when other topical treatment options are contraindicated or less appropriate. == Side effects == Side effects include local inflammatory reactions, such as blisters, a burning sensation, skin redness, dry skin, itching, skin breakdown, skin crusting or scabbing, skin drainage, skin flaking or scaling, skin ulceration, sores, swelling, as well as systemic reactions, such as fever, ""flu-like"" symptoms, headache, and tiredness. People who have had an organ transplant and are taking immune-suppressing drugs should not use imiquimod. == Mechanism of action == Imiquimod yields profound antitumoral activity by acting on several immunological levels synergistically. Imiquimod stimulates the innate immune system by activating toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), commonly involved in pathogen recognition. Cells activated by imiquimod via TLR-7 secrete cytokines (primarily interferon-α (IFN-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)). There is evidence that imiquimod, when applied to skin, can lead to the activation of Langerhans cells, which subsequently migrate to local lymph nodes to activate the adaptive immune system. Other cell types activated by imiquimod include natural killer cells, macrophages and B-lymphocytes. Imiquimod exerts its effect by increasing levels of the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr). In experiments, blocking OGFr function with siRNA technology resulted in loss of any antiproliferative effect of imiquimod. == History == Scientists at 3M's pharmaceutical division discovered imiquimod as part of a program to discover inhibitors of herpes simplex virus replication based on a known adenine derivative.: 369–372 3M obtained the first FDA approval for it in 1997 as a treatment for external genital and perianal warts under the brand ""Aldara"". In 2004, 3M obtained FDA approval to market imiquimod as a treatment for superficial basal cell carcinoma. In 2006, 3M sold its pharmaceutical business in the Americas to Graceway Pharmaceuticals, its European pharmaceutical business to Meda AB, and its pharmaceutical business in other territories to two private equity firms. Graceway declared bankruptcy in 2011, after the expiration of the patents on imiquimod, and its assets, including the rights to imiquimod branding and approvals in the Americas, were purchased by Medicis Pharmaceutical. Imiquimod 5% was approved for medical use in the European Union in September 1998. Imiquimod 3.75% was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2012. As of 2015, imiquimod is generic and is available worldwide under many brands. == Research == One randomized double-blind Phase III clinical study found clearance of genital warts (an FDA-approved indication) improved from 9% with placebo to 24.9% with 3.75% imiquimod cream applied for up to eight weeks. Imiquimod has been tested for treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Two large randomized controlled trials, however, found no evidence of effectiveness of imiquimod in treating children with molluscum contagiosum, and concerning adverse effects were also noted. These disprove earlier anecdotal claims and smaller, less reliable studies. Imiquimod has also been tested for treatment of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, common warts (a 2012 Cochrane review found no randomized controlled trials), plantar warts, warts in people with suppressed immune systems, flat warts on face and neck, and warts under and around fingernails and toenails. As of 2014, insufficient evidence exists to recommend treatment of warts (other than genital warts) with imiquimod, due to the small size of and lack of controls in existing studies. == References == == External links == DermNet treatments/imiquimod",Beselna,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06423957645893097), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00875609926879406)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Accumulated in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrated that napabucasin showed significant anticancer effects in various types of cancers. Napabucasin inhibits cancer cell proliferation, induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and suppresses metastasis and relapse. Such anticancer activities of napabucasin mainly rely on the inhibition of cancer stemness by targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and its related gene inhibition. However, several novel molecular targets for napabucasin, such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), have been reported. Napabucasin represents a promising anticancer lead for multiple cancers. In this mini review, the anticancer potential and the molecular mechanism of napabucasin will be briefly highlighted. The immune resistance of tumor microenvironment (TME) causes immune checkpoint blockade therapy inefficient to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Emerging strategies of using chemotherapy regimens to reverse the immune resistance provide the promise for promoting the efficiency of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The induction of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in tumor cells evokes the adaptive immunity and remodels the immunosuppressive TME. In this study, we report that mitoxantrone (MIT, a chemotherapeutic drug) activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway of HCC cells. We provide an approach to augment the efficacy of MIT using a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor called napabucasin (NAP). We prepare an aminoethyl anisamide (AEAA)-targeted polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based nanocarrier for co-delivery of MIT and NAP. The resultant co-nanoformulation can elicit the cGAS-STING-based immune responses to reshape the immunoresistant TME in the mice orthotopically grafted with HCC. Consequently, the resultant co-nanoformulation can promote anti-PD-1 antibody for suppressing HCC development, generating long-term survival, and inhibiting tumor recurrence. This study reveals the potential of MIT to activate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, and confirms the feasibility of nano co-delivery for MIT and NAP on achieving HCC chemo-immunotherapy. Napabucasin (BBI608) is an orally administered small molecule that blocks stem cell activity in cancer cells by targeting the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway is over-activated in many types of cancer and has been shown to be an important pathway in cancer stem cell-mediated propagation of cancer. Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of cancer cells considered to be the primary source of tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to conventional therapies, and thus, responsible for cancer relapse. This review describes the clinical development program of this first-in-class cancer stemness inhibitor, including preclinical discovery, early clinical trials, current phase III clinical trial evaluation, and future therapeutic combinations. The therapeutic potential of napabucasin was first reported in a preclinical study that demonstrated the potent anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activity of napabucasin in several different cancer types, both in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models, napabucasin was effective both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents; in particular, synergy was observed with paclitaxel in vivo. Napabucasin clinical trials have demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity as monotherapy and in combination with conventional therapeutics, with no significant pharmacokinetic interactions when used in combination therapies. Adverse events attributed to napabucasin have been predominantly mild, although some patients have experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal adverse events. More severe adverse events required reduced or discontinued dosing of napabucasin or medication to reverse or manage symptoms. In conclusion, napabucasin may prove useful in targeting cancer stem cells, with the potential to suppress metastasis and prevent relapse in patients with varying cancer types.",Napabucasin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6240566083070007e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000481132126878947), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006730860564857721)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([annalsofoncology.org](https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534%2819%2966214-9/fulltext?utm_source=openai), [thelancet.com](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370%2823%2900074-3/fulltext?utm_source=openai), [thelancet.com](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253%2818%2930009-8/abstract?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=376, start_index=9, title='Phase 1b/II study of cancer stemness inhibitor napabucasin in combination with FOLFIRI +/− bevacizumab (bev) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients (pts) - Annals of Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534%2819%2966214-9/fulltext?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=376, start_index=9, title='Napabucasin plus nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine versus nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine in previously untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma: an adaptive multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3, superiority trial - eClinicalMedicine', type='url_citation', url='https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370%2823%2900074-3/fulltext?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=376, start_index=9, title='Napabucasin versus placebo in refractory advanced colorectal cancer: a randomised phase 3 trial - The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253%2818%2930009-8/abstract?utm_source=openai')])"

The dosage was 12.5 to 200 mg per day. Its onset of action is slow and several weeks of continuous administration are required for the effects to develop fully upon initiation of treatment. The decrease in blood pressure with pargyline is described as impressive and is especially strong when standing. However, the blood pressure decrease with pargyline is often difficult to control adequately. Pargyline shares its mechanism of action, monoamine oxidase inhibition, with a class of antidepressants that includes phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and isocarboxazid, among others. However, unlike other MAOIs, pargyline itself was never licensed for treatment of depression. In any case, the drug was studied in the treatment of depression and was advertised in the 1960s as an antihypertensive agent that also ""brightens emotional outlook"". == Side effects == Orthostatic hypotension (excessively low blood pressure when standing or standing up) is a prominent side effect of pargyline. Other side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, headaches, increased appetite, nervousness, insomnia, agitation, sedation, manic reactions, and psychotic reactions. == Interactions == Pargyline has the potential for serious food and drug interactions due to its MAOI actions. This includes hypertensive crisis with intake of norepinephrine releasing agents like tyramine, amphetamine, and ephedrine. Tyramine is found in high concentrations in certain cheeses and other foods and can result in hypertensive crisis often referred to as the ""cheese reaction"". Episodes of hypertensive crisis can be severe or fatal and this has greatly limited the clinical use of pargyline. Hypertensive crisis with pargyline is treated intravenously with sympatholytic alpha blockers like phentolamine. Combination of pargyline and the antihypertensive agent methyldopa has been found to result in intense and potentially fatal central nervous system excitation in rodents. This has been said to resemble the effects of amphetamine overdose. The interaction appears to be due to inhibition by pargyline of the metabolism of normally short-lived methyldopa metabolites like α-methyldopamine and α-methylnorepinephrine that act as potent catecholamine releasing agents. Visual hallucinations have been reported with coadministration of pargyline and methyldopa in humans. As such, use of methyldopa in combination with pargyline and other MAOIs is contraindicated. Pargyline is also a disulfiram-like drug and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor similarly to disulfiram and can produce alcohol intolerance-type reactions with alcohol. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Monoamine oxidase inhibition ==== Pargyline is a non-selective and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), or an inhibitor of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Pargyline is said to have slight preference or selectivity for inhibition of MAO-B over MAO-A (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 8.20 nM and 11.52 nM, respectively). Using rodent systems however, pargyline showed 2- to 356-fold selectivity for MAO-B inhibition over MAO-A inhibition in different studies (compared to 16- to 6401-fold selectivity with selegiline). In relation to the preceding, pargyline has been referred to as a so-called semi-selective MAO-B inhibitor. It has also been found to show some selectivity for MAO-B inhibition with a single dose but results in non-selective inhibition with continuous administration. Pargyline produces its antihypertensive effects via MAO inhibition. However, the exact mechanism of action by which this occurs is unclear. Pargyline and other MAOIs inhibit the metabolism of norepinephrine and cause accumulation of norepinephrine in the heart, brain, and other adrenergic tissues. Some possibilities include diminished responsiveness to norepinephrine via increased norepinephrine levels in blood vessels and blockade blockade of the release of norepinephrine from peripheral sympathetic neurons. Another possibility is that pargyline increases levels of false neurotransmitters like octopamine and tyramine, which are weaker pressor agents than norepinephrine. However, the involvement of octopamine in the hypotensive effects of pargyline and other MAOIs is uncertain. Yet another possibility is that the hypotensive effects may be due to accumulation of N-acetylserotonin, which shows antihypertensive effects in animals. As of 2018, the precise mechanism of the hypotensive effects of MAOIs still remains unresolved. ==== Other actions ==== In addition to its actions as an MAOI, pargyline has been found to bind with high affinity to the I2 imidazoline receptor. This receptor has been found to actually be an allosteric site on the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme. A high dose of pargyline (10 mg/kg) has been found to stimulate locomotor activity, a psychostimulant-like effect, in certain behavioral tests in rats. This might be due to its MAOI activity and increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens or might be related to stimulant-like effects of its metabolites including benzylamine, N-methylbenzylamine, and/or N-propargylbenzylamine. However, no studies on this matter have been conducted. Certain other MAOIs, like iproniazid, phenelzine, pheniprazine, and tranylcypromine, but not nialamide, have likewise been found to produce amphetamine- and psychostimulant-like effects at high doses in animals. Several of these agents are known to metabolize into phenethylamines and amphetamines with catecholamine-releasing activity or to have intrinsic catecholamine-releasing actions of their own. Benzylamine derivatives have been found to act as catecholamine reuptake inhibitors. Pargyline has been found to act as an irreversible aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. It is a disulfiram-like drug and can produce intolerance-type reactions with alcohol similarly to disulfiram. The ALDH inhibition of pargyline appears to be mediated by its metabolites, namely propiolaldehyde, but also propargylamine and benzylamine. Pargyline has been found to act as a reversible inhibitor of diamine oxidase (DAO)-mediated putrescine metabolism. It has additionally been found to act as a weak inhibitor of arylalkyl acylamidase and of histamine N-methyltransferase. In contrast to selegiline, pargyline does not appear to show catecholaminergic activity enhancer (CAE)-like effects. Similarly, pargyline is not an agonist of the mouse TAAR1. === Pharmacokinetics === Pargyline has high lipophilicity and is predicted to cross the blood–brain barrier. The drug has been shown to elevate brain monoamine levels, for instance of serotonin norepinephrine, dopamine, and trace amines, in animals. Pargyline is N-demethylated and N-depropargylated by CYP2E1 to form arylalkylamine and other metabolites including benzylamine, N-methylbenzylamine, and N-propargylbenzylamine, among others. These metabolites may then undergo additional metabolism, for instance hydroxylation and oxidation. It also forms propiolaldehyde and propargylamine. N‐Propargylbenzylamine, which is a major active metabolite of pargyline, is a potent and selective inhibitor of MAO-B in vivo in rats and may contribute importantly to MAO-B inhibition with pargyline. Other metabolites, like propiolaldehyde, are potent ALDH inhibitors. == Chemistry == Pargyline is an derivative of benzylamine and is also known as N-methyl-N-propargylbenzylamine. It is used pharmaceutically as the hydrochloride salt. Pargyline is a lipophilic compound, with a predicted log P of about 2.1. Pargyline preceded and is structurally related to the selective and irreversible MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (deprenyl; (R)-(–)-N-methyl-N-propargylamphetamine). Clorgyline (MB-9302; N-methyl-N-propargyl-3-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propylamine), another structural analogue of pargyline, is a selective and irreversible MAO-A inhibitor. == History == Pargyline was first described in the scientific literature in 1960. It was brought to market in the United States and the United Kingdom by Abbott Laboratories in 1963 as an antihypertensive drug. It was one of several MAOIs introduced in the 1960s including nialamide, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine. By 2007, the drug was discontinued. As of 2014, there were no generic versions available in the United States. It continued to be available in the United States as late as 2000. == Society and culture == === Names === Pargyline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt is pargyline hydrochloride. The drug is also known by the developmental code name MO-911. Marketed brand names of pargyline have included Eutonyl and Eutron. == Research == Pargyline has been studied in the treatment of depression. == References ==",Pargyline,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.451116051815916e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6331539882230572e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019407500512897968)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pargyline ', [])"
1441,"('Phenprocoumon', 'Phenprocoumarol', 'Phenprocoumarole', 'Liquamar', 'Marcumar')",Medical,"Phenprocoumon (marketed under the brand names Marcoumar, Marcumar and Falithrom) is a long-acting anticoagulant to be taken by mouth, and a coumarin derivative. It acts as a vitamin K antagonist and inhibits blood clotting (coagulation) by blocking synthesis of coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X. It is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders such as heart attacks and pulmonary (lung) embolism. The most common adverse effect is bleeding. The drug interacts with a large number of other medications, including aspirin and St John's Wort. It is the standard coumarin used in Germany, Austria, and other European countries. == Medical uses == Phenprocoumon is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders after heart bypass surgery and myocardial infarction (heart attack), long-term treatment of myocardial infarction with increased risk of thromboembolism, thrombophilia (abnormal blood clotting), antithrombin III deficiency, atrial fibrillation (a kind of abnormal heart rhythm) with artery embolisms, after venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and artificial heart valve surgery, as well as chronic ventricular aneurysm (bulging of the heart wall) and congestive cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart). === Dosing === When phenprocoumon therapy is started, the clotting tendency of the blood is measured daily by determining the prothrombin time, more specifically the international normalized ratio (INR). After the desired INR has been reached, which typically takes five to six days, intervals between measurements are increased to twice or three times a week for a week or two, then to two to four weeks if the patient is stable. INR monitoring continues throughout the therapy, often for life. This is necessary because people need different doses depending on the genetic makeup of their enzymes, activity of coagulation factors, vitamin K concentrations in the body, other drugs, and diet. If a fast onset of action is needed, as after an acute thromboembolism, phenprocoumon therapy has to be accompanied with a subcutaneous or intravenous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for the first 36 to 72 hours. Similarly, if the blood thinning effect has to be stopped before a surgery, phenprocoumon is paused up to two weeks beforehand, and the therapy gap is ""bridged"" with LMWH until after the surgery. Alternatively, phenprocoumon can be antagonised with vitamin K, for example before an unplanned surgery, or when severe bleeding occurs after overdosing. == Contraindications == Phenprocoumon is contraindicated when bleeding risks exceed the potential benefits, for example in people with severe bleeding diathesis, peptic ulcers, endocarditis, aortic aneurysm, brain aneurysm, serious injuries, or after brain surgery. During pregnancy, it is contraindicated except to prevent coagulation in women with life-threatening heparin intolerance. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effect is bleeding. It occurs in 5–25% of patients and ranges from harmless nosebleeds to life-threatening bleeding in the brain, gut wall, adrenal glands, pleural cavity, pericardium, or subdural space. Other side effects are uncommon and include headache, nausea, reversible hair loss, purple toe syndrome, and allergic rashes. A rare but severe adverse effect is warfarin necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissue during the first days of treatment. == Overdose == Mild cases of overdosing are characterised by minor bleeding and/or bruising; they can usually be controlled by reducing the dose. Taking a large amount of phenprocoumon at once can lead to brain edema during the first 24 hours, followed by reduced blood clotting and (possibly severe) bleeding, including blood in the stool or urine. Bleeding into the brain can lead to disorientation or unconsciousness, calling for immediate medical intervention. Overdosing for an extended time period is toxic for the liver parenchyma, the kidneys' glomeruli, and blood vessels. == Interactions == Due to its narrow therapeutic index, the fact that it can only be eliminated from the body after inactivation by the liver enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, and its high plasma protein binding (see below), phenprocoumon has significant interactions with a large number of other drugs and with some kinds of food. Some examples are: CYP2C9 inducers decrease its concentrations and therefore its anticoagulant effect: rifampicin, St John's wort. CYP3A4 inducers also decrease its anticoagulant effect: also rifampicin and St John's wort. CYP2C9 inhibitors increase its concentrations and therefore the risk for bleeding: amiodarone. CYP3A4 inhibitors also increase the risk for bleeding: clarithromycin, ketoconazole, grapefruit juice, also amiodarone. Substances that displace phenprocoumon from its plasma protein binding increase its free blood concentrations and therefore increase the risk for bleeding: a number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially aspirin. Antibiotics increase the risk for bleeding, probably because they kill vitamin K producing bacteria of the gut flora: possibly all antibiotics; documented for amoxicillin and quinolone antibiotics among others. Food containing vitamin K, such as cabbage, spinach and broccoli, might reduce the drug's effectivity. High doses of vitamin K antagonise phenprocoumon 20 to 24 hours after ingestion or infusion; the effect lasts for 7 to 10 days. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Phenprocoumon is an inhibitor of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). Vitamin K is needed to activate the coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X and the anticoagulation factors protein C and protein S, in which process it turns into vitamin K 2,3-epoxide. This is then recycled to vitamin K in a process involving VKOR. Inhibiting this enzyme effectively creates a vitamin K deficiency, blocking activation of the coagulation factors. After 36 to 72 hours, the available activated factors have been depleted (used up) by the coagulation system, and the anticoagulation takes effect. === Pharmacokinetics === The drug is taken by mouth and quickly and completely absorbed from the gut. When in the bloodstream, 99% are bound to plasma proteins (mainly albumin). The substance is metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to various hydroxyl derivatives, and subsequently conjugated to glucuronic acid to a small extent. The glucuronide metabolites partly undergo enterohepatic circulation. All metabolites, as well as the parent substance, are excreted predominantly via the kidney and urine, only 15% in unchanged form. The terminal half-life is 150 hours (6 to 7 days) on average with large differences between people. The long half-life means that drug concentrations take about four weeks to reach a steady state after therapy is started; the anticoagulation lasts at least 7 to 10 days after therapy is stopped; and dose changes need several days to take effect. The drug passes the placenta and also into breast milk. === Pharmacogenomics === Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 can change the metabolization speed of phenprocoumon. Polymorphisms of VKORC1, the gene coding for subunit 1 of vitamin K epoxide reductase, can influence the dose needed to achieve the desired INR. == Chemistry == Phenprocoumon, a 4-hydroxycoumarin structurally similar to warfarin, is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a characteristic smell. It is practically insoluble in water, but soluble in chloroform, ethanol, methanol, and aqueous alkali hydroxide solutions. It is an acid (pKa = 4.2) and melts between 177 and 181 °C (351 and 358 °F). The substance is used as a racemic mixture; the S(−)-form is significantly more potent as an anticoagulant. == Comparison with other anticoagulants == === Warfarin === Warfarin and phenprocoumon have the same mechanism of action, similar uses, side effects and interactions, and are also chemically similar. For both drugs, the INR needs to be carefully monitored. Both are racemates, and the S(−)-enantiomers are significantly more potent than the respective R(+)-enantiomers. There are however pharmacokinetic differences: Warfarin is predominantly metabolized via the enzyme CYP2C9, while for phenprocoumon CYP3A4 plays the more important role. The average half-life of warfarin is 40 hours, that of phenprocoumon 150 hours, almost four times as long. Both drugs show large differences in half-life between individuals. === Direct factor Xa inhibitors === Direct factor Xa inhibitors (xabans) such as rivaroxaban and apixaban are a newer class of blood thinners. They have been in therapeutic use since about 2010, while phenprocoumon was developed in the 1950s. Xabans have a fast onset and cessation of action, wide therapeutic index, and relatively low potential for interactions with other drugs and food. There are standard dosing schemes, and INR monitoring is neither necessary nor meaningful. On the other hand, forgetting one phenprocoumon dose does not change the INR much because of its long half-life, while forgetting a xaban dose means the patient is not reliably anticoagulated for about a day. INR monitoring under phenprocoumon makes it easier to detect problems such as medication errors or interactions with drugs or food. Also, there have been concerns that patients' therapy adherence may not be as reliable if they are not regularly monitored by their physicians. Finally, xabans are significantly more expensive than phenprocoumon and warfarin. === Low-molecular-weight heparins === LMWHs also have a fast onset of action, wide therapeutic index, standard dosing schemes, and a very low potential for interactions. They can, however, only be given by injection or infusion, rendering them impractical for long-term use at home. == History == The substance was developed in 1953 by Alfred Winterstein and his team, and patented in 1955 by Hoffmann-La Roche. == References == == External links == Diseases Database (DDB): 29943",Marcumar,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.667406266089529e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0012404375011101365)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenprocoumon?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Phenprocoumon', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenprocoumon?utm_source=openai')])"
1442,"('Tricyclazole', 'Tricyclazone', 'Blascide', 'Beam', 'Sivic')","Food, Medical"," Tricyclazole (8-methyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3]benzothiazole) is a fungicide used globally on rice for treatment of the seasonal rice blast disease. Human exposure to this fungicide can occur via dietary and nondietary routes. In a battery of in vitro assays, tricyclazole did not induce gene mutations in bacteria (Ames test) or at the Hprt locus of CHO cells. It was also negative for the induction of micronuclei in human lymphocyte cultures and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in primary rat hepatocyte. Paradoxically, tricyclazole induced a mutagenic response at the Tk locus of the mouse lymphoma L5178Ycells (MLA), which occurred equally among small/large colony phenotypes. Selection of preexisting mutants leading to a false-positive response in the MLA was ruled out in follow-up experiments. In vivo, tricyclazole was negative in the rat liver UDS assay, mouse bone micronucleus test and a transgenic (MutaMouse) gene mutation assay in glandular stomach, liver, and kidney. Other supporting evidence for the lack of genotoxicity for tricyclazole comes from an in vivo study for sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamsters, and a dominant lethal test in the male germ cells of mice. The combined evidence from the genotoxicity studies together with the evidence from toxicokinetic, carcinogenicity, developmental, and reproductive toxicity studies confirm that mutagenicity does not occur in relevant in vivo systems. Data were also compared to potential animal and human exposure, mechanistic data on biological targets and data on analogues, confirming adequacy of the available data for hazard identification and risk assessment. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 61:300-315, 2020. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Herein, we publish data from regulatory studies investigating the oral ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) of tricyclazole in vivo, in silico and in vitro. The oral route is relevant to human dietary exposure assessment. Tricyclazole is readily absorbed and highly bioavailable in rodents (>86%) with indication of saturation of absorption at high doses. Enterohepatic recirculation is evident. Excretion occurs quickly both via urinary (31-64%) and faecal routes (39-65%), with substantial biliary elimination in the rat (≥58%). The tricyclazole-derived radioactivity is distributed to major organs, including those investigated in in vivo genotoxicity studies (liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow). There is no evidence of bioaccumulation. Metabolism is extensive (approximately 30 metabolites), with the liver being identified as the primary metabolism organ with Phase I and II enzymes involved. Several metabolites are formed following an initial cleavage of the central thiazole ring, with no loss of free triazole from the remaining phenyl ring. A group of 4 metabolites derive from an initial oxidation step with the formation of the tricyclazole-alcohol, a relevant crop metabolite, and account for up to 13% of the administered dose. In vitro metabolism, investigated with liver microsomes, confirmed that humans do not form unique metabolites. Tricyclazole is widely used in agriculture as a pesticide, but its toxicity in vertebrates is currently poorly evaluated. In this study, we used zebrafish to assess the toxicity of tricyclazole. We found that tricyclazole induces liver damage, or hepatotoxicity, in zebrafish, during both development and adulthood. In embryos, we found that tricyclazole affected the liver development rather than other endodermal tissues such as gut and pancreas. In both embryos and adult zebrafish livers, tricyclazole disrupted the relationship between oxidant and antioxidant system and resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) overload. Meanwhile, it triggered hepatocyte apoptosis and disturbed carbohydrate/lipid metabolism and energy demand systems. These results suggested that tricyclazole could cause severe consequences for vertebrate hepatic development and function.",Tricyclazole,PUBMED,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0005530327325686812), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('IN', -0.0341649055480957), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.38693612813949585), ('ĠFOOD', -0.015306624583899975), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011094193905591965)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([sitem.herts.ac.uk](https://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/ppdb/en/Reports/660.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=107, start_index=12, title='Tricyclazole (Ref: EL 291)', type='url_citation', url='https://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/ppdb/en/Reports/660.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

During research and development, pramocaine hydrochloride stood out among a series of alkoxy aryl alkamine ethers as an especially good topical local anesthetic agent. Pharmacologic study revealed it to be potent and of low acute and subacute toxicity, well tolerated by most mucous membranes and of a low sensitizing index in humans. Like other local anesthetics, pramocaine decreases the permeability of neuronal membranes to sodium ions, blocking both initiation and conduction of nerve impulses. Depolarization and repolarization of excitable neural membranes is thus inhibited, leading to numbness. == Use == Topical anesthetics are used to relieve pain and itching caused by conditions such as sunburn or other minor burns, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and minor cuts and scratches. The hydrochloride salt form of pramocaine is water-soluble. Pramocaine is a common component of over the counter hemorrhoid preparations. Pramocaine is also included in some topical antibiotics like Neosporin Plus Pain Relief used to treat or prevent infections due to its pain relieving effects. However, there is no additional antibiotic effect compared to antibiotics without pramocaine. == Synthesis == The ether formation between hydroquinone (1) and 1-bromobutane (2) gives 4-butoxyphenol [122-94-1] (3).

1444,"('Primidone', 'Primaclone', 'Mysoline', 'Lepimidin', 'Liskantin')",Medical,"Primidone, sold under various brand names (including Mysoline), is a barbiturate medication that is used to treat partial and generalized seizures and essential tremors. It is taken by mouth. Its common side effects include sleepiness, poor coordination, nausea, and loss of appetite. Severe side effects may include suicide and psychosis. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the fetus. Primidone is an anticonvulsant of the barbiturate class; however, its long-term effect in raising the seizure threshold is likely due to its active metabolite, phenobarbital. The drug’s other active metabolite is phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA). Primidone was approved for medical use in the United States in 1954. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 269th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Epilepsy === It is licensed for generalized tonic-clonic and complex partial seizures in the United Kingdom. In the United States, primidone is approved for adjunctive (in combination with other drugs) and monotherapy (by itself) use in generalized tonic-clonic seizures, simple partial seizures, complex partial seizures, and myoclonic seizures. In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, it is a second-line therapy, reserved for when the valproates or lamotrigine do not work and when the other second-line therapy, acetazolamide, does not work. The usual dose for seizure disorder is titrated from 100-125 mg/day up to a maintenance dose of 750-1,500 mg/day (maximum daily dosage is 2 g). Open-label case series have suggested that primidone is effective in the treatment of epilepsy. Primidone has been compared to phenytoin, phenobarbital, mephobarbital, ethotoin, metharbital, and mephenytoin. In adult comparison trials, primidone has been found to be just as effective. === Essential tremor === Primidone is not indicated for essential tremor but is often used as a first-line therapy for essential tremor, as is propranolol. In tremor amplitude reduction, it is just as effective as propranolol, reducing it by 50%. Both drugs are well studied for this condition, unlike other therapies, and are recommended for initial treatment. A low-dose therapy (50 mg/day) is just as good as a high-dose therapy (750 mg/day). The usual dose range is 120 to 250 mg/day in two divided doses or as one single dose. Primidone is not the only anticonvulsant used for essential tremor; the others include topiramate and gabapentin. Other pharmacological agents include alprazolam, clonazepam, atenolol, sotalol, nadolol, clozapine, nimodipine, and botulinum toxin A. Many of these drugs were less effective than primidone. Only propranolol has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial. === Psychiatric disorders === In 1965, Monroe and Wise reported using primidone along with a phenothiazine derivative antipsychotic and chlordiazepoxide in treatment-resistant psychosis. What is known is that 10 years later, Monroe went on to publish the results of a meta-analysis of two controlled clinical trials on people displaying out-of-character and situationally inappropriate aggression, who had abnormal EEG readings, and who responded poorly to antipsychotics; one of the studies was specifically mentioned as involving psychosis patients. When they were given various anticonvulsants, not only did their EEGs improve, but so did the aggression. In March 1993, S.G. Hayes of the University of Southern California School of Medicine reported that 9 out of 27 people (33%) with either treatment-resistant depression or treatment-resistant bipolar disorder had a permanent positive response to primidone. A plurality of subjects was also given methylphenobarbital in addition to or instead of primidone. == Adverse effects == Primidone can cause drowsiness, listlessness, ataxia, visual disturbances, nystagmus, headache, and dizziness. These side effects are the most common, reportedly occurring in more than 1% of users. Transient nausea and vomiting are also common side effects. Dupuytren's contracture, a disease of the fasciae in the palm and fingers that permanently bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, 14 years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that the severity of the epilepsy did not matter. Only one-quarter of the women were affected, though, vs. half of the men. Critcheley et al., 35 years later, reported a correlation between how long a patient had had epilepsy and his or her chance of getting Dupuytren's contracture. They suspected that this was due to phenobarbital therapy, and that the phenobarbital was stimulating peripheral tissue growth factors. Dupuytren's contracture is almost exclusively found in Caucasians, especially those of Viking descent, and highest rates are reported in northern Scotland, Norway, Iceland, and Australia. It has also been associated with alcoholism, heavy smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical trauma (either penetrating in nature or due to manual labor), tuberculosis, and HIV. People with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely to get this, and Drs. Hart and Hooper speculate that this is also true of gout due to the use of allopurinol. This is the only susceptibility factor that is generally agreed upon. Anticonvulsants do not seem to increase the incidence of Dupuytren's contracture in people of color. Primidone has other cardiovascular effects in beyond shortening the QT interval. Both phenobarbital and it are associated with elevated serum levels (both fasting and six hours after methionine loading) of homocysteine, an amino acid derived from methionine. This is almost certainly related to the low folate levels reported in primidone users. Elevated levels of homocysteine have been linked to coronary heart disease. In 1985, both drugs were also reported to increase serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A and B. It was first reported to exacerbate hepatic porphyria in 1975. In 1981, phenobarbital, one of primidone's metabolites, was shown to only induced a significant porphyrin level at high concentrations in vitro. It can also cause elevations in hepatic enzymes such as gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase. Less than 1% of primidone users experience a rash. Compared to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin, this is very low. The rate is comparable to that of felbamate, vigabatrin, and topiramate. Primidone also causes exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Primidone, along with phenytoin and phenobarbital, is one of the anticonvulsants most heavily associated with bone diseases such as osteoporosis, osteopenia (which can precede osteoporosis), osteomalacia, and fractures. The populations usually said to be most at risk are institutionalized people, postmenopausal women, older men, people taking more than one anticonvulsant, and children, who are also at risk of rickets. Bone demineralization is suggested to be most pronounced in young people (25–44 years of age), and one 1987 study of institutionalized people found that the rate of osteomalacia in the ones taking anticonvulsants—one out of 19 individuals taking an anticonvulsant (vs. none among the 37 people taking none) —was similar to that expected in elderly people. The authors speculated that this was due to improvements in diet, sun exposure, and exercise in response to earlier findings, and/or that this was because it was sunnier in London than in the Northern European countries, which had earlier reported this effect. In any case, the use of more than one anticonvulsant has been associated with an increased prevalence of bone disease in institutionalized epilepsy patients versus institutionalized people who did not have epilepsy. Likewise, postmenopausal women taking anticonvulsants have a greater risk of fracture than their drug-naive counterparts. Anticonvulsants affect the bones in many ways. They cause hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, low vitamin D levels, and increased parathyroid hormone. Anticonvulsants also contribute to the increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor, which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people. Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate, and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants than for people taking enzyme-non-inducing anticonvulsants. In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause arthralgia. Granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, red-cell hypoplasia and aplasia, and megaloblastic anemia are rarely associated with the use of primidone. Megaloblastic anemia is actually a group of related disorders with different causes that share morphological characteristics—enlarged red blood cells with abnormally high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios resulting from delayed maturation of nuclei combined with normal maturation of cytoplasm, into abnormal megakaryocytes and sometimes hypersegmented neutrophils; regardless of etiology, all of the megaloblastic anemias involve impaired DNA replication. The anticonvulsant users who get this also tend to eat monotonous diets devoid of fruits and vegetables. This antagonistic effect is not due to the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism. In addition to increasing the risk of megaloblastic anemia, primidone, like other older anticonvulsants, also increases the risk of neural tube defects, and like other enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants, it increases the likelihood of cardiovascular defects, and cleft lip without cleft palate. Epileptic women are generally advised to take folic acid, but there is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of vitamin supplementation in the prevention of such defects. Additionally, a coagulation defect resembling vitamin K deficiency has been observed in newborns of mothers taking primidone. Because of this, primidone is a Category D medication. Primidone, like phenobarbital and the benzodiazepines, can also cause sedation in the newborn and also withdrawal within the first few days of life; phenobarbital is the most likely out of all of them to do that. In May 2005, Dr. M. Lopez-Gomez's team reported an association between the use of primidone and depression in epilepsy patients; this same study reported that inadequate seizure control, post-traumatic epilepsy, and polytherapy were also risk factors. Polytherapy was also associated with poor seizure control. Of all of the risk factors, use of primidone and inadequate seizure control were the greatest, with odds ratios of 4.089 and 3.084, respectively. They had been looking for factors associated with depression in epilepsy patients. Schaffer et al. 1999 reported that one of their treatment failures, a 45-year-old woman taking 50 mg a day along with lithium 600 mg/day, clozapine 12.5 mg/day, trazodone 50 mg/day, and alprazolam 4 mg/day for three and a half months experienced auditory hallucinations that led to discontinuation of primidone. It can also cause hyperactivity in children; this most commonly occurs at low serum levels. There is one case of an individual developing catatonic schizophrenia when her serum concentration of primidone went above normal. Primidone is one of the anticonvulsants associated with anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, with the others being carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. This syndrome consists of fever, rash, peripheral leukocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and occasionally hepatic necrosis. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy was reported by Katano Hiroyuki of the Nagoya City Higashi General Hospital in early 2002 in a patient who had been stable on primidone monotherapy for five years before undergoing surgery for astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor. Additionally, her phenobarbital levels were inexplicably elevated after surgery. This is much more common with the valproates than with any of the barbiturates. A randomized, controlled trial w found that primidone was more likely to cause impotence than phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital. Like phenytoin, primidone is rarely associated with lymphadenopathy. Primidone can also cause vomiting; this happens in 1.0–0.1% of users. === Overdose === The most common symptoms of primidone overdose are coma with loss of deep tendon reflexes, and during the recovery period, if the patient survives, disorientation, dysarthria, nystagmus, and ataxia, lethargy, somnolence, vomiting, nausea, and occasionally, focal neurological deficits which lessen over time. Complete recovery comes within five to seven days of ingestion. The symptoms of primidone poisoning have generally been attributed to its biotransformation to phenobarbital, but primidone has toxic effects independent of its metabolites in humans. The massive crystalluria that sometimes occurs sets its symptom profile apart from that of phenobarbital. The crystals are white, needle-like, shimmering, hexagonal plates consisting mainly of primidone. In the Netherlands alone, 34 cases of suspected primidone poisoning occurred between 1978 and 1982. Of these, primidone poisoning was much less common than phenobarbital poisoning; 27 of those adult cases were reported to the Dutch National Poison Control Center. Of these, one person taking it with phenytoin and phenobarbital died, 12 became drowsy, and four were comatose. Treatments for primidone overdose have included hemoperfusion with forced diuresis, a combination of bemegride and amiphenazole; and a combination of bemegride, spironolactone, caffeine, pentylenetetrazol, strophanthin, penicillin, and streptomycin. In the three adults who are reported to have succumbed, the doses were 20–30 g. However, two adult survivors ingested 30 g 25 g, and 22.5 g. One woman experienced symptoms of primidone intoxication after ingesting 750 mg of her roommate's primidone. == Interactions == Taking primidone with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), procarbazine (Matulane), selegiline (Eldepryl), tranylcypromine (Parnate) or within two weeks of stopping any one of them may potentiate the effects of primidone or change one's seizure patterns. Isoniazid, an antitubercular agent with MAOI properties, has been known to strongly inhibit the metabolism of primidone. Like many anticonvulsants, primidone interacts with other anticonvulsants. Clobazam decreases clearance of primidone, Mesuximide increases plasma levels of phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In addition to being an inducer of CYP3A4, it is also an inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens. Primidone and the other enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants can cut the half-life of antipyrine roughly in half (6.2 ± 1.9 h vs. 11.2 ± 4.2 h), and increases the clearance rate by almost 70%. Phenobarbital reduces the half-life to 4.8 ± 1.3 and increases the clearance by almost 109%. It also interferes with the metabolism of dexamethasone, a synthetic steroid hormone, to the point where its withdrawal from the regimen of a 14-year-old living in the United Kingdom made her hypercortisolemic. Tempelhoff and colleagues at the Washington University School of Medicine's Department of Anesthesiology reported in 1990 that primidone and other anticonvulsant drugs increase the amount of fentanyl needed during craniotomy based on the patient's heart rate. == Mechanism of action == The exact mechanism of primidone's anticonvulsant action is still unknown after over 50 years. It is believed to work via interactions with voltage-gated sodium channels that inhibit high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials. The effect of primidone in essential tremor is not mediated by phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA). The major metabolite, phenobarbital, is also a potent anticonvulsant in its own right and likely contributes to primidone's effects in many forms of epilepsy. According to Brenner's Pharmacology, it also increases GABA-mediated chloride flux, thereby hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. Primidone was recently shown to directly inhibit the TRPM3 ion channel; whether this effect contributes to its anticonvulsant effect is not known, but gain-of-function mutations in TRPM3 were shown to be associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability in 2021. == Pharmacokinetics == Primidone converts to phenobarbital and PEMA; it is still unknown which exact cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible. The phenobarbital, in turn, is metabolized to p-hydroxyphenobarbital. The rate of primidone metabolism was greatly accelerated by phenobarbital pretreatment, moderately accelerated by primidone pretreatment, and reduced by PEMA pretreatment. In 1983, a new minor metabolite, p-hydroxyprimidone, was discovered. Primidone, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin are among the most potent hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs in existence, which occurs at therapeutic doses. In fact, people taking these drugs have displayed the highest degree of hepatic-enzyme induction on record. In addition to being an inducer of CYP3A4, it is also an inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants, as well as potentially increasing the toxicity of tobacco products. Its metabolite, phenobarbital, is a substrate of CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP3A5, CYP1E1, and the CYP2E subfamily. The gene expression of these isoenzymes is regulated by human pregnane receptor X (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Phenobarbital induction of CYP2B6 is mediated by both. Primidone does not activate PXR. The rate of metabolism of primidone into phenobarbital was inversely related to age; the highest rates were in the oldest patients (the maximum age being 55). People aged 70–81, relative to people aged 18–26, have decreased renal clearance of primidone, phenobarbital, and PEMA, in ascending order of significance, and that there was a greater proportion of PEMA in the urine. The clinical significance is unknown. The percentage of primidone converted to phenobarbital has been estimated to be 5% in dogs and 15% in humans. Work done 12 years later found that the serum phenobarbital 0.111 mg/100 mL for every mg/kg of primidone ingested. Authors publishing a year earlier estimated that 24.5% of primidone was metabolized to phenobarbital, but the patient reported by Kappy and Buckley would have had a serum level of 44.4 mg/100 mL instead of 8.5 mg/100 mL if this were true for individuals who have ingested a large dose. The patient reported by Morley and Wynne would have had serum barbiturate levels of 50 mg/100 mL, which would have been fatal. == History == Primidone is a congener of phenobarbital, where the carbonyl oxygen of the urea moiety is replaced by two hydrogen atoms. The effectiveness of Primidone for epilepsy was first demonstrated in 1949 by Yule Bogue. He found it to have a similar anticonvulsant effect, but more specific, i.e. with fewer associated sedative effects. It was brought to market a year later by the Imperial Chemical Industry, now known as AstraZeneca in the United Kingdom and Germany. In 1952, it was approved in the Netherlands. Also in 1952, Drs. Handley and Stewart demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of patients who failed to respond to other therapies; it was noted to be more effective in people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy than in people whose epilepsy had a known cause. Dr. Whitty noted in 1953 that it benefitted patients with psychomotor epilepsy, who were often treatment-resistant. Toxic effects were reported to be mild. That same year, it was approved in France. Primidone was introduced in 1954 under the brandname Mysoline by Wyeth in the United States. === Association with megaloblastic anemia === In 1954, Chalmers and Boheimer reported that the drug was associated with megaloblastic anemia. Between 1954 and 1957, 21 cases of megaloblastic anemia associated with primidone and/or phenytoin were reported. In most of these cases, the anemia was due to vitamin deficiencies - usually folic acid deficiency, in one case vitamin B12 deficiency, and in one case vitamin C deficiency. Some cases were associated with deficient diets - one patient ate mostly bread and butter, another ate bread, buns, and hard candy, and another could rarely be persuaded to eat in the hospital. The idea that folic acid deficiency could cause megaloblastic anemia was not new. What was new was the idea that drugs could cause this in well-nourished people with no intestinal abnormalities. In many cases, it was not clear which drug had caused it. This might be related to the structural similarity between folic acid, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone. Folic acid had been found to alleviate the symptoms of megaloblastic anemia in the 1940s, not long after it was discovered, but the typical patient only made a full recovery—cessation of CNS and PNS symptoms as well as anemia—on B12 therapy. Five years earlier, folic acid deficiency was linked to birth defects in rats. Primidone was seen by some as too valuable to withhold based on the slight possibility of this rare side effect and by others as dangerous enough to be withheld unless phenobarbital or some other barbiturate failed to work for this and other reasons (i.e., reports of permanent psychosis). == Available forms == Primidone is available as a 250 mg/5mL suspension, and in the form of 50 mg, 125 mg, and 250 mg tablets. It is also available in a chewable tablet formulation in Canada. It is marketed as several different brands, including Mysoline (Canada, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Turkey), Prysoline (Israel, Rekah Pharmaceutical Products, Ltd.), Apo-Primidone, Liskantin (Germany, Desitin), Resimatil (Germany, Sanofi-Synthélabo GmbH), Mylepsinum (Germany, AWD.pharma GmbH & Co., KG)., and Sertan (Hungary, 250 mg tablets, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.[1]) == Veterinary uses == Primidone has veterinary uses, including the prevention of aggressive behavior and cannibalism in gilt pigs, and treatment of nervous disorders in dogs and other animals. == References == == Further reading == ""Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Primidone in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Feed Studies)"" (PDF).

1445,"('Phosphocreatine (disodium)', 'Disodium creatine phosphate', 'Glycine, n-[imino(phosphonoamino)methyl]-n-methyl-', 'Creatine phosphate; creatinephosphoric acid', 'Creatinephosphate')","Endogenous, Medical"," Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of creatine supplementation for improvements in exercise performance. Few studies, however, have examined the effects of phosphocreatine supplementation on exercise performance. Furthermore, while polyphenols have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, little is known regarding the influence of polyphenol supplementation on muscular strength, power, and endurance. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of 28 days of supplementation with phosphocreatine disodium salts plus blueberry extract (PCDSB), creatine monohydrate (CM), and placebo on measures of muscular strength, power, and endurance. Thirty-three men were randomly assigned to consume either PCDSB, CM, or placebo for 28 days. Peak torque (PT), average power (AP), and percent decline for peak torque (PT%) and average power (AP%) were assessed from a fatigue test consisting of 50 maximal, unilateral, isokinetic leg extensions at 180°·s The results demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) improvements in PT for the PCDSB and CM groups from pre- (99.90 ± 22.47 N·m and 99.95 ± 22.50 N·m, respectively) to post-supplementation (119.22 ± 29.87 N·m and 111.97 ± 24.50 N·m, respectively), but no significant (p = 0.112) change for the placebo group. The PCDSB and CM groups also exhibited significant improvements in AP from pre- (140.18 ± 32.08 W and 143.42 ± 33.84 W, respectively) to post-supplementation (170.12 ± 42.68 W and 159.78 ± 31.20 W, respectively), but no significant (p = 0.279) change for the placebo group. A significantly (p < 0.05) greater proportion of subjects in the PCDSB group exceeded the MID for PT compared to the placebo group, but there were no significant (p > 0.05) differences in the proportion of subjects exceeding the MID between the CM and placebo groups or between the CM and PCDSB groups. These findings indicated that for the group mean responses, 28 days of supplementation with both PCDSB and CM resulted in increases in PT and AP. The PCDSB, however, may have an advantage over CM when compared to the placebo group for the proportion of individuals that respond favorably to supplementation with meaningful increases in muscular strength. The effect of phosphocreatine and phosphocreatinine disodium salts on excitation conduction in acute myocardial ischemia was investigated, using repeated short-term ischemia exposures of the isolated rabbit ventricular septum as a model. Considerable improvement of excitation conduction through ischemized myocardium, seen after the administration of phosphocreatine and phosphocreatinine salts, was shown to be associated with Na+ added to the perfusion medium. Phosphocreatine and phosphocreatinine effects on excitation conduction time and the septal force in control perfusion were related to both the addition of Na+ and the binding of Ca2+ by these agents in the perfusion medium.",Phosphocreatine (disodium),PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.49688953161239624)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.48144638538360596), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006794326473027468)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.0002181987656513229), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.5491004129871726e-05), (' MED', -0.0005541055579669774), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL; ([pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/phosphocreatine-disodium-salt?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=145, start_index=21, title='Phosphocreatine, Disodium Salt | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/phosphocreatine-disodium-salt?utm_source=openai')])"

1447,"('Tamsulosin', '(r)-ym12617 (free base)', '(r)-5-(2-((2-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)ethyl)amino)propyl)-2-methoxybenzenesulfonamide', 'Tamsulosinum', 'Tamsulosina')",Medical,"Tamsulosin, sold under the brand names including Flomax and Contiflo, is a medication used to treat symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and chronic prostatitis and to help with the passage of kidney stones. The evidence for benefit with a kidney stone is better when the stone is larger. Tamsulosin is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, blurry vision, and sexual problems. Other side effects may include feeling lightheaded with standing due to changes in blood pressure, and angioedema. Tamsulosin is an alpha blocker and works by relaxing muscles in the prostate. Specifically it is an α1-adrenergic receptor blocker. Tamsulosin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication in the UK. In 2022, it was the twentieth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 25 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Tamsulosin is primarily used for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and to help with the passage of kidney stones. Tamsulosin, however, appears to be effective only for stones over 4 mm and less than 10 mm in size. Tamsulosin is also used as an add-on treatment for acute urinary retention. People may void more successfully after catheter removal if they are taking tamsulosin. People taking tamsulosin also are less likely to need repeat catheterization. Tamsulosin does not decrease the overall size of the prostate in men with BPH and is not recommended for the prevention of prostate cancer. === Combination therapy === The results of the CombAT (combination of dutasteride [Avodart] and tamsulosin [Duodart]) trial in 2008 demonstrated that treatment with the combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin provides greater symptom benefits compared to monotherapy with either agent alone for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The CombAT trial became the medication Jalyn. It was approved by the FDA on 14 June 2010. This combination can be useful because it may take up to six months for symptomatic relief to be found when using 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as dutasteride compared to alpha-1 receptor blockers, which can provide relief in some cases within 48 hours. == Adverse effects == Eyes: People taking tamsulosin are prone to a complication known as floppy iris syndrome during cataract surgery. Adverse outcomes of the surgery are greatly reduced by the surgeon's prior knowledge of the person's history with this drug, and thus having the option of alternative techniques. Severe hypotension. Persons with cardiac conditions including hypotension, mechanical heart failure (valvular, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis), and congestive heart failure should be monitored carefully while taking tamsulosin. Alpha-blockers, including prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or tamsulosin, do not appear to affect all-cause mortality in heart failure rehospitalization in those also receiving β-blockers. Tamsulosin can also cause retrograde ejaculation, which occurs when semen is redirected to the urinary bladder instead of being ejaculated normally. This is because tamsulosin relaxes the muscles of the urethral sphincters, which are normally closed during ejaculation. == Mechanism == Tamsulosin is a selective α1 receptor antagonist that has preferential selectivity for the α1A receptor in the prostate versus the α1B receptor in the blood vessels. When alpha 1 receptors in the bladder neck, prostate, ureter, and urethra are blocked, a relaxation in smooth muscle tissue results. This mechanism decreases resistance to urinary flow, reduces discomfort associated with BPH, and facilitates passage of kidney stones. == Brand names == Tamsulosin was first marketed in 1996 under the trade name Flomax. The U.S. patent expired in October 2009. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved generics in March 2010. In 2010, tamsulosin was available as OTC medication in UK. It is marketed by various companies under licence, including Boehringer Ingelheim and CSL. Tamsulosin hydrochloride extended-release capsules are marketed under the trade names Urimax 0.4 (India),Tamlocept 0.4 (India), Flomax, Flomaxtra, Contiflo XL, bestflo, Mecir LP (France), Urimax, Pamsvax, and Pradif, although generic, unmodified-release capsules are still approved and marketed in many countries (such as Canada). Generic extended-release tablets are marketed in most countries of the EEA. In Mexico, it is marketed as Secotex and as Harnal D in Japan and Indonesia and as Harnal OCAS (oral controlled absorption system) in Thailand. In Egypt, Italy, Russia and Iceland, it is marketed under the trade name Omnic by Astellas Pharma Europe. The largest manufacturer of tamsulosin is Synthon BV (the Netherlands). Tamsulosin hydrochloride is marketed in Bangladesh under the trade names Uromax, Prostanil MR, Tamisol MR, and Tamsin. == References ==",Tamsulosinum,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.062299427052494e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -3.814624506048858e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a698012.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Tamsulosin: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a698012.html?utm_source=openai')])"

As a supplement, it is often used for the attempted short-term treatment of disrupted sleep patterns, such as from jet lag or shift work, and is typically taken orally. There is evidence of its benefit for this use, but is not strong. A 2017 review found that sleep onset occurred six minutes faster with use on average, but found no change in total time asleep. Side effects from melatonin supplements are minimal at low doses for short durations (the studies reported about equally for both melatonin and placebo). Side effects of melatonin are rare but may occur in 1 to 10 patients in 1,000. They may include somnolence, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, abnormal dreams, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, migraine, lethargy, hyperactivity, dizziness, hypertension, abdominal pain, heartburn, mouth ulcers, dry mouth, hyperbilirubinaemia, dermatitis, night sweats, pruritus, rash, dry skin, pain in the extremities, symptoms of menopause, chest pain, glycosuria (sugar in the urine), proteinuria (protein in the urine), abnormal liver function tests, weight gain, mood swings, aggression, and grogginess after awakening. Its use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding or for those with liver disease. Melatonin acts as an agonist of the melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors, the biological targets of endogenous melatonin. It is thought to activate these receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus in the brain to regulate the circadian clock and sleep–wake cycles. Immediate-release melatonin has a short elimination half-life of about 20 to 50 minutes. Prolonged-release melatonin used as a medication has a half-life of 3.5 to 4 hours. Melatonin was discovered in 1958. It is sold over-the-counter in Canada and the United States; in the United Kingdom, it is a prescription-only medication. In Australia and the European Union, it is indicated for difficulty sleeping in people over the age of 54. In the European Union, it is indicated for the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) treats melatonin as a dietary supplement and, as such, has not approved it for any medical uses. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2007. Besides melatonin, certain synthetic melatonin receptor agonists like ramelteon, tasimelteon, and agomelatine are also used in medicine. In 2022, it was the 217th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Insomnia === There is no good evidence that melatonin helps treat insomnia and its attempted use for this purpose is recommended against by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. A prolonged-release form of melatonin is approved for use as a medication in Europe for the treatment of insomnia in certain people. === Circadian rhythm sleep disorders === Melatonin may be useful in the treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome. Melatonin is known to reduce jet lag, especially in eastward travel. However, if it is not taken at the correct time, it can instead delay adaptation. Melatonin appears to have limited use against the sleep problems of people who work shift work. Tentative evidence suggests that it increases the length of time people are able to sleep. === REM sleep behavior disorder === Melatonin is a safer alternative than clonazepam in the treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder – a condition associated with the synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. However, clonazepam may be more effective. In any case, the quality of evidence for both treatments is very low and it is unclear whether either is definitely effective. === Dementia === A 2020 Cochrane review found no evidence that melatonin helped sleep problems in people with moderate to severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. A 2019 review found that while melatonin may improve sleep in minimal cognitive impairment, after the onset of Alzheimer's disease it has little to no effect. Melatonin may, however, help with sundowning (increased confusion and restlessness at night) in people with dementia. === Available forms === A prolonged-release 2 mg oral formulation of melatonin sold under the brand name Circadin is approved for use in the European Union in the short-term treatment of insomnia in people age 55 and older. Melatonin is also available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement in many countries. It is available in both immediate-release and less commonly prolonged-release forms. The compound is available in supplements at doses ranging from 0.3 mg to 10 mg or more. It is also possible to buy raw melatonin powder by the weight. Immediate-release formulations of melatonin cause blood levels of melatonin to reach their peak in about an hour. The hormone may be administered orally, as capsules, gummies, tablets, oral films, or liquids. It is also available for use sublingually, or as transdermal patches. Several inhalation-based melatonin products with a wide range of doses are being sold but the safety remains to be evaluated. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) said that the melatonin content in unregulated (without a USP verified mark) supplements can diverge widely from the claimed amount; a study found that the melatonin content ranged from one half to four times the stated dose. == Contraindications == Contraindications of melatonin include hypersensitivity reactions among others. It is not recommended in people with autoimmune diseases due to lack of data in these individuals. Prolonged-release pharmaceutical melatonin (Circadin) contains lactose and should not be used in people with the lactase deficiency or glucose–galactose malabsorption. Use of melatonin is also not recommend in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or in people with liver disease. == Adverse effects == Melatonin appears to cause very few side effects as tested in the short term, up to three months, at low doses. Two systematic reviews found no adverse effects of exogenous melatonin in several clinical trials, and comparative trials found the adverse effects headaches, dizziness, nausea, and drowsiness were reported about equally for both melatonin and placebo. Prolonged-release melatonin is safe with long-term use of up to 12 months. Although not recommended for long-term use beyond this, low-dose melatonin is generally safer, and a better alternative, than many prescription and over-the-counter sleep aids if a sleeping medication must be used for an extended period of time. Low doses of melatonin are usually sufficient to produce a hypnotic effect in most people. Higher doses do not appear to result in a stronger effect but instead appear to cause drowsiness for a longer period of time. There is emerging evidence that the timing of taking exogenous melatonin in relation to food is also an important factor. Specifically, taking exogenous melatonin shortly after a meal is correlated with impaired glucose tolerance. Therefore, Rubio-Sastre and colleagues recommend waiting at least 2 hours after the last meal before taking a melatonin supplement. Melatonin can cause nausea, next-day grogginess, and irritability. In autoimmune disorders, evidence is conflicting whether melatonin supplementation may ameliorate or exacerbate symptoms due to immunomodulation. Melatonin can lower follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Melatonin's effects on human reproduction remain unclear. Some supplemental melatonin users report an increase in vivid dreaming. Extremely high doses of melatonin increased REM sleep time and dream activity in people both with and without narcolepsy. Increased use of melatonin in the 21st century has significantly increased reports of melatonin overdose, calls to poison control centers, and related emergency department visits for children. The number of children who unintentionally ingested melatonin supplements in the US has increased 530% from 2012 to 2021. Over 4,000 reported ingestions required a hospital stay, and 287 children required intensive care. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says there is little evidence that melatonin supplementation is effective in treating insomnia in healthy children. == Overdose == Melatonin appears to be relatively safe in overdose. It has been administered at daily doses of up to 300 mg without causing clinically significant adverse reactions in the literature. The most commonly reported adverse effect of melatonin overdose is somnolence. Upon melatonin overdose, drowsiness may be expected and the compound should be cleared within 12 hours. No special treatment is needed for melatonin overdose. == Interactions == Melatonin is metabolized mainly by CYP1A enzymes. As such, inhibitors and inducers of CYP1A enzymes, such as CYP1A2, can modify melatonin metabolism and exposure. As an example, the CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 inhibitor fluvoxamine increases melatonin peak levels by 12-fold and overall exposure by 17-fold and this combination should be avoided. CYP1A2 inducers like cigarette smoking, carbamazepine, and rifampicin may reduce melatonin exposure due to induction of CYP1A2. In those taking warfarin, some evidence suggests there may exist a potentiating interaction, increasing the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and the risk of bleeding. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Melatonin acts as an agonist of the melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors, the biological targets of endogenous melatonin. Endogenous melatonin is normally secreted from the pineal gland of the brain. Melatonin is thought to activate melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus to regulate the circadian clock and sleep–wake cycles. When used several hours before sleep according to the phase response curve for melatonin in humans, small amounts (0.3 mg) of melatonin shift the circadian clock earlier, thus promoting earlier sleep onset and morning awakening. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The bioavailability of melatonin is between 2.5 and 50%. Melatonin is rapidly absorbed and distributed, reaching peak plasma concentrations after 60 minutes of administration, and is then eliminated. Usual doses of exogenous melatonin of 1 to 12 mg produce melatonin concentrations 10 to 100 times higher than endogenous peak levels. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of melatonin is approximately 60%. It is mainly bound to albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein. The membrane transport proteins that move melatonin across a membrane include, but are not limited to, glucose transporters, including GLUT1, and the proton-driven oligopeptide transporters PEPT1 and PEPT2. ==== Metabolism ==== Melatonin is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1A2 to 6-hydroxymelatonin. Metabolites are conjugated with sulfuric acid or glucuronic acid for excretion in the urine. Some of the metabolites formed via the reaction of melatonin with a free radical include cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), and N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK). ==== Elimination ==== In humans, 90% of orally administered exogenous melatonin is cleared in a single passage through the liver, a small amount is excreted in urine, and a small amount is found in saliva. Melatonin is excreted in the urine 2 to 5% as the unchanged drug. Melatonin has an elimination half-life of about 20 to 60 minutes. The half-life of prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin) is 3.5 to 4 hours. == Chemistry == Melatonin, also known as N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine and a derivative of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). It is structurally related to N-acetylserotonin (normelatonin; N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine), which is the chemical intermediate between serotonin and melatonin in the body. Synthetic melatonin receptor agonists used in medicine like ramelteon, tasimelteon, agomelatine, and piromelatine (still in clinical trials) are analogues of melatonin. == History == The first patent for its use in circadian rhythm disorders was granted in 1987 to Roger V Short and Stuart Armstrong at Monash University, and the first patent for its use as a low-dose sleep aid was granted to Richard Wurtman at MIT in 1995. Around the same time, the hormone got a lot of press as a possible treatment for many illnesses. The New England Journal of Medicine editorialized in 2000: ""With these recent careful and precise observations in blind persons, the true potential of melatonin is becoming evident, and the importance of the timing of treatment is becoming clear."" It was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2007. == Society and culture == Melatonin is categorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a dietary supplement, and is sold over-the-counter in both the US and Canada. FDA regulations applying to medications are not applicable to melatonin, though the FDA has found false claims that it cures cancer. As melatonin may cause harm in combination with certain medications or in the case of certain disorders, a doctor or pharmacist should be consulted before making a decision to take melatonin. In many countries, melatonin is recognized as a neurohormone and it cannot be sold over-the-counter. According to Harriet Hall caution is advisable, since quality control is a documented problem. 71% of products did not contain within 10% of the labelled amount of melatonin, with variations ranging from -83% to +478%, lot-to-lot variability was as high as 465%, and the discrepancies were not correlated to any manufacturer or product type. To make matters worse, 8 out of 31 products were contaminated with the neurotransmitter serotonin. Formerly, melatonin was derived from animal pineal tissue, such as bovine. It is now synthetic, which limits the risk of contamination or the means of transmitting infectious material. Melatonin is the most popular over-the-counter sleep remedy in the United States, resulting in sales in excess of US$400 million during 2017. In 2022, it was the 217th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. Beverages and snacks containing melatonin were being sold in grocery stores, convenience stores, and clubs in May 2011. The FDA considered whether these food products could continue to be sold with the label ""dietary supplements"". On 13 January 2010, it issued a Warning Letter to Innovative Beverage, creators of several beverages marketed as drinks, stating that melatonin, while legal as a dietary supplement, was not approved as a food additive. Bebida Beverage Company received a warning letter in 2015 for selling a melatonin-containing beverage. == Research == Some research supports an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect of melatonin. It has also been used to aid in the treatment of manic episodes in bipolar disorder, although evidence for its effectiveness is still inconsistent. Other studies have shown that melatonin may help reduce some types of headaches, epigastric pain and heartburn. There have also been studies trying to prove the effectiveness of melatonin in relation to epilepsy, dysmenorrhea, delirium, and tinnitus, but little to no beneficial role has been found. Melatonin has also been tested as a treatment for cancer, but the National Cancer Institute found insufficient evidence for it. However, further research found it to slightly improve survival of patients and to alleviate chemotherapy-related side effects. Both animal and human studies have shown melatonin to protect against radiation-induced cellular damage. Melatonin and its metabolites protect organisms from oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species which are generated during exposure. Nearly 70% of biological damage caused by ionizing radiation is estimated to be attributable to the creation of free radicals, especially the hydroxyl radical that attacks DNA, proteins, and cellular membranes. Melatonin has been described as a broadly protective, readily available, and orally self-administered antioxidant that is without known major side effects. == References ==",Circadin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.05537686496973038), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.005241225939244032), (' END', -0.02123350277543068), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -1.9266199160483666e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.16035684943199158), (' FOOD', -0.2519778311252594)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0025084717199206352), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.0009148702956736088), ('ĠEND', -0.04877831041812897), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.023257791996002197), ('ĠFOOD', -2.6702524337451905e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04874277487397194)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS; https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/circadin,https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/27475/PIL/Circadin/,https://www.drugs.com/uk/circadin.html ', [])"

1450,"('Uracil 1-œ≤-d-arabinofuranoside', 'Spongouridine', 'Arauridine', 'Ara-u', 'Uracil arabinoside')","Endogenous, Medical"," Cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and uracil arabinoside (ara-U) levels were measured in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine of 10 patients exhibiting primary central nervous system lymphoma who received 31 infusions of high-dose ara-C (3 g/m2) as part of their treatment regimen. Peak plasma and CSF ara-C levels were 10.8 and 1.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Ara-C was cleared more rapidly from plasma than from CSF. Ara-U appeared rapidly in both plasma and CSF, reaching a peak that was 10 times higher than the corresponding ara-C concentration (104 and 11.2 micrograms/ml, respectively). Only 4%-6% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine, but 63%-73% of it appeared as ara-U within the first 24 h. The presence of leptomeningeal lymphoma did not affect the CSF level of ara-C or ara-U. We report that hemodialysis clears Ara-U from the blood after high-dose Ara-C treatment in a patient with lymphoma and end-stage renal failure. The patient received two doses of Ara-C 1 g/m(2) 24 h apart and was hemodialyzed at about 6 h after each dose and subsequently as per her usual dialysis schedule. Multiple blood samples were collected after dosing. Blood and dialyzate were also collected from the dialysis circuit during a second identical treatment cycle. Ara-C and its metabolite Ara-U in plasma and dialyzate were measured chromatographically, and the data subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis. The distribution and elimination half-lives, steady-state volume of distribution and clearance values were 0.5 h, 7 h, 181 L and 307 l/h for Ara-C and 4.1 h, 34 h, 118 L and 2.64 l/h for Ara-U, respectively. The dialysis sessions immediately after the first and second doses cleared 39 and 52% (as Ara-U) of the respective Ara-C doses. Some 63% of Ara-U in plasma was extracted by dialysis. The patient showed no signs of neurotoxicity or other drug-related adverse effects. Hemodialysis is very effective in clearing Ara-U from the plasma in renal failure, and this maneuver could easily be used routinely to prevent Ara-U accumulation and minimize adverse effects in patients with renal failure. The pharmacokinetics of high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HiDAC) given as a three-hour intravenous infusion at 3 g/m2 were studied in five patients with acute leukemia during relapse and/or remission of their disease. Apparent steady state plasma levels of ara-C during 13 infusions averaged 115 +/- 32 microM. Upon cessation of the infusion, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) was rapidly cleared from the plasma. The apparent postinfusion kinetics of ara-C were triexponential with a distribution half-life of 16 minutes and elimination half-lives of 1.8 hours and six hours. Total clearance averaged 86 L per hour and mean residence time averaged 0.47 hours. Disease status (relapse or remission) had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ara-C. Peak levels of ara-U averaged 310 microM and the metabolite had an average apparent elimination half-life of 3.75 hours. Despite the persistence of ara-U at about 100 microM at the time of administration of subsequent infusions of ara-C, there was no further accumulation of ara-U in the plasma with repetitive infusions of HiDAC. In vitro studies indicate that ara-U can exert an inhibitory effect on deoxycytidine (dCyd) deaminase activity. The ratio of the Ki of ara-U to the Km of ara-C for cytidine (Cyd)-dCyd deaminase is 40:1; however, during the gamma phase of ara-C elimination, the ratio of ara-U:ara-C in plasma is at least 100:1. Thus, a retardation of systemic catabolism of ara-C by ara-U is possible. Two to three hours after the termination of the HiDAC infusion, the ara-C cerebrospinal fluid: plasma ratio is 1-3:1, a feature of potential therapeutic significance. The slower elimination of ara-C from the CSF may also contribute to the plasma gamma half-life.",Ara-u,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03804275393486023), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.04953733831644058), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5759773850440979)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.011047814972698689), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([tcichemicals.com](https://www.tcichemicals.com/US/en/p/A2356?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=6, title='1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyluracil 3083-77-0 | TCI AMERICA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.tcichemicals.com/US/en/p/A2356?utm_source=openai')])"
1451,"('Uridine', 'Œ≤-uridine', 'Uridin', 'Uracil riboside', 'Uracil, 1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-')","Endogenous, Medical","Uridine (symbol U or Urd) is a glycosylated pyrimidine analog containing uracil attached to a ribose ring (or more specifically, a ribofuranose) via a β-N1-glycosidic bond. The analog is one of the five standard nucleosides which make up nucleic acids, the others being adenosine, thymidine, cytidine and guanosine. The five nucleosides are commonly abbreviated to their symbols, U, A, dT, C, and G, respectively. However, thymidine is more commonly written as 'dT' ('d' represents 'deoxy') as it contains a 2'-deoxyribofuranose moiety rather than the ribofuranose ring found in uridine. This is because thymidine is found in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and usually not in ribonucleic acid (RNA). Conversely, uridine is found in RNA and not DNA. The remaining three nucleosides may be found in both RNA and DNA. In RNA, they would be represented as A, C and G whereas in DNA they would be represented as dA, dC and dG. == Biosynthesis == Uridine is widely produced in nature as uridine monophosphate (uridylate) by de novo synthesis by the decarboxylation of orotidylate, which is catalyzed by orotidylate decarboxylase. The orotidylate is produced from orotate, which is combined with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form orotidylate by pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase. PRPP is created from ribose-5-phosphate by a further phosphorylation, serving as an energetic molecule to drive the reaction forward, while orotate is generated in several steps from carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate. == Dietary sources == Uridine is regarded as a non-essential nutrient, as it is produced by the human body as needed and supplementation is not generally recommended, though it has been explored for specific applications. Some foods that contain uridine in the form of RNA are listed below. Although claimed that virtually none of the uridine in this form is bioavailable ""since – as shown by Handschumacher's Laboratory at Yale School of Medicine in 1981 – it is destroyed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and no food, when consumed, has ever been reliably shown to elevate blood uridine levels'. This is contradicted by Yamamoto et al., plasma uridine levels rose 1.8-fold 30 minutes after beer ingestion, suggesting, at the very least, conflicting data. On the other hand, ethanol on its own (which is present in beer) increases uridine levels, which may explain the raise of uridine levels in the study by Yamamoto et al. In infants consuming mother's milk or commercial infant formulas, uridine is present as its monophosphate, UMP, which is both bioavailable and able to enter the circulation from the digestive tract. goat's and sheep's milk and milk products Sugarcane extract Tomatoes (0.5 to 1.0 g uridine per kilogram dry weight) Brewer's yeast (1.7% uridine by dry weight) Beer Broccoli Organ meats (liver, pancreas, etc.) Consumption of RNA-rich foods may lead to high levels of purines (adenine and guanosine) in blood. High levels of purines are known to increase uric acid production and may aggravate or lead to conditions such as gout. Harvard researchers report that omega-3 fatty acids and uridine, two substances in foods such as fish, walnuts, molasses, and sugar beets, prevented depression in rats as effectively as antidepressant drugs. ""Giving rats a combination of uridine and omega-3 fatty acids produced immediate effects that were indistinguishable from those caused by giving the rats standard antidepressant medications,"" said lead author of the study William Carlezon, director of McLean's Behavioral Genetics Laboratory. == Galactose glycolysis == Uridine plays a role in the glycolysis pathway of galactose. There is no catabolic process to metabolize galactose. Therefore, galactose is converted to glucose and metabolized in the common glucose pathway. Once the incoming galactose has been converted into galactose 1-phosphate (Gal-1-P), it is involved in a reaction with UDP-glucose, a glucose molecule bonded to uridine diphosphate (UDP). This process is catalyzed by the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase and transfers the UDP to the galactose molecule. The end result is UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. This process is continued to allow the proper glycolysis of galactose. == See also == Deoxyuridine monophosphate Pseudouridine Uridine monophosphate == References ==",Uridine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0010991342132911086), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.318681188422488e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -5.836499985889532e-05), (' FOOD', -1.0280383548888494e-06)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.02693875879049301), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -6.556489552167477e-06), ('OUS', -1.6689286894688848e-06), (',', -0.004089208785444498), ('ĠFOOD', -0.002062219427898526), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12706412374973297)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.1472419600977446e-06), (' FOOD', -8.061054359131958e-06)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10937367/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uridine,https://www.drugs.com/ingredient/uridine.html ', [])"

1454,"('Xanthinol nicotinate', 'Xanthinol niacinate', 'Xanthinol', 'Xavin', 'Jupal')",Medical,"Xavin is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is commonly depicted in association with the Runaways. Xavin is gender-fluid (made more prominent due to their shape-shifting abilities) with seemingly no preference in which pronouns are used for them (""they/them"" pronouns are used throughout the article for clarity's sake). They were created by author Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona, and debuted in Runaways (vol. 2) #7. In the publications, Xavin is a Super-Skrull in training. Although Alphona was the series' artist at the time, artist Takeshi Miyazawa first drew the character on print. When Xavin first appeared to the Runaways, they took on the form of a black male, but changed into a black female just for the sake of Karolina Dean, a lesbian whom they were to marry. Xavin is often seen as a male, simply to be ""intimidating"". Xavin, often called ""Xav"" for short, is known for their obtuse and warlike personality. They had originally found it hard to fit in with the Runaways due in part to Xavin's constant gender switching and unfamiliarity with Earth values and norms though through proving their loyalty to the group found acceptance. Xavin is the child of the Skrull Prince De'zean. Xavin was portrayed by Clarissa Thibeaux in the second and third seasons of the Hulu television series Runaways, which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. == Publication history == Xavin first appeared in Runaways (vol. 2) #7 (August 2005), and was created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona. They are introduced as a Skrull prince, the child of De'zean of the Skrull Royal Family on the planet Tarnax VI, and they are meant to marry Karolina to bring peace to their two warring alien species. As members of the Runaways, they appeared in the comic book Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers, which involves both the Runaways and Young Avengers teams. In the short lived third volume of the Runaways, they were forced to leave the team and was last seen being taken from Earth in Majesdanian custody. == Fictional character biography == === History === When Xavin journeys to Earth to find Karolina Dean, they reveal to Karolina that their parents had one more large secret. The Deans had been exiled from their planet Majesdane for criminal activities. They traveled to Earth where they encountered Xavin's father, Prince De'zean of the Skrulls, who was going to rule the planet. The Deans had stopped the destruction but gave the Skrulls the location of another, more valuable planet: Majesdane. To prove they weren't lying, they gave Prince De'zean's child their child's hand in marriage. The Deans had believed that Xavin would die in the new Skrull/Majesdanian war. Xavin later arrived on Earth to marry her and hopefully stop the fifteen-year war between their races. Xavin encountered Karolina shortly after her romantic advances were rejected by Nico Minoru. Xavin tried to convince Karolina to be their bride. He fought and pursued her, in the form of a human male. Karolina revealed that she is not attracted to men and doesn't want to live a lie. But Xavin altered their form to that of a human woman and persuaded her to leave Earth with the new female version of Xavin. During the wedding ceremony, a fight breaks out between the two races, and Xavin and Karolina barely escape before Majesdane is destroyed. They return to Earth, where they help rescue Molly Hayes from the New Pride. Xavin impersonates Nico and takes a bullet for her, distracting Geoffrey Wilder long enough for Nico to untie Molly and escape. Xavin survives the attack by shape-shifting their organs out of the way. === Secret Invasion === When the Runaways return from a trip to the past, Xavin learns they are in the most heated phase of the Skrull Invasion. Instead of fighting, they knock out their teammates and attempt a peaceful settlement of the war, reasoning that the Skrulls are ""religious extremists"". Their attempts at peace fail, and they're informed that the Runaways are targeted for execution. They urge Nico to take the rest of the team and hide, and in a last-ditch effort to halt the invasion, they flee to search for Hulkling, former Skrull King and enemy of the religious extremist Skrulls' Queen, Veranke. They find Hulkling injured, targeted for assassination by Veranke herself. By siding with Hulkling, they are branded as a traitor too. === As a fugitive === Weeks later, Xavin better adjusted, refraining from insulting Victor and becoming closer to Molly (the only teammate other than Karolina to always refer to Xavin as female). However, Xavin is still more-or-less an outcast to the other members. Like the other Runaways, Xavin is an orphan (they told the group when they first appeared that their parents were dead because of the aliens' war). They also call themselves runaway when they reveal their identity to Geoffrey Wilder. Xavin joins the group but has trouble adjusting to their new surroundings and getting along with their new teammates, particularly Victor, whom they often offend with condescending remarks about robots. Although they are aggressive and headstrong, Xavin is motivated to protect their new home of their love for Karolina. Xavin usually reverts to the male Skrull form when in battle, insisting that it adds to a more intimidating persona, despite Karolina thinking that it is sexist, yet still spends some time in the male human form as well. However, during their trip to 1907, it was revealed that when they lose control or are under emotional pressure, the female form was the one to which they would revert, something that made Karolina very happy. === Departure === In Runaways' ""Dead Wrong"" story arc, a group of surviving Majesdanians arrives to arrest Karolina. After they repeatedly attack the Runaways, Xavin realizes that the aliens won't stop until they get Karolina. Karolina apparently leaves the group with the Majesdanians, but the Runaways, except Nico, are later shocked to find the real Karolina knocked out. Xavin shapeshifted into Karolina's form and took her place to take all the punishment for their species' war. Kissing Karolina, Xavin whispers their love and departs the group. Their fate is unknown. == Powers and abilities == Xavin, being a Skrull, has the Skrull's natural ability to shapeshift. Xavin was a Super-Skrull in training, meaning they can manifest the powers of the Fantastic Four: Mr. Fantastic's ability to stretch and contort his body into any shape imaginable, Invisible Woman's power to render herself invisible, and the ability to create force fields, the Human Torch's fire-control and flight and the Thing's superhuman strength and resistant rock-like hide. The Super-Skrull Kl'rt is one of Xavin's idols. As stated by Xavin, they are still a Super Skrull in training, so they can only use their Fantastic Four abilities one at a time; at one point, when Xavin was bombarded with high-frequency sounds, they lost control of their powers and burnt up the Griffith Observatory. Finally, in (vol. 3) #2, they used all their powers at once in anger. === Personality === Xavin is known for their warlike, rash attitude, something that irritates the other Runaways, particularly Victor, towards whom they had a strong animosity towards because being an android, Victor would have been hardwired to cook and clean on their planet. Although Xavin often demonstrates strong, general-type behavior, there are periods when they accidentally show they barely have any more experience than the other Runaways; for example, they once stretched themselves from one building to another just to get to the other side instead of simply creating a force-field bridge, only realizing the alternative after it was pointed out to them by Molly. == Reception == In 2008, Xavin was named the fourth (out of ten) best Skrull characters in an article published on Marvel's official website. == Gender identity == Due to Xavin often changing through their three main forms, (human female, human male, and true Skrull form) both characters within the series and fans question the nature of their gender. As a Skrull, a race of shapeshifters, Xavin stated ""for us, just changing our gender is no different than changing our hair color"", implying that Skrulls have fluid gender identities. When asked by Molly about why they don't stay in female form all the time, Xavin replied that it was simply their nature to do so and doesn't see a problem in it, though it causes Xavin to start questioning their own nature. Although Karolina does truly love Xavin, even so much as to deny Xavin disguised as Nico due to loyalty, she does become depressed when Nico questions Xavin's true gender. In Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways, Xavin is mostly male, but female briefly. In (vol. 3) #1, Xavin is only male, but in (vol. 3) #2, Xavin is only female. Karolina is fixed on the idea that Xavin is female, and that Xavin isn't pretending to be a woman, just learning to be human. During an argument with Karolina, Xavin loses control and changes form into their female form, and Karolina takes that to mean Xavin's true form is a female. However, on his blog, the artist Humberto Ramos notes that he was instructed to draw Xavin taking different genders depending on the situation, even when not plot-necessary. == Relationships with other Runaways == Due to their war-like, yet rash attitude, Xavin often irritates the other Runaways. They often believed that Victor was supposed to be hardwired to know everything, due to Viktor being a cyborg. In their first appearance, they called Victor a ""toy"". Xavin met Karolina after Karolina suffered rejection from Nico, her crush, for some time. When Xavin expressed no concern about changing physical appearance from male to female to please her, Karolina began a relationship. Xavin once took the form of Nico to please Karolina, but Karolina rejected them as Nico because they had earned her loyalty and reassured Xavin that she loved them as they are. At times, they still suspect Karolina has lingering feelings for Nico. Later on, during an argument, Xavin subconsciously reverted to their female human form, which both surprised and pleased Karolina, who had earlier expressed some lingering doubts about Xavin's true gender. Besides Victor, Xavin strongly infuriates Nico and often questions Nico's leadership decisions. Xavin grew to respect Nico's leadership, telling her how much they've learned from her. == In other media == Xavin appears in the second season of Runaways portrayed by Clarissa Thibeaux, with other actors and actresses occasionally portraying them. This version is a Xartan, a being with the ability to shapeshift, presenting as numerous people before adopting a female body. They are first named in ""Last Rites"" as one of the aliens on Jonah's ship, before it is blown up by Pride. They begin telepathically conversing with Karolina before adopting the appearance of a charitable stranger and briefly interacting with her while shopping. Xavin fully reveals themselves to Karolina at the end of ""Earth Angel"" as her betrothed. They tell Karolina they stowed away on a ship that carried Karolina's biological father, ""Jonah"", and his family of exiled Gibborim royal magistrates for the purpose of fulfilling an uncertain prophecy that she believes they are a part of that will unite two worlds and bring peace to the universe. Xavin stays at the hostel where she speaks with Leslie Dean and reveals to her that she is pregnant with Jonah's heir and that he and his family have inhabited other bodies, later revealed to be Stacey Yorkes, Tina Minoru, Victor Stein, and one unknown party (Alex Wilder). They try rescuing Karolina from Victor/Jonah, but they are overpowered. They regroup at the hostel with Leslie, Alex, Molly, and Nico to plan out how they will rescue their friends from Jonah. She makes her last appearance in the third season, episode ""Rite of Thunder"", where Leslie gives birth to a baby named Elle Dean, and Xavin takes her in and raises her as her own and goes off into space. == References == == External links == Xavin at Marvel Database",Xavin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -5.471556869451888e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00034671969478949904)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -4.320199877838604e-07)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB2255507.htm,https://www.drugfuture.com/chemdata/Xanthinol-Niacinate.html ', [])"

The drug was first designed and synthesized in the group of Professor Barry V L Potter at the Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, University of Bath, working together with Professor Michael J. Reed at Imperial College, London and its initial development was undertaken through the university spin-out company Sterix Ltd and overseen by Cancer Research UK (CRUK). Results of the ""first-in-class"" clinical trial in breast cancer of an STS inhibitor in humans were published in 2006 and dose optimisation studies and further clinical data have been reported. == Mechanism of action == By inhibiting STS, irosustat prevents the conversion of hormonally inactive steroid sulfates such as DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S) and estrone sulfate (E1S) into their respective active forms, DHEATooltip dehydroepiandrosterone and estrone (which, in turn, can be transformed into more potent androgens and estrogens, respectively). The X-ray crystal structure of the drug bound to CAII has been determined. == Pharmacokinetics == Despite Irosustat being quickly degraded in plasma ex vivo, this is prevented in vivo by its sequestration almost completely inside red blood cells after oral administration, being bound to carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) like its parent steroidal sulfamate ester E2MATE and thus avoiding first pass metabolism. == Clinical development == In 2004 Sterix Ltd was acquired by Ipsen and Irosustat continued in development through formal academic-industry partnerships by Ipsen with the University of Bath and Imperial College. The drug reached phase II clinical trials in women with hormone-dependent breast cancer and endometrial cancer prior to the discontinuation of its initial development by Ipsen as a monotherapy for endometrial cancer in women with advanced/metastatic or recurrent estrogen-receptor positive endometrial cancer after a futility analysis of trial data. Results published in 2017 showed clinical activity and a good safety profile for Irosustat, with 36% of patients on Irosustat alive without progression at 6 months; 11% showed responses and there was more stable disease noted (47%) compared to the current therapy (32%), the progestin megestrol acetate (MA). However, overall there were no statistically significant differences between Irosustat and the current standard of care MA in response and survival rates. It also reached a phase I trial in the US for prostate cancer, being safe and well tolerated in male patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and ongoing androgen deprivation therapy. Pharmacodynamic proof of concept was demonstrated with Irosustat effecting nearly complete STS inhibition at three doses, and in all patients there was notable suppression of endocrine parameters. The development of Irosustat has continued with clinical trials overseen by CRUK designed to explore its activity in early breast cancer (IPET trial) and also in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) (IRIS trial). The multicentre IRIS trial, an open-label phase II clinical study, explored the clinical value of adding an STS inhibitor in addition to a first-line AI in patients with advanced breast cancer and enrolled postmenopausal women with ER+ locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had benefited from a first-line AI but were subsequently progressing. The IPET trial was a pre-surgical window-of-opportunity study, assessing Irosustat for the first time in ER+ early breast cancer and recruiting postmenopausal women with untreated early disease. Importantly, these data are the first to demonstrate clinical activity of Irosustat in early breast cancer, albeit in a small patient population. The results of both trials were published in 2017, showing evidence of clinical benefit and underpinning the scientific concept of STS inhibition. Larger studies are now required. Irosustat was also evaluated as a combination therapy with an oral epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients. Clinical development continues and the current status was reviewed in 2018. Administration of 5 mg/day irosustat to women with breast cancer for 5 days inhibited STS activity by 98 to 99% in breast tumor tissue and significantly decreased serum levels of estrone (by 76%), estradiol (by 39%), DHEA (by 41%), androstenediol (by 70%), androstenedione (by 62%), and testosterone (by 30%), whereas levels of DHEA-S and E1S increased slightly (by 1.1% and 7.4%, respectively). == Animal studies == Importantly, it was demonstrated that oral treatment with Irosustat alleviates the symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease in a murine model, indicating that the drug passes the blood–brain barrier. STS inhibitors could therefore potentially be employed to treat aging and aging-associated diseases. == See also == in patients.

1456,"('Camphor', '(1r)-camphor', '(r)-camphor', '(1r,4r)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one', 'Bornan-2-one')","Food, Medical","Camphor () is a waxy, colorless solid with a strong aroma. It is classified as a terpenoid and a cyclic ketone. It is found in the wood of the camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), a large evergreen tree found in East Asia; and in the kapur tree (Dryobalanops sp.), a tall timber tree from South East Asia. It also occurs in some other related trees in the laurel family, notably Ocotea usambarensis. Rosemary leaves (Rosmarinus officinalis) contain 0.05 to 0.5% camphor, while camphorweed (Heterotheca) contains some 5%. A major source of camphor in Asia is camphor basil (the parent of African blue basil). Camphor can also be synthetically produced from oil of turpentine. The compound is chiral, existing in two possible enantiomers as shown in the structural diagrams. The structure on the left is the naturally occurring (+)-camphor ((1R,4R)-bornan-2-one), while its mirror image shown on the right is the (−)-camphor ((1S,4S)-bornan-2-one). Camphor has few uses but is of historic significance as a compound that is readily purified from natural sources. == Etymology == The word camphor derived in the 14th century from Old French: camphre, itself from Medieval Latin: camfora, from Arabic: كافور, romanized: kāfūr, perhaps through Sanskrit: कर्पूर, romanized: karpūra, from Tamil: கற்பூரம், romanized: karpooram apparently from Austronesian Malay: kapur 'lime' (chalk). In Old Malay, camphor was called kapur barus, meaning ""the chalk of Barus"", referring to Barus, an ancient port near modern Sibolga on the western coast of Sumatra. This port traded in camphor extracted from the Borneo camphor trees (Dryobalanops aromatica) that were abundant in the region. == Production == === Natural camphor === (+)-camphor has been produced as a forest product for centuries, condensed from the vapor given off by the roasting of wood chips cut from Camphora officinarum, and later by passing steam through the pulverized wood and condensing the vapors. By the early 19th century most camphor tree reserves had been depleted with the remaining large stands in Japan and Taiwan, with Taiwanese production greatly exceeding Japanese. Camphor was one of the primary resources extracted by Taiwan's colonial powers as well as one of the most lucrative. First the Chinese and then the Japanese established monopolies on Taiwanese camphor. In 1868, a British naval force sailed into Anping harbor and the local British representative demanded the end of the Chinese camphor monopoly. After the local imperial representative refused, the British bombarded the town and took the harbor. The ""camphor regulations"" negotiated between the two sides subsequently saw a brief end to the camphor monopoly. (-)-camphor occurs naturally in the essential oil of Matricaria plants. As a result, it's much rarer. === Synthetic camphor === Camphor is produced from alpha-pinene, which is abundant in the oils of coniferous trees and can be distilled from turpentine produced as a side product of chemical pulping. With acetic anhydride as the solvent and with catalysis by a strong acid, alpha-pinene is converted to isobornyl acetate. Hydrolysis of this ester gives isoborneol which can be oxidized to give racemic camphor. A biological enzyme has been proposed for producing only the rare (-) or L-camphor. This EstB esterase from Burkholderia gladioli hydrolyzes only (+)-isobornyl acetate. == Reactions == The reactions of camphor have been extensively examined. Some representative transformations include sulfonation: oxidation with selenium dioxide to camphorquinone . Camphor can also be reduced to isoborneol using sodium borohydride. It can be converted to the alkene bornylene. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === In biosynthesis, camphor is produced from geranyl pyrophosphate, via cyclisation of linaloyl pyrophosphate to bornyl pyrophosphate, followed by hydrolysis to borneol and oxidation to camphor. == Uses == The first significant manmade plastics were low-nitrogen (or ""soluble"") nitrocellulose (pyroxylin) plastics. In the early decades of the plastics industry, camphor was used in immense quantities: 130 as the plasticizer that creates celluloid from nitrocellulose, in nitrocellulose lacquers and other plastics and lacquers. === Alternative medicine and scent === Camphor has been used for its scent, as an embalming fluid, as topical medication, as a manufacturing chemical, and in religious ceremonies. Camphor has been used as a folk medicine over centuries, probably most commonly as a decongestant. Camphor was used in ancient Sumatra to treat sprains, swellings, and inflammation. Camphor also was used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine for various purposes. In Europe, camphor was used after the Black Death era. In the 20th century, camphor was used as an analeptic by injection, and to induce seizures in schizophrenic people in an attempt to treat psychosis. Camphor has limited use in veterinary medicine by intramuscular injection to treat breathing difficulties in horses. === Topical medication === Camphor is commonly applied as a topical medication as a skin cream or ointment to relieve itching from insect bites, minor skin irritation, or joint pain. It is absorbed in the skin epidermis, where it stimulates nerve endings sensitive to heat and cold, producing a warm sensation when vigorously applied, or a cool sensation when applied gently, indicating its properties as a counterirritant. The action on nerve endings also induces a slight local analgesia. === Respiratory aerosol === Camphor is also used via an aerosol, typically by steam inhalation, sometimes in the form of branded nasal inhaler sticks, to inhibit coughing and relieve upper airway congestion due to the common cold. However, the clinical efficacy of these remedies is challenged. === Other niche uses === Camphor is used by marksmen to blacken the front and rear sights of rifles to prevent the sights from reflecting. This is done by setting light to a small amount of camphor, which burns at a relatively low temperature, and using the soot rising from the flame to deposit a coating on a surface held above it. Historically, this soot blackening was also used to coat barograph record charts. A barracks-room rumour possibly derived from an older rumour about saltpetre holds that soldiers in the Islamic Republic of Iran are dosed with camphor in their daily meals in order to repress their libido and prevent homosexual incidents. === Pest deterrent and preservative === Camphor is believed to be toxic to insects and is thus sometimes used as a repellent. Camphor is used as an alternative to mothballs. Camphor crystals are sometimes used to prevent damage to insect collections by other small insects. It is kept in clothes used on special occasions and festivals, and also in cupboard corners as a cockroach repellent. The smoke of camphor crystal or camphor incense sticks can be used as an environmentally-friendly mosquito repellent. Recent studies have indicated that camphor essential oil can be used as an effective fumigant against red fire ants, as it affects the attacking, climbing, and feeding behavior of major and minor workers. Camphor is also used as an antimicrobial substance. In embalming, camphor oil was one of the ingredients used by ancient Egyptians for mummification. === Perfume === In the ancient Arab world, camphor was a common perfume ingredient. The Chinese referred to the best camphor as ""dragon's brain perfume"", due to its ""pungent and portentous aroma"" and ""centuries of uncertainty over its provenance and mode of origin"". === Culinary uses === One of the earliest known recipes for ice cream dating to the Tang dynasty includes camphor as an ingredient. It was used to flavor leavened bread in ancient Egypt. In ancient and medieval Europe, camphor was used as an ingredient in sweets. It was used in a wide variety of both savory and sweet dishes in medieval Arabic language cookbooks, such as Kitab al-Ṭabikh compiled by ibn Sayyār al-Warrāq in the 10th century. It also was used in sweet and savory dishes in the Ni'matnama, according to a book written in the late 15th century for the sultans of Mandu. It is a main constituent of a spice known as ""edible camphor"" (or kapur), which may be used in traditional South Indian desserts like Payasam and Chakkarai Pongal. === Religious rites === Camphor is widely used in Hindu religious ceremonies. Aarti is performed after placing it on a stand and setting fire to it usually as the last step of puja or devotional worship ritual to one or more deities. Camphor is mentioned in the Quran as being the fragrance of wine given to believers in heaven. == Toxicity == Applied on skin, camphor may cause allergic reactions in some people; when ingested by mouth, camphor cream or ointment is poisonous. In high ingested doses, camphor produces symptoms of irritability, disorientation, lethargy, muscle spasms, vomiting, abdominal cramps, convulsions, and seizures. Lethal doses by ingestion in adults are in the range 50–500 mg/kg (orally). Generally, ingestion of two grams causes serious toxicity and four grams is potentially lethal. Airborne camphor may be toxic if respired by humans. The Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for camphor in ambient air is 2 mg/m3 at exposure time (TWA) not more than 8 hours. 200 mg/m3 is considered a very dangerous concentration (IDLH). == History of synthetic camphor == When its use in the nascent chemical industries (discussed below) greatly increased the volume of demand in the late 19th century, potential for changes in supply and in price followed. In 1911 Robert Kennedy Duncan, an industrial chemist and educator, related that the Imperial Japanese government had recently (1907–1908) tried to monopolize the production of natural camphor as a forest product in Asia but that the monopoly was prevented by the development of the total synthesis alternatives, which began in ""purely academic and wholly uncommercial"" form with Gustav Komppa's first report: ""... but it sealed the fate of the Japanese monopoly ... For no sooner was it accomplished than it excited the attention of a new army of investigators—the industrial chemists. The patent offices of the world were soon crowded with alleged commercial syntheses of camphor, and of the favored processes companies were formed to exploit them, factories resulted, and in the incredibly short time of two years after its academic synthesis artificial camphor, every whit as good as the natural product, entered the markets of the world ... And yet artificial camphor does not—and cannot—displace the natural product to an extent sufficient to ruin the camphor-growing industry. Its sole present and probable future function is to act as a permanent check to monopolization, to act as a balance-wheel to regulate prices within reasonable limits."": 133–134 This ongoing check on price growth was confirmed in 1942 in a monograph on DuPont's history, where William S. Dutton said, ""Indispensable in the manufacture of pyroxylin plastics, natural camphor imported from Formosa and selling normally for about 50 cents a pound, reached the high price of $3.75 in 1918 [amid the global trade disruption and high explosives demand that World War I created]. The organic chemists at DuPont replied by synthesizing camphor from the turpentine of southern US pine stumps, with the result that the price of industrial camphor sold in carload lots in 1939 was between 32 cents and 35 cents a pound."": 293 The background of Gustaf Komppa's synthesis was as follows. In the 19th century, it was known that nitric acid oxidizes camphor into camphoric acid. Haller and Blanc published a semisynthesis of camphor from camphoric acid. Although they demonstrated its structure, they were unable to prove it. The first complete total synthesis of camphoric acid was published by Komppa in 1903. Its inputs were diethyl oxalate and 3,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, which reacted by Claisen condensation to yield diketocamphoric acid. Methylation with methyl iodide and a complicated reduction procedure produced camphoric acid. William Perkin published another synthesis a short time later. Previously, some organic compounds (such as urea) had been synthesized in the laboratory as a proof of concept, but camphor was a scarce natural product with a worldwide demand. Komppa realized this, and began industrial production of camphor in Tainionkoski, Finland, in 1907 (with plenty of competition, as Kennedy Duncan reported). A different way of synthesis was developed at the same time by Dr. Karl Stephan from Chemische Fabrik auf Actien. This chemist, who had patented a route to synthesize camphene in 1902, found out that borneol or isoborneol could easily be oxidized with permanganate in benzene solution with unprecedentedly high yields of 95+%, and patented it in 1903. The process was efficient enough to compete with natural camphor, and Japan was forced to lower prices in 1907, but the German company still increased its production, reaching 623 tons in 1913, only to be interrupted by WWI. == See also == 1,4-Dichlorobenzene Citral Eucalyptol Lavender Vaporizer == References == == External links == INCHEM at IPCS (International Programme on Chemical Safety) NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards – Camphor at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",Bornan-2-one,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.35711613297462463), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.07728824019432068), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.00014036978245712817), (' INDUSTR', -0.5491328835487366), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.6031926274299622), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), (',', -6.890059739816934e-05), ('ĠPERSON', -0.6588753461837769), ('AL', 0.0), ('ĠCARE', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.001503528794273734), ('ĠFOOD', -0.25205329060554504), (',', -0.0788993313908577), ('ĠINDU', -0.0037716934457421303), ('ST', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('RI', -2.8609820219571702e-05), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10022976994514465)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0036070786882191896)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([apps.who.int](https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/4447?utm_source=openai), [chembk.com](https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/bornan-2-one?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=228, start_index=33, title='WHO | JECFA', type='url_citation', url='https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/4447?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=228, start_index=33, title='bornan-2-one', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/bornan-2-one?utm_source=openai')])"

The hydroxyl group in this compound is placed in an endo position. The exo diastereomer is called isoborneol. Being chiral, borneol exists as enantiomers, both of which are found in nature: d-borneol (also written (+)-borneol) and l-borneol (or (−)-borneol). == Reactions == Borneol is oxidized to the ketone (camphor). == Occurrence == The compound was named in 1842 by the French chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt. Borneol can be found in several species of Heterotheca, Artemisia, Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) Dipterocarpaceae, Blumea balsamifera and Kaempferia galanga. It is one of the chemical compounds found in castoreum. This compound is gathered from the beaver's plant food. === Synthesis === Borneol can be synthesized by reduction of camphor by the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction (a reversible process). Industrially, a racemic mixture of camphor is used, leading to a racemic mixture of borneol and isoborneol. The chirality can be controlled by changing the chirality of camphor: (+)-camphor gives (−)-isoborneol and (+)-borneol. Reduction of camphor with sodium borohydride (fast and irreversible) gives instead the diastereomer isoborneol. === Natural sources === Industrially, natural (+)-borneol is produced from Cinnamomum burmanni (one specific chemotype) and Cinnamomum camphora. Natural (-)-borneol occurs in Blumea balsamifera. === Biosynthesis === Borneol is synthesized using DMAPP as the starting material. DMAPP is then converted to GPP, which is acted upon by a bornyl diphosphate synthase to yield a bornyl diphosphate. A phosphatase then removes the phosphate groups, yielding borneol. The chirality of borneol in a plant depends on the preferred chirality of the bornyl diphosphate synthase. Synthases for either chirality have been sequenced. A downstream product is camphor of either chirality, a reaction catalyzed by (+)-borneol dehydrogenase or (−)-borneol dehydrogenase. == Uses == Whereas d-borneol was the enantiomer that used to be the most readily available commercially, the more commercially available enantiomer now is l-borneol, which also occurs in nature. (+)-Borneol from Dipterocarpus spp. is used in traditional Chinese medicine. An early description is found in the Bencao Gangmu. Borneol is a component of many essential oils and it is a natural insect repellent. It also generates a TRPM8-mediated cooling sensation similar to menthol. Laevo-borneol is used in perfumery. It has a balsamic odour type with pine, woody and camphoraceous facets. Dextro-borneol (dexborneol) is used in edaravone/dexborneol, a drug approved in China for stroke. == Toxicology == Borneol may cause eye, skin, and respiratory irritation; it is harmful if swallowed. Acute exposure may cause headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, and syncope. Exposure to higher levels or over a longer period of time may cause restlessness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and seizures. === Skin irritation === Borneol has been shown to have little to no irritation effect when applied to the human skin at doses used in fine fragrance formulation. Skin exposure can lead to sensitization and a future allergic reaction even to small quantities. == Derivatives == The bornyl group is a univalent radical C10H17 derived from borneol by removal of hydroxyl and is also known as 2-bornyl. Isobornyl is the univalent radical C10H17 that is derived from isoborneol. The structural isomer fenchol is also a widely used compound derived from certain essential oils.

It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an alpha-CH2-containing aldehyde and a member of phenylacetaldehydes. Phenylacetaldehyde is one important oxidation-related aldehyde. Exposure to styrene gives phenylacetaldehyde as a secondary metabolite. Styrene has been implicated as reproductive toxicant, neurotoxicant, or carcinogen in vivo or in vitro. Phenylacetaldehyde could be formed by diverse thermal reactions during the cooking process together with C8 compounds is identified as a major aroma–active compound in cooked pine mushroom. Phenylacetaldehyde is readily oxidized to phenylacetic acid. Therefore will eventually be hydrolyzed and oxidized to yield phenylacetic acid that will be excreted primarily in the urine in conjugated form. == Natural occurrence == Phenylacetaldehyde occurs extensively in nature because it can be biosynthetically derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. Natural sources of the compound include chocolate, buckwheat, flowers, and communication pheromones from various insect orders. It is notable for being a floral attractant for numerous species of Lepidoptera; for example, it is the strongest floral attractor for the cabbage looper moth. == Uses == === Fragrances and flavors === The aroma of pure substance can be described as honey-like, sweet, rose, green, grassy and is added to fragrances to impart hyacinth, narcissi, or rose nuances. For similar reasons the compound can sometimes be found in flavored cigarettes and beverages. Historically, before biotechnology approaches were developed, phenylacetaldehyde was also used to produce phenylalanine via the Strecker reaction as a step in the production of aspartame sweetener. === Polymers === Phenylacetaldehyde is used in the synthesis of polyesters where it serves as a rate-controlling additive during polymerization. === Natural Medicine === Phenylacetaldehyde is responsible for the antibiotic activity of maggot therapy. === MAOI === Theoretically, hydrazone formation and subsequent reduction of the phenylethylidenehydrazine gives phenelzine. == Preparation == Phenylacetaldehyde can be obtained via various synthetic routes and precursors.

It is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The most common side effects include diarrhea, rash, musculoskeletal pain, dry skin, skin inflammation around nails, sore mouth, fatigue, and cough. Osimertinib was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2015, and in the European Union in February 2016. == Medical uses == Osimertinib is used to treat locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), if the cancer cells are positive for the T790M mutation in the gene coding for EGFR or for activating EGFR mutations. The T790M mutation may be de novo or acquired following first-line treatment with other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib. In the US, EGFR exon 19 deletions, exon 21 L858R mutations, or the T790M status of the patient before treatment with osimertinib must be detected by a companion diagnostic test. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved multiple tests, including FoundationOne CDx for this purpose. In Europe and elsewhere, activating EGFR mutations or T790M mutations may be determined by a validated test. In February 2024, the FDA approved osimertinib, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, for people with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test. In people treated with osimertinib, resistance usually develops within approximately ten months. Resistance mediated by an exon 20 C797S mutation accounts for the majority of resistance cases, which has resulted in multiple attempts with non-ATP competitive or allosteric inhibitors to try and offset this acquired resistance by targeting other regions of the RTK kinase domain. In September 2024, the FDA approved osimertinib for adults with locally advanced, unresectable (stage III) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed during or following concurrent or sequential platinum-based chemoradiation therapy and whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test. == Adverse effects == Very common (greater than 10% of clinical trial subjects) adverse effects include diarrhea, stomatitis, rashes, dry or itchy skin, infections where finger or toenails abut skin, low platelet counts, low leukocyte counts, and low neutrophil counts. Common (between 1% and 10% of clinical trial subjects) adverse effects include interstitial lung disease. It can cause fetal harm. == Interactions == Osimertinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, so substances that strongly inhibit either enzyme, like macrolide antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals may increase exposure to osimertinib, and substances like rifampicin that activate either enzyme may decrease the effectiveness of osimertinib. == Pharmacology == Osimertinib preferentially binds irreversibly to mutated epidermal growth factor receptor proteins, particularly those with more common mutations in lung cancer such as L858R mutation or an exon 19 deletion. It exhibits linear pharmacokinetics; the median time to Cmax is 6 hours (range 3–24 hours). The estimated mean half-life is 48 hours, and oral clearance (CL/F) is 14.3 (L/h). 68% of elimination is by feces and 14% by urine. == Chemistry == Osimertinib is provided as the mesylate; the chemical formula is C28H33N7O2·CH4O3S, and the molecular weight is 596 g/mol. The chemical name is N-(2-{2-dimethylaminoethyl-methylamino}-4-methoxy-5-{[4-(1-methylindol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl]amino}phenyl)prop-2-enamide mesylate salt. == History == The drug discovery program that led to osimertinib started in 2009 and yielded the drug by 2012; the process was structure-driven and aimed to find a third-generation EGFR inhibitor that would selectively target the T790M form of the EGFR receptor. Osimertinib was designated as a breakthrough therapy in April 2014, based on phase I trial results, and the drug was provisionally approved under the FDA accelerated approval program with a priority review voucher, in November 2015. In February 2016, the EMA provisionally approved osimertinib under an accelerated process—the first approval under the program. In February 2024, the FDA approved osimertinib, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, for people with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test. Efficacy was evaluated in FLAURA 2 (NCT04035486), an open-label, randomized trial of 557 participants with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive la/mNSCLC and no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either osimertinib with platinum-based chemotherapy or osimertinib monotherapy.

Estrogens are well recognized to play the predominant role in breast cancer development and growth and much efforts have been devoted to the blockade of estrogen formation and action. The most widely used therapy of breast cancer which has shown benefits at all stages of the disease is the use of the antiestrogen Tamoxifen. This compound, however, possesses mixed agonist and antagonist activity and major efforts have been devoted to the development of compounds having pure antiestrogenic activity in the mammary gland and endometrium. Such a compound would avoid the problem of stimulation of the endometrium and the risk of endometrial carcinoma. We have thus synthesized an orally active non-steroidal antiestrogen, EM-652 (SCH 57068) and the prodrug EM-800 (SCH57050) which are the most potent of the known antiestrogens. EM-652 is the compound having the highest affinity for the estrogen receptor, including estradiol. It has higher affinity for the ER than ICI 182780, hydroxytamoxifen, raloxifene, droloxifene and hydroxytoremifene. EM-652 has the most potent inhibitory activity on both ER alpha and ER beta compared to any of the other antiestrogens tested. An important aspect of EM-652 is that it inhibits both the AF1 and AF2 functions of both ER alpha and ER beta while the inhibitory action of hydroxytamoxifen is limited to AF2, the ligand-dependent function of the estrogen receptors. AF1 activity is constitutive, ligand-independent and is responsible for mediation of the activity of growth factors and of the ras oncogene and MAP-kinase pathway. EM-652 inhibits Ras-induced transcriptional activity of ER alpha and ER beta and blocks SRC-1-stimulated activity of the two receptors. EM-652 was also found to block the recruitment of SRC-1 at AF1 of ER beta, this ligand-independent activation of AF1 being closely related to phosphorylation of the steroid receptors by protein kinase. Most importantly, the antiestrogen hydroxytamoxifen has no inhibitory effect on the SRC-1-induced ER beta activity while the pure antiestrogen EM-652 completely abolishes this effect, thus strengthening the need to use pure antiestrogens in breast cancer therapy in order to control all known aspects of ER-regulated gene expression. In fact, the absence of blockade of AF2 by hydroxytamoxifen could explain why the benefits of tamoxifen observed up to 5 years become negative at longer time intervals and why resistance develops to tamoxifen. EM-800, the prodrug of EM-652, has been shown to prevent the development of dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary carcinoma in the rat, a well-recognized model of human breast cancer. It is of interest that the addition of dehydroepiandrosterone, a precursor of androgens, to EM-800, led to complete inhibition of tumor development in this model. Not only the development, but also the growth of established DMBA-induced mammary carcinoma was inhibited by treatment with EM-800. An inhibitory effect was also observed when medroxyprogesterone was added to treatment with EM-800. Uterine size was reduced to castration levels in the groups of animals treated with EM-800. An almost complete disappearance of estrogen receptors was observed in the uterus, vaginum and tumors in nude mice treated with EM-800. EM-652 was the most potent antiestrogen to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer ZR-75-1, MCF-7 and T-47D cells in vitro when compared with ICI 182780, ICI 164384, hydroxytamoxifen, and droloxifene. Moreover, EM-652 and EM-800 have no stimulatory effect on the basal levels of cell proliferation in the absence of E2 while hydroxytamoxifen and droloxifene had a stimulatory effect on the basal growth of T-47D and ZR-75-1 cells. EM-652 was also the most potent inhibitor of the percentage of cycling cancer cells. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED) EM-652 (SCH 57068) is a new orally active antiestrogen that demonstrates pure antagonistic effects in the mammary gland and endometrium. In vivo studies have shown that EM-652 is primarily glucuronidated at the 7-hydroxy position in rats and that the metabolite is present in the plasma of female monkeys and human subjects after EM-800 (SCH 57050) or EM-652.HCl oral administration. Using hepatic microsomes from rat, monkey, and human, the formation of two EM-652 monoglucuronides at positions 4' and 7 was demonstrated by a liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method. Although no difference in EM-652 conjugation was observed between male and female monkey livers, an interindividual variation of hepatic EM-652 glucuronidation was shown with female human donors. Using microsome preparations from human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing each of the 12 human and 11 monkey UGT enzymes cloned to date, the two EM-652-monoglucuronides were detected after incubation with microsomes containing human UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and monkey monUGT1A01, monUGT1A03, and monUGT1A09. Despite human UGT1A1 and monkey monUGT1A09 favored formation of EM-652-7-glucuronide, other active UGT1A enzymes formed both 4'- and 7-glucuronide derivatives in equal amounts. Kinetic analysis of EM-652 glucuronidation by these enzymes showed Michaelis constant (K(m)) values between 36 and 302 microM for EM-652-4'-glucuronide and 19 and 233 microM for EM-652-7-glucuronide. The present results demonstrate the importance of UGT1A isoforms, mainly UGT1A1, for EM-652 metabolism in humans. The use of modulators of estrogen receptors activation is receiving increasing interest in menopausal medicine. Pure antiestrogens define a group of compounds exhibiting universal antagonistic properties. Nevertheless, we cannot disregard the possibility that they may still have some agonistic actions. Because estradiol (E2) has antioxidant properties, we tested the antioxidant capacity of two pure antiestrogens, ICI 182780 and EM-652 (SCH 57068). The ability of both compounds to protect isolated low-density lipoproteins against copper-induced oxidation in vitro was used as an index of their antioxidant properties. When compared with control (vehicle alone), ICI 182780 and EM-652 significantly increased the lag time of low-density lipoprotein oxidation when present at concentrations of 10 and 0.5 microM or greater, respectively. When compared with estrogens, ICI 182780 was as effective as E2 at the lower concentrations tested (0.1 and 1 microM) but less effective at higher concentrations. EM-652 had similar antioxidant potency as E2 but exerted maximal effects at lower concentration. Combined exposure to E2 and each of the antiestrogens resulted in a higher antioxidant effect than that of antiestrogen alone. Another estrogen (estrone), and selective estrogen-receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen and hydroxytamoxifen, displayed an antioxidant potency that was close to ICI 182780 but lower than EM-652. Progestogens, such as progesterone or medroxyprogesterone acetate, had no antioxidant effect. Both ICI 182780 and EM-652 exhibited potent antioxidant activity, which could have important biological implications.",Em 652; em-652; em652; sch57068; sch-57068; sch 57068,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.008716629818081856), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023266876116394997)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -2.935296834039036e-06)])","('INFO; ([abmole.com](https://www.abmole.com/products/acolbifene-hydrochloride.html?utm_source=openai), [adooq.com](https://www.adooq.com/acolbifene-em-652-sch57068.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=187, start_index=6, title='Acolbifene hydrochloride (EM-652 hydrochloride; SCH 57068 hydrochloride) | CAS 252555-01-4 | AbMole BioScience | Acolbifene hydrochloride Price', type='url_citation', url='https://www.abmole.com/products/acolbifene-hydrochloride.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=187, start_index=6, title='Acolbifene (EM 652, SCH57068) | estrogen receptor modulator | Buy from Supplier AdooQ®', type='url_citation', url='https://www.adooq.com/acolbifene-em-652-sch57068.html?utm_source=openai')])"

C57BL/6 mice were injected daily with AICAR (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [IP]) from day 0, the day of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) immunization, until day 21. The severity of uveitis was assessed clinically and histopathologically. T-cell proliferation and cytokine production of IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-10 in response to IRBP stimulation were determined. In addition, regulatory T-cell (Treg) populations were measured. Co-stimulatory molecule expression (CD40, 80, 86, and I-Ab) on dendritic cells (DCs) in EAU and on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) treated with AICAR was measured. AICAR treatment significantly reduced clinical and histologic severity of EAU as well as ocular cytokine production. An anti-inflammatory effect associated with the inhibition of T-cell proliferation and Th1 and Th17 cytokine production was observed. Increases in the Th2 response and Treg population were not observed with AICAR treatment. AICAR did significantly inhibit BMDC maturation by reducing co-stimulatory molecule expression. AICAR attenuates EAU by preventing generation of Ag-specific Th1 and Th17 cells. Impaired DC maturation may be an underlying mechanism for this anti-inflammatory effect observed with AICAR. In Salmonella enterica, the thiamine biosynthetic intermediate 5-aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR) can be synthesized de novo independently of the early purine biosynthetic reactions. This secondary route to AIR synthesis is dependent on (i) 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribotide (AICAR) accumulation, (ii) a functional phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide (SAICAR) synthetase (PurC; EC 6.3.2.6), and (iii) methionine and lysine in the growth medium. Studies presented here show that AICAR is a direct precursor to AIR in vivo. PurC-dependent conversion of AICAR to AIR was recreated in vitro. Physiological studies showed that exogenous nutrients (e.g., methionine and lysine) antagonize the inhibitory effects of AICAR on the ThiC reaction and decreased the cellular thiamine requirement. Finally, genetic results identified multiple loci that impacted the effect of AICAR on thiamine synthesis and implicated cellular aspartate levels in AICAR-dependent AIR synthesis. Together, the data here clarify the mechanism that allows conditional growth of a strain lacking the first five biosynthetic enzymes, and they provide additional insights into the complexity of the metabolic network and its plasticity. In bacteria, the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine is derived from aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR), an intermediate in purine biosynthesis. A previous study described conditions under which AIR synthesis is independent of purine biosynthesis. This work is an extension of that previous study and describes a new synthetic pathway to thiamine that depends on a novel thiamine precursor and a secondary activity of the biosynthetic enzyme PurC. These findings provide mechanistic details of redundancy in the synthesis of a metabolite that is essential for nucleotide and coenzyme biosynthesis. Metabolic modifications that allow the new pathway to function or enhance it are also described. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an analog of AMP is widely used as an activator of AMP-kinase (AMPK), a protein that regulates the responses of the cell to energy change. Recently, we showed that AICAR-induced AMPK activation inhibits the growth of retinoblastoma cells in vitro by decreasing cyclins and by inducing apoptosis and S-phase arrest. In this study, we investigated the effects of AMPK activator AICAR on the growth of retinoblastoma in vivo. Intraperitoneal injection of AICAR resulted in 48% growth inhibition of Y79 retinoblastoma cell tumors in mice. Tumors isolated from mice treated with AICAR had decreased expression of Ki67 and increased apoptotic cells (TUNEL positive) compared with the control. In addition, AICAR treatment suppressed significantly tumor vessel density and macrophage infiltration. We also showed that AICAR administration resulted in AMPK activation and mTOR pathway inhibition. Paradoxically observed down-regulation of p21, which indicates that p21 may have a novel function of an oncogene in retinoblastoma tumor. Our results indicate that AICAR treatment inhibited the growth of retinoblastoma tumor in vivo via AMPK/mTORC1 pathway and by apoptogenic, anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenesis mechanism.

It also interferes with several cellular signaling pathways and has an anti-inflammatory effect, which may have applications in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. === Metabolism === The enzyme 6'-deoxychalcone synthase uses malonyl-CoA, 4-coumaroyl-CoA, NADPH, and H+ to produce CoA, isoliquiritigenin, CO2, NADP+, and H2O. The enzyme isoliquiritigenin 2'-O-methyltransferase further transforms isoliquiritigenin into 2'-O-methylisoliquiritigenin. === Mechanism of action === Isoliquiritigenin has been found to be a potent (65 times higher affinity than diazepam) GABA-A benzodiapine receptor positive allosteric modulator. It can target miR-301b/LRIG1 signaling pathways, resulting in the inhibition of melanoma growth in vitro. == References ==",Isoliquiritigenin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.008249898441135883), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.02975570224225521), (' MED', -0.1305454522371292), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.04170619323849678), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0025227407459169626), ('ĠMED', -0.21634425222873688), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16046324372291565)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoliquiritigenin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=93, start_index=6, title='Isoliquiritigenin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoliquiritigenin?utm_source=openai')])"
1472,"('Oxybenzone', 'Benzophenone 3', 'Benzophenone-3', '(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)(phenyl)methanone', 'Oxybenzon')",Medical,"Oxybenzone or benzophenone-3 or BP-3 (trade names Milestab 9, Eusolex 4360, Escalol 567, KAHSCREEN BZ-3) is an organic compound belonging to the class of aromatic ketones known as benzophenones. It takes the form of pale-yellow crystals that are readily soluble in most organic solvents. It is widely used in sunscreen formulations, plastics, toys, furniture finishes, and other products to limit UV degradation. In nature, it can be found in various flowering plants (angiosperms). The compound was first synthesised in Germany by chemists König and Kostanecki in 1906. The use of oxybenzone as sunscreen ingredient is currently under scrutiny by the scientific community due to controversies about the molecule's environmental impact and safety profile (see section below). As a result, sunscreens containing oxybenzone have been banned from sale in Hawaii, Palau, and Thailand. == Structure and electronic structure == Being a conjugated molecule, oxybenzone absorbs light at lower energies than many aromatic molecules. As in related compounds, the hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the ketone. This interaction contributes to oxybenzone's light-absorption properties. At low temperatures, however, it is possible to observe both the phosphorescence and the triplet-triplet absorption spectrum. At 175 K the triplet lifetime is 24 ns. The short lifetime has been attributed to a fast intramolecular hydrogen transfer between the oxygen of the C=O and the OH. == Production == Oxybenzone is produced by the Friedel-Crafts reaction of benzoyl chloride with 3-methoxyphenol. == Uses == Oxybenzone is used in plastics as an ultraviolet light absorber and stabilizer. It is used, along with other benzophenones, in sunscreens, hair sprays, and cosmetics because they help prevent potential damage from sunlight exposure. It is also found, as a stabilizer in concentrations up to 1%, in nail polishes. Oxybenzone can also be used as a photostabilizer for synthetic resins. This substance can leach from food packaging, and is widely used as photo-initiators to activate a chemical that dries ink faster. Despite its photoprotective qualities, much controversy surrounds oxybenzone because of possible negative hormonal and photoallergenic effects, leading many countries to regulate use in sunscreen products. === Sunscreen === Oxybenzone provides a broad-spectrum ultraviolet coverage which includes UVB and short-wave UVA rays. As a photoprotective agent, it has an absorption profile spanning from 270 to 350 nm with absorption peaks at 288 and 350 nm. Due to toxicity and environmental concerns, the percentage of sunscreen products on the market containing oxybenzone in the USA dropped to 13% in 2023 from 60% in 2019. Some brands market their sunscreens as ""oxybenzone free"" due to the generally negative perception of benzophenones by both the consuming public and scientific researchers. == Safety == === In vivo studies === The incidence of oxybenzone causing skin eruptions is extremely uncommon, however, oxybenzone has been associated with rare allergic reactions triggered by sun exposure. In a study of 82 patients with photoallergic contact dermatitis, just over one quarter showed photoallergic reactions to oxybenzone. Evidence points to oxybenzone having contact allergen effects. Oxybenzone is allegedly the most common allergen found in sunscreens. In a 2008 study of participants ages 6 and up, oxybenzone was detected in 96.8% of urine samples. Humans can absorb anywhere from 0.4% to 8.7% of oxybenzone after one topical application of sunscreen, as measured in urine excretions. This number can increase after multiple applications over the same period of time. Because oxybenzone is the least lipophilic of the three most common UV filters, it is the least likely to end up trapped in the stratum corneum and the most likely to be absorbed and metabolized. When applied topically, UV filters, such as oxybenzone, are absorbed through the skin, metabolized, and excreted primarily through the urine. The method of biotransformation, the process by which a foreign compound is chemically transformed to form a metabolite, was determined by Okereke and colleagues through oral and dermal administration of oxybenzone to rats. The scientists analyzed blood, urine, feces, and tissue samples and found three metabolites: 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHB), 2,2-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (DHMB) and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THB). To form DHB the methoxy functional group undergoes O-dealkylation; to form THB the same ring is hydroxylated. Ring B in oxybenzone is hydroxylated to form DHMB. A study done in 2004 measured the levels of oxybenzone and its metabolites in urine. After topical application to human volunteers, results revealed that up to 1% of the applied dose was found in the urine. The major metabolite detected was DHB and very small amounts of THB were found. By utilizing the Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strains, DHB was determined to be nonmutagenic. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) noted in their recommendations for future study that, ""While research indicates that some topical drugs can be absorbed into the body through the skin, this does not mean these drugs are unsafe."" Oxybenzone can also occur as a natural product. == Environmental effects == Studies have shown possible links between oxybenzone exposure and mortality in coral larvae, coral bleaching, and to genetic damage in marine invertebrates. However, some of these studies have been criticised for not having control groups or representing real-world conditions. Nevertheless, these have led to the ban of oxybenzone-containing sunscreen in many areas such as Palau, Hawaii, nature reserves in Mexico, Bonaire, the Marshall Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, Thailand's marine natural parks, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Aruba. == Health and environmental regulation == === Aruba === Aruba banned the use of oxybenzone in sunscreens due to environmental concerns in 2019. === Australia === As of 2023, the maximum concentration of oxybenzone in a sunscreen cannot exceed 10% according to the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration). === Bonaire === As of 2019 Bonaire banned oxybenzone due to coral toxicity concerns, with regards to coral larvae === Canada === Revised as of 2012, Health Canada allows oxybenzone for cosmetic use up to 6%. === European Union === The European Food Safety Authority categorises All the benzophenones, such as oxybenzone, as persistent, bio-accumulative, toxic, and a possible human carcinogen and endocrine disruptor. The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Commission concluded that it poses a significant risk to consumers as a contact allergenic potential. It is allowed in face, hand, and lip products up to 6%, in body products up to 2.2%, and in other formulations up to 0.5%. === Japan === Revised as of 2001, the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare notification allows oxybenzone for cosmetic use up to 5%. === Mexico === Nature Reserves across Mexico have banned the usage of sunscreens containing Oxybenzone === Palau === The Palau government has signed a law that restricts the sale and use of sunscreen and skincare products that contain oxybenzone, and nine other chemicals. The ban came into force in 2020. === Sweden === The Swedish Research Council has determined that sunscreens with oxybenzone are unsuitable for use in young children, because children under the age of two years have not fully developed the enzymes that are believed to break it down. No regulations have come of this study yet. === Thailand === Thailand has prohibited sunscreens containing chemicals harmful to corals, including oxybenzone, in all its marine national parks. This decision was driven by evidence highlighting the detrimental effects of certain sunscreen ingredients on coral larvae, reproduction, and inducing reef bleaching. Violators face fines up to 100,000 baht (£2,100), although enforcement methods remain unspecified. === United States === In 2021 the U.S. FDA changed their classification of oxybenzone and no longer regard it as GRASE (Generally Recognised As Safe and Effective) due to the lack of safety data to support the classification. The Hawaii State Legislature has legislated oxybenzone as illegal for use in sunscreens and personal care products since 2021 due to its environmental effects, such as mortality in developing coral, coral bleaching, genetic damage to coral, and other marine organisms. Key West has also banned the sale of sunscreens that contain the ingredients oxybenzone (and octinoxate). The ban was to be effective as of January 1, 2021. However, this legislation was superseded by the Florida State Legislature by Senate Bill 172, which prohibits local governments from regulating over-the-counter proprietary drugs and cosmetics (such as sunscreen containing oxybenzone and octinoxate). The statute became effective July 1, 2020. == References ==",Benzophenone-3,WIKIPEDIA,"('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('PERSON', -0.03105318360030651), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.006718690041452646), (' INDUSTR', -0.061993569135665894), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.06198382377624512), (' FOOD', -6.988221684878226e-06)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('P', -0.08641841262578964), ('ERSON', 0.0), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ĠCARE', -7.593343616463244e-05), (',', -0.001932421582750976), ('ĠINDU', -0.0061334241181612015), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38693830370903015)])","('PERSONAL CARE', [('PERSON', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxybenzone,https://biomonitoring.ca.gov/chemicals/benzophenone-3-oxybenzone,https://cosmetics.specialchem.com/inci-ingredients/benzophenone-3 ', [])"

Aztreonam alone and the combination of clindamycin phosphate-aztreonam were prepared in duplicate polypropylene syringes. Each cephalosporin antibiotic as well as the three clindamycin phosphate-cephalosporin combinations were admixed in duplicate 100 ml partial-fill glass bottles containing either dextrose 5% in water or NaCl 0.9%. All solutions were examined, antibiotic concentrations were determined, and pH was measured at the time of admixture and 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours later. The solutions were maintained at room temperature under fluorescent lighting for the length of the study. Antibiotic concentrations were determined by drug-specific high performance liquid chromatographic assays. Significant instability or incompatibility was defined as a decrease in concentration of greater than ten percent relative to the initial concentration measured at the time of admixture. All antibiotics were stable for 48 hours. In the combination studies, clindamycin was stable for 48 hours, both in partial-fill glass bottles and syringes. Aztreonam, cefoperazone, cefonicid, and cefuroxime were also stable for 48 hours. Seven unknown antibiotic impurities in cefonicid sodium were separated and characterized by a trap-free two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution ion-trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry (2D-LC/IT-TOF MS) using both positive and negative modes of electrospray ionization. Trap-free 2D-LC and an online demineralization technique made it possible to characterize cefonicid sodium under the conditions of the official standard, and the TIC chromatogram obtained by LC/MS was in conformity with the LC chromatogram obtained by the official analytical method in the peak sequence of impurities.

1474,"('Cycloserine', 'Seromycin', 'Orientomycin', 'Oxamycin', 'Cyclo-d-serine')",Medical,"Cycloserine, sold under the brand name Seromycin, is a GABA transaminase inhibitor and an antibiotic, used to treat tuberculosis. Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, for active drug resistant tuberculosis. It is given by mouth. Common side effects include allergic reactions, seizures, sleepiness, unsteadiness, and numbness. It is not recommended in people who have kidney failure, epilepsy, depression, or are alcoholics. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Cycloserine is similar in structure to the amino acid D-alanine and works by interfering with the formation of the bacteria's cell wall. Cycloserine was discovered in 1954 from a type of Streptomyces. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Tuberculosis === For the treatment of tuberculosis, cycloserine is classified as a second-line drug. Its use is only considered if one or more first-line drugs cannot be used. Hence, cycloserine is restricted for use only against multiple drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. Another reason for limited use of this drug is the neurological side effects it causes, since it is able to penetrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and cause headaches, drowsiness, depression, dizziness, vertigo, confusion, paresthesias, dysarthria, hyperirritability, psychosis, convulsions, and shaking (tremors). Overdose of cycloserine may result in paresis, seizures, and coma, while alcohol consumption may increase the risk of seizures. Coadministration of pyridoxine can reduce the incidence of some of these CNS side effects (e.g. convulsions) caused by cycloserine. === Psychiatry === A 2015 Cochrane review found no evidence of benefit in anxiety disorders as of 2015. Another review found preliminary evidence of benefit. Evidence for use in addiction is tentative but also unclear. == Mechanism of action == Cycloserine works as an antibiotic by inhibiting cell-wall biosynthesis in bacteria. As a cyclic analogue of D-alanine, cycloserine acts against two crucial enzymes important in the cytosolic stages of peptidoglycan synthesis: alanine racemase (Alr) and D-alanine:D-alanine ligase (Ddl). The first enzyme is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme which converts the L-alanine to the D-alanine form. The second enzyme is involved in joining two of these D-alanine residues together by catalyzing the formation of the ATP-dependent D-alanine-D-alanine dipeptide bond between the resulting D-alanine molecules. If both of these enzymes are inhibited, then D-alanine residues cannot form and previously formed D-alanine molecules cannot be joined. This effectively leads to inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis. Psychiatric use is suggested based on partial NMDA receptor agonism, which improves neural plasticity in lab animals. The degree of clinical usefulness is, as aforementioned, unclear and still being explored, as of 2016. == Chemical properties == Under mildly acidic conditions, cycloserine hydrolyzes to give hydroxylamine and D-serine. Cycloserine can be conceptualized as a cyclized version of serine, with an oxidative loss of dihydrogen to form the nitrogen-oxygen bond. Cycloserine is stable under basic conditions, with the greatest stability at pH = 11.5. == Synthesis == Initial approaches to synthesize the compound was first published in 1955, when the Stammer group produced a racemic synthesis from DL‐β‐aminoxyalanine ethyl ester. In 1957, Platter et al. managed to synthesis the pure D-enantiomer by cyclizing the corresponding α‐amino‐β‐chlorohydroxamic acids. Chemical synthesis of the compound was revolutionized in the 2010s, when several approaches starting with the cheap D-serine (mirror form of normal L-serine) were published by different groups. The biosynthesis of the compound is defined by a ten-gene cluster. L-serine and L-arginine are converted to O-ureido-L-serine, flipped to O-ureido-D-serine, then turned into the final compound by cyclization. In 2013, Uda et al. successfully used recombinant versions of three enzymes in the cluster to produce the compound. A 1963 patent describes industrial production of the drug by bacterial fermentation. It is unclear what process is used in the 21st century, fermentation, or chemical synthesis. == History == The compound was first isolated nearly simultaneously by two teams. Workers at Merck isolated the compound, which they called oxamycin, from a species of Streptomyces. The same team prepared the molecule synthetically. Workers at Eli Lilly isolated the compound from strains of Streptomyces orchidaceus. It was shown to hydrolyze to serine and hydroxylamine. == Economics == In the U.S., the price of cycloserine increased from $500 for 30 pills to $10,800 in 2015 after the Chao Center for Industrial Pharmacy and Contract Manufacturing changed ownership to Rodelis Therapeutics in August 2015. The price increase was rescinded after the previous owner, the Purdue University Research Foundation, which retained ""oversight of the manufacturing operation"" intervened and Rodelis returned the drug to an NGO of Purdue University. The foundation now will charge $1,050 for 30 capsules, twice what it charged before"". Eli Lilly has been criticised for not ensuring that the philanthropic initiative continued. Due to US antitrust laws, however, no company may control the price of a product after it is outlicensed. In 2015, the cost in the United States was increased to US$3,150 a month and then decreased to US$1,050 per month. == Research == Reviews in 2016-17 found that cycloserine produced a small improvement in cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and had potential for use as a therapy in psychiatric diseases. == Further reading == A.

It belongs to the class of compounds related to benzene and its derivatives. It is being developed by the Seattle biotechnology company, Sound Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Ebselen has been entered into clinical trials as a lead compound intended for the potential treatment of various diseases. Its most advanced clinical trial is a Phase III study in people with Meniere's disease, completed in July 2024. In vitro, ebselen is a mimic of glutathione peroxidase and reacts with peroxynitrite.

(Route III). == History == The first patent for 2-phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3(2H)-one was filed in 1980 and granted in 1982. == Research == Ebselen is in preliminary clinical development for the potential treatment of hearing loss and depression, among other medical indications. == References == == External links == Sound Pharmaceuticals, Inc., corporate website",Ebselen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0017024369444698095), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.38697969913482666), (' INDUSTR', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0009888288332149386), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06200985610485077)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -2.1008713702030946e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.005233882926404476), (' INDUSTR', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24867080/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9445321/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7590103/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebselen,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27095225/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33225732/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7319625/,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.STR.29.1.12,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32598985/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9030939/ ', [])"
1477,"('Minocycline (hydrochloride)', 'Minocycline', 'Minocyclin', 'Minociclina', 'Dynacin')",Medical,"Minocycline, sold under the brand name Minocin among others, is a tetracycline antibiotic medication used to treat a number of bacterial infections such as some occurring in certain forms of pneumonia. It is generally (but not always) less preferred than the tetracycline doxycycline. Minocycline is also used for the treatment of acne and rheumatoid arthritis. It is taken by mouth or applied to the skin. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, allergic reactions, and kidney problems. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, a lupus-like syndrome, and easy sunburning. Use in the later part of pregnancy may harm the baby and safety during breastfeeding is unclear. It works by decreasing a bacterium's ability to make protein thus stopping its growth. Minocycline was patented in 1961 and came into commercial use in 1971. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 269th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Acne === Minocycline and doxycycline are frequently used for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Minocycline is specifically indicated to treat inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in people nine years of age and older. Both minocycline and doxycycline have similar levels of effectiveness and common adverse effects for acne, although doxycycline may have a slightly lower risk of adverse side effects. Both oral/systemic and more recently topical formulations of minocycline are available to treat acne. Historically, oral minocycline has been an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. However, acne that is caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem in many countries. In Europe and North America, a number of people with acne no longer respond well to treatment with tetracycline family antibiotics because their acne symptoms are caused by bacteria (primarily Cutibacterium acnes) that are resistant to these antibiotics. In order to reduce resistance rates as well as increase the effectiveness of treatment, oral antibiotics should be generally combined with topical acne creams such as benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid (tretinoin, adapalene, etc.). There have also been concerns about systemic minocycline having a variety of rare adverse effects in terms of its use to treat acne. Oral minocycline is used to treat acne for up to 3 to 4 months. Data beyond 3 to 4 months are limited. === Other infections === Minocycline is also used for other skin infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although minocycline's broader spectrum of activity, compared with other members of the group, includes activity against Neisseria meningitidis, its use for prophylaxis is no longer recommended because of side effects (dizziness and vertigo). It may be used to treat certain strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection and a disease caused by drug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. A list of uses includes: Amoebic dysentery Anthrax Bubonic plague Cholera Ehrlichiosis Gonorrhea (when penicillin cannot be given) Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome (confluent and reticulated papillomatosis) Hidradenitis suppurativa For use as an adjuvant to HAART Leprosy Periodontal disease Perioral dermatitis Respiratory infections such as pneumonia Rocky Mountain spotted fever Rosacea Syphilis (when penicillin cannot be given) Urinary tract infections (UTIs), rectal infections, and infections of the cervix caused by certain microbes Minocycline has been reported to be effective in the eradication of UTIs and prostatitis. A 2013 Cochrane review identified and included two comparative clinical trials of minocycline for chronic bacterial prostatitis. For this condition, minocycline has been found to be equivalent or superior to doxycycline, equivalent to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and superior to the first-generation cephalosporin cephalexin. It was also equivalent to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum. Treatment durations of minocycline for chronic bacterial prostatitis have ranged from 2 to 4 weeks. === Other uses === Both minocycline and doxycycline have shown effectiveness in asthma due to immune-suppressing effects. Minocycline and doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis does not include minocycline. === Available forms === Minocycline is available in the form of 50 and 100 mg oral capsules, among a variety of other formulations. The oral form of minocycline is usually taken twice daily, once every 12 hours, although divided doses four times daily can also be employed. Extended-release oral forms are also available. A topical formulation is available as well. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated in people with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline antibiotics, as there is complete cross sensitivity in this group. It is also contraindicated in people with severe liver impairment and after the 16th week of pregnancy. == Side effects == Minocycline may cause upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, migraines, and vomiting. It increases sensitivity to sunlight, and may affect the quality of sleep and rarely causes sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of minocycline can lead to blue-gray staining of skin, fingernails, and scar tissue. This staining is not permanent, but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; however, a muddy brown skin color in sun-exposed areas is usually permanent. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization. Occasionally, minocycline therapy may result in autoimmune disorders such as drug-related lupus and autoimmune hepatitis, which usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline-induced lupus; however, women are more likely to develop minocycline-induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline-induced autoimmune problems within a period of a few weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy. Autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy, but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with minocycline. Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause vestibular disturbances, including symptoms of dizziness, ataxia, vertigo, and tinnitus. These effects are thought to be related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. The vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, reportedly occurring in 50 to 70% of women receiving minocycline. However, other sources state that vestibular side effects occur in only 1 to 10% of patients. In any case, other studies have found that side effects occur more frequently in women than in men (~58% vs. 34%, respectively). Due to its vestibular side effects, minocycline has been said to be rarely used in female patients. Minocycline's vestibular side effects typically resolve after discontinuation of the drug. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage if not recognized early and treated. Contrary to most other tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline excluded), minocycline may be used in those with kidney disease, but may aggravate systemic lupus erythematosus. It may also trigger or unmask autoimmune hepatitis. Minocycline can cause the rare condition of secondary intracranial hypertension, which has initial symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and confusion. Brain swelling and rheumatoid arthritis are rare side effects of minocycline in some people. Minocycline, like most tetracyclines, becomes dangerous past its expiration date. While most prescription drugs lose potency after their expiration dates, tetracyclines are known to become toxic over time. Expired tetracyclines can cause serious damage to the kidney due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline. Minocycline's absorption is impaired if taken at the same time of day as calcium or iron supplements. Unlike some of the other tetracycline group antibiotics, it can be taken with calcium-rich foods such as milk, although this does reduce the absorption slightly. Minocycline, like other tetracyclines, is associated with esophageal irritation and ulceration if insufficient fluids are taken with the drug before sleep. A 2007 study suggested that minocycline harms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Patients on minocycline declined more rapidly than those on placebo. The mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. The effect does not seem to be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not do worse than those on the low doses. Other possible rare side effects of minocycline include hyperpigmentation and hypersensitivity reactions, among others. It has been associated with more rare and serious adverse effects than other tetracyclines. Some of the rare adverse effects of minocycline may result in death. This has spurred interest in topical instead of systemic minocycline for treatment of acne. Minocycine has shown thyroid toxicity in animals, including in rodents, mini pigs, dogs, and monkeys. The use of minocycline to treat acne has been associated with skin and gut dysbiosis (see antibiotic misuse). == Overdose == Symptoms of minocycline overdose may include dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. There is no specific antidote for overdose of minocycline and treatment should be symptom-based and supportive. The drug is not removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. == Interactions == The combination of minocycline with dairy, antacids, calcium and magnesium supplements, iron products, laxatives containing magnesium, or bile acid sequestrants may decrease minocycline's effectiveness by forming chelates. Combining it with isotretinoin, acitretin or other retinoids can increase the risk for intracranial hypertension. Minocycline significantly reduces concentrations of the anti-HIV drug atazanavir in the body. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antibiotic activity ==== Minocycline mediates its antibiotic activity by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria and thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. It is primarily bacteriostatic. The drug is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and shows activity against a wide range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. ==== Other activities ==== Minocycline shows a number of off-target activities in addition to its antibiotic activity. These include inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), anti-inflammatory effects, antiapoptotic effects, antioxidant effects, and neuroprotective effects. Some other reported activities of minocycline include: PARP1 inhibition Ki = 13.8 nM Neuroprotection IC50 = 10 nM Microglia full inhibition = 20 nM Suppression of the mouse's locomotor activity = 0.5 mg/kg Indirect inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Minocycline is quickly and nearly completely absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine. Taking it together with food, including milk, has no relevant influence on resorption. It reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after 1 to 2 hours. ==== Distribution ==== The drug has a plasma protein binding of 70 to 75%. It penetrates into almost all tissues; very high concentrations are found in the gallbladder and liver. It crosses the blood–brain barrier better than doxycycline and other tetracyclines, reaching therapeutically relevant concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and also in inflamed meninges. Minocycline achieves good concentrations in the urinary bladder, and many other tissues. It shows excellent penetration into the prostate gland. However, while permeation of prostate tissue and semen is good, levels are lower in prosatic fluid. ==== Metabolism ==== Minocycline is inactivated by metabolism in the liver to about 50%. It is primarily metabolized into 9-hydroxyminocycline. Two N-demethylated metabolites are also formed. ==== Elimination ==== The rest is predominantly excreted into the gut (in part via the gallbladder, in part directly from blood vessels) and eliminated via the feces. About 10–15% are eliminated via the kidneys. It is excreted about 5 to 10% unchanged in urine. For comparison, other tetracyclines, like doxycycline and tetracycline, are excreted 30 to 70% unchanged in urine. The biological half-life of minocycline is 11 to 26 hours in healthy people, up to 30 hours in those with kidney failure, and significantly longer in those with liver disease. == Chemistry == Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative. It is closely structurally related to other tetracyclic antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, and tigecycline. The drug is used in form of minocycline hydrochloride dihydrate, which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. Minocycline reacts acidic in aqueous solution. The partition coefficient (P) of minocycline has been reported to be 39.4 (i.e., log P of 1.60). However, other sources have stated the experimental log P of minocycline to be 0.05, 0.5, and 1.1. In any case, minocycline is consistently described as a highly lipophilic compound with excellent tissue penetration and distribution. It has been said to be unique among the tetracyclines in that it is the most lipophilic of all of the members of this group. Minocycline has 10 to 30 times greater lipophilicity than tetracycline and 5 times greater lipophilicity than doxycycline. The improved lipophilicity of minocycline is thought to be advantageous in terms of its clinical antibiotic effectiveness. == History == Minocycline was patented in 1961, was first described in the scientific literature in 1967, and came into commercial use in 1971. A topical foam for treatment of acne was approved in 2019. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Minomycin Minostad (in Europe, for the treatment of acne) Akamin Minocin Minoderm Cyclimycin Arestin (1-mg doses administered locally into periodontal pockets, after scaling and root planing, for treatment of periodontal disease.) Aknemin Solodyn (extended-release, for the treatment of acne) Dynacin Sebomin Mino-Tabs Acnamino Minopen (in Japan) Maracyn 2 (for treatment of bacterial infections in aquarium fish and amphibians) Quatrocin (in Syria) Minox (in Ireland) Minoz (in India and Romania) Divaine (in India) Vinocyclin 100 (100-mg dose approved for treatment of acne in Vietnam) Dentomycin (2% minocylcine gel for use in periodontal pockets) Amzeeq (4% foam, approved for treatment of acne United States) Zilxi (1.5% foam, approved for treatment of rosacea in the United States) Cleeravue-M === Generic availability === It is available as a generic medication. == Research == === Neuropsychiatric disorders === ==== Depression ==== Minocycline has been studied in the treatment of depression. According to a 2023 systematic review of minocycline for treatment-resistant depression based on four clinical trials, ""There is no significant difference with minocycline compared to placebo for depression not responding to first-line antidepressant therapy."" Likewise, a 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials found that minocycline was not significantly more effective than placebo in treating depression. Minocycline might have some benefit in treatment-resistant depression with inflammation however. Yet another meta-analysis, also published in 2023, found that minocycline was effective in the treatment of depression, including treatment-resistant depression, with a small to moderate effect size. ==== Schizophrenia ==== Early research has found a tentative benefit from minocycline in schizophrenia, with several trials underway as of 2012. A 2014 meta-analysis found minocycline may reduce negative and total symptom scores and was well tolerated. A 2019 meta-analysis, which included 13 randomized controlled trials, found that minocycline was effective in the treatment of the positive, negative, and general symptoms of schizophrenia, with small to moderate effect sizes. Similarly, a 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials found that minocycline was effective in treating the total, negative, and general symptoms of schizophrenia but not the positive or cognitive symptoms, again with small to moderate effect sizes. ==== Other conditions ==== Some early studies suggest that minocycline may be beneficial as an add-on treatment for moderate-to-severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) when used with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). === Stroke and neurodegenerative diseases === In ongoing research and trial, minocycline demonstrated efficacy and seems a promising neuroprotective agent in acute stroke patients, especially in AIS subgroup. Further RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of minocycline among ICH patients. Research is examining the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline against the progression of a group of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. As mentioned above, minocycline harms ALS patients. A trial found no difference between minocycline and placebo in people with Alzheimers' disease. Minocycline is somewhat neuroprotective in mouse models of Huntington's disease. === Multiple sclerosis === A 2007 study reported the impact of the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS. === Delirium === A 2024 randomized controlled trial found that prophylactic minocycline provided a small but significant decrease in delirium incidence in critically ill patients. Unexpectedly, there was also a significant decrease in hospital mortality with minocycline prophylaxis. The mortality benefits of minocycline might have simply been due to its bactericidal effects. === Hearing protection === Several preclinical studies (in vitro cell cultures and animal models) suggest that minocycline may have otoprotective benefits. Animal models indicate it could potentially reduce noise-induced and blast-induced hearing loss, possibly by protecting hair cells and mitigating inflammation. In vitro and animal studies also show minocycline may help decrease ototoxicity from certain drugs like gentamicin, neomycin, and cisplatin. === Other uses === Minocycline also has been used as a ""last-ditch"" treatment for toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients. Minocycline has been suggested as a possible treatment for post-COVID-19 syndrome (""long COVID""), but no quality clinical trials exist. The same is true of minocycline as a potential treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). == References ==",Dynacin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0013299677520990372), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014240548014640808)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/minocycline-oral-route/description/drg-20075715?utm_source=openai), [drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/cons/dynacin.html?utm_source=openai), [rxlist.com](https://www.rxlist.com/dynacin-drug.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=284, start_index=9, title='Minocycline (oral route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/minocycline-oral-route/description/drg-20075715?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=284, start_index=9, title='Dynacin Advanced Patient Information - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/cons/dynacin.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=284, start_index=9, title='Dynacin (Minocycline Hydrochloride Tablets): Side Effects, Uses, Dosage, Interactions, Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxlist.com/dynacin-drug.htm?utm_source=openai')])"
1478,"('Crenolanib', 'Crenolanib (cp-868596)', 'Crenolanib [usan]', 'Cp 868596', 'Crenolanib (usan)')",Medical,"Crenolanib besylate (CP-868,596-26 or AR-868,596-26, 4-piperidinamine, 1-[2-[5-[(3-Methyl-3-oxetanyl) methoxy]-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl]- 8-quinolinyl]-, monobenzenesulfonate) is an investigational inhibitor being developed by AROG Pharmaceuticals, LLC. As of 2014, the compound was being evaluated for safety and efficacy in clinical trials for various types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), and glioma. Crenolanib is an orally bioavailable benzimidazole that selectively and potently inhibits signaling of wild-type and mutant isoforms of class III receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) FLT3 (FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3), PDGFR α (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor), and PDGFR β. Unlike most RTK inhibitors, crenolanib is a type I mutant-specific inhibitor that preferentially binds to phosphorylated active kinases with the ‘DFG in’ conformation motif. == Background == Type III Receptor tyrosine kinase, including FLT3, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematological malignancies. Mutations of FLT3 comprise one of the most frequently identified types of genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia. Approximately one-third of AML patients present with a mutation in this gene. The majority of these mutations result in constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways and aberrant cell growth. Mutations in FLT3 have also been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Activating mutations in PDGFRA have been detected in 5-12% of Gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Fusion of PDGFRA has been found to be responsible for hematological malignances like hypereosinophilic syndrome. The amplification of chromosome 4q12, the site of the PDGFRA gene, has been identified in 13-29% of adult gliomas and in 29% to 36% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), a subset of high-grade gliomas (HGG) in pediatric patients. Activation of PDGFRB, a third member of the type III RTK family, has been implicated in the development of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia due to the fusion of PDGFRB with the TEL gene. Furthermore, PDGFB translocation to the COL1A1 gene locus has been identified to be responsible for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). In cancer cells, PDGFR promotes tumor development and migration via proto-oncogenic downstream mediators like AKT and MEK. In stromal fibroblasts, PDGFRα activation leads to local tissue invasion, production and secretion of VEGF, and elevated intratumoral interstitial pressure. In stromal pericytes, PDGFRβ activation mediates vascular stability. Thus, either FLT3 or PDGF/PDGFR pathway is the primary driver of oncogenesis in the above malignancies and can be targeted by crenolanib therapy. == Mechanism == === FLT3: wild-type and mutant === Crenolanib inhibits both wild type FLT3 and its constitutively active mutations. In vitro studies have shown that crenolanib has low Kd for the FLT3 enzyme with constitutively activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations, D835H and D835Y, as compared to wild type. Crenolanib tightly binds to FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835H and FLT3-D835Y with Kd of 0.74 nM, 0.4 nM, and 0.18 nM, respectively. Crenolanib inhibits the phosphorylation of the FLT3-ITD receptor in transfected TF-1 cells and the FLT3-D835Y TKD mutation in transfected Ba/F3 cells at nanomolar IC50 concentrations of 1.3 nM and 8.8 nM, respectively. Immunoblot experiments performed in the Molm14 FLT3-ITD positive cell line show that crenolanib inhibits downstream signaling of FLT3 at a concentration of 10 nM. MTT assay measurements of crenolanib cytotoxicity evaluated in the FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines Molm14 and MV411, showed that crenolanib is toxic at IC50 concentrations of 7 nM and 8 nM, respectively. === PDGFRα: wild-type and mutant === Crenolanib has been shown to inhibit PDGFRα with an IC50 of 0.4 ng/mL in porcine aortic epithelial cell lines. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing PDGFRα, crenolanib inhibited the phosphorylation of wild type PDGFRα at an IC50 of 10 nM. Additionally, crenolanib completely blocked PDGFRα phosphorylation and downstream AKT signaling at a concentration between 0.1 and 1 uM in Ink4a/Arf-/- mouse astrocytes transfected to stably co-express both human PDGFRα and PDGF AA. The lung cancer cell line H1703, which is reported to have amplification of both PDGFRA (4q12) and PDGFC (4q32) genes on chromosome 4, and also overexpress PDGFRα, was sensitive to crenolanib with an IC50 of ~80 nM. In CHO cells expressing an activating exon 18 (D842V) PDGFRα mutation, crenolanib was effective at an IC50 of 6nM and IC90 of 25nM. In addition, crenolanib also inhibited phosphorylation of the double mutants PDGFRα (V561D + D842V and T674I + D842V). === PDGFRβ: wild-type === Crenolanib has been shown to inhibit PDGFRβ with an IC50 of 0.8 ng/mL in porcine aortic epithelial cell lines. Crenolanib inhibits the ability of recombinant PDGFRβ to phosphorylate a synthetic tyrosine substrate (poly-glutamic acid-tyrosine), with an IC50 of 0.4 ng/mL. Evaluation of the antitumor activity of crenolanib in a genetically engineered BSG DIPG mouse model showed that it is highly selective for PDGFRβ with an IC50 of 10 nM when measured by BrdU assay and 1.25 uM by MTT assay. === C-Kit: wild-type and mutant === Crenolanib has been shown to have IC50 and Kd values of 67 nM and 78 nM, respectively, for wild type c-KIT in in vitro assays. Similar assays show that crenolanib inhibits c-KIT activating mutations D816H and D816V with IC50 concentrations of 5.4 and 2.5 nM, respectively. Human bone marrow progenitor cell growth assays showed that crenolanib has modest effects on GM-CSF and BFUE driven colony formation at the IC50 concentration of 20 nM. == Clinical == Phase I single-agent and Phase Ib combination studies have investigated the clinical pharmacology of crenolanib in patients with cancer. Pharmacokinetic and safety studies of Crenolanib administered alone or in combination with docetaxel with or without axitinib have been completed.

1480,"('Tyramine', 'P-tyramine', 'Uteramine', 'Tocosine', 'Tyrosamine')","Food, Medical","Tyramine ( TY-rə-meen) (also spelled tyramin), also known under several other names, is a naturally occurring trace amine derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyramine acts as a catecholamine releasing agent. Notably, it is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting in only non-psychoactive peripheral sympathomimetic effects following ingestion. A hypertensive crisis can result, however, from ingestion of tyramine-rich foods in conjunction with the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). == Occurrence == Tyramine occurs widely in plants and animals, and is metabolized by various enzymes, including monoamine oxidases. In foods, it often is produced by the decarboxylation of tyrosine during fermentation or decay. Foods that are fermented, cured, pickled, aged, or spoiled have high amounts of tyramine. Tyramine levels go up when foods are at room temperature or go past their freshness date. Specific foods containing considerable amounts of tyramine include: Strong or aged cheeses: cheddar, Swiss, Parmesan, Stilton, Gorgonzola or blue cheeses, Camembert, feta, Muenster Meats that are cured, smoked, or processed: such as salami, pepperoni, dry sausages, hot dogs, bologna, bacon, corned beef, pickled or smoked fish, caviar, aged chicken livers, soups or gravies made from meat extract Pickled or fermented foods: sauerkraut, kimchi, tofu (especially stinky tofu), pickles, miso soup, bean curd, tempeh, sourdough breads Condiments: soy, shrimp, fish, miso, teriyaki, and bouillon-based sauces Drinks: beer (especially tap or home-brewed), vermouth, red wine, sherry, liqueurs Beans, vegetables, and fruits: fermented or pickled vegetables, overripe fruits Chocolate Scientists more and more consider tyramine in food as an aspect of safety. They propose projects of regulations aimed to enact control of biogenic amines in food by various strategies, including usage of proper fermentation starters, or preventing their decarboxylase activity. Some authors wrote that this has already given positive results, and tyramine content in food is now lower than it has been in the past. === In plants === Mistletoe (toxic and not used by humans as a food, but historically used as a medicine). === In animals === Tyramine also plays a role in animals including: In behavioral and motor functions in Caenorhabditis elegans; Locusta migratoria swarming behaviour; and various nervous roles in Rhipicephalus, Apis, Locusta, Periplaneta, Drosophila, Phormia, Papilio, Bombyx, Chilo, Heliothis, Mamestra, Agrotis, and Anopheles. == Biological activity == Tyramine is a norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent (NDRA) and indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Evidence for the presence of tyramine in the human brain has been confirmed by postmortem analysis. Additionally, the possibility that tyramine acts directly as a neuromodulator was revealed by the discovery of a G protein-coupled receptor with high affinity for tyramine, called the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR1). The TAAR1 receptor is found in the brain, as well as peripheral tissues, including the kidneys. Tyramine is a full agonist of the TAAR1 in rodents and humans. Tyramine is physiologically metabolized by monoamine oxidases (primarily MAO-A), FMO3, PNMT, DBH, and CYP2D6. Human monoamine oxidase enzymes metabolize tyramine into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. If monoamine metabolism is compromised by the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and foods high in tyramine are ingested, a hypertensive crisis can result, as tyramine also can displace stored monoamines, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, from pre-synaptic vesicles. Tyramine is considered a ""false neurotransmitter"", as it enters noradrenergic nerve terminals and displaces large amounts of norepinephrine, which enters the blood stream and causes vasoconstriction. Additionally, cocaine has been found to block blood pressure rise that is originally attributed to tyramine, which is explained by the blocking of adrenaline by cocaine from reabsorption to the brain. The first signs of this effect were discovered by a British pharmacist who noticed that his wife, who at the time was on MAOI medication, had severe headaches when eating cheese. For this reason, it is still called the ""cheese reaction"" or ""cheese crisis"", although other foods can cause the same problem. Most processed cheeses do not contain enough tyramine to cause hypertensive effects, although some aged cheeses (such as Stilton) do. A large dietary intake of tyramine (or a dietary intake of tyramine while taking MAO inhibitors) can cause the tyramine pressor response, which is defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg or more. The increased release of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from neuronal cytosol or storage vesicles is thought to cause the vasoconstriction and increased heart rate and blood pressure of the pressor response. In severe cases, adrenergic crisis can occur. Although the mechanism is unclear, tyramine ingestion also triggers migraine attacks in sensitive individuals and can even lead to stroke. Vasodilation, dopamine, and circulatory factors are all implicated in the migraines. Double-blind trials suggest that the effects of tyramine on migraine may be adrenergic. Research reveals a possible link between migraines and elevated levels of tyramine. A 2007 review published in Neurological Sciences presented data showing migraine and cluster diseases are characterized by an increase of circulating neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (including tyramine, octopamine, and synephrine) in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and dopaminergic system. People with migraine are over-represented among those with inadequate natural monoamine oxidase, resulting in similar problems to individuals taking MAO inhibitors. Many migraine attack triggers are high in tyramine. If one has had repeated exposure to tyramine, however, there is a decreased pressor response; tyramine is degraded to octopamine, which is subsequently packaged in synaptic vesicles with norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Therefore, after repeated tyramine exposure, these vesicles contain an increased amount of octopamine and a relatively reduced amount of norepinephrine. When these vesicles are secreted upon tyramine ingestion, there is a decreased pressor response, as less norepinephrine is secreted into the synapse, and octopamine does not activate alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. When using a MAO inhibitor (MAOI), an intake of approximately 10 to 25 mg of tyramine is required for a severe reaction, compared to 6 to 10 mg for a mild reaction. Tyramine, like phenethylamine, is a monoaminergic activity enhancer (MAE) of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in addition to its catecholamine-releasing activity. That is, it enhances the action potential-mediated release of these monoamine neurotransmitters. The compound is active as a MAE at much lower concentrations than the concentrations at which it induces the release of catecholamines. The MAE actions of tyramine and other MAEs may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. == Biosynthesis == Biochemically, tyramine is produced by the decarboxylation of tyrosine via the action of the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase. Tyramine can, in turn, be converted to methylated alkaloid derivatives N-methyltyramine, N,N-dimethyltyramine (hordenine), and N,N,N-trimethyltyramine (candicine). In humans, tyramine is produced from tyrosine, as shown in the following diagram. == Chemistry == In the laboratory, tyramine can be synthesized in various ways, in particular by the decarboxylation of tyrosine. == Society and culture == === Legal status === ==== United States ==== Tyramine is a Schedule I controlled substance, categorized as a hallucinogen, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the state of Florida without a license at any purity level or any form whatsoever. The language in the Florida statute says tyramine is illegal in ""any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any quantity of [tyramine] or that contains any of [its] salts, isomers, including optical, positional, or geometric isomers, and salts of isomers, if the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible within the specific chemical designation."" This ban is likely the product of lawmakers overly eager to ban substituted phenethylamines, which tyramine is, in the mistaken belief that ring-substituted phenethylamines are hallucinogenic drugs like the 2C series of psychedelic substituted phenethylamines. The further banning of tyramine's optical isomers, positional isomers, or geometric isomers, and salts of isomers where they exist, means that meta-tyramine and phenylethanolamine, a substance found in every living human body, and other common, non-hallucinogenic substances are also illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida. Given that tyramine occurs naturally in many foods and drinks (most commonly as a by-product of bacterial fermentation), e.g. wine, cheese, and chocolate, Florida's total ban on the substance may prove difficult to enforce. == Notes == == References ==",P-tyramine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.04366880655288696), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00015860427811276168), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -4.961759259458631e-06)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.16497902572155), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0005569098866544664), ('ĠEND', -0.005056213121861219), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10029080510139465)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -6.0629870858974755e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -9.615255839889869e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS,FOOD;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2830119/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563197/,https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/tyramine ', [])"

1484,"('Repaglinide', 'Ag-ee 623zw', 'Prandin', 'Novonorm', 'Gluconorm')",Medical,"Repaglinide is an antidiabetic drug in the class of medications known as meglitinides, and was invented in 1983. Repaglinide is a medication used in addition to diet and exercise for blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. The mechanism of action of repaglinide involves promoting insulin release from β-islet cells of the pancreas; like other antidiabetic drugs, a main side effect concern is hypoglycemia. It is sold by Novo Nordisk under the name of Prandin in the United States, Gluconorm in Canada, Surepost in Japan, Repaglinide in Egypt, and Novonorm elsewhere. In Japan it is produced by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma. == Medical uses == Repaglinide is an oral medication used in addition to diet and exercise for blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes. == Contraindications == Repaglinide is contraindicated in people with: Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma Type 1 diabetes Co-administration with gemfibrozil Known hypersensitivity to drug or inactive ingredients == Adverse events == Common adverse events include: Metabolic Hypoglycemia (31%) Respiratory Upper respiratory infection (16%) Sinusitis (6%) Rhinitis (3%) Gastrointestinal Nausea (5%) Diarrhea (5%) Constipation (3%) Vomiting (3%) Musculoskeletal Arthralgia (6%) Back Pain (5%) Other Headache (11%) Paresthesia (3%) Serious adverse events include: Cardiac ischemia (2%) Angina (1.8%) Deaths due to cardiovascular events (0.5%) == Special populations == Pregnancy category C: safety in pregnant women has not been established. Data is limited, and there is only one case report that notes no complications with the use of repaglinide during pregnancy. Caution should be taken in people with liver disease and decreased kidney function when using this medication. == Drug interactions == Repaglinide is a major substrate of CYP3A4 and should not be administered concomitantly with gemfibrozil, clarithromycin or azole antifungals such as itraconazole or ketoconazole. Administration of both repaglinide and one or more of these drugs results in an increase in plasma concentration of repaglinide and may lead to hypoglycemia. Co-administration of repaglinide and clopidogrel (a CYP2C8 inhibitor) may lead to a significant decrease in blood glucose levels due to a drug-drug interaction. In fact, using these drugs together for even one day can cause repaglinide levels to increase over 5-fold...and may lead to significant hypoglycemia. Repaglinide should not be combined with sulfonylurea, because they have the same mechanism of action. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Repaglinide lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta islet cells of the pancreas. It achieves this by closing ATP-dependent potassium channels in the membrane of the beta cells. This depolarizes the beta cells, opening the cells' calcium channels, and the resulting calcium influx induces insulin secretion. === Pharmacokinetics === Absorption: repaglinide has a 56% bioavailability when absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Bioavailability is reduced when taken with food; the maximum concentration decreases by 20%. Distribution: The protein binding of repalglinide to albumin is greater than 98%. Metabolism: repaglinide is primarily metabolized by the liver - specifically CYP450 2C8 and 3A4 - and to a lesser extent via glucuronidation. Metabolites of repaglinide are inactive and do not display glucose-lowering effects. Excretion: repaglinide is 90% excreted in the feces and 8% in the urine. 0.1% is cleared unchanged in the urine. Less than 2% is unchanged in the feces. == History == Precursor drugs to repaglinide were invented in late 1983 by scientists at Dr Karl Thomae GmbH, a German drug manufacturer located at Biberach an der Riß in southern Germany which was acquired by Boehringer Ingelheim in 1990. The drug that became repaglinide was later licensed by Boehringer to Novo Nordisk, which filed an Investigational New Drug application for the compound with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 1992. Novo Nordisk filed its New Drug Application (NDA) for Prandin in July 1997 and it was quickly approved, gaining FDA approval in December 1997. The drug was the first of the meglitinide class. It was branded Prandin because its quick onset and short duration of action concentrates its effect around meal time (the prandium was the Roman meal which is comparable to the modern lunch). == Intellectual property == After several attempts to file for U.S. patent protection, a filing was made in March 1990 which eventually became U.S. Patents 5,216,167 (June 1993), 5,312,924 (May 1994) and 6,143,769 (November 2000). After filing its NDA for repaglinide in 1997, Novo Nordisk applied for patent extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. This process, called patent term restoration, allows drug patents to be extended based on the time that a drug spent in clinical trials and in the approval process. Previously it had been decided by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that the expiration date of U.S. Patents 5,216,167 and 5,312,924 would be 5 September 2006. In February 2001 Prandin's patent life was extended to 14 March 2009 in response to Novo Nordisk's patent term restoration application, with U.S. Patent 5,216,167 having been reissued as RE37035. Prior to the end of repaglinide's patent term, Novo Nordisk obtained a new patent, U.S. Patent 6,677,358 (January 2004), covering the combination therapy of repaglinide together with the generic anti-diabetic drug metformin. This new patent was due to expire June 2018. In January 2011, a federal court ruled Novo Nordisk's new patent invalid on the grounds of obviousness, and unenforceable on the grounds of inequitable conduct on the part of Novo Nordisk's patent attorneys. == References == == External links == ""Repaglinide"".

Captopril was the first oral ACE inhibitor found for the treatment of hypertension. It does not cause fatigue as associated with beta-blockers. Due to the adverse drug event of causing hyperkalemia, as seen with most ACE Inhibitors, the medication is usually paired with a diuretic. Captopril was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1980. == Structure–activity relationship == Captopril has an L-proline group which allows it to be more bioavailable in oral formulations. The thiol moiety within the molecule has been associated with two significant adverse effects: the hapten or immune response. This immune response, also known as agranulocytosis, can explain the adverse drug events which may be seen in captopril with the allergic response which includes hives, severe stomach pain, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat. In terms of interaction with the enzyme, the molecule's thiol moiety will attach to the binding site of the ACE enzyme. This will inhibit the port at which the angiotensin-1 molecule would normally bind, therefore inhibiting the downstream effects within the renin-angiotensin system. == Medical uses == Captopril's main uses are based on its vasodilation and inhibition of some renal function activities. These benefits are most clearly seen in: Hypertension Cardiac conditions such as congestive heart failure and after myocardial infarction Preservation of kidney function in diabetic nephropathy.

Captopril stereoisomers were also reported to inhibit some metallo-β-lactamases. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects of captopril include cough due to increase in the plasma levels of bradykinin, angioedema, agranulocytosis, proteinuria, hyperkalemia, taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia. Except for postural hypotension, which occurs due to the short and fast mode of action of captopril, most of the side effects mentioned are common for all ACE inhibitors. Among these, cough is the most common adverse effect. Hyperkalemia can occur, especially if used with other drugs which elevate potassium level in blood, such as potassium-sparing diuretics. Other side effects are: Itching Headache Tachycardia Chest pain Palpitations Dysgeusia Weakness The adverse drug reaction (ADR) profile of captopril is similar to other ACE inhibitors, with cough being the most common ADR. However, captopril is also commonly associated with rash and taste disturbances (metallic or loss of taste), which are attributed to the unique thiol moiety. == Overdose == ACE inhibitor overdose can be treated with naloxone. == History == In the late 1960s, John Vane of the Royal College of Surgeons of England was working on mechanisms by which the body regulates blood pressure. He was joined by Sérgio Henrique Ferreira of Brazil, who had been studying the venom of a Brazilian pit viper, the jararaca (Bothrops jararaca), and brought a sample of the viper's venom. Vane's team found that one of the venom's peptides selectively inhibited the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which was thought to function in blood pressure regulation; the snake venom functions by severely depressing blood pressure. During the 1970s, ACE was found to elevate blood pressure by controlling the release of water and salts from the kidneys. Captopril, an analog of the snake venom's ACE-inhibiting peptide, was first synthesized in 1975 by three researchers at the U.S. drug company E.R. Squibb & Sons Pharmaceuticals (now Bristol-Myers Squibb): Miguel Ondetti, Bernard Rubin, and David Cushman. Squibb filed for U.S. patent protection on the drug in February 1976, which was granted in September 1977, and captopril was approved for medical use in 1980. It was the first ACE inhibitor developed and was considered a breakthrough both because of its mechanism of action and also because of the development process. In the 1980s, Vane received the Nobel prize and was knighted for his work and Ferreira received the National Order of Scientific Merit from Brazil. The development of captopril was among the earliest successes of the revolutionary concept of structure-based drug design. The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system had been extensively studied in the mid-20th century, and this system presented several opportune targets in the development of novel treatments for hypertension. The first two targets that were attempted were renin and ACE. Captopril was the culmination of efforts by Squibb's laboratories to develop an ACE inhibitor. Ondetti, Cushman, and colleagues built on work that had been done in the 1960s by a team of researchers led by John Vane at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The first breakthrough was made by Kevin K.F. Ng in 1967, when he found the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II took place in the pulmonary circulation instead of in the plasma. In contrast, Sergio Ferreira found bradykinin disappeared in its passage through the pulmonary circulation. The conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and the inactivation of bradykinin were thought to be mediated by the same enzyme. In 1970, using bradykinin potentiating factor (BPF) provided by Sergio Ferreira, Ng and Vane found the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation. BPF was later found to be a peptide in the venom of a lancehead viper (Bothrops jararaca), which was a “collected-product inhibitor” of the converting enzyme. Captopril was developed from this peptide after it was found via QSAR-based modification that the terminal sulfhydryl moiety of the peptide provided a high potency of ACE inhibition. Captopril gained FDA approval on April 6, 1981. The drug became a generic medicine in the U.S. in February 1996, when the market exclusivity held by Bristol-Myers Squibb for captopril expired. == Chemical synthesis == A chemical synthesis of captopril by treatment of L-proline with (2S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl chloride under basic conditions (NaOH), followed by aminolysis of the protective acetyl group to unmask the drug's free thiol, is depicted in the figure at right. Procedure 2 taken out of patent US4105776. See examples 28, 29a and 36. == Mechanism of action == Captopril blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and prevents the degradation of vasodilatory prostaglandins, thereby inhibiting vasoconstriction and promoting systemic vasodilation. == Pharmacokinetics == Unlike the majority of ACE inhibitors, captopril is not administered as a prodrug (the only other being lisinopril). About 70% of orally administered captopril is absorbed. Bioavailability is reduced by presence of food in stomach. It is partly metabolised and partly excreted unchanged in urine. Captopril also has a relatively poor pharmacokinetic profile. The short half-life necessitates dosing two or three times per day, which may reduce patient compliance. Captopril has a short half-life of 2–3 hours and a duration of action of 12–24 hours. == See also == Captopril challenge test Captopril suppression test == References == == External links == ""Captopril"".

1487,"('Dexpramipexole (dihydrochloride)', '(r)-pramipexole (dihydrochloride)', 'R-pramipexole (dihydrochloride)', 'Dexpramipexole', '(r)-pramipexole')",Medical,"== About == Dexpramipexole is a first-in-class oral investigational medicine that lowers blood and tissue eosinophils before they can cause damage in the target organ. Dexpramipexole is being developed by Areteia Therapeutics and has the potential to be the first oral treatment ever approved for eosinophilic asthma. The eosinophil-targeting effects of oral dexpramipexole were discovered during its clinical development. Across five clinical trials, dexpramipexole has consistently been shown to significantly reduce blood eosinophil counts. == Recent data == The most recently completed dexpramipexole clinical trial was EXHALE-1 (AS201), a Phase II clinical trial in participants with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma. Dexpramipexole demonstrated highly significant, dose dependent eosinophil lowering during the primary assessment phase and was maximal at Week 12. Dexpramipexole produced clinically relevant changes in FEV1 across study arms and time points and the magnitude of FEV1 improvement was comparable to currently approved biologics. Dexpramipexole was well tolerated in the trial, with adverse events balanced across treatment and placebo groups, no serious adverse events, and no adverse events leading to discontinuation. == Phase III Development Underway == Areteia Therapeutics is currently conducting three global Phase III clinical trials of dexpramipexole in eosinophil-associated asthma as listed below. EXHALE-2: a global Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dexpramipexole as an add-on oral therapy in participants with inadequately controlled eosinophilic asthma, is currently recruiting people ≥12 years old with a documented physician diagnosis of asthma who require medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids with at least one other controller medicine and a history of asthma exacerbations. The study will assess the effects of two different doses of dexpramipexole on exacerbation rates and lung function. EXHALE-3: a global Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dexpramipexole as an add-on oral therapy in participants with inadequately controlled eosinophilic asthma, is currently recruiting people ≥12 years old with a documented physician diagnosis of asthma who require medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids with at least one other controller medicine and a history of asthma exacerbations. The study will assess the effects of two different doses of dexpramipexole on exacerbation rates and lung function. EXHALE-4: a global Phase III clinical trial to evaluate dexpramipexole as an add-on oral therapy in participants with inadequately controlled eosinophilic asthma, is currently recruiting people ≥12 years old with a documented physician diagnosis of asthma who require treatment with at least low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and one other controller medicine. The study will assess improvements in lung function, asthma control, and quality of life. == History == Dexpramipexole was originally identified as a candidate therapy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease by James Bennett, M.D., Ph.D., then of the University of Virginia. The drug was initially investigated in ALS by Knopp Biosciences and Biogen Idec. A 2010 Phase II clinical trial showed a slowing of ALS disease progression and mortality benefits. In January 2013, Biogen Idec discontinued its development of dexpramipexole in ALS due to lack of efficacy in the Phase III study. As a result of observing eosinophil lowering in the ALS trials, Knopp pivoted dexpramipexole clinical development to eosinophil associated diseases. In subsequent clinical trials, dexpramipexole significantly reduced eosinophil counts and glucocorticoid requirements in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome and significantly reduced blood and tissue eosinophil counts in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. == Chemical structure and Pharmacology == Dexpramipexole is the (D)-enantiomer of pramipexole. Enantiopure dexpramipexole has essentially no dopamine agonist activity and shares no other pharmacologic similarity to pramipexole. In contrast, pramipexole the (S)-enantiomer is a dopamine agonist and is an approved drug (Mirapex) used in Parkinson's disease. Dexpramipexole is a low molecular weight, orally bioavailable, water-soluble small molecule with linear pharmacokinetics and linear dose proportionality. == References == == External links == STATEMENT ON A NONPROPRIETARY NAME ADOPTED BY THE USAN COUNCIL, contains structural formula and chemical name Clinicaltrials.gov: Dexpramipexole Dose-Ranging Biomarker Study in Subjects With Eosinophilic Asthma (AS201) Clinicaltrials.gov:Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Dexpramipexole (KNS-760704) in Subjects With Hypereosinophilic Syndrome Clinicaltrials.gov:Study of Dexpramipexole Chronic Sinusitis With Nasal Polyps and Eosinophilia (CS201)",Dexpramipexole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004306692280806601), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00035315475543029606), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024782679975032806)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexpramipexole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=6, title='Dexpramipexole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexpramipexole?utm_source=openai')])"
