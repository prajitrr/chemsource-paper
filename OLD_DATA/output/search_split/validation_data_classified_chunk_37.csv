3667,"('Brimonidine', 'Uk 14304', 'Bromoxidine', 'Uk 14,304', 'Uk 14304;agn190342')",Medical,"Brimonidine is an α2 agonist medication used to treat open-angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension, and rosacea. In rosacea it improves the redness. It is used as eye drops or applied to the skin. It is also available in the fixed-dose combination medication brimonidine/timolol along with timolol maleate. Common side effects when used in the eyes include itchiness, redness, and a dry mouth. Common side effects when used on the skin include redness, burning, and headaches. More significant side effects may include allergic reactions and low blood pressure. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. When applied to the eye it works by decreasing the amount of aqueous humor made while increasing the amount that drains from the eye. When applied to the skin it works by causing blood vessels to contract. Brimonidine was patented in 1972 and came into medical use in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 199th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Brimonidine is indicated for the lowering of intraocular pressure in people with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It is also used to reduce redness of the eye. The gel is indicated for the topical treatment of persistent (nontransient) facial erythema of rosacea in adults 18 years of age or older. A 2017 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine if brimonidine slows optic nerve damage. == Mechanism of action == Brimonidine is an α2 adrenergic agonist. Peripheral α2 agonist activity results in vasoconstriction of blood vessels (as opposed to central α2 agonist activity that decreases sympathetic tone, as can be seen by the medication clonidine). This vasoconstriction may explain the acute reduction in aqueous humor flow. The increased uveoscleral outflow from prolonged use may be explained by increased prostaglandin release due to α adrenergic stimulation. This may lead to relaxed ciliary muscle and increased uveoscleral outflow. == Society and culture == === Names === It is sold under the brand names Alphagan, Alphagan-P, Mirvaso, Lumify, Brymont, and others. == References == == Further reading == Oh DJ, Chen JL, Vajaranant TS, Dikopf MS (January 2019).

3669,"('Nitrophenylphosphate', 'Phosphoric acid, mono(4-nitrophenyl) ester', 'P-nitrophenyl phosphate', 'P-nitrophenyl dihydrogen phosphate', 'P-nitrophenol phosphate')",Medical,"para-Nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) is a non-proteinaceous chromogenic substrate for alkaline and acid phosphatases used in ELISA and conventional spectrophotometric assays. Phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of pNPP liberating inorganic phosphate and the conjugate base of para-nitrophenol (pNP). The resulting phenolate is yellow, with a maximal absorption at 405 nm. This property can be used to determine the activity of various phosphatases including alkaline phosphatase (AP) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). PNPP is classified as a chromogenic substrate because of its ability to transform from a colorless compound to a colored compound through a biological mechanism, dephosphorylation. PNPP is used because of its low cost and the rate of the reactions can be measured over a wide range of substrate concentrations because the concentration of the substrate is not a limiting factor in the reaction. The limitations of PNPP is that it is a small molecule and perhaps does not entirely represent the conditions and structures that are encountered physiologically. A PNPP assay involves mixing the sample with a PNPP-containing mixture and permitting the reaction to run its course for a predetermined period of time. After that point, the process is halted through the addition of a stop solution, often made of a potent alkali like sodium hydroxide. The substance is sensitive to light, and thus should be stored protected from light. This is also important after adding the substrate to the mixture and before reading. −20 °C is the optimal storage temperature. To get precise and credible findings, the assay parameters must be carefully regulated because the reaction is sensitive to factors such as pH, temperature, and the varying degree of inhibitors or stimulants. == References == == External links == pNPP disodium salt hexahydrate (SigmaAldrich.com) Nunc Brand Products",P-nitrophenyl phosphate,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.2519291639328003), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.038305096328258514), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038082610815763474)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0004306692280806601), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

3671,"('Metformin', 'N,n-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide', 'Fluamine', 'Metformine', 'Metiguanide')",Medical,"Metformin, sold under the brand name Glucophage, among others, is the main first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, particularly in people who are overweight. It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, and is sometimes used as an off-label adjunct to lessen the risk of metabolic syndrome in people who take antipsychotic medication. It has been shown to inhibit inflammation, and is not associated with weight gain. Metformin is taken by mouth. Metformin is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. It has a small risk of causing low blood sugar. High blood lactic acid level (acidosis) is a concern if the medication is used in overly large doses or prescribed in people with severe kidney problems. Metformin is a biguanide anti-hyperglycemic agent. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver, increasing the insulin sensitivity of body tissues, and increasing GDF15 secretion, which reduces appetite and caloric intake. Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922 by Emil Werner and James Bell. French physician Jean Sterne began the study in humans in the 1950s. It was introduced as a medication in France in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the second most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 86 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == Metformin is used to lower the blood glucose in those with type 2 diabetes. It is also used as a second-line agent for infertility in those with polycystic ovary syndrome. === Type 2 diabetes === The American Diabetes Association and the American College of Physicians both recommend metformin as a first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes. It is as effective as repaglinide and more effective than all other oral drugs for type 2 diabetes. ==== Efficacy ==== Treatment guidelines for major professional associations, including the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the European Society for Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association, describe evidence for the cardiovascular benefits of metformin as equivocal. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review did not find enough evidence of reduction of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke when comparing metformin monotherapy to other glucose-lowering drugs, behavior change interventions, placebo or no intervention. The use of metformin reduces body weight in people with type 2 diabetes in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are associated with weight gain. Some evidence shows that metformin is associated with weight loss in obesity in the absence of diabetes. Metformin has a lower risk of hypoglycemia than the sulfonylureas, although hypoglycemia has uncommonly occurred during intense exercise, calorie deficit, or when used with other agents to lower blood glucose. Metformin modestly reduces low density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. In individuals with prediabetes, a 2019 systematic review comparing the effects of metformin with other interventions in the reduction of risk of developing type 2 diabetes found moderate-quality evidence that metformin reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to diet and exercise or a placebo. However, when comparing metformin to intensive diet or exercise, moderate-quality evidence was found that metformin did not reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes and very low-quality evidence was found that adding metformin to intensive diet or exercise did not show any advantage or disadvantage in reducing risk of type 2 diabetes when compared to intensive exercise and diet alone. The same review also found one suitable trial comparing the effects of metformin and sulfonylurea in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in prediabetic individuals, however, this trial did not report any patient-relevant outcomes. === Polycystic ovary syndrome === In those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), tentative evidence shows that metformin use increases the rate of live births. This includes in those who have not been able to get pregnant with clomiphene. Metformin does not appear to change the risk of miscarriage. A number of other benefits have also been found both during pregnancy and in nonpregnant women with PCOS. In an updated Cochrane (2020) review on metformin versus placebo/no treatment before or during IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS no conclusive evidence of improved live birth rates was found. In long GnRH-agonist protocols there was uncertainty in the evidence of improved live birth rates but there could be increases in clinical pregnancy rate. In short GnRH-antagonist protocols metformin may reduce live birth rates with uncertainty on its effect on clinical pregnancy rate. Metformin may result in a reduction of OHSS but could come with a greater frequency of side effects. There was uncertainty as to metformin's impact on miscarriage. The evidence does not support general use during pregnancy for improving maternal and infant outcomes in obese women. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from medical treatment. Metformin treatment decreases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in women with PCOS who exhibited impaired glucose tolerance at baseline. === Diabetes and pregnancy === A total review of metformin use during pregnancy compared to insulin alone found good short-term safety for both the mother and baby, but safety in the longer term is unclear. Several observational studies and randomized controlled trials found metformin to be as effective and safe as insulin for the management of gestational diabetes. Nonetheless, several concerns have been raised and evidence on the long-term safety of metformin for both mother and child is lacking. Compared with insulin, women with gestational diabetes treated with metformin gain less weight and are less likely to develop pre‐eclampsia during pregnancy. Babies born to women treated with metformin have less visceral fat, and this may make them less prone to insulin resistance in later life. The use of metformin for gestational diabetes resulted in smaller babies compared to treatment with insulin. However, despite initially lower birth weight, children exposed to metformin during pregnancy had accelerated growth after birth, and were heavier by mid-childhood than those exposed to insulin during pregnancy. This pattern of initial low birth weight followed by catch-up growth that surpasses comparative children has been associated with long-term cardiometabolic disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of metformin, published in 2024, found that it is safe and effective in managing gestational diabetes or diabetes in pregnancy with no adverse impact on the mother or the child after eleven years of childbirth. === Weight change === Metformin use is typically associated with weight loss. It appears to be safe and effective in counteracting the weight gain caused by the antipsychotic medications olanzapine and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable. === Use with insulin === Metformin may reduce the insulin requirement in type 1 diabetes, albeit with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. == Contraindications == Metformin is contraindicated in people with: Severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) Known hypersensitivity to metformin Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis (from uncontrolled diabetes), with or without coma == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effect of metformin is gastrointestinal irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence. Metformin is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects than most other antidiabetic medications. The most serious potential adverse effect of metformin is lactic acidosis; this complication is rare, and seems to be related to impaired liver or kidney function. Metformin is not approved for use in those with severe kidney disease, but may still be used at lower doses in those with kidney problems. === Gastrointestinal === Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort; it is most common when metformin is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7 g/day) and increasing the dose gradually, but even with low doses, 5% of people may be unable to tolerate metformin. Use of slow or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability. Long-term use of metformin has been associated with increased homocysteine levels and malabsorption of vitamin B12. Higher doses and prolonged use are associated with increased incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency, and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies. ==== Vitamin B12 ==== Metformin treatment has been associated with reductions in vitamin B12 in certain people. Left untreated, vitamin B12 deficiencies can lead to serious health problems including neurological problems and anemia. Although more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of this association, it is suggested that people who take metformin monitor their vitamin B12 levels and if low, begin supplementation. In most cases of deficiencies if the person's deficiency can be corrected with exogenous administration of vitamin B12, they can continue their metformin treatment under the supervision of their doctor. === Lactic acidosis === Lactic acidosis rarely occurs with metformin exposure during routine medical care. Rates of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are about nine per 100,000 persons/year, which is similar to the background rate of lactic acidosis in the general population. A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis. Metformin is generally safe in people with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, with a proportional reduction of metformin dose according to severity of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and with periodic assessment of kidney function, (e.g., periodic plasma creatinine measurement). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends avoiding the use of metformin in more severe chronic kidney disease, below the eGFR cutoff of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin use because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, a process that metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given severely impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure, and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); the most common cause is kidney disease. Metformin-associated lactate production may also take place in the large intestine, which could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors. The clinical significance of this is unknown, though, and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production. === Overdose === The most common symptoms following an overdose include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, tachycardia, drowsiness, and rarely, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Treatment of metformin overdose is generally supportive, as no specific antidote is known. Extracorporeal treatments are recommended in severe overdoses. Due to metformin's low molecular weight and lack of plasma protein binding, these techniques have the benefit of removing metformin from the blood plasma, preventing further lactate overproduction. Metformin may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a forensic death investigation. Blood or plasma metformin concentrations are usually in a range of 1–4 mg/L in persons receiving therapeutic doses, 40–120 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage, and 80–200 mg/L in fatalities. Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed. The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is also increased by a massive overdose of metformin, although even quite large doses are often not fatal. === Interactions === The H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine causes an increase in the plasma concentration of metformin by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect. Metformin also interacts with anticholinergic medications, due to their effect on gastric motility. Anticholinergic drugs reduce gastric motility, prolonging the time drugs spend in the gastrointestinal tract. This impairment may lead to more metformin being absorbed than without the presence of an anticholinergic drug, thereby increasing the concentration of metformin in the plasma and increasing the risk for adverse effects. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The molecular mechanism of metformin is not completely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed: inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), complex IV–mediated inhibition of the GPD2 variant of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (thereby reducing the contribution of glycerol to hepatic gluconeogenesis), and an effect on gut microbiota. Metformin exerts an anorexiant effect in most people, decreasing caloric intake. Metformin decreases gluconeogenesis (glucose production) in the liver. Metformin inhibits basal secretion from the pituitary gland of growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and expression of proopiomelanocortin, which in part accounts for its insulin-sensitizing effect with multiple actions on tissues including the liver, skeletal muscle, endothelium, adipose tissue, and the ovaries. The average patient with type 2 diabetes has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third. Activation of AMPK was required for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that plays an important role in insulin signaling, whole-body energy balance, and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK activation is required for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain: metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate) which could activate AMPK allosterically at high levels; a newer theory involves binding to PEN-2. Metformin inhibits cyclic AMP production, blocking the action of glucagon, and thereby reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice, and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion. In addition to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose may be due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes. AMPK probably also plays a role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms, however, AMPK likely has a modest overall effect and its activity is not likely to directly decrease gluconeogenesis in the liver. Metformin has indirect antiandrogenic effects in women with insulin resistance, such as those with PCOS, due to its beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity. It may reduce testosterone levels in such women by as much as 50%. A Cochrane review, though, found that metformin was only slightly effective for decreasing androgen levels in women with PCOS. Metformin also has significant effects on the gut microbiome, such as its effect on increasing agmatine production by gut bacteria, but the relative importance of this mechanism compared to other mechanisms is uncertain. Due to its effect on GLUT4 and AMPK, metformin has been described as an exercise mimetic. === Pharmacokinetics === Metformin has an oral bioavailability of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and is absorbed slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within 1–3 hours of taking immediate-release metformin and 4–8 hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000 L after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached in 1–2 days. Metformin has acid dissociation constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so it exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make it a stronger base than most other basic medications with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of −1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As a result of its low lipid solubility, it requires the transporter SLC22A1 for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (−0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation to produce prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin. Metformin is not metabolized. It is cleared from the body by tubular secretion and excreted unchanged in the urine; it is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. Metformin is distributed to (and appears to accumulate in) red blood cells, with a much longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 hours in a single-dose study of nondiabetics). Some evidence indicates that liver concentrations of metformin in humans may be two to three times higher than plasma concentrations, due to portal vein absorption and first-pass uptake by the liver in oral administration. == Chemistry == Metformin hydrochloride (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol, but almost insoluble in acetone, ether, or chloroform. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The usual synthesis of metformin, originally described in 1922, involves the one-pot reaction of dimethylamine hydrochloride and 2-cyanoguanidine overheat. According to the procedure described in the 1975 Aron patent, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield. === Impurities === In December 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it learned that some metformin medicines manufactured outside the United States might contain a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), classified as a probable human carcinogen, at low levels. Health Canada announced that it was assessing NDMA levels in metformin. In February 2020, the FDA found NDMA levels in some tested metformin samples that did not exceed the acceptable daily intake. In February 2020, Health Canada announced a recall of Apotex immediate-release metformin, followed in March by recalls of Ranbaxy metformin and in March by Jamp metformin. In May 2020, the FDA asked five companies to voluntarily recall their sustained-release metformin products. The five companies were not named, but they were revealed to be Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Actavis Pharma, Apotex Corp, Lupin Pharma, and Marksans Pharma Limited in a letter sent to Valisure, the pharmacy that had first alerted the FDA to this contaminant in metformin via a Citizen Petition. In June 2020, the FDA posted its laboratory results showing NDMA amounts in metformin products it tested. It found NDMA in certain lots of ER metformin and is recommending companies recall lots with levels of NDMA above the acceptable intake limit of 96 nanograms per day. The FDA is also collaborating with international regulators to share testing results for metformin. In July 2020, Lupin Pharmaceuticals pulled all lots (batches) of metformin after discovering unacceptably high levels of NDMA in tested samples. In August 2020, Bayshore Pharmaceuticals recalled two lots of tablets. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. == History == The biguanide class of antidiabetic medications, which also includes the withdrawn agents phenformin and buformin, originates from the plant Goat's rue (Galega officinalis) also known as Galega, French lilac, Italian fitch, Spanish sainfoin, Pestilenzkraut, or Professor-weed. (The plant should not be confused with plants in the genus Tephrosia which are highly toxic and sometimes also called Goat's rue.) Galega officinalis has been used in folk medicine for several centuries. G. officinalis itself does not contain biguanide medications which are chemically synthesized compounds composed of two guanidine molecules and designed to be less toxic than the plant-derived parent compounds guanidine and galegine (isoamylene guanidine). Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, finding it the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was ignored, as other guanidine analogs such as the synthalins, took over and were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin. Interest in metformin resumed at the end of the 1940s. In 1950, metformin, unlike some other similar compounds, was found not to decrease blood pressure and heart rate in animals. That year, Filipino physician Eusebio Y. Garcia used metformin (he named it Fluamine) to treat influenza; he noted the medication ""lowered the blood sugar to minimum physiological limit"" and was not toxic. Garcia believed metformin to have bacteriostatic, antiviral, antimalarial, antipyretic, and analgesic actions. In a series of articles in 1954, Polish pharmacologist Janusz Supniewski was unable to confirm most of these effects, including lowered blood sugar. Instead, he observed antiviral effects in humans. French diabetologist Jean Sterne studied the antihyperglycemic properties of galegine, an alkaloid isolated from G. officinalis, which is related in structure to metformin, and had seen brief use as an antidiabetic before the synthalins were developed. Later, working at Laboratoires Aron in Paris, he was prompted by Garcia's report to reinvestigate the blood sugar-lowering activity of metformin and several biguanide analogs. Sterne was the first to try metformin on humans for the treatment of diabetes; he coined the name ""Glucophage"" (glucose eater) for the medication and published his results in 1957. Metformin became available in the British National Formulary in 1958. It was sold in the UK by a small Aron subsidiary called Rona. Broad interest in metformin was not rekindled until the withdrawal of the other biguanides in the 1970s. Metformin was approved in Canada in 1972, but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes until 1994. Produced under license by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the U.S., beginning on 3 March 1995. Generic formulations are available in several countries. The US FDA granted the application for metformin orphan drug designation. The European Medicines Agency granted orphan drug status to metformin. == Society and culture == === Environmental impact === Metformin and its major transformation product guanylurea are present in wastewater treatment plant effluents and regularly detected in surface waters. Guanylurea concentrations above 200 μg/L have been measured in the German river Erpe, which are amongst the highest reported for pharmaceutical transformation products in aquatic environments. === Formulations === Metformin is the British Approved Name (BAN), the United States Adopted Name (USAN), and the International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It is sold under several brand names. Common brand names include Glucophage, Riomet, Fortamet, and Glumetza in the US. In other areas of the world, there is also Obimet, Gluformin, Dianben, Diabex, Diaformin, Metsol, Siofor, Metfogamma and Glifor. There are several formulations of metformin available on the market, and all but the liquid form have generic equivalents. ==== Combination with other medications ==== When used for type 2 diabetes, metformin is often prescribed in combination with other medications. Several medications are available as fixed-dose combinations, with the potential to reduce pill burden, decrease cost, and simplify administration. ===== Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) ===== ====== Rosiglitazone ====== A combination of metformin and rosiglitazone was released in 2002, and sold as Avandamet by GlaxoSmithKline, or as a generic medication. Formulations are 500/1, 500/2, 500/4, 1000/2, and 1000 mg/4 mg of metformin/rosiglitazone. In 2009, it was the most popular metformin combination. In 2005, the stock of Avandamet was removed from the market, after inspections showed the factory where it was produced was violating good manufacturing practices. The medication pair continued to be prescribed separately, and Avandamet was again available by the end of that year. A generic formulation of metformin/rosiglitazone from Teva received tentative approval from the FDA and reached the market in early 2012. However, following a meta-analysis in 2007, that linked the medication's use to an increased risk of heart attack, concerns were raised over the safety of medicines containing rosiglitazone. In September 2010, the European Medicines Agency recommended that the medication be suspended from the European market because the benefits of rosiglitazone no longer outweighed the risks. It was withdrawn from the market in the UK and India in 2010, and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011. From November 2011 until November 2013 the FDA did not allow rosiglitazone or metformin/rosiglitazone to be sold without a prescription; moreover, makers were required to notify patients of the risks associated with its use, and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies. In November 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of the 2009 RECORD clinical trial (a six-year, open-label randomized control trial), which failed to show elevated risk of heart attack or death associated with the medication. ====== Pioglitazone ====== The combination of metformin and pioglitazone (Actoplus Met, Piomet, Politor, Glubrava) is available in the US and the European Union. ===== DPP-4 inhibitors ===== Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and thus reduce glucagon and blood glucose levels. DPP-4 inhibitors combined with metformin include a sitagliptin/metformin combination (Janumet), a saxagliptin/metformin combination (Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze), and an alogliptin/metformin combination (Kazano, Vipdomet). Linagliptin combined with metformin hydrochloride is sold under the brand name Jentadueto. As of August 2021, linagliptin/metformin is available as a generic medicine in the US. ===== SGLT2 inhibitors ===== There are combinations of metformin with the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin. ===== Sulfonylureas ===== Sulfonylureas act by increasing insulin release from the beta cells in the pancreas. A 2019 systematic review suggested that there is limited evidence if the combined use of metformin with sulfonylurea compared to the combination of metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention, provides benefit or harm in mortality, severe adverse events, macrovascular and microvascular complications. Combined metformin and sulfonylurea therapy did appear to lead to a higher risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin is available combined with the sulfonylureas glipizide (Metaglip) and glibenclamide (US: glyburide) (Glucovance). Generic formulations of metformin/glipizide and metformin/glibenclamide are available (the latter is more popular). ===== Meglitinide ===== Meglitinides are similar to sulfonylureas, as they bind to beta cells in the pancreas, but differ by the site of binding to the intended receptor and the drugs' affinities to the receptor. As a result, they have a shorter duration of action compared to sulfonylureas and require higher blood glucose levels to begin to secrete insulin. Both meglitinides, known as nateglinide and repanglinide, are sold in formulations combined with metformin. A repaglinide/metformin combination is sold as Prandimet, or as its generic equivalent. ===== Triple combination ===== The combination of metformin with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin is available in the United States as Qternmet XR. The combination of metformin with pioglitazone and glibenclamide is available in India as Accuglim-MP, Adglim MP, and Alnamet-GP; and in the Philippines as Tri-Senza. The combination of metformin with pioglitazone and lipoic acid is available in Turkey as Pional. == Research == Metformin is a pleiotropic drug, with extensive off-target activity beyond its antidiabetic effect. Much of this has been attributed to its action on AMPK, although other mechanisms have been proposed. Metformin has been studied for its effects on multiple other conditions, including: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Premature puberty Cancer Cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes Aging === Aging and life extension === No evidence shows that metformin extends the human lifespan. Despite that, metformin has received substantial interest as an agent that delays aging; it has been shown to increase longevity in some animal models (e.g., C. elegans and crickets). This effect may be mediated by insulin and carbohydrate regulation, similar to its effects on diabetes. Whether metformin may help extend life, even in otherwise healthy people, remains unknown; a 2021 review of the literature found it is likely to improve healthspan, i.e., the number of years spent in good health, rather than lifespan overall. A 2017 review found that people with diabetes who were taking metformin had lower all-cause mortality. They also had reduced cancer and cardiovascular disease compared with those on other therapies. In people without diabetes, metformin does not appear to reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. === Cancer === The potential anticancer effects of metformin are believed to be mediated through multiple pathways, particularly involving AMPK activation and IGF-1R modulation. Research has focused particularly on stomach cancer, with evidence of protective impact (reducing the risk of cancer) and improving survival rates among patients in whom cancer has already developed. Despite promising findings, evidence is still preliminary and there is no consensus on its preventive and therapeutic role. === COVID-19 === A study found a benefit using metformin to reduce the occurrence of long COVID. It is unclear if there is a reduced risk of death using metformin to treat people with COVID-19. === Neurological and neurodegenerative disorders === There has been extensive research into the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin in developmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, certain types of epilepsy, and fragile X syndrome, with mixed results. Preliminary studies have examined whether metformin can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and whether there is a correlation between type 2 diabetes and the risk of Alzheimer's disease. While metformin may reduce body weight in persons with fragile X syndrome, whether it improves neurological or psychiatric symptoms is uncertain. === Derivatives === A derivative HL156A, also known as IM156, is a potential new drug for medical use. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Nitrosamine impurities in medications: Guidance"".

3672,"('Nintedanib',)",Medical,"Nintedanib, sold under the brand names Ofev and Vargatef, is an oral medication used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and along with other medications for some types of non-small-cell lung cancer. In March 2020, it was approved for use in the United States to treat chronic fibrosing (scarring) interstitial lung diseases (ILD) with a progressive phenotype (trait). It is the first treatment for this group of fibrosing lung diseases that worsen over time that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Common side effects include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. It is a small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor and platelet derived growth factor receptor. Ofev was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim. It received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2014 – one of only two drugs available for treating IPF – and numerous studies since have demonstrated its effectiveness in slowing the progressive, terminal lung disease. == Medical uses == === Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis === Nintedanib is used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It has been shown to slow down decrease in forced vital capacity, and it also improves people's quality of life. Nintedanib does not improve survival in people with IPF. It interferes with processes like fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and laying down extracellular matrix. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends nintedanib in cases of IPF where the FVC is 50-80% of predicted. NICE recommends discontinuation of therapy if a person's FVC decreases by 10% or more in a 12-month period, indicating disease progression despite treatment. === Lung cancer === It is also used in combination with docetaxel as a second-line treatment for adult patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or locally recurring non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology. It is unclear how this combination compares to other second line agents as the comparisons have not been done as of 2014. == Contraindications == Nintedanib is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to nintedanib, peanut or soya. Nintedanib has not been tested in patients with moderate to severe impairment of liver function. Given that the drug is metabolised in the liver, it may not be safe in such patients. Nintedanib can be used in geriatric population without any dose modifications. It has not been studied in paediatric populations and hence cannot be given in patients below 18 years of age. It is also contraindicated in pregnancy == Adverse effects == Common side effects noted with nintedanib include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal perforation, weight loss, arterial thromboembolism (including myocardial infarction), bleeding, hypothyroidism, elevated liver enzymes, and headache. Gastrointestinal side effects are decreased when nintedanib is co-administered with food. Side effects observed with nintedanib were worse with a higher dose. For this reason, subsequent trials have used an equally clinically effective lower dose. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Nintedanib competitively inhibits both nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). NRTK targets of nintedanib include Lck, Lyn, and Src. RTK targets of nintedanib include platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α and β; fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1, 2, and 3; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3; and FLT3. Its use in IPF is predicated on its inhibition of PDGFR, FGFR, and VEGFR, which increase fibroblast proliferation, migration, and transformation. === Pharmacokinetics === Only a small percentage of orally taken nintedanib is absorbed in the gut, partially due to transport proteins (such as P-glycoprotein) moving the substance back into the lumen. Combined with a high first-pass effect, this results in an oral bioavailability of about 4.7% with a 100 mg tablet. The drug reaches peak plasma levels in 2 to 4 hours after oral intake in the form of a soft gelatin capsule. Nintedanib is mainly inactivated by esterases that cleave the methyl ester, resulting in the free carboxylic acid form, which is then glucuronidated by uridinediphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases and excreted mostly via the bile and faeces. No relevant cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism has been observed. === Interactions === Nintedanib is a substrate of the transporter P-glycoprotein which moves the absorbed substance back into the gut's lumen. The P-glycoprotein inhibitor ketoconazole is known to increase blood plasma levels of nintedanib by a factor of 1.8; other inhibitors such as erythromycin or ciclosporin are expected to have a similar effect. On the other hand, the P-glycoprotein inducer rifampicin cuts nintedanib plasma levels in half; other inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or St. John's Wort probably lower plasma levels as well. == Chemistry == The drug is used in form of its salt with ethanesulfonic acid. This salt, nintedanib esilate, is a yellow, crystalline solid that melts at 244 °C (471 °F) to 251 °C (484 °F). It has poor solubility in water, and somewhat better solubility in dimethyl sulfoxide at 25 g/L. == History == === Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis === Nintedanib was approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis on 15 October 2014, by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency in November 2014, being approved in the European Union in January 2015. It is also approved in Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and other countries. Two replicate randomized clinical trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of nintedanib for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The primary endpoint of the study was the effect on lung function, measured by forced vital capacity. In total, 1066 patients were treated with either 150 mg nintedanib or placebo and evaluated after 52 weeks. At the end of the observation period, nintedanib reduced the decline of forced vital capacity. In the study, diarrhoea was the most common adverse event and was higher in the nintedanib group compared to the placebo group. Nintedanib was granted orphan drug designation in the US by the FDA for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in June 2011 until 15 October 2021. === Lung cancer === Nintedanib was approved for combination therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer in the European Union in 2014, and is approved for this indication in other parts of the world. Nintedanib was granted orphan drug designation in the US by the FDA for the treatment of systemic sclerosis (including the associated interstitial lung disease) in July 2016 until 6 September 2019. === Other interstitial lung diseases === The drug was granted priority review designation by the FDA before being approved in the US on 6 September 2019, to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). It is the first FDA-approved treatment for this rare lung condition. The effectiveness of nintedanib to treat SSc-ILD was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 576 subjects ages 20–79 with the disease. Subjects received treatment for 52 weeks, with some subjects treated up to 100 weeks. The primary test for efficacy measured the forced vital capacity, or FVC, which is a measure of lung function, defined as the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Those who took nintedanib had less lung function decline compared to those on placebo. The overall safety profile observed in the nintedanib treatment group was consistent with the known safety profile of the therapy. The most frequent serious adverse event reported in subjects treated with nintedanib was pneumonia (2.8% nintedanib vs. 0.3% placebo). Adverse reactions leading to permanent dose reductions were reported in 34% of nintedanib-treated subjects compared to 4% of placebo-treated subjects. Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse reaction that led to permanent dose reduction in subjects treated with nintedanib. The safety and effectiveness of nintedanib to treat chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases with a progressive phenotype in adults was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 663 adults. The mean age of subjects was 66 years and more subjects were male (54%) than female. The primary test for effectiveness was the forced vital capacity, which is a measure of lung function. It is defined as the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. In the 52-week period, subjects received either 150 milligrams of nintedanib twice a day or a placebo. After 52 weeks, people who received nintedanib had less lung function decline compared to those on the placebo. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted nintedanib priority review designation and breakthrough therapy designation. The FDA granted the approval of Ofev to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In February 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Nintedanib Accord for the treatment of adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare S.L.U. Nintedanib Accord is a generic of Ofev, which has been authorized in the EU since January 2015. === Brand names === Boehringer is using the brand name Ofev for marketing nintedanib for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and Vargatef for marketing the medication for lung cancer. == Research == Nintedanib is being tested in several phase I to III clinical trials for cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors such as nintedanib may be effective in a range of solid tumour types including lung, ovarian, metastatic bowel, liver and brain cancer. Current phase II trials are investigating the effect of nintedanib in patients with bladder cancer, metastatic bowel cancer, liver cancer and the brain tumour glioblastoma multiforme. A Phase III trial completed in 2015 investigated the use of nintedanib in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel as a first line treatment for patients with ovarian cancer. == References ==",Nintedanib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3589766240329482e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -9.965400386136025e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-group-progressive-interstitial-lung-diseases?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=165, start_index=9, title='FDA Approves First Treatment for Group of Progressive Interstitial Lung Diseases | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-group-progressive-interstitial-lung-diseases?utm_source=openai')])"
3673,"('Meisoindigo', 'Dian iii', 'N-methylisoindigotin', 'Natura-œ±', 'Methylisoindigotin')",Medical," Ischemic stroke is a devastating disease with long-term disability. However, the pathogenesis is unclear and treatments are limited. Meisoindigo, a second-generation derivative of indirubin, has general water solubility and is well-tolerated. Previous studies have shown that meisoindigo reduces inflammation by inhibiting leukocyte chemotaxis and migration. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that meisoindigo was also protective against ischemic stroke, then evaluated its underlying mechanisms.  The aim of this review is to summarize our experience and the current knowledge on the clinical results of Indirubin, a minor active constituent of a well-know traditional Chinese prescription, Ganggui Luhui Wan, and its analogue, Meisoindigo, in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in China. Indirubin and meisoindigo induced hematologic remission in patients with chronic phase (CP) CML as effective as hydroxyurea and busulfan, in addition, there were no significant differences in median duration of CP, median survival and blast crisis at 60 months from diagnosis in indirubin, meisoindigo, hydroxyurea and busulfan treated groups. However, when meisoindigo was combined with hydroxyurea, there was evidence of a significantly prolonged median duration of CP, median survival and a reduced incidence of blast crisis at 60 months compared with busulfan, meisoindigo and hydroxyurea alone. The critical mechanisms of indirubin and meisoindigo action have not yet been identified. Both antiproliferative and induced apoptosis mechanisms have been described. Further research, especially randomized trials, are required to confirm the role of indirubin and meisoindigo in the treatment of CML. Meisoindigo (Mei) has long been recognized in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment.

Here, we investigate the role of small molecule AR-A014418 and Manzamine A against GSK3 kinase with factual control on splicing regulators. AR-A 014418, 48 hrs posttreatment, caused dose (25-100  μ M) dependent inhibition in U373 and U87 cell viability with also inhibition in activating tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK3alpha (Tyr 279) and beta (Tyr 216). Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3 kinase resulted in significant downregulation of splicing factors (SRSF1, SRSF5, PTPB1, and hnRNP) in U87 cells with downregulation of antiapoptotic genes such as BCL2, BCL-xL, Survivin, MCL1, and BMI1. Similarly, downregulation of splicing factors was also observed in U373 glioma cell after using SiRNA against AKT and GSK3beta kinase. In addition, potential roles of AR-A014418 in downregulation of splicing factors were reflected with decrease in Anxa7 (VA) variant and increase in Anxa7 WT tumor suppressor transcript and protein.

It is a histone deacetylase inhibitor with potential anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and antineoplastic activities. It is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that works by targeting pathogenic processes to reduce inflammation and loss of muscle. The most common side effects include diarrhea, abdominal pain, low platelets (thrombocytopenia), nausea/vomiting, an increase in triglycerides (a type of fat in the body) (hypertriglyceridemia), and fever. Givinostat was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2024. Givinostat is the first nonsteroidal medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat people with all genetic variants of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The FDA considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Givinostat is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in people six years of age and older. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials of givinostat as a salvage therapy for advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma, the most common adverse reactions were fatigue (seen in 50% of participants), mild diarrhea or abdominal pain (40% of participants), moderate thrombocytopenia (decreased platelet counts, seen in one third of patients), and mild leukopenia (a decrease in white blood cell levels, seen in 30% of patients). One-fifth of patients experienced prolongation of the QT interval, a measure of electrical conduction in the heart, severe enough to warrant temporary suspension of treatment. == Mechanism of action == Givinostat inhibits class I and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) and several pro-inflammatory cytokines. This reduces expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1α and β, and interleukin 6. It also has activity against cells expressing JAK2(V617F), a mutated form of the janus kinase 2 (JAK2) enzyme that is implicated in the pathophysiology of many myeloproliferative diseases, including polycythaemia vera. In patients with polycythaemia, the reduction of mutant JAK2 concentrations by givinostat is believed to slow down the abnormal growth of erythrocytes and ameliorate the symptoms of the disease. == History == ITF2357 was discovered at Italfarmaco of Milan, Italy. It was patented in 1997 and first described in the scientific literature in 2005. The efficacy of givinostat for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 18-month phase III study. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to month 18 using a four stair climb to measure muscle function. All participants continued to receive a standard of care steroid regimen throughout the study and, after 18 months of treatment, participants treated with givinostat showed statistically significant less decline in the time it took to climb four stairs compared to placebo. The mean change from baseline to month 18 in time to climb four stairs was 1.25 seconds for participants receiving givinostat compared to 3.03 seconds for participants receiving placebo. A secondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to month 18 in physical function as assessed by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA)—a scale commonly used to rate the motor function in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who are capable of walking. Compared to placebo, participants treated with givinostat saw less worsening in their NSAA score after 18 months. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for givinostat priority review, fast track, orphan drug, and rare pediatric disease designations. The FDA granted the approval of Duvyzat to Italfarmaco S.p.A. The FDA approved givinostat based on evidence from a single clinical trial (NCT02851797) of 179 males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy who were six years of age and older who could walk and were on stable background therapy with steroids. The trial was conducted at 45 sites in 11 countries in North America and Europe. Twenty-eight of the participants were from the United States. == Society and culture == === Names === Givinostat is the international nonproprietary name. == Research == Givinostat is in numerous phase II clinical trials (including for relapsed leukemias and myelomas), and has been granted orphan drug designation in the European Union for the treatment of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, polycythaemia vera. and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A preclinical study produced early results suggesting the molecule might help with diastolic dysfunction. == References == == Further reading ==",Givinostat,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.156323378381785e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005598884890787303)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/givinostat.html?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givinostat?utm_source=openai), [britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/givinostat?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=242, start_index=9, title='Givinostat: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/givinostat.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=242, start_index=9, title='Givinostat', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givinostat?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=242, start_index=9, title='Givinostat | Description, Mechanism of Action, Side Effects, & Facts | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/givinostat?utm_source=openai')])"

3677,"('Rosiglitazone', 'Avandia', 'Rosiglizole', 'Brl-49653', 'Rosiglitazone (avandia)')",Medical,"Rosiglitazone (trade name Avandia) is an antidiabetic drug in the thiazolidinedione class. It works as an insulin sensitizer, by binding to the PPAR in fat cells and making the cells more responsive to insulin. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a stand-alone drug or for use in combination with metformin or with glimepiride. First released in 1999, annual sales peaked at approximately $2.5-billion in 2006; however, following a meta-analysis in 2007 that linked the drug's use to an increased risk of heart attack, sales plummeted to just $9.5-million in 2012. The drug's patent expired in 2012. It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 1999. Despite rosiglitazone's effectiveness at decreasing blood sugar in type 2 diabetes mellitus, its use decreased dramatically as studies showed apparent associations with increased risks of heart attacks and death. Adverse effects alleged to be caused by rosiglitazone were the subject of over 13,000 lawsuits against GSK; as of July 2010, GSK had agreed to settlements on more than 11,500 of these suits. Some reviewers recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market, but an FDA panel disagreed, and it remains available in the U.S. From November 2011 until November 2013, the federal government did not allow Avandia to be sold without a prescription from a certified doctor; moreover, patients were required to be informed of the risks associated with its use, and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies. In 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of a 2009 trial which failed to show increased heart attack risk. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended in September 2010 that the drug be suspended because the benefits no longer outweighed the risks. It was withdrawn from the market in the UK, Spain and India in 2010, and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011. == Medical uses == Rosiglitazone was approved for glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes, as measured by glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint, similar to that of other oral antidiabetic drugs. The controversy over adverse effects has dramatically reduced the use of rosiglitazone. Published studies did not provide evidence that outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, costs and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by rosiglitazone. == Adverse effects == === Heart failure === One of the safety concerns identified before approval was fluid retention. Moreover, the combination of rosiglitazone with insulin resulted in a higher rate of congestive heart failure. In Europe there were contraindications for use in heart failure and combination with insulin. A meta analysis of all trials from 2010 and 2019 confirmed a higher risk of heart failure and a double risk when rosiglitazone was administered as add-on therapy to insulin. Two meta-analyses of real life cohort studies found a higher risk of heart failure compared to pioglitazone. There were 649 excess cases of heart failure every 100,000 patients who received rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone. === Heart attacks === The relative risk of ischemic cardiac events seen in pre-approval trials of rosiglitazone was similar to that of comparable drugs, but there was increased LDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides and weight. In 2005, at the insistence of the World Health Organization, GSK performed a meta-analysis of all 37 trials involving use of rosiglitazone, finding a hazard ratio of 1.29 (0.99 to 1.89). In 2006 the GSK updated the analysis, now including 42 trials and showing a hazard ratio of 1.31 (1.01 to 1.70). A large observational study comparing patients treated with rosiglitizone with patients treated with other diabetes therapies was performed at the same time and found a relative risk of 0.93 (95% C.I. 0.8 to 1.1) for those treated with rosiglitazone. The information was passed to the FDA and posted on the company website, but not otherwise published. GSK provided these analyses to the FDA, but neither the company nor the FDA warned prescribers or patients of the hazard. According to the FDA, the Agency did not issue a safety bulletin because the results of the meta analysis conflicted with those of the observational study and with the results of the ADOPT trial. A meta-analysis in May 2007 reported the use of rosiglitazone was associated with a 1.4 fold increased risk of heart attack and a numerically higher (but non-significant) increase in risk of death from all cardiovascular diseases against control. It contained 42 trials of which 27 were unpublished. Another meta analysis of 4 trials with follow-up longer than 1 year found similar results. Nissen's meta analysis was criticized in a 2007 article by George Diamond et al. in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The authors concluded that Nissens' analysis had excluded trials with important data on the cardiovascular profile of rosiglitazone, had inappropriately combined trials of greatly differing design, and had inappropriately excluded trials with no cardiovascular events. The authors concluded that no firm conclusion could be drawn regarding whether rosiglitazone increased or decreased cardiovascular risk. Investigators from the Cochrane Collaboration published a meta-analysis of their own on the use of rosiglitazone in Type II diabetes, concluding there was not sufficient evidence to show any health benefit for rosiglitazone. Noting the recent publication by Nissen, they repeated their meta analysis including only the trials included in the Nissen study that dealt with Type II diabetics. (The Nissen study included some trials in people with other disorders.) They did not find a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events, but noted that all of the cardiovascular endpoints they analyzed showed a non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the rosiglitazone arms. In July 2007 the FDA held a joint meeting of the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. FDA scientist Joy Mele presented a meta analysis examining the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone in completed clinical trials. The study found an overall 1.4 fold increase in risk of cardiovascular ischemic events relative to the control arms. The results were heterogenous, with clear evidence of increased risk relative to placebo but not relative to other diabetes treatments and higher risk associated with combinations of rosiglitazone with insulin or metformin. Based on the 1.4 fold increased risk relative to control groups, FDA scientist David Graham presented an analysis suggesting that rosiglitazone had caused 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007.: 4 The advisory panel voted 20 : 3 that the evidence available indicated that rosiglitazone increased the risk of cardiovascular events and 22 : 1 that the overall risk:benefit ratio of rosiglitazone justified its continued marketing in the United States. The FDA placed restrictions on the drug, including adding a boxed warning about heart attacks, but did not withdraw it. In 2000 a study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). GSK agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed that rosiglitazone was non-inferior to treatment with metformin or a sulfonylurea with respect to the rate of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. European regulators concluded that due in part to design limitations, the results neither proved nor eliminated concerns of excess cardiovascular risk. In February 2010, the FDA's associate director of drug safety, recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market. In June 2010, they published a retrospective study comparing roziglitazone to pioglitazone, the other thiazolidinedione marketed in the United States and concluded rosiglitazone was associated with ""an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality and an increased risk of the composite of AMI, stroke, heart failure, or all-cause mortality in patients 65 years or older"". The number needed to harm with roziglitazone was sixty. Graham argued rosiglitazone caused 500 more heart attacks and 300 more heart failures than its main competitor. Two meta analyses released in 2010, one incorporating 56 trials and a second incorporating 164 trials reached conflicting conclusions. Nissen et al. found again an increased risk for heart infarction against control, but no increased risk for cardiovascular death. Mannucci et al. found no statistically significant increase in cardiac events but a significant increase in heart failure. A 2011 drug class review found an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events. A meta-analysis of 16 observational studies released in March, 2011, compared rosiglitazone to pioglitazone, finding support for greater cardiovascular safety for pioglitazone. The meta-analysis involved 810 000 patients taking rosiglitazone or pioglitazone. The study suggests 170 excess myocardial infarctions, 649 excess cases of heart failure, and 431 excess deaths for every 100 000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone. This was confirmed by another meta-analysis involving 945 286 patients in 8 retrospective cohort studies, most in the US. In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for withholding the results of two studies of the cardiovascular safety of Avandia between 2001 and 2007. === Death === There was no difference in all cause and vascular death in a meta-analysis of 4 trials against controls. Two meta-analyses of cohort studies found excess deaths against pioglitazone. === Stroke === A retrospective observational study performed using Medicare data found that patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 27% higher risk of stroke compared to those treated with pioglitazone. === Bone fractures === GlaxoSmithKline reported a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given rosiglitazone compared with those given metformin or glyburide. The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial The same increase has been found with pioglitazone (Actos), another thiazolidinedione. A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs, involving 13,715 patients and including both rosiglitazone- and pioglitazone-treated patients, showed an overall 45% increased risk of fracture with thiazolidone use compared with placebo or active comparator. It doubled the risk of fractures among women with type 2 diabetes, without a significant increase in risk of fractures among men with type 2 diabetes. === Hypoglycaemia === The risk of hypoglycaemia is reduced with thiazolidinediones when compared with sulfonylureas; the risk is similar to the risk with metformin (high strength of evidence). === Weight gain === Both thiazolidinediones cause a similar degree of weight gain to that caused by sulfonylureas (moderate strength of evidence). === Eye damage === Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been suspected of causing macular edema, which damages the retina of the eye and causes partial blindness. Blindness is also a possible effect of diabetes, which rosiglitazone is intended to treat. One report documented several occurrences and recommended discontinuation at the first sign of vision problems. A retrospective cohort study showed an association between the use of thiazolidinediones and the incidence of diabetic macular edema (DME). Both use was associated with a 2,3 higher risk at 1 year and at 10 year follow-up, rising to 3 if associated with insulin. === Hepatotoxicity === Moderate to severe acute hepatitis has occurred in several adults who had been taking the drug at the recommended dose for two to four weeks. Plasma rosiglitazone concentrations may be increased in people with existing liver problems. === Contraindications === Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are contraindicated in people with NYHA Class III and IV heart failure. They are not recommended for use in heart failure. In Europe rosiglitazone was contraindicated for heart failure or history of heart failure with regard to all NYHA stages, for combined use with insulin and for acute coronary syndrome. The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market. == Pharmacology == Rosiglitazone is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. Thiazolidinediones act as insulin sensitizers. They reduce glucose, fatty acid, and insulin blood concentrations. They work by binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPARs are transcription factors that reside in the nucleus and become activated by ligands such as thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones enter the cell, bind to the nuclear receptors, and alter the expression of genes. The several PPARs include PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. Thiazolidinediones bind to PPARγ. PPARs are expressed in fat cells, cells of the liver, muscle, heart, and inner wall (endothelium) and smooth muscle of blood vessels. PPARγ is expressed mainly in fat tissue, where it regulates genes involved in fat cell (adipocyte) differentiation, fatty acid uptake and storage, and glucose uptake. It is also found in pancreatic beta cells, vascular endothelium, and macrophages Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ and has no PPARα-binding action. Other drugs bind to PPARα. Rosiglitazone also appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect in addition to its effect on insulin resistance. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), a signaling molecule, stimulates the inflammatory pathways. NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) downregulates the inflammatory pathways. When patients take rosiglitazone, NF-κB levels fall and IκB levels increase. == History == Rosiglitazone was approved by the US FDA in 1999 and by the EMA in 2000; the EMA however required two postmarketing studies on longterm adverse effects, one for chronic heart failure and the other for cardiovascular effects. == Society and culture == === Sales === US sales of the drug were of $2.2 billion in 2006. Sales in 2Q 2007 down 22% compared to 2006. 4Q 2007 sales down to $252 million. Though sales have gone down since 2007 due to safety concerns, Avandia sales for 2009 totalled $1.2 billion worldwide. === Lawsuits === According to analysts from UBS, 13,000 suits had been filed by March 2010. Included among those suing: Santa Clara County, California, which claims to have spent $2 million on rosiglitazone between 1999 and 2007 at its public hospital and is asking for ""triple damages"". In May 2010, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) reached settlement agreements for some of the cases against the company, agreeing to pay $60 million to resolve 700 suits. In July 2010, GSK reached settlement agreements to close another 10,000 of the lawsuits against it, agreeing to pay about $460 million to settle these suits. In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for withholding the results of two studies of the cardiovascular safety of Avandia between 2001 and 2007. The settlement stems from claims made by four employees of GlaxoSmithKline, including a former senior marketing development manager for the company and a regional vice president, who tipped off the government about a range of improper practices from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s. ==== United States investigations ==== GlaxoSmithKline was being investigated by the FDA and the US Congress regarding Avandia. Senators Democrat Max Baucus and Republican Charles Grassley filed a report urging GSK to withdraw Avandia in 2008 due to the side effects. The report noted the drug caused 500 avoidable heart attacks a month, and Glaxo officials sought to intimidate doctors who criticized the drug. It also said GSK continued to sell and promote the drug despite knowing the increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. The Senate Finance Committee, in a panel investigation, revealed emails from GSK company officials that suggest the company downplayed scientific findings about safety risks dating back to 2000. It was also alleged by the committee that the company initiated a ""ghostwriting campaign"", whereby GSK sought outside companies to write positive articles about Avandia to submit to medical journals. GSK defended itself by presenting data that its own tests found Avandia to be safe, although an FDA staff report showed the conclusions were flawed. On July 14, 2010, after two days of extensive deliberations, the FDA panel investigating Avandia came to a mixed vote. Twelve members of the panel voted to take the drug off the market, 17 recommended to leave it on but with a more revised warning label, and three voted to keep it on the market with the current warning label. The panel has come to some controversy, however; on July 20, 2010, one of the panelists was discovered to have been a paid speaker for GlaxoSmithKline, arousing questions of a conflict of interest. This panel member was one of the three who voted to keep Avandia on the market with no additional warning labels. In 2011 the FDA has decided on revising its prescribing information and medication guides for all rosilitazone containing medicines. The US label for rosiglitazone (Avandia, GlaxoSmithKline) and all rosiglitazone-containing medications (Avandamet and Avandaryl) now include the additional safety information and restrictions. The revised labels restrict use to patients already taking a rosiglitazone-containing medicine or to new patients who are unable to achieve adequate glycemic control on other diabetes medications and to those, who in consultation with their healthcare provider, have decided not to take Actos (pioglitazone) or other pioglitazone-containing medicines for medical reasons. In June 2013 an FDA Advisory Committee reviewed all available data, including a re-adjudicated RECORD trial, found no evidence of increased cardiovascular risk with Avandia, and voted to remove the restrictions on Avandia marketing in the United States. In November 2013, the US FDA removed these marketing restrictions on the product. Under the FDA's instruction, Avandia's maker, GlaxoSmithKline, had funded the Duke Clinical Research Institute to re-analyze the raw data from the study. At the 2010 panel, three panelists voted that the existing warnings were good enough; two were back in 2013. Seven voted to make those warnings more onerous, and five of them returned. But of the 10 who voted to restrict Avandia's use, only four returned. And of the 12 who voted in 2010 to withdraw Avandia from the market, only three came back. ==== European investigations ==== In 2000 a study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the EMA, and the makers agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed non-inferiority with regard to cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death when the treatment with rosiglitazone was compared with metformin or a sulfonylurea. For myocardial infarction, there was a non-statistically significant increase in risk. In their assessment, the European regulators acknowledged weaknesses of the study, such as an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events and the open-label design, which may lead to reporting bias. They found that the results were inconclusive. The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market. According to a probe by the British Medical Journal in September 2010, the United Kingdom's Commission on Human Medicines recommended to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) back in July 2010, to withdraw Avandia sale because its ""risks outweigh its benefits"". Additionally, the probe revealed that in 2000, members of the European panel in charge of reviewing Avandia prior to its approval had concerns about the long-term risks of the drug. ==== New Zealand ==== Rosiglitazone was withdrawn from the New Zealand market April 2011 because Medsafe concluded the suspected cardiovascular risks of the medicine for patients with type 2 diabetes outweigh its benefits. ==== South Africa ==== A notice issued by the Medicines Control Council of South Africa on July 5, 2011, stated that it had resolved on July 3, 2011, to withdraw all rosiglitazone-containing medicines from the South African market due to safety risks. It disallowed all new prescriptions of Avandia. === Controversy and response === Following the reports in 2007 that Avandia can significantly increase the risk of heart attacks, the drug has been controversial. A 2010 article in Time uses the Avandia case as evidence of a broken FDA regulatory system that ""may prove criminal as well as fatal"". It details the disclosure failures, adding, ""Congressional reports revealed that GSK sat on early evidence of the heart risks of its drug, and that the FDA knew of the dangers months before it informed the public."" It reports, ""the FDA is investigating whether GSK broke the law by failing to fully inform the agency of Avandia's heart risks"", according to deputy FDA commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein. GSK threatened academics who reported adverse research results, and received multiple warning letters from the FDA for deceptive marketing and failure to report clinical data. The maker of the drug, GlaxoSmithKline, has dealt with serious backlash against the company for the drug's controversy. Sales on the drug dropped significantly after the story first broke in 2007, dropping from $2.5 billion in 2006 to less than $408 million in 2009 in the US. In response to the rise in risk of heart attacks, the Indian government ordered GSK to suspend its research study, called TIDE, in 2010. The FDA also halted the TIDE study in the United States. Three doctors' groups, the Endocrine Society, the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, urged patients to continue to take the drug as it would be much worse to stop all treatment, despite any associated risk, but that patients could consult their doctors and begin a switch to a different drug if they or their doctors find concern. The American Heart Association said in a statement in June 2010: "" ...the reports deserves serious consideration, and patients with diabetes who are 65 years of age or older and being treated with rosiglitazone should discuss the findings with their prescribing physician...."". ""For patients with diabetes, the most serious consequences are heart disease and stroke, and the risk of suffering from them is significantly increased when diabetes is present. As in most situations, patients should not change or stop medications without consulting their healthcare provider."" == Research == Rosiglitazone was thought to be able to benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease who do not express the ApoE4 allele, but the phase III trial designed to test this showed that rosiglitazone was ineffective in all patients, including ApoE4-negative patients. Rosiglitazone may also treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, due to its anti-inflammatory properties as a PPAR ligand. Rosiglitazone has been investigated as an agent that may expedite body fat redistribution into a more feminine shape in trans women who have had little fat redistribution from hormone replacement therapy, due to thiozolidinediones' effects on body fat metabolism. == Synthesis == == References == == External links == ""Rosiglitazone"".

3680,"('Zinc pyrithione', 'Pyrithione', 'Omadine', 'Pyridine-2-thiol n-oxide', 'N-hydroxypyridine-2-thione')","Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Pyrithione is the common name of an organosulfur compound with molecular formula C5H5NOS, chosen as an abbreviation of pyridinethione, and found in the Persian shallot. It exists as a pair of tautomers, the major form being the thione 1-hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridinethione and the minor form being the thiol 2-mercaptopyridine N-oxide; it crystallises in the thione form. It is usually prepared from either 2-bromopyridine, 2-chloropyridine, or 2-chloropyridine N-oxide, and is commercially available as both the neutral compound and its sodium salt. It is used to prepare zinc pyrithione, which is used primarily to treat dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis in medicated shampoos, though is also an anti-fouling agent in paints. == Preparation == The preparation of pyrithione was first reported in 1950 by Shaw and was prepared by reaction of 2-chloropyridine N-oxide with sodium hydrosulfide followed by acidification, or more recently with sodium sulfide. 2-chloropyridine N-oxide itself can be prepared from 2-chloropyridine using peracetic acid. Another approach involves treating the same starting N-oxide with thiourea to afford pyridyl-2-isothiouronium chloride N-oxide which undergoes base hydrolysis to pyrithione. 2-Bromopyridine can be oxidised to its N-oxide using a suitable peracid (as per 2-chloropyridine), both approaches being analogous to that reported in Organic Syntheses for the oxidation of pyridine to its N-oxide. A substitution reaction using either sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) or sodium sulfide with sodium hydroxide will allow the replacement of the bromo substituent with a thiol functional group. The alternative strategy is to form the mercaptan before introducing the N-oxide moiety. 2-Mercaptopyridine was originally synthesized in 1931 by heating 2-chloropyridine with calcium hydrosulfide, an approach similar that first used to prepare pyrithione. The analogous thiourea approach via a uronium salt was reported in 1958 and provides a more convenient route to 2-mercaptopyridine. Oxidation to the N-oxide can then be undertaken. Pyrithione is found as a natural product in the Allium stipitatum plant, an Asian species of onion, also known as the Persian shallot. Its presence was detected using positive ion mass spectrometry using a DART ion source and the disulfide dipyrithione (2,2'-disulfanediylbis(pyridine)-1,1'-dioxide) has been reported from the same species. Dipyrithione can be prepared in a laboratory by oxidation of pyrithione with chlorine in the presence of sodium hydroxide: 2 C5H4NOSH + Cl2 + 2 NaOH → ONC5H4–S–S–C5H4NO + 2 NaCl + 2 H2O Dipyrithione is used as a fungicide and bactericide, and has been reported to possess novel cytotoxic activity by inducing apoptosis. However, as apoptosis only occurs in higher organisms, this mechanism isn't relevant to the antifungal and bacteric idal properties of pyrithione. == Properties == Pyrithione exists as a pair of prototropes, a form of tautomerism whereby the rapid interconversion of constitutional isomers involves the shift of a single proton, in this case between the sulfur and oxygen atoms (shown in the infobox above). Salts of the conjugate base of pyrithione can also be considered to exhibit tautomerism by notionally associating the sodium ion with whichever heteroatom bears the negative charge of the anion (as opposed to the formal charges associated with the N-oxide); however, considering the anion alone, this could also be described as an example of resonance. Pyrithione is a weak acid with pKa values of −1.95 and +4.6 (thiol proton), but is a markedly stronger acid than either of its parent compounds (pyridine-N-oxide and pyridine-2-thiol), both of which have pKa > 8. It is only slightly soluble in water (2.5 g L−1) but is soluble in many organic solvents (including benzene, chloroform, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and ethyl acetate) and slight solubility in others (diethyl ether, ethanol, methyl tert-butyl ether, and tetrahydrofuran). Pyrithione can be used as a source of hydroxyl radical in organic synthesis as it photochemically decomposes to HO• and (pyridin-2-yl)sulfanyl radical. == Applications == The conjugate base of pyrithione (pyrithionate ion) is an anion containing two donor atoms, a sulfur atom and an oxygen atom each bearing a negative formal charge; the nitrogen atom remains formally positively charged. The thiolate anion can be formed by reaction with sodium carbonate, and zinc pyrithione is formed when zinc chloride is added. The anion can act as either a monodentate or bidentate ligand and forms a 1:2 complex with a zinc(II) metal centre. Zinc pyrithione has been used since the 1930s though its preparation was not disclosed until a 1955 British patent in which pyrithione was reacted directly with hydrated zinc sulfate in ethanol. In its monomeric form, zinc pyrithione has two of the anions chelated to a zinc centre with a tetrahedral geometry. In the solid state, it forms a dimer in which each zinc centre adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with two of the anions acting as bridging ligands coordinated through the oxygen atoms in the axial positions. In solution, the dimers dissociate via scission of zinc-oxygen bonds to each bridging ligand. Further dissociation of the monomer into its constituents can occur and is undesirable as the complex is more potent in medical applications; for this reason, zinc carbonate can be added to formulations as it inhibits the monomer dissociation. Zinc pyrithione has a long history of use in medicated shampoos to treat dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis (dandruff can be considered a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis). It exhibits both antifungal and antimicrobial properties, inhibiting the Malassezia yeasts which promote these scalp conditions. The mechanisms by which this work are the subject of ongoing study. It can be used as an antibacterial agent against Staphylococcus and Streptococcus infections for conditions such as athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, and ringworm. It is known to be cytotoxic against Pityrosporum ovale, especially in combination with ketoconazole, which is the preferred formulation for seborrheic dermatitis. Pyrithione itself inhibits membrane transport processes in fungi. Paints used in external environments sometimes include zinc pyrithione as a preventive against algae and mildew. == References ==",N-hydroxypyridine-2-thione,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.2000654935836792), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00020377879263833165), (' PERSONAL', -0.6410512328147888), (' CARE', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.00318912067450583), (' INDUSTR', -0.20145681500434875), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.1401980221271515), ('ICAL', -7.867782187531702e-06), (',', -0.0012523435289040208), ('ĠINDU', -0.6810129880905151), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -1.4066597032069694e-05), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.1269713044166565), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0035109801683574915), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0026013364549726248)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.1605100780725479), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.07888989895582199), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrithione,https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/N-HYDROXYPYRIDINE-2-THIONE ', [])"
3681,"('Anastrozole', 'Arimidex', 'Anastrazole', 'Anastrozol', ""Alpha,alpha,alpha',alpha'-tetramethyl-5-(1h-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-m-benzenediacetonitrile"")",Medical,"Anastrozole, sold under the brand name Arimidex among others, is an antiestrogenic medication used in addition to other treatments for breast cancer. Specifically it is used for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It has also been used to prevent breast cancer in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects of anastrozole include hot flashes, altered mood, joint pain, and nausea. Severe side effects include an increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Anastrozole is in the aromatase-inhibiting family of medications. It works by blocking the production of estrogens in the body, and hence has antiestrogenic effects. Anastrozole was patented in 1987 and was approved for medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Anastrozole is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 179th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Breast cancer === Anastrozole is used in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer in women. The Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial was of localized breast cancer and women received either anastrozole, the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, or both for five years, followed by five years of follow-up. After more than 5 years the group that received anastrozole had better results than the tamoxifen group. The trial suggested that anastrozole is the preferred medical therapy for postmenopausal women with localized estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. === Early puberty === Anastrozole is used at a dosage of 0.5 to 1 mg/day in combination with the antiandrogen bicalutamide in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to familial male-limited precocious puberty (testotoxicosis) and McCune–Albright syndrome, in boys. === Available forms === Anastrozole is available in the form of 1 mg oral tablets. No alternative forms or routes are available. == Contraindications == Contraindications of anastrozole include hypersensitivity to anastrozole or any other component of anastrozole formulations, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Hypersensitivity reactions to anastrozole including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria have been observed. == Side effects == Common side effects of anastrozole (≥10% incidence) include hot flashes, asthenia, arthritis, pain, arthralgia, hypertension, depression, nausea and vomiting, rash, osteoporosis, bone fractures, back pain, insomnia, headache, bone pain, peripheral edema, coughing, dyspnea, pharyngitis, and lymphedema. Serious but rare adverse effects (<0.1% incidence) include skin reactions such as lesions, ulcers, or blisters; allergic reactions with swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat that may cause difficulty swallowing or breathing; and abnormal liver function tests as well as hepatitis. == Interactions == Anastrozole is thought to have clinically negligible inhibitory effects on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. As a result, it is thought that drug interactions of anastrozole with cytochrome P450 substrates are unlikely. No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported with anastrozole as of 2003. Anastrozole does not affect circulating levels of tamoxifen or its major metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen. However, tamoxifen has been found to decrease steady-state area-under-the-curve levels of anastrozole by 27%. But estradiol levels were not significantly different in the group that received both anastrozole and tamoxifen compared to the anastrozole alone group, so the decrease in anastrozole levels is not thought to be clinically important. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Anastrozole works by reversibly binding to the aromatase enzyme, and through competitive inhibition blocks the conversion of androgens to estrogens in peripheral (extragonadal) tissues. The medication has been found to achieve 96.7% to 97.3% inhibition of aromatase at a dosage of 1 mg/day and 98.1% inhibition of aromatase at a dosage of 10 mg/day in humans. As such, 1 mg/day is considered to be the minimal dosage required to achieve maximal suppression of aromatase with anastrozole. This decrease in aromatase activity results in an at least 85% decrease in estradiol levels in postmenopausal women. Levels of corticosteroids and other adrenal steroids are unaffected by anastrozole. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of anastrozole in humans is unknown, but it was found to be well-absorbed in animals. Absorption of anastrozole is linear over a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day in humans and does not change with repeated administration. Food does not significantly influence the extent of absorption of anastrozole. Peak levels of anastrozole occur a median 3 hours after administration, but with a wide range of 2 to 12 hours. Steady-state levels of anastrozole are achieved within 7 to 10 days of continuous administration, with 3.5-fold accumulation. However, maximal suppression of estradiol levels occurs within 3 or 4 days of therapy. Active efflux of anastrozole by P-glycoprotein at the blood–brain barrier has been found to limit the central nervous system penetration of anastrozole in rodents, whereas this was not the case with letrozole and vorozole. As such, anastrozole may have peripheral selectivity in humans, although this has yet to be confirmed. In any case, estradiol is synthesized peripherally and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, so anastrozole would still expected to reduce estradiol levels in the central nervous system to a certain degree. The plasma protein binding of anastrozole is 40%. The metabolism of anastrozole is by N-dealkylation, hydroxylation, and glucuronidation. Inhibition of aromatase is due to anastrozole itself rather than to metabolites, with the major circulating metabolite being inactive. The elimination half-life of anastrozole is 40 to 50 hours (1.7 to 2.1 days). This allows for convenient once-daily administration. The medication is eliminated predominantly by metabolism in the liver (83 to 85%) but also by residual excretion by the kidneys unchanged (11%). Anastrozole is excreted primarily in urine but also to a lesser extent in feces. == Chemistry == Anastrozole is a nonsteroidal benzyl triazole. It is also known as α,α,α',α'-tetramethyl-5-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-m-benzenediacetonitrile. Anastrozole is structurally related to letrozole, fadrozole, and vorozole, with all being classified as azoles. == History == Anastrozole was patented by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1987 and was approved for medical use, specifically the treatment of breast cancer, in 1995. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Anastrozole is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Anastrozole is primarily sold under the brand name Arimidex. However, it is also marketed under a variety of other brand names throughout the world. === Availability === Anastrozole is available widely throughout the world. == Research == Anastrozole is surprisingly ineffective at treating gynecomastia, in contrast to selective estrogen receptor modulators like tamoxifen. Anastrozole was under development for the treatment of female infertility but did not complete development and hence was never approved for this indication. An anastrozole and levonorgestrel vaginal ring (developmental code name BAY 98–7196) was under development for use as a hormonal contraceptive and treatment for endometriosis, but development was discontinued in November 2018 and the formulation was never marketed. Anastrozole increases testosterone levels in males and has been studied as an alternative method of androgen replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism. However, there are concerns about its long-term influence on bone mineral density in this patient population, as well as other adverse effects. == References ==",Anastrozol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.07287787614041e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016330339713022113)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastrozole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Anastrozole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastrozole?utm_source=openai')])"
3682,"('Berberine (chloride hydrate)', 'Natural yellow 18 (chloride hydrate)', 'Berberine', 'Umbellatine', 'Berberin')",Medical,"Berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, occurring naturally as a secondary metabolite in some plants including species of Berberis, from which its name is derived. Due to their yellow pigmentation, raw Berberis materials were once commonly used to dye wool, leather, and wood. Under ultraviolet light, berberine shows a strong yellow fluorescence, making it useful in histology for staining heparin in mast cells. As a natural dye, berberine has a color index of 75160. == Biological sources == The following plants are biological sources of berberine: Berberis vulgaris (barberry) Berberis aristata (tree turmeric) Berberis thunbergii Fibraurea tinctoria Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon grape) Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal) Xanthorhiza simplicissima (yellowroot) Phellodendron amurense (Amur cork tree) Coptis chinensis (Chinese goldthread) Tinospora cordifolia Argemone mexicana (prickly poppy) Eschscholzia californica (California poppy) Berberine is usually found in the roots, rhizomes, stems, and bark. == Biosynthesis == The alkaloid berberine has a tetracyclic skeleton derived from a benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline system with the incorporation of an extra carbon atom as a bridge. Formation of the berberine bridge is rationalized as an oxidative process in which the N-methyl group, supplied by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), is oxidized to an iminium ion, and a cyclization to the aromatic ring occurs by virtue of the phenolic group. Reticuline is the immediate precursor of protoberberine alkaloids in plants. Berberine is an alkaloid derived from tyrosine. L-DOPA and 4-hydroxypyruvic acid both come from L-tyrosine. Although two tyrosine molecules are used in the biosynthetic pathway, only the phenethylamine fragment of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring system is formed via DOPA; the remaining carbon atoms come from tyrosine via 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. == Research == Studies on the pharmacological effects of berberine, including medical uses, are preliminary: some studies consider cell cultures or animal models, whereas clinical trials investigating the use of berberine in humans are limited. A 2023 review concluded that berberine may improve lipid concentrations. High-quality, large clinical studies would be required to properly evaluate the effectiveness and safety of berberine in various health conditions. Berberine supplements are widely available in the U.S. but have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any specific medical use. Studies linking berberine to health benefits are limited. The quality of berberine supplements can across brands. A 2017 study found that out of 15 different products sold in the U.S., only six contained at least 90% of the specified berberine quantity. == Adverse effects == Longer-term human clinical trials have reported flatulence and diarrhea as common issues. The problem can be replicated in rats, with disruption of the gut microbiome to blame. == Drug interactions == Berberine is known to inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, an important enzyme involved in drug metabolism and clearance of endogenous substances, including steroid hormones such as cortisol, progesterone and testosterone. Several studies have demonstrated that berberine can increase the concentrations of cyclosporine in renal transplant patients and midazolam in healthy adult volunteers, confirming its inhibitory effect on CYP3A4. == Use in China == It is approved in China as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug for diarrhea treatment. The package insert claims efficacy against E. coli and Shigella spp. The Chinese package insert contraindicates berberine for people with hemolytic anemia and with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency). The insert also specifically precautions its use in children with G6PD deficiency because it can produce hemolytic anemia and jaundice. == References ==",Berberine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.49812203645706177), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.00043102685594931245), (' FOOD', -0.008396959863603115)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, INFO', [('MED', -1.0288195610046387), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.00044610086479224265), ('ĠFOOD', -0.030307313427329063), (',', -0.313730388879776), ('ĠINFO', -0.2116585522890091), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0008864049450494349)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.001170225441455841), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -4.842555426876061e-06)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/berberine-powerful-supplement,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325798,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/berberine-diabetes ', [])"
3683,"('Biotin', 'Vitamin b7', 'Vitamin h', 'Coenzyme r', 'Bioepiderm')","Food, Medical","Biotin (also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H) is one of the B vitamins. It is involved in a wide range of metabolic processes, both in humans and in other organisms, primarily related to the utilization of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids. The name biotin, borrowed from the German Biotin, derives from the Ancient Greek word βίοτος (bíotos; 'life') and the suffix ""-in"" (a suffix used in chemistry usually to indicate 'forming'). Biotin appears as a white, needle-like crystalline solid. == Chemical description == Biotin is classified as a heterocyclic compound, with a sulfur-containing tetrahydrothiophene ring fused to a ureido group. A C5-carboxylic acid side chain is appended to the former ring. The ureido ring, containing the −N−CO−N− group, serves as the carbon dioxide carrier in carboxylation reactions. Biotin is a coenzyme for five carboxylase enzymes, which are involved in the catabolism of amino acids and fatty acids, synthesis of fatty acids, and gluconeogenesis. Biotinylation of histone proteins in nuclear chromatin plays a role in chromatin stability and gene expression. == Dietary recommendations == The US National Academy of Medicine updated Dietary Reference Intakes for many vitamins in 1998. At that time there was insufficient information to establish estimated average requirement or recommended dietary allowance, terms that exist for most vitamins. In instances such as this, the academy sets adequate intakes (AIs) with the understanding that at some later date, when the physiological effects of biotin are better understood, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The biotin AIs for both males and females are: Australia and New Zealand set AIs similar to the US. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also identifies AIs, setting values at 40 μg/day for adults, pregnancy at 40 μg/day, and breastfeeding at 45 μg/day. For children ages 1–17 years, the AIs increase with age from 20 to 35 μg/day. === Safety === The US National Academy of Medicine estimates upper limits for vitamins and minerals when evidence for a true limit is sufficient. For biotin, however, there is no upper limit because the adverse effects of high biotin intake have not been determined. The EFSA also reviewed safety and reached the same conclusion as in the United States. === Labeling regulations === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value. For biotin labeling purposes, 100% of the daily value was 300 μg/day, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 30 μg/day to agree with the adequate intake. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == Biotin is stable at room temperature and is not destroyed by cooking. The dietary biotin intake in Western populations has been estimated to be in the range of 35 to 70 μg/day. Nursing infants ingest about 6 μg/day. Biotin is available in dietary supplements, individually or as an ingredient in multivitamins. According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, biotin deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified. == Physiology == Biotin is a water-soluble B vitamin. Consumption of large amounts as a dietary supplement results in absorption, followed by excretion into urine as biotin. Consumption of biotin as part of a normal diet results in urinary excretion of biotin and biotin metabolites. === Absorption === Biotin in food is bound to proteins. Digestive enzymes reduce the proteins to biotin-bound peptides. The intestinal enzyme biotinidase, found in pancreatic secretions and in the brush border membranes of all three parts of the small intestine, frees biotin, which is then absorbed from the small intestine. When consumed as a biotin dietary supplement, absorption is nonsaturable, meaning that even very high amounts are absorbed effectively. Transport across the jejunum is faster than across the ileum. The large intestine microbiota synthesizes amounts of biotin estimated to be similar to the amount taken in the diet, and a significant portion of this biotin exists in the free (protein-unbound) form and, thus, is available for absorption. How much is absorbed in humans is unknown, although a review did report that human colon epithelial cells in vitro demonstrated an ability to uptake biotin. Once absorbed, sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) mediates biotin uptake into the liver. SMVT also binds pantothenic acid, so high intakes of either of these vitamins can interfere with the transport of the other. === Metabolism and excretion === Biotin catabolism occurs via two pathways. In one, the valeric acid sidechain is cleaved, resulting in bisnorbiotin. In the other path, the sulfur is oxidized, resulting in biotin sulfoxide. Urine content is proportionally about half biotin, plus bisnorbiotin, biotin sulfoxide, and small amounts of other metabolites. === Factors that affect biotin requirements === Chronic alcohol use is associated with a significant reduction in plasma biotin. Intestinal biotin uptake also appears to be sensitive to the effect of the anti-epilepsy drugs carbamazepine and primidone. Relatively low levels of biotin have also been reported in the urine or plasma of patients who have had a partial gastrectomy or have other causes of achlorhydria, as well as burn patients, elderly individuals, and athletes. Pregnancy and lactation may be associated with an increased demand for biotin. In pregnancy, this may be due to a possible acceleration of biotin catabolism, whereas, in lactation, the higher demand has yet to be elucidated. Recent studies have shown marginal biotin deficiency can be present in human gestation, as evidenced by increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, decreased urinary excretion of biotin and bisnorbiotin, and decreased plasma concentration of biotin. == Biosynthesis == Biotin, synthesized in plants, is essential to plant growth and development. Bacteria also synthesize biotin, and it is thought that bacteria resident in the large intestine may synthesize biotin that is absorbed and utilized by the host organism. Biosynthesis starts from two precursors, alanine and pimeloyl-CoA. These form 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). KAPA is transported from plant peroxisomes to mitochondria where it is converted to 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) with the help of the enzyme, BioA. The enzyme dethiobiotin synthetase catalyzes the formation of the ureido ring via a DAPA carbamate activated with ATP, creating dethiobiotin with the help of the enzyme, BioD, which is then converted into biotin which is catalyzed by BioB. The last step is catalyzed by biotin synthase, a radical SAM enzyme. The sulfur is donated by an unusual [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. Depending on the species of bacteria, Biotin can be synthesized via multiple pathways. == Cofactor biochemistry == The enzyme holocarboxylase synthetase covalently attaches biotin to five human carboxylase enzymes: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC1) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACC2) Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) For the first two, biotin serves as a cofactor responsible for the transfer of bicarbonate to acetyl-CoA, converting it to malonyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. PC participates in gluconeogenesis. MCC catalyzes a step in leucine metabolism. PCC catalyzes a step in the metabolism of propionyl-CoA. Metabolic degradation of the biotinylated carboxylases leads to the formation of biocytin. This compound is further degraded by biotinidase to release biotin, which is then reutilized by holocarboxylase synthetase. Biotinylation of histone proteins in nuclear chromatin is a posttranslational modification that plays a role in chromatin stability and gene expression. == Deficiency == Primary biotin deficiency, meaning deficiency due to too little biotin in the diet, is rare because biotin is contained in many foods. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning, brittle fingernails, or skin rash, typically on the face. Aside from inadequate dietary intake (rare), biotin deficiency can be caused by a genetic disorder that affects biotin metabolism. The most common among these is biotinidase deficiency. Low activity of this enzyme causes a failure to recycle biotin from biocytin. Rarer are carboxylase and biotin transporter deficiencies. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency started in the United States in 1984, with many countries now also testing for this genetic disorder at birth. Treatment is a lifelong dietary supplement with biotin. If biotinidase deficiency goes untreated, it can be fatal. === Diagnosis === Low serum and urine biotin are not sensitive indicators of inadequate biotin intake. However, serum testing can be useful for confirmation of consumption of biotin-containing dietary supplements, and whether a period of refraining from supplement use is long enough to eliminate the potential for interfering with drug tests. Indirect measures depend on the biotin requirement for carboxylases. 3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA is an intermediate step in the catabolism of the amino acid leucine. Without biotin, the pathway diverts to 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. Urinary excretion of this compound is an early and sensitive indicator of biotin deficiency. === Deficiency as a result of metabolic disorders === Biotinidase deficiency is a deficiency of the enzyme that recycles biotin, due to an inherited genetic mutation. Biotinidase catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides (the proteolytic degradation products of each holocarboxylase) and thereby recycles biotin. It is also important in freeing biotin from dietary protein-bound biotin. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency started in the United States in 1984, which as of 2017 was reported as required in more than 30 countries. Profound biotinidase deficiency, defined as less than 10% of normal serum enzyme activity, which has been reported as 7.1 nmol/min/mL, has an incidence of 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 60,000, but with rates as high as 1 in 10,000 in countries with high incidence of consanguineous marriages (second cousin or closer). Partial biotinidase deficiency is defined as 10% to 30% of normal serum activity. Incidence data stems from government-mandated newborn screening. For profound deficiency, treatment is oral dosing with 5 to 20 mg per day. Seizures are reported as resolving in hours to days, with other symptoms resolving within weeks. Treatment of partial biotinidase deficiency is also recommended even though some untreated people never manifest symptoms. Lifelong treatment with supplemental biotin is recommended for both profound and partial biotinidase deficiency. Inherited metabolic disorders characterized by deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiency. These include deficiencies in the enzymes holocarboxylase synthetase. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. There can also be a genetic defect affecting the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter protein. Biochemical and clinical manifestations of any of these metabolic disorders can include ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, rash, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia and coma. == Use in biotechnology == Chemically modified versions of biotin are widely used throughout the biotechnology industry to isolate proteins and non-protein compounds for biochemical assays. Because egg-derived avidin binds strongly to biotin with a dissociation constant Kd ≈ 10−15 M, biotinylated compounds of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. First, the chemically modified biotin reagents are bound to the targeted compounds in a solution via a process called biotinylation. The choice of which chemical modification to use is responsible for the biotin reagent binding to a specific protein. Second, the sample is incubated with avidin bound to beads, then rinsed, removing all unbound proteins, while leaving only the biotinylated protein bound to avidin. Last, the biotinylated protein can be eluted from the beads with excess free biotin. The process can also utilize bacteria-derived streptavidin bound to beads, but because it has a higher dissociation constant than avidin, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads, which often will denature the protein of interest. == Interference with medical laboratory results == When people are ingesting high levels of biotin in dietary supplements, a consequence can be clinically significant interference with diagnostic blood tests that use biotin-streptavidin technology. This methodology is commonly used to measure levels of hormones such as thyroid hormones, and other analytes such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Biotin interference can produce both falsely normal and falsely abnormal results. In the US, biotin as a non-prescription dietary supplement is sold in amounts of 1 to 10 mg per serving, with claims for supporting hair and nail health, and as 300 mg per day as a possibly effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (see § Research). Overconsumption of 5 mg/day or higher causes elevated concentration in plasma that interferes with biotin-streptavidin immunoassays in an unpredictable manner. Healthcare professionals are advised to instruct patients to stop taking biotin supplements for 48 h or even up to weeks before the test, depending on the specific test, dose, and frequency of biotin uptake. Guidance for laboratory staff is proposed to detect and manage biotin interference. == History == In 1916, W. G. Bateman observed that a diet high in raw egg whites caused toxic symptoms in dogs, cats, rabbits, and humans. By 1927, scientists such as Margarete Boas and Helen Parsons had performed experiments demonstrating the symptoms associated with ""egg-white injury."" They had found that rats fed large amounts of egg whites as their only protein source exhibited neurological dysfunction, hair loss, dermatitis, and eventually, death. In 1936, Fritz Kögl and Benno Tönnis documented isolating a yeast growth factor in a journal article titled ""Darstellung von krystallisiertem biotin aus eigelb."" (Representation of crystallized biotin from egg yolk). The name biotin derives from the Greek word bios ('to live') and the suffix ""-in"" (a general chemical suffix used in organic chemistry). Other research groups, working independently, had isolated the same compound under different names. Hungarian scientist Paul Gyorgy began investigating the factor responsible for egg-white injury in 1933 and in 1939, was successful in identifying what he called ""Vitamin H"" (the H represents Haar und Haut, German for 'hair and skin'). Further chemical characterization of vitamin H revealed that it was water-soluble and present in high amounts in the liver. After experiments performed with yeast and Rhizobium trifolii, West and Wilson isolated a compound they called co-enzyme R. By 1940, it was recognized that all three compounds were identical and were collectively given the name: biotin. Gyorgy continued his work on biotin and in 1941 published a paper demonstrating that egg-white injury was caused by the binding of biotin by avidin. Unlike for many vitamins, there is insufficient information to establish a recommended dietary allowance, so dietary guidelines identify an ""adequate intake"" based on best available science with the understanding that at some later date this will be replaced by more exact information. Using E. coli, a biosynthesis pathway was proposed by Rolfe and Eisenberg in 1968. The initial step was described as a condensation of pimelyl-CoA and alanine to form 7-oxo-8-aminopelargonic acid. From there, they described a three-step process, the last being introducing a sulfur atom to form the tetrahydrothiophene ring. == Research == === Multiple sclerosis === High-dose biotin (300 mg/day = 10,000 times adequate intake) has been used in clinical trials for treatment of multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating autoimmune disease. The hypothesis is that biotin may promote remyelination of the myelin sheath of nerve cells, slowing or even reversing neurodegeneration. The proposed mechanisms are that biotin activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a key rate-limiting enzyme during the synthesis of myelin, and by reducing axonal hypoxia through enhanced energy production. Clinical trial results are mixed; a 2019 review concluded that a further investigation of the association between multiple sclerosis symptoms and biotin should be undertaken, whereas two 2020 reviews of a larger number of clinical trials reported no consistent evidence for benefits, and some evidence for increased disease activity and higher risk of relapse. === Hair, nails, skin === In the United States, biotin is promoted as a dietary supplement for strengthening hair and fingernails, though scientific data supporting these outcomes in humans are very weak. A review of the fingernails literature reported brittle nail improvement as evidence from two pre-1990 clinical trials that had administered an oral dietary supplement of 2.5 mg/day for several months, without a placebo control comparison group. There is no more recent clinical trial literature. A review of biotin as a treatment for hair loss identified case studies of infants and young children with genetic defect biotin deficiency having improved hair growth after supplementation, but went on to report that ""there have been no randomized, controlled trials to prove the efficacy of supplementation with biotin in normal, healthy individuals."" Biotin is also incorporated into topical hair and skin products with similar claims. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 states that the US Food and Drug Administration must allow on the product label what are described as ""Structure:Function"" (S:F) health claims that ingredient(s) are essential for health. For example: Biotin helps maintain healthy skin, hair, and nails. If a S:F claim is made, the label must include the disclaimer ""This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."" == Animals == In cattle, biotin is necessary for hoof health. Lameness due to hoof problems is common, with herd prevalence estimated at 10 to 35%. Consequences of lameness include less food consumption, lower milk production, and increased veterinary treatment costs. Results after 4–6 months from supplementing biotin at 20 mg/day into daily diet reduces the risk of lameness. A review of controlled trials reported that supplementation at 20 mg/day increased milk yield by 4.8%. The discussion speculated that this could be an indirect consequence of improved hoof health or a direct effect on milk production. For horses, conditions such as chronic laminitis, cracked hooves, or dry, brittle feet incapable of holding shoes are a common problem. Biotin is a popular nutritional supplement. There are recommendations that horses need 15 to 25 mg/day. Studies report biotin improves the growth of new hoof horn rather than improving the status of existing hoof, so months of supplementation are needed for the hoof wall to be completely replaced. == See also == Biotin deficiency Biotin sulfoxide Biotinidase deficiency Biotinylation Multiple carboxylase deficiency NeutrAvidin Photobiotin == References == == External links == Media related to Biotin at Wikimedia Commons",Bioepiderm,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.6838966012001038), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.008624029345810413), (' PERSONAL', -0.33219581842422485), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.4743555188179016), (' MED', -0.7131807208061218), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.20180515944957733), (' END', -0.11989672482013702), ('OG', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('ENO', -0.00012403888104017824), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6152770519256592), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20302650332450867)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Despite that, clinical studies using avosentan have been halted due to adverse effects including fluid overload. Therefore, we aimed at investigating whether avosentan may have protective effects against hypertensive nephropathy at doses below those inducing fluid-retention. We used double transgenic rats (dTGR), overexpressing both the human renin and angiotensinogen gene, which develop malignant hypertension. Effects of avosentan alone or in combination with low-dose of valsartan (angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist) on end-organ damage were studied. Avosentan induced a decrease of diuresis (18.3%) with a consequent decrease in hematocrit (8.3%) only at the highest dose investigated (100mg/kg). Treatment with the combination of avosentan and valsartan (10 and 0.1mg/kg, once daily by gavage, respectively) decreased albuminuria to a greater extent than each compound given alone (avosentan: 19.6mg/24h; valsartan: 12.9mg/24h; avosentan+valsartan: 1.7mg/24h, data are median values). Histological severity score also showed a drastic reduction of kidney damage. Furthermore, avosentan alone or in combination therapy dramatically decreased mortality compared to the 100% in untreated animals. These data support a therapeutic effect of avosentan at doses below those inducing fluid overload. In the short term, the endothelin antagonist avosentan reduces proteinuria, but whether this translates to protection from progressive loss of renal function is unknown. We examined the effects of avosentan on progression of overt diabetic nephropathy in a multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We randomly assigned 1392 participants with type 2 diabetes to oral avosentan (25 or 50 mg) or placebo in addition to continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and/or angiotensin receptor blockade. The composite primary outcome was the time to doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, or death. Secondary outcomes included changes in albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and cardiovascular outcomes. We terminated the trial prematurely after a median follow-up of 4 months (maximum 16 months) because of an excess of cardiovascular events with avosentan. We did not detect a difference in the frequency of the primary outcome between groups. Avosentan significantly reduced ACR: In patients who were treated with avosentan 25 mg/d, 50 mg/d, and placebo, the median reduction in ACR was 44.3, 49.3, and 9.7%, respectively. Adverse events led to discontinuation of trial medication significantly more often for avosentan than for placebo (19.6 and 18.2 versus 11.5% for placebo), dominated by fluid overload and congestive heart failure; death occurred in 21 (4.6%; P = 0.225), 17 (3.6%; P = 0.194), and 12 (2.6%), respectively. In conclusion, avosentan reduces albuminuria when added to standard treatment in people with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy but induces significant fluid overload and congestive heart failure. Avosentan is a potent, selective endothelin A receptor blocker. The pharmacokinetics of avosentan were investigated in healthy male and female volunteers, following oral and i.v. administration of single doses of avosentan and its absolute bioavailability was determined. In a randomized, balanced open-label, three-period oral crossover study, 26 healthy subjects (19 males and 7 females) received Treatments A, B and C. Treatment A consisted of a single dose of a 25 mg film-coated tablet of avosentan, Treatment B of a single dose of a 50 mg film-coated tablet of avosentan and Treatment C of 10 mg avosentan in 20 ml solution for infusion for 20 minutes (10 mg avosentan in 20 ml phosphate buffer pH 9.0 containing 1% polysorbate 20). Plasma concentrations of avosentan and its hydroxymethyl metabolite Ro 68-5925 were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The absolute bioavailability values (compared with i.v. infusion) for the 25 and 50 mg film-coated tablets were 81% and 72%, respectively. The extent of absorption, as measured by partial and total AUC, increased almost proportionally with the dose. The estimated proportionality coefficient for AUC0- yen was 1.12 (90% CI 1.06, 1.18). For the rate of absorption (Cmax) strict dose-proportionality was not demonstrated (proportionality coefficient 1.13 (90% CI 1.0, 1.28)). No relevant gender differences in the pharmacokinetic characteristics were evident after a single i.v. dose and at an oral dose of 25 mg, whereas after oral administration of 50 mg of avosentan differences were seen in Cmax and t1/2. The absolute bioavailability of avosentan film-coated tablets is high, i.e. 70 - 80%.",Avosentan,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.142680823802948), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0010115751065313816), ('ICAL', -2.145764938177308e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014176025055348873)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is used as a 'conditioning' treatment to clear the bone marrow and make room for the transplanted bone marrow cells, which can then produce healthy blood cells. It is used together with another medicine called fludarabine in adults and children from one month of age with blood cancers as well as in adults with other severe disorders requiring a bone marrow transplant. It belongs to the family of drugs called alkylating agents. In the body, treosulfan is converted into other compounds called epoxides which kill cells, especially cells that develop rapidly such as bone marrow cells, by attaching to their DNA while they are dividing. The most common side effects include infections, nausea (feeling sick), stomatitis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth), vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain (belly ache). Tiredness, febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell counts with fever) and high blood levels of bilirubin (a breakdown product of red blood cells) are also seen in more than 1 in 10 adults, and rash also affects more than 1 in 10 children. The most common adverse reactions include musculoskeletal pain, stomatitis, pyrexia, nausea, edema, infection, and vomiting. Selected grade 3 or 4 nonhematological laboratory abnormalities include increased GGT, increased bilirubin, increased ALT, increased AST, and increased creatinine.

Here we report results from dose escalation and 2 expansion cohorts: Module 1A dose escalation with paired biopsy cohort in advanced solid tumor patients, Module 1B-1 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) monotherapy expansion, and Module 2A fulvestrant combination in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients post-CDK4/6-inhibitor. Core study primary endpoints are safety and tolerability, and secondary endpoints are pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, and anti-tumor activity. Common adverse events are low grade nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Maximum tolerated dose is 360 mg once daily. PK demonstrates dose proportionality (120 mg-480 mg), a half-life of approximately 75 hours, and no fulvestrant interaction. In dose escalation, one partial response (PR) is identified with disease control rate of 53% (19/36) and reduction of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, a substrate of CDK7, in circulating lymphocytes and tumor tissue. In TNBC expansion, one PR (duration 337 days) and clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks (CBR) of 20.0% (4/20) is achieved. In combination with fulvestrant, 3 patients achieve PR with CBR 36.0% (9/25); in patients without detectable TP53-mutation CBR is 47.4% (9/19). In this study, samuraciclib exhibits tolerable safety and PK is supportive of once-daily oral administration. Clinical activity in TNBC and HR+/HER2-breast cancer post-CDK4/6-inhibitor settings warrants further evaluation. Current strategies to inhibit androgen receptor (AR) are circumvented in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) promotes AR signalling, in addition to established roles in cell cycle and global transcription, providing a rationale for its therapeutic targeting in CRPC. The antitumour activity of CT7001, an orally bioavailable CDK7 inhibitor, was investigated across CRPC models in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Cell-based assays and transcriptomic analyses of treated xenografts were employed to investigate the mechanisms driving CT7001 activity, alone and in combination with the antiandrogen enzalutamide. CT7001 selectively engages with CDK7 in prostate cancer cells, causing inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle arrest. Activation of p53, induction of apoptosis, and suppression of transcription mediated by full-length and constitutively active AR splice variants contribute to antitumour efficacy in vitro. Oral administration of CT7001 represses growth of CRPC xenografts and significantly augments growth inhibition achieved by enzalutamide. Transcriptome analyses of treated xenografts indicate cell cycle and AR inhibition as the mode of action of CT7001 in vivo. This study supports CDK7 inhibition as a strategy to target deregulated cell proliferation and demonstrates CT7001 is a promising CRPC therapeutic, alone or in combination with AR-targeting compounds.",Samuraciclib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.615255839889869e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00032062159152701497), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019397982396185398)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([cancerresearchhorizons.com](https://www.cancerresearchhorizons.com/news-and-events/our-news/carrick-therapeutics-announces-first-patient-dosed-phase-2b-clinical-trial?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=197, start_index=9, title='Carrick Therapeutics announces first patient dosed in Phase 2b clinical trial of samuraciclib in combination with fulvestrant in patients with advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer | Cancer Research Horizons', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cancerresearchhorizons.com/news-and-events/our-news/carrick-therapeutics-announces-first-patient-dosed-phase-2b-clinical-trial?utm_source=openai')])"

This diazo compound is biosynthesized from lysine by three enzymes in bacteria. It is one of the most famous non-proteinogenic amino acid and was characterized in 1956 by Henry W Dion et al., who suggested a possible use in cancer therapy. This antitumoral efficacy was confirmed in different animal models. DON was tested as chemotherapeutic agent in different clinical studies, but was never approved. In 2019, DON was shown to kill tumor cells while reversing disease symptoms and improve overall survival in late-stage experimental glioblastoma in mice, when combined with calorie-restricted ketogenic diet. == Chemistry == DON is a water-soluble yellowish powder, which can be dissolved also in aqueous solutions of methanol, acetone or ethanol, but dissolution in absolute alcohols is difficult. Solutions of at least 50 μM DON in 0.9% NaCl are lightly yellowish. The crystalline form appears as yellowish greenish needles. The specific rotation is [α]26D +21° (c = 5.4% in H2O). In phosphate buffer, pH 7 are the ultraviolet absorption maxima at 274 nm (E1%1 cm. 683) and 244 nm (E1%1 cm 376). == Biochemistry == DON is used as inhibitor of different glutamine utilizing enzymes. Due to its similarity to glutamine, it can enter catalytic centres of these enzymes and inhibits them by covalent binding, or more precisely, by alkylation. The following table gives a survey of DON targets. == Pharmacology == DON is a cytotoxic inhibitor of many enzymes of nucleotide synthesis. It could be shown in vitro that DON treatment led to apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Different pathways were investigated; it could be shown that the inner mitochondrial membrane was damaged, and that single strand DNA breaks occurred. The exact mode of action remains unclear and needs further research. DON has not been approved as a pharmaceutical agent; however, it has been tested in combination with a recombinant glutaminase in clinical trials for the treatment of different solid tumors. == See also == JHU-083, a prodrug of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine == References ==",Diazooxonorleucine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.30122193694114685)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.35207149386405945), ('ICAL', -8.4638240878121e-06), (',', -0.16033002734184265), ('ĠINDU', -0.17580918967723846), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.030025895684957504)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0002613358374219388)])","('INFO; ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Diazooxonorleucine?utm_source=openai), [invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/diazooxonorleucine.html?utm_source=openai), [meshb-prev.nlm.nih.gov](https://meshb-prev.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D003980&utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=299, start_index=6, title='Diazooxonorleucine | C6H9N3O3 | CID 9087 - PubChem', type='url_citation', url='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Diazooxonorleucine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=299, start_index=6, title='Diazooxonorleucine | amino acid | CAS# 157-03-9 | InvivoChem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/diazooxonorleucine.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=299, start_index=6, title='MeSH Browser', type='url_citation', url='https://meshb-prev.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D003980&utm_source=openai')])"

3692,"('Arundic acid', '(r)-2-propyloctanoic acid', '(2r)-2-propyloctanoic acid', 'Cereact', 'Proglia')",Medical," Arundic acid has been experimented in vitro and in vivo as a potential neuroprotective agent. It modulates astrocyte activation by inhibiting the enhanced astrocytic synthesis of S-100β protein, responsible for inducing neuronal death. The phase II clinical trials for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, as well as clinical development in other neurodegenerative diseases including amytrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are recently completed. There is no review published in this area since its discovery as potential neuroprotective agent and the various syntheses reported for this important non-natural compound. This review summarizes the studies towards the development of arundic acid as a neuroprotective agent, the biological studies in vitro and in vivo, the phase II trials and the various efforts made for its synthesis in the last two decades. After focal cerebral ischemia, the infarct volume increases rapidly within acute infarct expansion (initial 12 to 24 h) and continues slowly during delayed infarct expansion (25 to 168 h). While acute infarct expansion represents progressive necrosis within the ischemic core, delayed infarct expansion starts as disseminated apoptotic cell death in a narrow rim surrounding the infarct border, which gradually coalesces to form a larger infarct. Discovery of a distinct correlation between reactive astrogliosis along the infarct border and delayed infarct expansion in the rodent ischemia model led us to investigate the possible causal relationship between the two events. Specifically, the calcium binding protein S100B exerts detrimental effects on cell survival through activation of various intracellular signaling pathways, resulting in altered protein expression. Arundic acid [(R)-(-)-2-propyloctanoic acid, ONO-2506] is a novel agent that inhibits S100B synthesis in cultured astrocytes. In the rodent ischemia model, this agent was shown to inhibit both the astrocytic overexpression of S100B and the subsequent activation of signaling pathways in the peri-infarct area. Concurrently, delayed infarct expansion was prevented, and neurologic deficits were promptly ameliorated. The results of subsequent studies suggest that the efficacy of arundic acid is mediated by restoring the activity of astroglial glutamate transporters via enhanced genetic expression. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells, have several metabolic functions, including ionic, neurotransmitter and energetic homeostasis for neuronal activity. Reactive astrocytes and their dysfunction have been associated with several brain disorders, including the epileptogenic process. Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) are astrocyte biomarkers associated with brain injury. We hypothesize that arundic acid (ONO-2506), which is known as an inhibitor of S100B synthesis and secretion, protects the hippocampal tissue from neuroinflammation and astrocyte dysfunction after status epileptics (SE) induction by Li-pilocarpine in young rats. Herein, we investigated the effects of arundic acid treatment, at time points of 6 or 24 h after the induction of SE by Li-pilocarpine, in young rats. In SE animals, arundic acid was able to prevent the damage induced by Li-pilocarpine in the hippocampus, decreasing neuroinflammatory signaling (reducing IL-1β, COX2, TLR4 and RAGE contents), astrogliosis (decreasing GFAP and S100B) and astrocytic dysfunction (recovering levels of GSH, glutamine synthetase and connexin-43). Furthermore, arundic acid improved glucose metabolism and reduced the glutamate excitotoxicity found in epilepsy. Our data reinforce the role of astrocytes in epileptogenesis development and the neuroprotective role of arundic acid, which modulates astrocyte function and neuroinflammation in SE animals.",Arundic acid,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -2.15310683415737e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.38691163063049316), (' INDUSTR', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0017296605510637164), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5759611129760742)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.12692810595035553), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23514413/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16709678/,https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X%2806%2900375-3/abstract ', [])"

This cation is a naturally-occurring intermediate in many biosynthetic pathways owing to the sulfonium functional group. It is biosynthesized from L-methionine and S-adenosylmethionine by the enzyme methionine S-methyltransferase. S-methylmethionine is particularly abundant in plants, being more abundant than methionine. S-Methylmethionine is sometimes referred to as vitamin U, but it is not considered a true vitamin. The term was coined in 1950 by Garnett Cheney for uncharacterized anti-ulcerogenic factors in raw cabbage juice that may help speed healing of peptic ulcers. == Biosynthesis and biochemical function == S-Methylmethionine arises via the methylation of methionine by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The coproduct is S-adenosyl homocysteine. The biological roles of S-methylmethionine are not well understood. Speculated roles include methionine storage, use as a methyl donor, regulation of SAM.

3695,"('Asymmetric dimethylarginine', 'N,n-dimethylarginine', 'Dimethyl-l-arginine', 'Ng,ng-dimethyl-l-arginine', 'N(g)-dimethylarginine')","Endogenous, Medical","Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a naturally occurring chemical found in blood plasma. It is a metabolic by-product of continual protein modification processes in the cytoplasm of all human cells. It is closely related to L-arginine, a conditionally essential amino acid. ADMA interferes with L-arginine in the production of nitric oxide (NO), a key chemical involved in normal endothelial function and, by extension, cardiovascular health. == Discovery == Patrick Vallance and his London co-workers first noted the interference role for asymmetric dimethylarginine in the early 1990s. Today biochemical and clinical research continues into the role of ADMA in cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, erectile dysfunction and certain forms of kidney disease. == Synthesis and regulation in the body == Asymmetric dimethylarginine is created in protein methylation, a common mechanism of post-translational protein modification. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme set called protein arginine N-methyltransferases 1 and 2 (also known as S-adenosylmethionine protein N-methyltransferases I and II). The methyl groups transferred to create ADMA are derived from the methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine, an intermediate in the metabolism of homocysteine. (Homocysteine is an important blood chemical because it is also a marker of cardiovascular disease). After synthesis, ADMA migrates into the extracellular space and thence into blood plasma. Asymmetric dimethylarginine is measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. ADMA concentrations are substantially elevated by native or oxidized LDL cholesterol. Thus a spiralling effect occurs with high endothelial LDL levels causing greater ADMA values, which in turn inhibit NO production needed to promote vasodilation. The elimination of ADMA occurs through urine excretion and metabolism by the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). The role of homocysteine as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease is suggested to be mediated by homocysteine down-regulating production of DDAH in the body. Polyphenol antioxidants also play a role in down-regulating homocysteine. == ADMA and suggested lines of therapeutic research == With raised levels of ADMA seemingly to be associated with adverse human health consequences for cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases, and also a wide range of diseases of the elderly, the possible lowering of ADMA levels may have important therapeutic effects. However, it has yet to be established whether ADMA levels can be manipulated and, more important, if this results in useful clinical benefits. The association of ADMA with abnormalities of lipid regulation suggested that supplements of free fatty acids might manipulate ADMA levels. However, research has failed to show that these have an effect. ADMA's role has been linked with elevated levels of homocysteine. Whilst approaches at modifying the latter with oral supplements of folic acid were strongly suggested, studies have shown this fails to give any clinical benefit and suggested that B vitamins might instead increase some cardiovascular risks. Direct alteration of ADMA levels with supplements of L-arginine have been suggested. The hope is that such intervention might not only improve endothelial function but also reduce clinical symptoms of overt cardiovascular disease. However studies show inconsistency in results in a clinical context, and the recent results with manipulating homocysteine levels warrant extreme care with what clinical outcomes might arise from this approach. Statins, as well as affecting circulating cholesterol levels, also increase nitric oxide levels and so have a direct effect on blood supply to the heart. Elevated levels of ADMA seems to modify this effect and so may have consequences for patients' responsiveness to taking statins. Repeated administration of d-amphetamine may decrease ADMA in mice. == See also == Arginine Hypertension Protein detoxification Vasoconstriction == References == == External links == ADMA article, Medical News Today, March 27, 2006 Summary of ADMA research literature www.adma.com",Asymmetric dimethylarginine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -6.749814019713085e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.002817591419443488), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.31335654854774475), ('ĠMED', -0.010087933391332626), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001177690108306706)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_dimethylarginine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=109, start_index=12, title='Asymmetric dimethylarginine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_dimethylarginine?utm_source=openai')])"

Twelve months of treatment with netazepide (YF476), an antagonist of the cholecystokinin B receptor (CCKBR or CCK2R), eradicated some type 1 gNETs in patients. We investigated the mechanisms by which netazepide induced gNET regression using gene expression profiling. We obtained serum samples and gastric corpus biopsy specimens from 8 patients with hypergastrinemia and type 1 gNETs enrolled in a phase 2 trial of netazepide. Control samples were obtained from 10 patients without gastric cancer. We used amplified and biotinylated sense-strand DNA targets from total RNA and Affymetrix (Thermofisher Scientific, UK) Human Gene 2.0 ST microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes in stomach tissues from patients with type 1 gNETs before, during, and after netazepide treatment. Findings were validated in a human AGS Levels of pappalysin 2 (PAPPA2) messenger RNA were reduced significantly in gNET tissues from patients receiving netazepide therapy compared with tissues collected before therapy. PAPPA2 is a metalloproteinase that increases the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) by cleaving IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs). PAPPA2 expression was increased in the gastric corpus of patients with type 1 gNETs, and immunohistochemistry showed localization in the same vicinity as CCK2R-expressing enterochromaffin-like cells. Up-regulation of PAPPA2 also was found in the stomachs of INS-GAS mice. Gastrin increased PAPPA2 expression with time and in a dose-dependent manner in gastric AGS In an analysis of human gNETS and mice, we found that gastrin up-regulates the expression of gastric PAPPA2. Increased PAPPA2 alters IGF bioavailability, cell migration, and tissue remodeling, which are involved in type 1 gNET development. These effects are inhibited by netazepide. Among the vinca-alkaloid class, vincristine is a potent chemotherapeutic agent with significant neurotoxic effects and is employed to address a wide spectrum of cancer types. Recently, the therapeutic potential of the cholecystokinin type 2 receptor (CCK2R) as a target for vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) was demonstrated. In this study, the impact of preventive CCK2R blockade using netazepide (Trio Medicines Ltd., London, UK) was investigated in a mouse model of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy. Netazepide is a highly selective CCK2R antagonist under development for the treatment of patients with gastric neuroendocrine tumors caused by hypergastrinemia secondary to chronic autoimmune atrophic gastritis. Vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy was induced by intraperitoneal injections of vincristine at 100 µg/kg/d for 7 days (D0 to D7). Netazepide (2 mg/kg/d or 5 mg/kg/d, per os) was administered one day before vincristine treatment until D7. Vincristine induced a high tactile allodynia from D1 to D7. VIPN was characterized by dorsal root ganglion neuron (DRG) and intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) loss, and enlargement and loss of myelinated axons in the sciatic nerve. Netazepide completely prevented the painful symptoms and nerve injuries induced by vincristine. In conclusion, the fact that netazepide protected against vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy in a mouse model strongly supports the assessment of its therapeutic potential in patients receiving such chemotherapy. Hypergastrinemia has been associated with high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in patients with Barrett's esophagus, and experimental studies suggest proinflammatory and proneoplastic effects of gastrin on Barrett's esophagus.

We have assessed the interaction of Palomid 529 with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux transporters ABCB1 (P-gp/P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (BCRP/Breast Cancer Resistant Protein) by in vitro transwell assays, and their effects on the brain penetration using drug disposition analysis of i.v. and oral Palomid 529 in wild-type (WT) and Abcb1 and/or Abcg2 knockout (KO) mice. Palomid 529 lacked affinity for these transporters in vitro, in contrast to GDC-0941, a small molecule PI3K inhibitor, which we used as control substance for in vitro transport. The plasma AUCi.v. of micronized and DMSO formulated Palomid 529 was similar in WT and KO mice. Importantly, the brain and brain tumor concentration of Palomid 529 at a high dose (54 mg/kg) was also similar in both strains, whereas a less than 1.4-fold difference (p < 0.05) was found at the low (5.4 mg/kg) dose. Because of poor solubility, the oral bioavailability of micronized Palomid 529 was only 5%. Olive oil or spray-dried formulation greatly improved the bioavailability up to 50%. Finally, Palomid 529 effectively inhibits the orthotopic U87 glioblastoma growth. In summary, Palomid 529 is the first mTOR targeting drug lacking affinity for ABCB1/ABCG2 and having good brain penetration. This warrants further evaluation of Palomid 529 for treatment of high-grade gliomas and other intracranial malignancies. It has become clear that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is central for promoting both tumor and tumor stroma and is therefore a major target for anticancer drug development. First- and second-generation rapalogs (prototypical mTOR inhibitors) have shown promise but, due to the complex nature of mTOR signaling, can result in counterproductive feedback signaling to potentiate upstream Akt signaling. We present a novel PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitor, Palomid 529 (P529), which inhibits the TORC1 and TORC2 complexes and shows both inhibition of Akt signaling and mTOR signaling similarly in tumor and vasculature. We show that P529 inhibits tumor growth, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability. It retains the beneficial aspects of tumor vascular normalization that rapamycin boasts. However, P529 has the additional benefit of blocking pAktS473 signaling consistent with blocking TORC2 in all cells and thus bypassing feedback loops that lead to increased Akt signaling in some tumor cells. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a valuable treatment target of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Palomid 529 is a novel mTORC1/2 dual inhibitor. RCC cells were treated with different concentrations of Palomid 529. Cell survival was tested by MTT assay and clonogenicity assay. Cell proliferation was tested by BrdU ELISA assay. Cell apoptosis was tested by the Hoechst-33342 nuclei staining assay and Histone DNA ELISA assay. mTOR signaling was tested by Western blotting assay and co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. The SCID mouse 786-O xenograft model was established to test RCC cell growth in vivo. Palomid 529 exerted cytotoxic, anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities in 786-O RCC cells. Palomid 529 disassembled mTORC1/2, causing de-phosphorylation of mTORC1/2 substrates. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is a primary resistant factor of Palomid 529. Palomid 529-induced 786-O cell apoptosis was sensitized by BRD4 inhibitors or BRD4 silencing, but inhibited with BRD4 over-expression. Palomid 529-induced cytotoxicity in the primary human RCC cells was negatively correlated with BRD4 expression level. In vivo, Palomid 529 i.p. administration inhibited 786-O xenograft tumor growth in SCID mice. Its anti-tumor activity was further sensitized by co-administration of the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1. Cconclusion: Palomid 529 inhibits RCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

3699,"('Zafirlukast', 'Accolate', 'Olmoran', 'Cyclopentyl (3-(2-methoxy-4-((o-tolylsulfonyl)carbamoyl)benzyl)-1-methyl-1h-indol-5-yl)carbamate', 'Accoleit')",Medical,"Zafirlukast is an orally administered leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) used for the chronic treatment of asthma. While zafirlukast is generally well tolerated, headaches and stomach upset often occur. Some rare side effects can occur, which can be life-threatening, such as liver failure. eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis has been associated with zafirlukast, but the relationship is not thought to be causative. Overdoses of zafirlukast tend to be self-limiting. Zafirlukast, like other LTRAs, works by inhibiting the immune system. Through its action on inflammatory cells in the lungs, zafirlukast reduces the production of inflammatory mediators that are implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. Zafirlukast is extensively hepatically metabolized by an enzyme called CYP2C9. Zafirlukast inhibits the action of CYP3A4, leading to drug-drug interactions with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4. Genetic differences in LTC4 synthase and CYP2C9 may predict how a person reacts to zafirlukast treatment. Zafirlukast (brand name Accolate) was the first cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist approved in the United States. It is now approved in many other countries under other brand names. == Medical uses == Zafirlukast is FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of asthma in adults and children older than 5 years old. Like other leukotriene receptor antagonists, zafirlukast is thought to be useful for the long-term treatment of asthma, but it is generally less effective than inhaled glucocorticoids as monotherapy (which are the standard of care) or long-acting beta-2 agonists in combination therapy. Notably, zafirlukast is ineffective in the event of an acute asthma attack. === Available forms === There are two dosage forms for zafirlukast, notable for their age-adjustments. The 20 mg tablet is for adults and children older than age 12, whereas the 10 mg tablet is for children between the ages of 5 and 12. Tablets should be stored at room temperature, out of direct sunlight, and away from sources of moisture. Tablets are for oral administration only. === Specific populations === ==== Pediatrics ==== As a general rule, leukotriene receptor antagonists like zafirlukast are more effective in children that are younger and whose asthma is less atopic. Atopy refers to a predisposition towards developing allergic conditions, including asthma, hay fever, and eczema. ==== Geriatrics ==== The hepatic clearance of zafirlukast is impaired in adults 65 years of age and older, resulting in a 2–3 fold increase in the maximum plasma concentration and the total area under the curve. Zafirlukast may increase the risk for infections (7.0% vs 2.9%, zafirlukast vs. placebo incidence respectively), especially lower respiratory tract infections, in older adults, though the infections noted were not severe. ==== Pregnancy ==== Zafirlukast is considered to be ""pregnancy category B."" This is due, in part, to the wide safety margin of zafirlukast in animal studies investigating teratogenicity. No teratogenicity has been observed in doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day in cynomolgus monkeys, representing an equivalent 20x exposure of the maximum recommended daily oral dose in human adults. However, spontaneous abortions occurred in cynomolgus monkeys at 2000 mg/kg/day, though the dose itself was maternally toxic. ==== Lactation ==== There is limited research on the use of zafirlukast in women whom are breastfeeding. Based on data from the manufacturer, it is expected that 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose would reach a breastfed infant, though the effects in the infant are unknown. ==== Renal impairment ==== Renal impairment does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetic profile of zafirlukast. ==== Hepatic impairment ==== The hepatic clearance of zafirlukast is impaired by significant hepatic impairment. Cirrhosis of the liver can increase the maximum plasma concentration and the total area under the curve (a measure of drug exposure) by 50–60%. == Contraindications == Zafirlukast is contraindicated in people who are hypersensitive or allergic to it. == Adverse effects == Zafirlukast is generally well tolerated, though headache and gastrointestinal (GI) upset can occur. The incidence of headaches is between 12 and 20%, which is similar to the incidence of headaches found in patients taking placebos in the studies that led to zafirlukast's approval. GI upset may include nausea, stomach discomfort/pain, and diarrhea. GI complaints can be lessened by taking zafirlukast with food, though this can dramatically impair the amount of drug that gets absorbed into the body (see the section on drug-food interactions below). Other common side effects include flu-like symptoms, sleep disturbances (abnormal dreams, insomnia), hallucinations, and daytime drowsiness. === Neuropsychiatric effects === Neuropsychiatric side effects have been reported with the use of zafirlukast and other LTRAs. While some side effects are less severe (e.g. abnormal dreams), others are more serious (e.g. hallucinations, tremors, suicidality). These effects were discovered through post-marketing reports, as the initial trials were not designed to monitor for neuropsychiatric side effects. === Hepatotoxicity === Zafirlukast can also cause rare but serious side effects like acute liver injury. Zafirlukast-induced hepatotoxicity generally occurs within the first 2–6 months of initiating therapy, though cases have been reported up to 13 months after starting zafirlukast. Zafirlukast-induced hepatotoxicity is characterized by a spectrum of liver damage symptoms, including fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant pain followed by dark urine, jaundice and pruritus. Liver enzyme elevations are common, and the pattern usually reflects hepatocellular damage, resembling acute viral hepatitis. It is unclear how the hepatotoxicity occurs, but it may be due to a metabolic intermediate of zafirlukast since it is metabolized in the liver through the enzyme CYP2C9. When it does occur it can be fatal, and reexposure with zafirlukast may result in a worse injury. Switching zafirlukast to another medication in the same class (e.g. montelukast) or in the related class of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors can be attempted, but caution should be employed. According to the ""Dear Health Care Provider"" letter from AstraZeneca, zafirlukast-induced hepatotoxicity has occurred predominantly in females. === Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis === Several cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis have been reported with the use of zafirlukast, montelukast, pranlukast, and other asthma medications. When eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis occurs, it tends to occur in people with long-standing asthma and sinus inflammation, chronic oral corticosteroid use, and the recent initiation of a new anti-asthma therapy (like zafirlukast) in conjunction with tapering the corticosteroids. While the exact etiology of the development of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis symptoms in proximity to initiating zafirlukast is unknown, it is thought that withdrawal of chronic corticosteroids ""unmasks"" the previously undetected disease. Because corticosteroid withdrawal often happens while starting a new anti-asthma medication (like zafirlukast), this explains the rare but notable association. These cases may represent misdiagnosed asthma, as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis can induce symptoms of airway obstruction that are akin to an acute asthma exacerbation. The highest overdose reported with zafirlukast is 200 mg. All overdose patients have survived. Symptoms reported included rash and upset stomach. == Interactions == === Drug–drug interactions === Zafirlukast is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 4 (CYP3A4). Zafirlukast may increase the concentration of drugs that are metabolized through CYP3A4, such as the anticoagulant medication warfarin and the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine. === Drug-food interactions === The oral absorption (bioavailability) of zafirlukast is decreased by 40% when it is taken with high fat or high protein meals. To avoid this interaction, zafirlukast should be taken on an empty stomach. An empty stomach is classified as an hour before, or two hours after, consuming a meal. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Zafirlukast is an antagonist of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1), a receptor found throughout the smooth muscle of the lungs, within interstitial lung macrophages (white blood cells that operate in the interstitial space of the lungs), and rarely in epithelial cells. CystLT1 is a receptor for a specific class of leukotrienes that contain the amino acid cysteine. These cysteinyl leukotrienes include leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4, all of which are produced by inflammatory cells like eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages in the lungs. Through their action on CysLT1 these leukotrienes can trigger bronchoconstriction, a state in which the bronchial passages of the lungs constrict, leading to the characteristic, reactive airway symptoms associated with bronchial asthma. The other pro-inflammatory effects of leukotrienes, such as their inhibition of mucus clearance and their stimulation of mucus secretion and edema, are thought to play a role in the characteristic symptoms of allergic rhinitis (also called hay fever). By inhibiting the action of these specific leukotrienes, zafirlukast is thought to exert an anti-inflammatory effect against leukotriene-mediated inflammatory conditions. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Zafirlukast is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream following oral administration, reaching peak plasma levels within 3 hours of taking the dose. The peak plasma level is the maximum concentration of zafirlukast in the blood. ==== Distribution ==== Zafirlukast is moderately distributed into the body's tissues, with an apparent steady state volume of distribution of 70 liters. Zafirlukast is highly plasma protein bound, 99% bound to albumin. Albumin is the most abundant protein found in human plasma and is capable of carrying and transporting drugs (like zafirlukast) throughout the body. In vivo research indicates that zafirlukast has low blood–brain barrier penetration. The blood–brain barrier is a protective system that prevents many chemicals from entering the brain. ==== Metabolism ==== Zafirlukast undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism into inactive metabolites. Zafirlukast is primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP2C9 to a hydroxylated metabolite. ==== Elimination ==== Zafirlukast is primarily cleared through biliary excretion at a rate of 20 liters/hour. Zafirlukast is undetectable in urine. The mean terminal half-life ranges 8–16 hours, following linear kinetics up to doses of 80 mg. === Pharmacogenomics === ==== LTC4 synthase ==== Genetic polymorphisms in the LTC4 synthase promoter may predict response to zafirlukast. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A444C (the wild-type DNA base adenine, at the 444th position on the gene, is mutated; cytosine is there instead), which is associated with a severe asthma phenotype, has been shown to decrease the clinical response to zafirlukast (both when the genetic alteration was heterozygous or homozygous). ==== CYP2C9 ==== Zafirlukast is metabolized through the hepatic enzyme CYP2C9. SNPs that decrease the function of CYP2C9 (such as CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*13) may decrease the hepatic clearance of zafirlukast, leading to increased exposure of zafirlukast. Notably, the CYP2C9*3 polymorphism is more commonly encountered in people of south/central Asian ancestry (10.165%) compared to people of Caucasian (7.083%), African American (1.170%), African (1.033%), middle eastern (9.312%), and east Asian (3.365%) ancestry. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === Zafirlukast can be synthesized by the following method: === Physiochemical properties === Pure zafirlukast is described as a fine, white to pale yellow, amorphous powder. It is practically insoluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol, and freely soluble in tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, and acetone. == History == Zafirlukast was the first cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist approved in the United States. Zafirlukast was approved in 1996. == Society and culture == === Economics === While preliminary evidence suggests that zafirlukast may reduce healthcare costs, the cost-effectiveness of using zafirlukast has not been established. === Brand names === == Research == === Mechanism of action === There is some research to suggest that zafirlukast actually acts as a partial inverse agonist at the CysLT1 receptor, though zafirlukast is still classified as an antagonist at this receptor. The possible clinical significance of this effect, if true, is unknown. === Other indications === There is some evidence that suggests that zafirlukast may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic urticaria (hives), whether due to a known cause such as cold-exposure or due to an unknown cause (idiopathic). A pilot study indicated that zafirlukast may be of some benefit in cystic fibrosis. In the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), a disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the lungs, zafirlukast has been shown to improve lung function. == Veterinary use == Zafirlukast is sometimes used for the treatment of bronchial asthma in cats. == References == == External links == ""Zafirlukast"".

3700,"('Pergolide (mesylate)', 'Pergolide methanesulfonate', 'Pergolide', 'Permax', 'Pergolidum')",Medical,"Pergolide, sold under the brand name Permax and Prascend (veterinary) among others, is an ergoline-based dopamine receptor agonist used in some countries for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is associated with reduced dopamine synthesis in the substantia nigra of the brain. Pergolide acts on many of the same receptors as dopamine to increase receptor activity. It was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1989. In 2007, pergolide was withdrawn from the U.S. market for human use after several published studies revealed a link between the drug and increased rates of valvular heart disease. However, a veterinary form of pergolide, marketed under the trade name Prascend, is permitted for the treatment of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) also known as equine Cushing's syndrome (ECS) in horses. == Medical uses == Pergolide is no longer available for use by humans in the United States, however, it is still used in various other countries, where it is used to treat various conditions including Parkinson's disease, hyperprolactinemia, and restless leg syndrome. Pergolide is available for veterinary use. Under the trade name Prascend, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim, it is commonly used for the treatment of pituitary hyperplasia at the pars intermedia or Equine Cushing's Syndrome (ECS) in horses. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Pergolide acts as an agonist of dopamine D2 and D1 and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It may possess agonist activity at other dopamine receptor subtypes as well, similar to cabergoline. Although pergolide is more potent as an agonist of the D2 receptor, it has high D1 receptor affinity and is one of the most potent D1 receptor agonists of the dopamine receptor agonists that are clinically available. The agonist activity of pergolide at the D1 receptor somewhat alters its clinical and side effect profile in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Pergolide has been said to be hallucinogenic due to activation of 5-HT2A receptors. However, other sources have stated that the drug is non-hallucinogenic. It has been associated with cardiac valvulopathy due to activation of 5-HT2B receptors. == Side effects == The drug is in decreasing use, as it was reported in 2003 to be associated with a form of heart disease called cardiac fibrosis. In 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration announced a voluntary withdrawal of the drug by manufacturers due to the possibility of heart valve damage. Pergolide is not currently available in the United States for human use. This problem is thought to be due to pergolide's action at the 5-HT2B serotonin receptors of cardiac myocytes, causing proliferative valve disease by the same mechanism as ergotamine, methysergide, fenfluramine, and other serotonin 5-HT2B agonists, including serotonin itself when elevated in the blood in carcinoid syndrome. Pergolide can rarely cause Raynaud's phenomenon. Among similar antiparkinsonian drugs, cabergoline, but not lisuride, exhibit this same type of serotonin receptor binding. In January 2007, cabergoline (Dostinex) was also reported to be associated with valvular proliferation heart damage. In March 2007, pergolide was withdrawn from the U.S. market for human use due to serious valvular damage that was shown in two independent studies. Pergolide has also been shown to impair associative learning. === Addictive behaviors === At least one British pergolide user has attracted some media attention with claims that it has caused him to develop a gambling addiction. In June 2010, it was reported that more than 100 Australian users of the drug are suing the manufacturer over both gambling and sex addiction problems they claim are the result of the drug's side effects. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names of pergolide include Permax and Prascend (veterinary), among others. == Research == Pergolide has been studied in the treatment of social anxiety disorder in one small study but was found to be ineffective. == References ==",Permax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010247035970678553), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00012337400403339416), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06199977174401283)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/pergolide-marketed-permax-information?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=158, start_index=6, title='Pergolide (marketed as Permax) Information | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/pergolide-marketed-permax-information?utm_source=openai')])"

It is one of the two forms of enkephalin, the other being leu-enkephalin. The enkephalins are considered to be the primary endogenous ligands of the δ-opioid receptor, due to their high potency and selectivity for the site over the other endogenous opioids. == History == Met-enkephalin was discovered and characterized by John Hughes, Hans Kosterlitz, et al. in 1975 after a search for endogenous ligands of the opioid receptors. == Chemistry == Met-enkephalin is a pentapeptide with the amino acid sequence tyr-gly-gly-phe-met. The tyrosine residue at position 1 is thought to be analogous to the 3-hydroxyl group on morphine. == Biochemistry == === Distribution === Met-enkephalin is found mainly in the adrenal medulla and throughout the central nervous system (CNS), including in the striatum, cerebral cortex, olfactory tubercle, hippocampus, septum, thalamus, and periaqueductal gray, as well as the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. It is also present in the periphery, notably in some primary afferent fibers that innervate the pelvic viscera. === Biosynthesis === Met-enkephalin is synthesized from proenkephalin via proteolytic cleavage in two metabolic steps. Proenkephalin A is first reduced by either one of two trypsin-like endopeptidase enzymes, prohormone convertase 1 (PC1) or prohormone convertase 2 (PC2); then, the resulting intermediates are further reduced by the enzyme carboxypeptidase E (CPE; previously known as enkephalin convertase (EC)). Proenkephalin A contains four sequences of met-enkephalin (at the following positions: 100–104; 107–111; 136–140; 210–214), and as a result, its cleavage generates four copies of met-enkephalin peptides at once. In addition, anabolism of proenkephalin A results in the production of one copy each of two C-terminal-extended met-enkephalin derivatives, the heptapeptide met-enkephalin-arg-phe (261–267), and the octapeptide met-enkephalin-arg-gly-leu (186–193), though whether they affect the opioid receptors in a similar manner as met-enkephalin is not entirely clear. === Clearance === Met- and leu-enkephalin are metabolized by a variety of different enzymes, including aminopeptidase N (APN), neutral endopeptidase (NEP), dipeptidyl peptidase 3 (DPP3), carboxypeptidase A6 (CPA6), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). These enzymes are sometimes referred to as enkephalinases. === Biological activity === Met-enkephalin is a potent agonist of the δ-opioid receptor, and to a lesser extent the μ-opioid receptor, with little to no effect on the κ-opioid receptor. It is through these receptors that met-enkephalin produces its opioid effects, such as analgesia and antidepressant-like effects. It is also the endogenous ligand of the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFR; formerly known as the ζ-opioid receptor), which plays a role in the regulation of tissue growth and regeneration; hence why met-enkephalin is sometimes called OGF instead. === Pharmacokinetics === Met-enkephalin has low bioavailability, is rapidly metabolized, and has a very short half-life (minutes). These properties are considered undesirable in pharmaceuticals as large doses would need to be administered multiple times an hour to maintain a therapeutically relevant effect, making it unlikely that met-enkephalin will ever be used as a medicine. [D-Ala2]-Met-enkephalinamide (DALA), is a synthetic enkephalin analog which is not susceptible to degradation by brain enzymes and at low doses (5 to 10 micrograms) caused profound, long-lasting, morphine-like analgesia when microinjected into a rat’s brain. == See also == Leu-enkephalin == References ==",Met-enkephalin,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.03215693682432175), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.3112935448589269e-05), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6932336091995239)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met-enkephalin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=12, title='Met-enkephalin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met-enkephalin?utm_source=openai')])"

3704,"('Acesulfame (potassium)', 'Acetosulfam', 'Acesulfamum', 'Acesulfamo', 'Acesulfame potassium')","Food, Medical","Acesulfame potassium (UK: , US: AY-see-SUL-faym or ), also known as acesulfame K or Ace K, is a synthetic calorie-free sugar substitute (artificial sweetener) often marketed under the trade names Sunett and Sweet One. In the European Union, it is known under the E number (additive code) E950. It was discovered accidentally in 1967 by German chemist Karl Clauss at Hoechst AG (now Nutrinova). Acesulfame potassium is the potassium salt of 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide. It is a white crystalline powder with molecular formula C4H4KNO4S and a molecular weight of 201.24 g/mol. == Properties == Acesulfame K is 200 times sweeter than sucrose (common sugar), as sweet as aspartame, about two-thirds as sweet as saccharin, and one-third as sweet as sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Acesulfame K is often blended with other sweeteners (usually sucralose or aspartame). These blends are reputed to give a more sucrose-like taste whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste, or exhibits a synergistic effect by which the blend is sweeter than its components. Acesulfame potassium has a smaller particle size than sucrose, allowing for its mixtures with other sweeteners to be more uniform. Unlike aspartame, acesulfame K is stable under heat, even under moderately acidic or basic conditions, allowing it to be used as a food additive in baking, or in products that require a long shelf life. Although acesulfame potassium has a stable shelf life, it can eventually degrade to acetoacetamide, which is toxic in high doses. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as aspartame or sucralose. It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable. The acceptable daily intake of acesulfame potassium is listed as 15 mg/kg/day. Acesulfame potassium is widely used in the human diet and excreted by the kidneys. It thus has been used by researchers as a marker to estimate to what degree swimming pools are contaminated by urine. Other names for acesulfame K are potassium acesulfamate, potassium salt of 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxothiazin-4(3H)-one-2,3-dioxide, and potassium 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one-3-ate-2,2-dioxide. == Effect on body weight == Acesulfame potassium provides a sweet taste with no caloric value. There is no high-quality evidence that using acesulfame potassium as a sweetener affects body weight or body mass index (BMI). == Discovery == Acesulfame potassium was developed after the accidental discovery of a similar compound (5,6-dimethyl-1,2,3-oxathiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide) in 1967 by Karl Clauss and Harald Jensen at Hoechst AG. After accidentally dipping his fingers into the chemicals with which he was working, Clauss licked them to pick up a piece of paper. Clauss is the inventor listed on a United States patent issued in 1975 to the assignee Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft for one process of manufacturing acesulfame potassium. Subsequent research showed a number of compounds with the same basic ring structure had different levels of sweetness. 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide had particularly favourable taste characteristics and was relatively easy to synthesize, so it was singled out for further research, and received its generic name (acesulfame-K) from the World Health Organization in 1978. Acesulfame potassium first received approval for table top use in the United States in 1988. == Safety == The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its general use as a safe food additive in 1988, and maintains that safety assessment, as of 2023. In a 2000 scientific review, the European Food Safety Authority determined that acesulfame K is safe in typical consumption amounts, and does not increase the risk of diseases. == References == == External links == Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives evaluation monograph of Acesulfame Potassium Archived 2011-09-16 at the Wayback Machine FDA approval of Acesulfame Potassium FDA approval of Acesulfame Potassium as a General Purpose Sweetener in Food Elmhurst College, Illinois Virtual ChemBook Acesulfame K Discovery News Sweeteners Linger in Groundwater",Acesulfame potassium,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.004806393291801214), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.127160906791687), ('ĠINDU', -0.2615351974964142), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06199304759502411)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acesulfame_potassium?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=6, title='Acesulfame potassium', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acesulfame_potassium?utm_source=openai')])"
3705,"('Neoandrographolide', 'Neoandrographiside', 'S9157', 'Neoandrographolide, analytical standard')",Medical," Osteoporosis (OP), as the prevalent systemic metabolic bone disease worldwide, progresses insidiously and slowly. The clinical discomfort and complications associated with OP impose a significant burden on patients. Therefore, finding more effective treatments for OP remains an urgent challenge. We first conducted  NEO exhibits no significant cytotoxic effects on BMMs at concentrations less than or equal to 30 μM while exerting inhibitory effects on OC differentiation during its early and middle stages. RT-PCR and Western blot results reveal that NEO suppresses the expression of genes and proteins including CTSK,c-Fos,MMP9,NFATc1. Western blot findings also indicate that NEO inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK, P38, JNK, and P65 but does not reverse the degradation of IκB-α. Additionally, NEO affects the phosphorylation of proteins in the PI3K/AKT, GSK3β, and PPARγ signaling pathways, demonstrating that NEO can inhibit OC formation through multiple pathways and targets.  NEO has the potential to serve as a therapeutic agent for OP by targeting multiple sites and inhibiting the formation of mature OC through various signaling pathways. Neoandrographolide, one of the principal diterpene lactones, isolated from a medicinal herb Andrographis paniculata Nees, was tested in vivo and in vitro for its anti-inflammatory activities and mechanism. Oral administration of neoandrographolide (150 mg/kg) significantly suppressed ear edema induced by dimethyl benzene in mice. Oral administration of neoandrographolide (100-150 mg/kg) also reduced the increase in vascular permeability induced by acetic acid in mice. In vitro studies were performed using the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 to study the effect of neoandrographolide on suppressing phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated respiratory bursts and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Respiratory bursts were quantified by chemiluminescence (CL) measurements. Results showed that neoandrographolide suppressed PMA-stimulated respiratory bursts dose-dependently from 30 muM to 150 muM. Neoandrographolide also inhibited NO and TNF-alpha production in LPS-induced macrophages, contributing to the anti-inflammatory activity of A. paniculata. These results indicate that neoandrographolide possesses significant anti-inflammatory effects, which implies that it would be one of the major contributing components to participate in the anti-inflammatory effect of A. paniculata. and a potential candidate for further clinical trial. FXR (Farnesoid X Receptor) is one of the nuclear receptors expressed in the liver performing a significant role in the maintenance of bile acid concentration. An imbalance of cholesterol and bile acid ratio due to any undefined reason could cause gallstone formation. Hence, this paper aims to screen phytochemicals that could maintain a requisite balance of cholesterol and bile acid by targeting FXR and thereby contributing to the dissolution of gallstone. Nineteen phytochemicals were selected and queried for Pa and Pi in the way2drug online server for hepatoprotective property, cholesterol synthesis and absorption inhibition property, and β-glucuronidase inhibiting activity. Cianidanol, neoandrographolide, cynarine, saponins, and tanins with satisfying stated properties were docked with the screened FXR (PDB ID- 1OSH) using HADDOCK server, followed by pharmacokinetics study utilizing SwissADME tool. Neoandrographolide fits best among the other selected literature-based phytochemicals with minor violation of 'Brenk's rule'. The violation was corrected with the removal of an alkene group in the provided ChemDraw space of SwissADME. This Dealkenylated compound was further docked with FXR. The promising response under the static condition of the Dealkenylated compound was analyzed for molecular dynamic simulation at physiological conditions for 100 ns. Dealkenylated Neoandrographolide (DN) exhibited hepatoprotective, cholesterol synthesis and absorption inhibition property, and β-glucuronidase inhibition activity with a superior binding score of -42.6+/-1.5 with FXR. The interaction of the FXR receptor and the DN showed exceptional stability at physiological conditions during MD simulation and fit for the ADME properties, therefore it could be a potent candidate to dissolve gallstones.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

3706,"('Pridopidine', 'Pridopidine [usan:inn]', 'Pridopidine (usan/inn)', 'Piperidine, 4-(3-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-1-propyl-')",Medical,"Pridopidine (developmental code name PL-101) is an orally administrated small molecule investigational drug. Pridopidine is a selective and potent Sigma-1 Receptor agonist. It is being developed by Prilenia Therapeutics and is currently in late-stage clinical development for Huntington's disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). == Mechanism of action == Pridopidine works by binding and activating an intracellular protein called the Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) located at the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The S1R regulates key cellular processes crucial to neuronal health and survival. Selective activation of the S1R is a promising therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. Pridopidine activation of the S1R demonstrates neuroprotective effects in numerous models of neurodegenerative diseases including HD, ALS, Glaucoma, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pridopidine exhibits a neuroprotective effect against mutant Huntingtin (mHTT)-induced cell death in mouse primary HD neurons and human HD iPSCs. It restores the impaired synaptic plasticity in HD neurons, enhances mitochondrial function, upregulates BDNF transport and secretion, reduces ER stress and restores dendritic spine abnormalities in HD and AD models. In models of ALS, pridopidine protects neuron-muscle connectivity and restores muscle integrity and contractility. These beneficial effects are exclusively mediated by the S1R as either deletion of this gene, or selective inhibition of its function, completely abolish pridopidine's beneficial effects. Initially, the primary target of pridopidine was postulated to be the dopamine D2/D3 receptors. However, in-vitro binding assays show that pridopidine has high affinity for the S1R and low affinity for other targets including the dopamine D2/D3 receptors, adrenergic a2C receptor and the Sigma-2 receptor. Furthermore, selective and robust occupancy of the S1R, with no or negligible occupancy of the D2/D3 receptors was demonstrated by in-vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rats and human. == Potential indications == === Huntington's disease (HD) === HD is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by a mutation in the Huntingtin gene (expanded CAG repeat >35). The disease is characterized by progressive motor abnormalities, cognitive decline, and psychiatric and behavioral symptoms. Adult-onset HD usually begins between 35 and 45 years of age. Following onset, motor, cognitive and functional outcomes steadily decline over 15 to 20 years, ultimately leading to a state of profound incapacity and death. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and thus each child of a parent with HD has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated HD gene. For patients and their families, maintaining functional capacity is vital as it translates to a patient's ability to maintain their occupation, continue to manage their daily lives, and live independently. A meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,130 patients (816 in the pridopidine group and 314 in the placebo group) found that pridopidine led to a slight, though not statistically significant, improvement in overall motor symptoms, as measured by the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score, compared to placebo. However, the drug significantly improved voluntary movements, as indicated by the Modified Motor Score. Pridopidine was generally well tolerated, with no significant differences in adverse events or serious adverse events compared to placebo. The findings suggest that pridopidine has potential for treating motor symptoms in HD, with a favorable safety profile, warranting further clinical trials to confirm its benefits. === Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis === ALS is a devastating progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. Over time this progressive loss of motor function leads to losing the ability to speak, eat, move and eventually breathe. In 2019, pridopidine was selected by the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at the Massachusetts General Hospital as one of the first potential new innovative treatments to be evaluated in the first Platform Trial in ALS −, aimed to accelerate clinical trials in ALS. The first patient in the pridopidine regimen was enrolled in December 2020 (NCT04615923). The study will enroll 160 patients in each regimen with a 3:1 randomization (120 patients to be treated with pridopidine and 40 patients treated with placebo, daily for 24 weeks). == References ==",Pridopidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.999896090244874e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011784045491367579)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240903492530/en/Prilenia%E2%80%99s-Pridopidine-for-Huntington%E2%80%99s-Disease-Accepted-for-European-Marketing-Authorisation-Review/?utm_source=openai), [prilenia.com](https://www.prilenia.com/pipeline/?utm_source=openai), [prilenia.com](https://www.prilenia.com/about-pridopidine/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=372, start_index=9, title='Prilenia’s Pridopidine for Huntington’s Disease Accepted for European Marketing Authorisation Review | Business Wire', type='url_citation', url='https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240903492530/en/Prilenia%E2%80%99s-Pridopidine-for-Huntington%E2%80%99s-Disease-Accepted-for-European-Marketing-Authorisation-Review/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=372, start_index=9, title='Prilenia Pipeline: Pridopidine Clinical Trials', type='url_citation', url='https://www.prilenia.com/pipeline/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=372, start_index=9, title='What is Pridopidine?', type='url_citation', url='https://www.prilenia.com/about-pridopidine/?utm_source=openai')])"
3707,"('Kynurenine', '(r)-2-amino-4-(2-aminophenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid', '(2r)-2-amino-4-(2-aminophenyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid', 'Kynurenine, d-', 'Kyn')","Endogenous, Medical","Kynurenic acid (KYNA or KYN) is a product of the normal metabolism of amino acid L-tryptophan. It has been shown that kynurenic acid possesses neuroactive activity. It acts as an antiexcitotoxic and anticonvulsant, most likely through acting as an antagonist at excitatory amino acid receptors. Because of this activity, it may influence important neurophysiological and neuropathological processes. As a result, kynurenic acid has been considered for use in therapy in certain neurobiological disorders. Conversely, increased levels of kynurenic acid have also been linked to certain pathological conditions. Kynurenic acid was discovered in 1853 by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in dog urine, which it was apparently named after. It is formed from L-kynurenine in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme kynurenine—oxoglutarate transaminase. == Mechanism of action == KYNA has been proposed to act on five targets: As an antagonist at ionotropic AMPA, NMDA and Kainate glutamate receptors in the concentration range of 0.1-2.5 mM. As a noncompetitive antagonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor. As an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, recently (2011) direct recording of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents in adult (noncultured) hippocampal interneurons by the Cooper laboratory validated a 2009 study that failed to find any blocking effect of kynurenic acid across a wide range of concentrations, thus suggesting that in noncultured, intact preparations from adult animals there is no effect of kynurenic acid on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents. As a ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35. As an agonist for the G protein-coupled receptor HCAR3. == Role in disease == High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in patients with tick-borne encephalitis, schizophrenia and HIV-related illnesses. In all these situations, increased levels were associated with confusion and psychotic symptoms. Kynurenic acid acts in the brain as a glycine-site NMDAr antagonist, key in glutamatergic neurotransmission system, which is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The kynurenic acid hypothesis of schizophrenia was proposed in 2007, based on its action on midbrain dopamine activity and NMDArs, thus linking dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia with the glutamate hypothesis of the disease. Kynurenic acid is reduced in individuals with mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, especially during depressive episodes. High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in human urine in certain metabolic disorders, such as marked pyridoxine deficiency and deficiency/absence of kynureninase. When researchers decreased the levels of kynurenic acid in the brains of mice, their cognition was shown to improve markedly. However, kynurenic acid also shows neuroprotective properties. Some researchers have posited that the increased levels found in cases of neurological degradation is due to a failed attempt to protect the cells. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid compared to kynurenine appear to be associated with poorer T cell response and higher mortality in male subjects with COVID-19, suggesting an explanation for the poorer clinical outcomes observed in males than in females. == Link to ketogenic diet == One controlled study kept mice on a ketogenic diet and measured kynurenic acid concentrations in different parts of the brain. It found that the mice on the ketogenic diet had greater kynurenic acid concentrations in the striatum and hippocampus compared to mice on a normal diet, with no significant difference in the cortex. In response to the studies showing detrimental behaviour following increases in kynurenic acid the authors also note that the diet was generally well tolerated by the animals, with no ""gross behavioural abnormalities"". They posit that the increases in concentrations found were insufficient to produce behavioural changes seen in those studies. == See also == Xanthurenic acid == References == == External links == Link found between TBE and schizophrenia - TheLocal.se, Sweden's news in English, 6 November 2007.",Kyn,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0005686411168426275), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0003811025235336274), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.05605969578027725), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('OUS', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.008881115354597569), ('ĠMED', -0.032997772097587585), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1269676387310028)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Kynurenine is synthesized by the enzyme tryptophan dioxygenase, which is made primarily but not exclusively in the liver, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which is made in many tissues in response to immune activation. Kynurenine and its further breakdown products carry out diverse biological functions, including dilating blood vessels during inflammation and regulating the immune response. Some cancers increase kynurenine production, which increases tumor growth. Kynurenine protects the eye by absorbing UV light, especially in the UVA region (315–400 nm). Kynurenine is present in the lens and retina as one of multiple tryptophan derivatives produced in the eye, including 3-hydroxykynurenine, that together provide UV protection and aid in enhancing visual acuity. The use of kynurenine as a UV filter is consistent with its photostability and low photosensitization, owing to its efficient relaxation from the UV-induced excited state. The concentration of this UV filter decreases with age, and this loss of free kynurenine and the concomitant formation of relatively more photosensitizing kynurenine derivatives and kynurenine-protein conjugates may contribute to the formation of cataracts. Evidence suggests that increased kynurenine production may precipitate depressive symptoms associated with interferon treatment for hepatitis C. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with imbalances in the enzymes that break down kynurenine. Blood levels of kynurenine are reduced in people with bipolar disorder. Kynurenine production is increased in Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease where its metabolites are associated with cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms. Kynurenine is also associated with tics. Kynureninase catalyzes the conversion of kynurenine into anthranilic acid while kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase catalyzes its conversion into kynurenic acid. Kynurenine 3-hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine. Kynurenine has also been identified as one of two compounds that makes up the pigment that gives the goldenrod crab spider its yellow color. == Kynurenine pathway dysfunction == Dysfunctional states of distinct steps of the kynurenine pathway (such as kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine) have been described for a number of disorders, including: HIV dementia Tourette syndrome Tic disorders Psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, anxiety disorders) Multiple sclerosis Huntington's disease Encephalopathies Lipid metabolism Liver fat metabolism Systemic lupus erythematosus Glutaric aciduria Vitamin B6 deficiency Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Downregulation of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) can be caused by genetic polymorphisms, cytokines, or both. KMO deficiency leads to an accumulation of kynurenine and to a shift within the tryptophan metabolic pathway towards kynurenine acid and anthranilic acid. Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase deficiency is associated with disorders of the brain (e.g. major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, tic disorders) and of the liver. == Drug development == It is hypothesized that the kynurenine pathway is partly responsible for the therapeutic effect of lithium on bipolar disorder. If that is the case, it could be a target of drug discovery. == See also == Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) N′-Formylkynurenine == References ==",Kynurenine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.00026097820955328643), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -4.024604277219623e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.006533215753734112), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('OUS', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.20167089998722076), ('ĠMED', -0.34222832322120667), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20147736370563507)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS;  ', [])"
3709,"('Salicylic acid', 'O-hydroxybenzoic acid', 'O-carboxyphenol', 'Rutranex', 'Salonil')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Salicylic acid is an organic compound with the formula HOC6H4COOH. A colorless (or white), bitter-tasting solid, it is a precursor to and a metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). It is a plant hormone, and has been listed by the EPA Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Substance Inventory as an experimental teratogen. The name is from Latin salix for willow tree, from which it was initially identified and derived. It is an ingredient in some anti-acne products. Salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates. == Uses == === Medicine === Salicylic acid as a medication is commonly used to remove the outermost layer of the skin. As such, it is used to treat warts, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, ringworm, dandruff, and ichthyosis. Similar to other hydroxy acids, salicylic acid is an ingredient in many skincare products for the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, acanthosis nigricans, ichthyosis, and warts. === Uses in manufacturing === Salicylic acid is used as a food preservative, a bactericide, and an antiseptic. Salicylic acid is used in the production of other pharmaceuticals, including 4-aminosalicylic acid, sandulpiride, and landetimide (via salethamide). It is also used in picric acid production. Salicylic acid has long been a key starting material for making acetylsalicylic acid (ASA or aspirin). ASA is prepared by the acetylation of salicylic acid with the acetyl group from acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. ASA is the standard to which all the other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are compared. In veterinary medicine, this group of drugs is mainly used for treatment of inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders. Bismuth subsalicylate, a salt of bismuth and salicylic acid, ""displays anti-inflammatory action (due to salicylic acid) and also acts as an antacid and mild antibiotic"". It is an active ingredient in stomach-relief aids such as Pepto-Bismol and some formulations of Kaopectate. Other derivatives include methyl salicylate, used as a liniment to soothe joint and muscle pain, and choline salicylate, which is used topically to relieve the pain of mouth ulcers. Aminosalicylic acid is used to induce remission in ulcerative colitis, and has been used as an antitubercular agent often administered in association with isoniazid. Sodium salicylate is a useful phosphor in the vacuum ultraviolet spectral range, with nearly flat quantum efficiency for wavelengths between 10 and 100 nm. It fluoresces in the blue at 420 nm. It is easily prepared on a clean surface by spraying a saturated solution of the salt in methanol followed by evaporation. == Mechanism of action == Salicylic acid modulates COX-1 enzymatic activity to decrease the formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Salicylate may competitively inhibit prostaglandin formation. Salicylic acid, when applied to the skin surface, works by causing the cells of the epidermis to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up, and allowing room for new cell growth. Salicylic acid inhibits the oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) competitively with NADH and noncompetitively with UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid to the phenolic acceptor. The wound-healing retardation action of salicylates is probably due mainly to its inhibitory action on mucopolysaccharide synthesis. == Safety == If high concentrations of salicylic ointment are used topically, high levels of salicylic acid can enter the blood, requiring hemodialysis to avoid further complications. Cosmetic applications of the drug pose no significant risk. Even in a worst-case use scenario in which one was using multiple salicylic acid-containing topical products, the aggregate plasma concentration of salicylic acid was well below what was permissible for acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Since oral aspirin (which produces much higher salicylic acid plasma concentrations than dermal salicylic acid applications) poses no significant adverse pregnancy outcomes in terms of frequency of stillbirth, birth defects or developmental delay, use of salicylic acid containing cosmetics is safe for pregnant women. Salicylic acid is present in most fruits and vegetables as for example in greatest quantities in berries and in beverages like tea. == Production and chemical reactions == === Biosynthesis === Salicylic acid is biosynthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine. In Arabidopsis thaliana, it can be synthesized via a phenylalanine-independent pathway. === Chemical synthesis === Commercial vendors prepare sodium salicylate by treating sodium phenolate (the sodium salt of phenol) with carbon dioxide at high pressure (100 atm) and high temperature (115 °C) – a method known as the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction. Acidifying the product with sulfuric acid gives salicylic acid: At the laboratory scale, it can also be prepared by the hydrolysis of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen) with a strong acid or base; these reactions reverse those chemicals' commercial syntheses. === Reactions === Upon heating, salicylic acid converts to phenyl salicylate: Further heating gives xanthone. Salicylic acid as its conjugate base is a chelating agent, with an affinity for iron(III). Salicylic acid slowly degrades to phenol and carbon dioxide at 200–230 °C: All isomers of chlorosalicylic acid and of dichlorosalicylic acid are known. 5-Chlorosalicylic acid is produced by direct chlorination of salicylic acid. == History == Willow has long been used for medicinal purposes. Dioscorides, whose writings were highly influential for more than 1,500 years, used ""Itea"" (which was possibly a species of willow) as a treatment for ""painful intestinal obstructions"", birth control, for ""those who spit blood"", to remove calluses and corns and, externally, as a ""warm pack for gout"". William Turner, in 1597, repeated this, saying that willow bark, ""being burnt to ashes, and steeped in vinegar, takes away corns and other like risings in the feet and toes"". Some of these cures may describe the action of salicylic acid, which can be derived from the salicin present in willow. It is, however, a modern myth that Hippocrates used willow as a painkiller. Hippocrates, Galen, Pliny the Elder, and others knew that decoctions containing salicylate could ease pain and reduce fevers. It was used in Europe and China to treat these conditions. This remedy is mentioned in texts from Ancient Egypt, Sumer, and Assyria. The Cherokee and other Native Americans use an infusion of the bark for fever and other medicinal purposes. In 2014, archaeologists identified traces of salicylic acid on seventh-century pottery fragments found in east-central Colorado. Edward Stone, a vicar from Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, reported in 1763 that the bark of the willow was effective in reducing a fever. An extract of willow bark, called salicin, after the Latin name for the white willow (Salix alba), was isolated and named by German chemist Johann Andreas Buchner in 1828. A larger amount of the substance was isolated in 1829 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist. Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist, was able to convert the substance into a sugar and a second component, which on oxidation becomes salicylic acid. Salicylic acid was also isolated from the herb meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria, formerly classified as Spiraea ulmaria) by German researchers in 1839. Their extract caused digestive problems such as gastric irritation, bleeding, diarrhea, and even death when consumed in high doses. In 1874 the Scottish physician Thomas MacLagan experimented with salicin as a treatment for acute rheumatism, with considerable success, as he reported in The Lancet in 1876. Meanwhile, German scientists tried sodium salicylate with less success and more severe side effects. In 1979, salicylates were found to be involved in induced defenses of tobacco against tobacco mosaic virus. In 1987, salicylic acid was identified as the long-sought signal that causes thermogenic plants, such as the voodoo lily, Sauromatum guttatum, to produce heat. == Dietary sources == Salicylic acid occurs in plants as free salicylic acid and its carboxylated esters and phenolic glycosides. Several studies suggest that humans metabolize salicylic acid in measurable quantities from these plants. High-salicylate beverages and foods include beer, coffee, tea, numerous fruits and vegetables, sweet potato, nuts, and olive oil. Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, sugar, breads and cereals have low salicylate content. Some people with sensitivity to dietary salicylates may have symptoms of allergic reaction, such as bronchial asthma, rhinitis, gastrointestinal disorders, or diarrhea, so may need to adopt a low-salicylate diet. == Plant hormone == Salicylic acid is a phenolic phytohormone, and is found in plants with roles in plant growth and development, photosynthesis, transpiration, and ion uptake and transport. Salicylic acid is involved in endogenous signaling, mediating plant defense against pathogens. It plays a role in the resistance to pathogens (i.e. systemic acquired resistance) by inducing the production of pathogenesis-related proteins and other defensive metabolites. SA's defense signaling role is most clearly demonstrated by experiments which do away with it: Delaney et al. 1994, Gaffney et al. 1993, Lawton et al. 1995, and Vernooij et al. 1994 each use Nicotiana tabacum or Arabidopsis expressing nahG, for salicylate hydroxylase. Pathogen inoculation did not produce the customarily high SA levels, SAR was not produced, and no pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were expressed in systemic leaves. Indeed, the subjects were more susceptible to virulent – and even normally avirulent – pathogens. Exogenously, salicylic acid can aid plant development via enhanced seed germination, bud flowering, and fruit ripening, though too high of a concentration of salicylic acid can negatively regulate these developmental processes. The volatile methyl ester of salicylic acid, methyl salicylate, can also diffuse through the air, facilitating plant-plant communication. Methyl salicylate is taken up by the stomata of the nearby plant, where it can induce an immune response after being converted back to salicylic acid. === Signal transduction === A number of proteins have been identified that interact with SA in plants, especially salicylic acid binding proteins (SABPs) and the NPR genes (nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes), which are putative receptors. == See also == Salsalate Trolamine salicylate == References == == Further reading == Schrör K (2016).

Phosphorylcholine is part of the platelet-activating factor; the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, the only phospholipid of the membrane that is not built with a glycerol backbone. Treatment of cell membranes, like those of RBCs, by certain enzymes, like some phospholipase A2, renders the phosphorylcholine moiety exposed to the external aqueous phase, and thus accessible for recognition by the immune system. Antibodies against phosphorylcholine are naturally occurring autoantibodies that are created by CD5+/B-1 B cells and are referred to as non-pathogenic autoantibodies. == Thrombus-resistant stents == In interventional cardiology, phosphorylcholine is used as a synthetic polymer-based coating, applied to drug-eluting stents, to prevent the occurrence of coronary artery restenosis. The first application of this approach for use of stents evolved from efforts by Hayward, Chapman et al., who showed that the phosphorylcholine component of the outer surface of the erythrocyte bilayer was non-thrombogenicity. Until 2002, over 120,000 phosphorylcholine-coated stents have been implanted in patients with no apparent deleterious effect in the long term compared to bare metal stent technologies. Phosphorylcholine polymer-based drug-eluting stents Drug-eluting stents (DES) are used by interventional cardiologists, operating on patients with coronary artery disease. The stent is inserted into the artery via a balloon angioplasty. This will dilate the diameter of the coronary artery and keep it fixed in this phase so that more blood flows through the artery without the risk of blood clots (atherosclerosis). Phosphorylcholine is used as the polymer-based coating of a DES because its molecular design improves surface biocompatibility and lowers the risk of causing inflammation or thrombosis. Polymer coatings of stents that deliver the anti-proliferative drug Zotarolimus to the arterial vessel wall are components of these medical devices. For targeted local delivery of Zotarolimus to the artery, the drug is incorporated into a methacrylate-based copolymer that includes a synthetic form of phosphorylcholine. This use of biomimicry, or the practice of using polymers that occur naturally in biology, provides a coating with minimal thrombus deposition and no adverse clinical effect on late healing of the arterial vessel wall. Not only is the coating non-thrombogenic, but it also exhibits other features that should be present when applying such a material to a medical device for long-term implantation.

The commercially available synthetic compounds (R)-mandelic acid, benzoylformic acid, and racemic p-hydroxymandelic acid, had GI50 values of 82, 72, and 59 micrograms/mL, respectively, as compared with the natural compounds pisolithin A, 67 micrograms/mL, and pisolithin B, 71 micrograms/mL. Two synthetic S enantiomers of mandelic acid, (S)-mandelic acid and (S)-(+)-p-hydroxymandelic acid, were the most effective compounds, with GI50 values of 31 and 33 micrograms/mL, respectively. A sodium salt of mandelic acid had no activity below 500 micrograms/mL. Pisolithin A and pisolithin B were compared with polyoxin D for inhibition of hyphal growth, as measured by protein estimation.

3714,"('Rilpivirine', 'Edurant', 'Rilpivirine free base', 'R 278474', '(e)-4-((4-((4-(2-cyanovinyl)-2,6-dimethylphenyl)amino)pyrimidin-2-yl)amino)benzonitrile')",Medical,"Rilpivirine, sold under the brand name Edurant among others, is a medication, developed by Tibotec, used for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It is a second-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) with higher potency, longer half-life and reduced side-effect profile compared with older NNRTIs such as efavirenz. == Medical uses == In the US, rilpivirine is approved for treatment-naive patients with a viral load of 100,000 copies/mL or less at therapy initiation. It has to be combined with other drugs against HIV. In the European Union, rilpivirine is approved in combination with cabotegravir for maintenance treatment of adults who have undetectable HIV levels in the blood (viral load less than 50 copies/ml) with their current antiretroviral treatment, and when the virus has not developed resistance to certain class of anti-HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INIs). === Available forms === The drug is available as tablets (brand name Edurant) and as a long-acting intramuscular injection to be given once every month or every two months (Rekambys). Before using the injection, the tablets are given for about four weeks to assess tolerability. == Contraindications and interactions == The drug is contraindicated for use with drugs that induce the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St John's wort. Such drugs can accelerate the breaking down of rilpivirine, substantially decreasing its plasma concentrations and potentially resulting in loss of effectiveness and possible resistance. Some of these drugs also induce the enzyme UGT1A1 and thus reduce blood plasma concentrations of cabotegravir, further compromising the effectiveness of this combination therapy. It is also contraindicated in combination with proton pump inhibitors because the increased gastric pH causes decreased rilpivirine absorption from the gut, with similar consequences as with CYP3A4 inducers. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects of the injectable formulation are reactions at the injection site (in up to 84% of patients) such as pain and swelling, as well as headache (up to 12%) and fever or feeling hot (in 10%). Less common (under 10%) are depressive disorders, insomnia, and rashes. The most common side effects of the tablets are also depressive disorders (4.1%), headache (3.5%), insomnia (3.5%) and rashes (2.3%). All of these side effects occurred under combination therapies of rilpivirine with one or more other drugs against HIV. QT prolongation of the heart rhythm has been observed at very high doses, but is not clinically relevant at standard doses of the drug. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). === Pharmacokinetics === When taken by mouth, rilpivirine reaches highest levels in the blood plasma after about four to five hours. Taking the drug without food lowers its plasma levels by 40% as compared to taking it with food, which is considered to be clinically relevant. Therefore, patients are advised to take the medication together with a meal. After injection into the muscle, the substance reaches highest plasma levels after three to four days. Independently of the mode of application, rilpivirine is almost completely bound to plasma proteins (99.7%), mostly to albumin. It is metabolised mainly by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Metabolites include several oxidation products, glucuronides, and glucuronides of oxidized metabolites. The biological half-life is approximately 45 hours for the tablets and 13 to 28 weeks for the injection. Elimination has only been studied for oral administration: Most of the drug is excreted via the faeces (85%), partly in unchanged form (25%), partly in form of its metabolites (60%). A minor amount is excreted via the urine (6%), almost exclusively as metabolites. == Fixed-dose combinations == A fixed-dose medication combining rilpivirine with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2011 under the brand name Complera, and was approved for use in the European Union with the brand name Eviplera in November 2011. This combination has been shown to have higher rates of virologic failure than emtricitabine/tenofovir/efavirenz in people with baseline HIV viral loads greater than 100,000 copies/mm3. A fixed-dose medication combining rilpivirine with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) was approved for use in the US in March 2016 with the brand name Odefsey. Dolutegravir/rilpivirine, sold under the brand name Juluca, is a fixed-dose combination antiretroviral medication for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It was approved for use in the United States in November 2017 and for use in the European Union in May 2018. In January 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cabotegravir/rilpivirine (brand name Cabenuva) for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in adults to replace an antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. This is the first FDA-approved injectable, complete regimen for HIV-infected adults that is administered once a month. The label for rilpivirine tablets was revised to reflect the oral lead-in recommendations for use with cabotegravir. == Chemistry == Like etravirine, a second-generation NNRTI approved in 2008, rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine (DAPY). The tablets contain rilpivirine hydrochloride, while the injection contains free rilpivirine. == History == Rilpivirine entered phase III clinical trials in April 2008, and was approved for use in the United States in May 2011 under the brand name Edurant. In October 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for rilpivirine under the trade name Rekambys, intended for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection in combination with cabotegravir injection. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in December 2020. The two medicines are the first antiretrovirals that come in a long-acting injectable formulation. == References ==",Edurant,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00034433635300956666), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00012599628826137632)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/edurant.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Edurant and Edurant Ped: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/edurant.html?utm_source=openai')])"

The traditional Chinese medicine Andrographis paniculata and its principal active component (Dehydroandrographolide, DA) have been well known for their diverse cardiovascular protective effects. However, the effects of DA on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) were still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects and revealed the potential mechanisms of DA on DIC both in vivo and in vitro. The effects of DA on DIC were systematically assessed by echocardiography and histological assays. Western blot and flow cytometry were used to measure apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Transmission electron microscopy and StubRFP-SensGFP-LC3 lentivirus were further used to assay autophagic flux. Our results showed that DA administration significantly improved cardiac function and attenuated DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mechanically, DA restored autophagic flux and lysosome functions via inhibiting DOX-induced mTOR signal pathway activation and increasing the translocation of TFEB to the nucleus. However, activation of mTOR or knockdown of TFEB significantly inhibited the protective effects of DA against DIC by impacting lysosomal functions and autophagic flux. In conclusion, our results revealed that DA might be a potential cardioprotective agent against DIC. To systematically evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Potassium Dehydroandrographolide Succinate Injection (PDSI) in the treatment of child epidemic parotitis (EP). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding PDSI in the treatment of child EP were searched in China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, PubMed, and Cochrane Library from inception to July 30, 2013. Two reviewers independently retrieved RCTs and extracted information. The Cochrane risk of bias method was used to assess the quality of included studies, and a meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.2 software. A total of 11 studies with 818 participants were included. The quality of the studies was generally low, among which only one study mentioned the random method. The meta-analysis indicated that PDSI was more effective than the conventional therapy with Western medicine for EP in the outcomes of the total effective rate [relative risk (RR)=1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.14, 1.33], P<0.01], the time of temperature return to normal, the time of detumescence [mean difference (MD)=-2.10, 95% CI [-2.78,-1.41], P<0.01], and the incidence of complications (RR=0.14, 95% CI [0.03, 0.72], P=0.02). There were 6 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in this systematic review, 2 of which were mainly represented rash and diarrhea in the experiment group, while another 4 ADRs occurred in the control group. Based on the systematic review, PDSI was effectiveness and relatively safety in the treatment of child EP. But further rigorously designed trials are warranted to determine its effectiveness.

3716,"('Diroximel fumarate', 'Diroximel fumarete', 'Vumerity', '(2e)-2-butenedioic acid 1-[2-(2,5-dioxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)ethyl] 4-methyl ester', 'Diroximel-fumarate')",Medical,"Diroximel fumarate, sold under the brand name Vumerity, is a medication used for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). It acts as an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory drug. Its most common adverse effects are flushing and gastrointestinal problems. Diroximel fumarate was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2019, and in the European Union in November 2021. == Medical uses == Diroximel fumarate is used for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. In the US, it is additionally approved for other relapsing forms of MS such as clinically isolated syndrome and active secondary progressive disease. === Available forms === The drug is available as a white delayed-release capsule that is resistant to gastric acid and only dissolves in the intestine. == Contraindications == Under the European Union's label, the drug is contraindicated in people with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a disease of the brain caused by a virus. In the US, combination with the closely related drug dimethyl fumarate is contraindicated. == Side effects == No systematic studies of adverse effects under diroximel fumarate are available. The most common side effects in studies with dimethyl fumarate were flushing (in 34% of patients treated with the drug, versus 5% in the placebo group) and gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhoea (14% versus 10%), nausea (12% versus 9%), abdominal pain (9% versus 4%), vomiting (8% versus 5%), and indigestion (5% versus 3%). Three percent of patients stopped the treatment because of flushing, 4% because of gastrointestinal side effects. A rare but potentially fatal adverse effect may be PML, which has been observed under treatment with dimethyl fumarate. == Overdose == No specific antidote is known. Adverse effects caused by overdosing diroximel fumarate are treated symptomatically. == Interactions == Diroximel fumarate does not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes or P-glycoprotein. Its active metabolite, monomethyl fumarate, has a relatively low plasma protein binding of 27 to 45%. Therefore, its potential for pharmacokinetic interactions is considered to be low. Inactivated vaccines can be given under diroximel fumarate therapy, based on experience with other immunosuppressant drugs, such as studies with tetanus, pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines. No studies regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines under diroximel fumarate have been conducted. No data are available regarding combination with live vaccines, chemotherapy or immunosuppressants. Nephrotoxicity could be increased when the drug is combined with aminoglycoside antibiotics, diuretics, NSAIDs or lithium. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The drug's mechanism of action is not well understood. In preclinical studies it activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor that is up-regulated under oxidative stress. === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics of diroximel fumarate has been found to be practically identical to that of dimethyl fumarate. Both are prodrugs of monomethyl fumarate. Taking the drug with a high-calorie, high-fat meal slows down absorption, but has no relevant effect on overall absorption. The US label recommends not taking the drug together with high-calorie and high-fat meals. After ingestion, the substance is cleaved by esterase enzymes before reaching the systemic circulation, resulting in monomethyl fumarate (MMF), the active metabolite, and hydroxyethyl succinimide (HES), which is inactive. Diroximel fumarate itself is not present in the bloodstream. MMF reaches highest concentrations in the blood plasma 2.5 to 3 hours after ingestion. When in the bloodstream, 27 to 45% are bound to plasma proteins. MMF is further metabolized to fumarate, citrate and glucose, ultimately entering the citric acid cycle and being broken down to carbon dioxide (CO2). About 60% of the substance leave the body as CO2 via the lungs, 15.5% are eliminated with the urine (according to another source, less than 0.3%), and 0.9% are eliminated with the faeces. The terminal half-life is one hour. HES is eliminated mainly with the urine (58 to 63%). == Chemistry == The substance is a white to off-white powder. It is slightly soluble in water; that is, its solubility is between 1:100 and 1:1000. The molecule is achiral. The double bond of the fumarate moiety has E configuration. == History == This drug was formulated by Alkermes in collaboration with Biogen. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Diroximel fumarate was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2019. In September 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Vumerity, intended for the treatment of adults with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.

3717,"('Plerixafor', 'Mozobil', 'Bicyclam jm-2987', 'Plerixafor hydrochloride', 'Plerixafor (amd3100)')",Medical,"Plerixafor, sold under the brand name Mozobil, is an immunostimulant used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells in cancer patients into the bloodstream. The stem cells are then extracted from the blood and transplanted back to the patient. The drug was developed by AnorMED, which was subsequently bought by Genzyme. == Medical uses == Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization, which is important as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation, is generally performed using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), but is ineffective in around 15 to 20% of patients. Combination of G-CSF with plerixafor increases the percentage of persons that respond to the therapy and produce enough stem cells for transplantation. The drug is approved for patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Phase 2 clinical trials started in 2021 exploring the combination of plerixafor and MGTA-145, a CXCL2 ligand. == Contraindications == === Pregnancy and lactation === Studies in pregnant animals have shown teratogenic effects. Plerixafor is therefore contraindicated in pregnant women except in critical cases. Fertile women are required to use contraception. It is not known whether the drug is secreted into the breast milk. Breast feeding should be discontinued during therapy. == Adverse effects == Nausea, diarrhea and local reactions were observed in over 10% of patients. Other problems with digestion and general symptoms like dizziness, headache, and muscular pain are also relatively common; they were found in more than 1% of patients. Allergies occur in less than 1% of cases. Most adverse effects in clinical trials were mild and transient. The European Medicines Agency has listed a number of safety concerns to be evaluated on a post-marketing basis, most notably the theoretical possibilities of spleen rupture and tumor cell mobilisation. The first concern has been raised because splenomegaly was observed in animal studies, and G-CSF can cause spleen rupture in rare cases. Mobilisation of tumor cells has occurred in patients with leukaemia treated with plerixafor. == Interactions == No interaction studies have been conducted. The fact that plerixafor does not interact with the cytochrome system indicates a low potential for interactions with other drugs. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === In the form of its zinc complex, plerixafor acts as an antagonist (or perhaps more accurately a partial agonist) of the alpha chemokine receptor CXCR4 and an allosteric agonist of CXCR7. The CXCR4 alpha-chemokine receptor and one of its ligands, SDF-1, are important in hematopoietic stem cell homing to the bone marrow and in hematopoietic stem cell quiescence. The in vivo effect of plerixafor with regard to ubiquitin, the alternative endogenous ligand of CXCR4, is unknown. Plerixafor has been found to be a strong inducer of mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow to the bloodstream as peripheral blood stem cells. Additionally, plerixafor inhibits CD20 expression on B cells by interfering with CXCR4/SDF1 axis that regulates its expression. === Pharmacokinetics === Following subcutaneous injection, plerixafor is absorbed quickly and peak concentrations are reached after 30 to 60 minutes. Up to 58% are bound to plasma proteins, the rest mostly resides in extravascular compartments. The drug is not metabolized in significant amounts; no interaction with the cytochrome P450 enzymes or P-glycoproteins has been found. Plasma half life is 3 to 5 hours. Plerixafor is excreted via the kidneys, with 70% of the drug being excreted within 24 hours. == Chemistry == Plerixafor is a macrocyclic compound and a bicyclam derivative, the cyclam rings being linked at the amine nitrogen atoms by a 1,4-xylyl spacer. It is a base; all eight nitrogen atoms accept protons readily. The two macrocyclic rings form chelate complexes with bivalent metal ions, especially zinc, copper and nickel, as well as cobalt and rhodium. The biologically active form of plerixafor is its zinc complex. === Synthesis === Three of the four nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle cyclam... (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) are protected with tosyl groups. The product is treated with 1,4-bis(brommethyl)benzene and potassium carbonate in acetonitrile. After cleaving of the tosyl groups with hydrobromic acid, plerixafor octahydrobromide is obtained. == History == The molecule was first synthesised in 1987 to carry out basic studies on the redox chemistry of dimetallic coordination compounds. Then, it was serendipitously discovered by another chemist that such a molecule could have a potential use in the treatment of HIV because of its role in the blocking of CXCR4, a chemokine receptor which acts as a co-receptor for certain strains of HIV (along with the virus's main cellular receptor, CD4). Development of this indication was terminated because of lacking oral availability and cardiac disturbances. Further studies led to the new indication for cancer patients. == Society and culture == Plerixafor has orphan drug status in the United States and European Union for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication on 15 December 2008. In the European Union, the drug was approved after a positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use assessment report on 29 May 2009. The drug was approved for use in Canada by Health Canada on 8 December 2011. == Research == === Anti-cancer properties === Plerixafor was seen to reduce metastasis in mice in several studies. It has also been shown to reduce recurrence of glioblastoma in a mouse model after radiotherapy. In this model, the cancer cells that survived radiation critically depended on bone marrow derived cells for vasculogenesis, and the recruitment of the latter was mediated by SDF-1 CXCR4 interactions, which are blocked by plerixafor. === Use in stem cell research === Researchers at Imperial College have demonstrated that plerixafor in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can mobilise mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells into the peripheral blood of mice. In a 2020 study, researchers did not find evidence that plerixafor assisted in the healing of diabetic-related arterial insufficiency ulcers. === Neurologic === Blockade of CXCR4 signalling by plerixafor has also unexpectedly been found to be effective at counteracting opioid-induced hyperalgesia produced by chronic treatment with morphine, though only animal studies have been conducted as yet. == References ==",Mozobil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.046303264563903e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002693767019081861)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([felleskatalogen.no](https://www.felleskatalogen.no/medisin/pasienter/pil-mozobil-sanofi-576724?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=125, start_index=9, title='Mozobil Sanofi - Felleskatalogen Pasientutgave', type='url_citation', url='https://www.felleskatalogen.no/medisin/pasienter/pil-mozobil-sanofi-576724?utm_source=openai')])"

It is believed to inhibit HIV by a novel mechanism, so-called maturation inhibition. It is not currently U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. It was originally developed by the pharmaceutical company Panacos and reached Phase IIb clinical trials. Myriad Genetics announced on January 21, 2009 the acquisition of all rights to bevirimat for $7M USD. On June 8, 2010 Myriad Genetics announced that it was abandoning their HIV portfolio to focus more on cancer drug development. == Pharmacokinetics == According to the only currently available study, ""the mean terminal elimination half-life of bevirimat ranged from 56.3 to 69.5 hours, and the mean clearance ranged from 173.9 to 185.8 mL/hour."" == Mechanism of action == Like protease inhibitors, bevirimat and other maturation inhibitors interfere with protease processing of newly translated HIV polyprotein precursor, called gag. Gag is an essential structural protein of the HIV virus. Gag undergoes a chain of interactions both with itself and with other cellular and viral factors to accomplish the assembly of infectious virus particles. HIV assembly is a two-stage process involving an intermediate immature capsid that undergoes a structurally dramatic maturation to yield the infectious particle. This alteration is mediated by the viral protease, which cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor, allowing the freed parts to reassemble to form the core of the mature virus particle. Bevirimat prevents this viral replication by specifically inhibiting cleavage of the capsid protein (CA) from the SP1 spacer protein. First, bevirimat enters a growing virus particle as it buds from an infected cell and binds to the Gag polypeptide at the CA/SP1 cleavage site. This prevents the protease enzyme from cleaving CA-SP1. As the capsid protein remains bound to SP1, the virus particle core is prevented from compressing into its normal mature shape, which is crucial for infectivity, resulting in the release of an immature, non-infectious particle. == Metabolism == It has been found that bevirimat does not inhibit the cytochrome P450 system or interact with the human P-glycoprotein. Unformulated bevirimat is not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood. Some of the less desirable properties of unformulated bevirimat and its salts include: inadequate bioavailability, poor solubility of the pharmaceutical composition in gastric fluid, insufficient dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, below standard long term safety profile for oral dosage forms, below standard long term chemical and physical stability of the final dosage form, tendency for conversion to metastable forms, lengthy dissolution times for oral dosage forms, and precipitation in gastric or intestinal fluids. Some pharmaceutical compositions of formulated bevirimat have shown to have better properties over unformulated bevirimat. Some of these properties include: improved bioavailability, improved solubility of the composition in gastric fluid, improved dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, improved safety for oral dosage forms, improved chemical and physical stability of the oral dosage form, decreased conversion to metastable forms, and decreased rate of precipitation in gastric fluid. Bevirimat was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with detectable concentrations present in the plasma within 15 minutes after administration and peak plasma concentrations were achieved approximately one to three hours after administration. The plasma had a mean plasma elimination half-life ranging from 58 to 80 hours. This long half-life of bevirimat supports once-daily dosing. Elimination of bevirimat is primarily via hepatobiliary routes, with renal elimination counting for less than 1% of the dose. == Toxicity and side effects == Preclinical studies have not presented any sign that bevirimat might be associated with any specific safety concerns that would limit its clinical use. In vitro preclinical studies in human cells propose that bevirimat should have low potential for cytotoxicity. There is no evidence of any reproductive or developmental toxicity and it is not immunotoxic. Bevirimat was initially evaluated for safety and pharmacokinetics in a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase clinical study in healthy volunteers. It was administered as an oral solution in doses of 25, 50, 100, and 250 mg. The plasma concentrations were dose-proportional, and the compound was seen to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities and no serious adverse effects. In one clinical trial, headaches was the most commonly reported side effect of bevirimat, reported by four participants on bevirimat and one on the placebo. The second most common reported side effect was throat discomfort by two participants on bevirimat. No serious adverse effects were reported, all adverse effects reported were mild, and no participants discontinued use of bevirimat because of the adverse effects. == Resistance == In vitro studies have shown that presence of a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CA/SP1 cleavage site have resulted in resistance to bevirimat. However, mutations at these sites were not found in phase I and II clinical trials. Instead, mutations in the glutamine-valine-threonine (QVT) motif of the SP1 peptide are also known to cause bevirimat resistance. In addition, V362I mutations have been shown to confer strong resistance to bevirimat, where the S373P and I376V mutations may confer low resistance to bevirimat. A further complication of the use of bevirimat is that, since bevirimat targets the CA/SP1 cleavage site, it could also be used in the treatment of protease inhibitor resistant patients. Except for A364V, mutations in the CA/SP1 cleavage site have resulted in fitness deficits when combined with protease inhibitor resistance. This proposes that these mutations may develop slowly. It has been shown that protease inhibitor resistance can result in an increase in the occurrence of mutations within the downstream QVT motif. == Clinical trials == In December 2007, some results of the Phase IIb trial were released. Thomson Financial News reported that, ""some patients respond 'very well' to the drug, while another population 'does not respond as well at current dose levels.'"" Panacos said it intends to add a group to the study at a higher dosage. The drug manufacturer, Panacos, has stated that success with bevirimat hinges on a patient's particular HIV not having a specific group of genetic mutations in HIV’s Gag protein. When they evaluated the study participants’ virus and found that the participant’s virologic response depended greatly on whether or not the Gag protein of a participant’s virus had polymorphisms—multiple mutations in the protein’s structure. After sampling the virus of 100 patients in the company’s database, they found that about 50 percent did not have Gag polymorphisms, meaning that about 50 percent would likely respond well to the drug. == See also == BMS-955176 == References == == External links == AIDSmeds Bevirimat An animation illustrating Bevirimat's mechanism of action Overview and Publication Listing for Bevirimat from Panacos",Bevirimat,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3133038878440857)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0028181858360767365), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038081347942352295)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevirimat,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06581,https://retrovirology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4690-3-S1-S8 ', [])"

It is a stereoisomer of the molecule podophyllotoxin (PPT) which also acts as an inhibitor of the IGF1R. Both stereoisomers are classified as cyclolignans, with PPT being the trans conformation and picropodophyllin being the cis conformation. Picropodophyllin is currently being applied in clinical research investigating its viability as an anti-cancer treatment. It is often administered orally in patients with solid tumours. It has shown effectiveness in reducing tumour volume in glioblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and other cancers through the targeting of IGF1R. == Synthesis == Picropodophyllin is a lignan extract from podophyllum resin which is sourced from the roots of Podophyllum plants. == Clinical applications == Picropodophyllin has been used in multiple in-vitro and in-vivo trials investigating its ability to reduce solid tumour volume. Its current primary use is in clinical trials. === Administration === Picropodophyllin is a relatively non-polar compound, and therefore is administered clinically dissolved in solution or in drug form. In-vitro trials used saline, DMSO, or ethanol to dissolve the picropodophyllin before administering to cell cultures. In-vivo experiments used saline. Clinical trials have also used AXL1717, which is a drug containing picropodophyllin. === Glioblastoma === Picropodophyllin has been used in in-vitro and in-vivo testing on glioblastoma (GB) cells. In GB cell lines that were cultured and treated with Picropodophyllin, it was demonstrated that picropodophyllin prevents GB cell growth and induces apoptosis. One in-vitro assay demonstrated that out of 12 GB cell lines, all but one had their growth inhibited by the administration of picropodophyllin. Furthermore, an in-vivo assay was conducted which determined that in mice which had xenografted GB tumour cells, picropodophyllin induced strong regression of the xenograft tumours. === Astrocytoma === A phase 1 clinical trial was conducted on patients suffering from recurrent or progressive malignant astrocytomas. AXL1717, a drug whose main active compound is picropodophyllin, was administered orally at a dosage of 215-400mg on a 35 day cycle (28 days administered and 7 days off). 9 patients received treatment, with 4 of them showing tumour responses to the Picropodophyllin. The trial also found that the adverse reaction to picropodophyllin, which was neutropenia, was easily detected and reversed in all but one patient. === Rhabdomyosarcoma === Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancer that highly expresses IGF1R receptors. In-vitro studies have been conducted to investigate the viability of picropodophyllin as a treatment. In in-vitro cell cultures, certain lines of rhabdomyosarcoma such as RH30 showed 90% of cells had expression of IGF1R. When treating cell cultures of RH30 and RD with picropodophyllin, researchers found that 24 hour exposure caused a dose dependent decrease in viable cancer cells. Doses above 2μM caused massive apoptosis and cell death. == Mechanism of action == Currently, the specific molecular mechanisms by which picropodophyllin is able to cause apoptosis in cancer cells is unknown. Picropodophyllin suppresses signalling in the IGF1R pathway, which can be observed clinically through a reduction of phosphorylated IGF1R proteins, as well as a reduction of phosphorylated down-stream signalling proteins. It has also been demonstrated that picropodophyllin interacts with the PI3K/Akt pathway, which mediates neoplastic transformation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. Specifically, picropodophyllin induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest using reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In-vitro investigations show that administration of picropodophyllin significantly increases the expression levels of ROS generating enzymes, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), oxidases (NOX1 and NPX3) and the cytochrome b-245 beta chain (CYBB). The expression of ROS scavenging enzymes remained constant post treatment, resulting in the accumulation of ROS. ROS accumulation has also been demonstrated to inactivate the PI3K/Akt pathway. Picropodophyllin's ability to cause mitotic arrest in cancer cells is a result of inhibition of microtubule formation. Researchers found that in cells which had been arrested in metaphase, the impact of picropodophyllin administration was like that of Nocodazole, a microtubule destabiliser. Picropodophyllin does not directly bind b-tubulin in microtubules, instead mediating mitotic arrest by interfering with microtubule dynamics. == Side effects == Picropodophyllin can cause adverse effects, primarily being febrile neutropenia. Picropodophyllin is undergoing investigation in cancer treatment in part due to its clinical activity accompanied by a lack of metabolic toxicity. == References ==",Picropodophyllin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002036595979006961), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011872540198964998), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01105458103120327)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.10021097958087921)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picropodophyllin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=6, title='Picropodophyllin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picropodophyllin?utm_source=openai')])"
3720,"('Podofilox', 'Podophyllotoxin', 'Condylox', 'Condyline', 'Wartec')",Medical,"Podophyllotoxin (PPT) is the active ingredient in Podofilox, a medical cream used to treat genital warts and molluscum contagiosum. It is not recommended for HPV infections without external warts. It can be applied either by a healthcare provider or the patient themselves. Podophyllotoxin is a non-alkaloid lignin extracted from the roots and rhizomes of plants of the genus Podophyllum. A less refined form known as podophyllum resin is also available, but has greater side effects. Podophyllotoxin was first isolated in pure form in 1880 by Valerian Podwyssotzki (1818 – 28 January 1892), a Polish-Russian privatdozent at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) and assistant at the Pharmacological Institute there. PPT is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Podophyllotoxin possesses a large number of medical applications, as it inhibits replication of both cellular and viral DNA by binding necessary enzymes. It can additionally destabilize microtubules and prevent cell division. Because of these interactions it is considered an antimitotic drug. It has been employed in the treatment of a wide range of medical conditions, from infections to cancer, although modern medicine typically relies on less orally toxic derivatives when antimitotic effects are desired. Podophyllotoxin cream is commonly prescribed as a potent topical antiviral. It is used for the treatment of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections with external warts as well as molluscum contagiosum infections. 0.5% PPT cream is prescribed for twice daily applications for 3 days followed by 4 days with no application; this weekly cycle is repeated for four weeks. PPT can also be prescribed as a gel, as opposed to a cream, and is also sold under the names condyline and warticon. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects of podophyllotoxin cream are typically limited to irritation of tissue surrounding the application site, usually burning, redness, pain, itching, and swelling. Application is sometimes immediately followed by burning or itching. Small sores, itching, and peeling skin may also follow. For these reasons it is recommended that application be done in a way that limits contact with surrounding uninfected tissue. Neither podophyllin resin nor podophyllotoxin lotions or gels are used during pregnancy because these medications have been shown to be embryotoxic in both mice and rats. Antimitotic agents are in general not typically recommended during pregnancy. Additionally, it has not been determined if podophyllotoxin can pass into breast milk from topical applications and therefore it is not recommended for breastfeeding women. Though podophyllotoxin cream is safe for topical use, it can cause CNS depression as well as enteritis if ingested. The podophyllum resin from which podophyllotoxin is derived has the same effect. == Mechanism of action == Podophyllotoxin destabilizes microtubules by binding tubulin and thus preventing cell division. In contrast, some of its derivatives display binding activity to the enzyme topoisomerase II (Topo II) during the late S and early G2 stages. For instance, etoposide binds and stabilizes the temporary DNA break caused by the enzyme, disrupts the reparation of the break through which the double-stranded DNA passes, and consequently prevents DNA unwinding, which is necessary for subsequent replication. Mutants resistant to either podophyllotoxin or to its topoisomerase II-inhibitory derivatives such as etoposide (VP-16)p have been described in Chinese hamster cells. The mutually exclusive cross-resistance patterns of these mutants provide a highly specific means to distinguish the two kinds of podophyllotoxin derivatives. Mutant Chinese hamster cells resistant to podophyllotoxin are affected in a protein P1 that was later identified as the mammalian HSP60 or chaperonin protein. Furthermore, podophyllotoxin is classified as an aryltetralin lignan for its ability to bind and deactivate DNA. It and its derivates bind Topo II and prevent its ability to catalyze the rejoining of DNA which has been broken for replication. Lastly, experimental evidence has shown that these aryltetralin lignans can interact with cellular factors to create chemical DNA adducts, thus further deactivating DNA. == Chemistry == === Structural characteristic === The structure of podophyllotoxin was first elucidated in the 1930s. Podophyllotoxin bears four consecutive chiral centers, labelled C-1 through C-4 in the following image. The molecule also contains four almost planar fused rings. The podophyllotoxin molecule includes a number of oxygen-containing functional groups: an alcohol, a lactone, three methoxy groups, and an acetal. Derivatives of podophyllotoxin are synthesized as properties of the rings and carbon 1 through 4 are diversified. For example, ring A is not essential to antimitotic activity. Aromatization of ring C leads to loss of activity, possibly from ring E no longer being placed on the axial position. In addition, the stereochemistry at C-2 and C-3 configures a trans-lactone, which has more activity than the cis counterpart. Chirality at C-1 is also important as it implies an axial position for ring E. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthetic route of podophyllotoxin was not completely eludicidated for many years; however, in September 2015, the identity of the six missing enzymes in podophyllotoxin biosynthesis were reported for the first time. Several prior studies have suggested a common pathway starting from coniferyl alcohol being converted to (+)-pinoresinol in the presence of a one-electron oxidant through dimerization of stereospecific radical intermediate. Pinoresinol is subsequently reduced in the presence of co-factor NADPH to first lariciresinol, and ultimately secoisolariciresinol. Lactonization on secoisolariciresinol gives rise to matairesinol. Secoisolariciresinol is assumed to be converted to yatein through appropriate quinomethane intermediates, leading to podophyllotoxin. A sequence of enzymes involved has been reported to be dirigent protein (DIR), to convert coniferyl alcohol to (+)-pinocresol, which is converted by pinocresol-lariciresinol reductase (PLR) to (-)-secoisolariciresinol, which is converted by sericoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SDH) to (-)-matairesinol, which is converted by CYP719A23 to (-)-pluviatolide, which is likely converted by Phex13114 (OMT1) to (-)-yatein, which is converted by Phex30848 (2-ODD) to (-)-deoxypodophyllotoxin. Though not proceeding through the last step of producing podophyllotoxin itself, a combination of six genes from the mayapple enabled production of the etoposide aglycone in tobacco plants. === Chemical synthesis === Podophyllotoxin has been successfully synthesized in a laboratory; however, synthesis mechanisms require many steps, resulting in a low overall yield. It therefore remains more efficient to obtain podophyllotoxin from natural sources. Four routes have been used to synthesize podophyllotoxin with varying success: an oxo ester route, lactonization of a dihydroxy acid, cyclization of a conjugate addition product, and a Diels-Alder reaction. === Derivatives === Podophyllotoxin and its derivatives are used as cathartic, purgative, antiviral agent, vesicant, antihelminthic, and antitumor agents. Podophyllotoxin derived antitumor agents include etoposide and teniposide. These drugs have been successfully used in therapy against numerous cancers including testicular, breast, pancreatic, lung, stomach, and ovarian cancers. == Natural abundance == Podophyllotoxin is present at concentrations of 0.3% to 1.0% by mass in the rhizome of the American mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum). Another common source is the rhizome of Sinopodophyllum hexandrum Royle (Berberidaceae). It is biosynthesized from two molecules of coniferyl alcohol by phenolic oxidative coupling and a series of oxidations, reductions and methylations. == References == == Further reading ==",Wartec,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.6932599544525146), (' FOOD', -0.0014117816463112831)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0009597701136954129), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25203216075897217)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3721,"('Novobiocin (sodium)', 'Albamycin', 'Cathomycin', 'Novobiocin', 'Streptonivicin')",Medical,"Novobiocin, also known as albamycin, is an aminocoumarin antibiotic that is produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces niveus, which has recently been identified as a subjective synonym for S. spheroides a member of the class Actinomycetia. Other aminocoumarin antibiotics include clorobiocin and coumermycin A1. Novobiocin was first reported in the mid-1950s (then called streptonivicin). == Clinical use == It is active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and may be used to differentiate it from the other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which is resistant to novobiocin, in culture. Novobiocin was licensed for clinical use under the tradename Albamycin (Upjohn) in the 1960s. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical trials. The oral form of the drug has since been withdrawn from the market due to lack of efficacy. A combination product of novobiocin and tetracycline, sold by Upjohn under brand names such as Panalba and Albamycin-T, was in particular the subject of intense FDA scrutiny before it was finally taken off the market. Novobiocin is an effective antistaphylococcal agent used in the treatment of MRSA. == Mechanism of action == The molecular basis of action of novobiocin, and other related drugs clorobiocin and coumermycin A1 has been examined. Aminocoumarins are very potent inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase and work by targeting the GyrB subunit of the enzyme involved in energy transduction. Novobiocin as well as the other aminocoumarin antibiotics act as competitive inhibitors of the ATPase reaction catalysed by GyrB. The potency of novobiocin is considerably higher than that of the fluoroquinolones that also target DNA gyrase, but at a different site on the enzyme. The GyrA subunit is involved in the DNA nicking and ligation activity. Novobiocin has been shown to weakly inhibit the C-terminus of the eukaryotic Hsp90 protein (high micromolar IC50). Modification of the novobiocin scaffold has led to more selective Hsp90 inhibitors. Novobiocin has also been shown to bind and activate the Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide transporter LptBFGC. The ATP binding pocket of polymerase theta is blocked by novobiocin resulting in a loss of ATPase activity. This results in the loss of microhomology-mediated end joining as a pathway for homologous recombination deficient cells to circumvent DNA damaging agents. The action of novobiocin is syngeristic with PARP inhibitors for reducing tumor size in a mouse model. == Structure == Novobiocin is an aminocoumarin. Novobiocin may be divided up into three entities; a benzoic acid derivative, a coumarin residue, and the sugar novobiose. X-ray crystallographic studies have found that the drug-receptor complex of Novobiocin and DNA Gyrase shows that ATP and Novobiocin have overlapping binding sites on the gyrase molecule. The overlap of the coumarin and ATP-binding sites is consistent with aminocoumarins being competitive inhibitors of the ATPase activity. === Structure–activity relationship === In structure activity relationship experiments it was found that removal of the carbamoyl group located on the novobiose sugar lead to a dramatic decrease in inhibitory activity of novobiocin. == Biosynthesis == This aminocoumarin antibiotic consists of three major substituents. The 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid moiety, known as ring A, is derived from prephenate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. The aminocoumarin moiety, known as ring B, is derived from L-tyrosine. The final component of novobiocin is the sugar derivative L-noviose, known as ring C, which is derived from glucose-1-phosphate. The biosynthetic gene cluster for novobiocin was identified by Heide and coworkers in 1999 (published 2000) from Streptomyces spheroides NCIB 11891. They identified 23 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and more than 11 other ORFs that may play a role in novobiocin biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of ring A (see Fig. 1) begins with prephenate which is a derived from the shikimic acid biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme NovF catalyzes the decarboxylation of prephenate while simultaneously reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to produce NADPH. Following this NovQ catalyzes the electrophilic substitution of the phenyl ring with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) otherwise known as prenylation. DMAPP can come from either the mevalonic acid pathway or the deoxyxylulose biosynthetic pathway. Next the 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate molecule is subjected to two oxidative decarboxylations by NovR and molecular oxygen. NovR is a non-heme iron oxygenase with a unique bifunctional catalysis. In the first stage both oxygens are incorporated from the molecular oxygen while in the second step only one is incorporated as determined by isotope labeling studies. This completes the formation of ring A. The biosynthesis of ring B (see Fig. 2) begins with the natural amino acid L-tyrosine. This is then adenylated and thioesterified onto the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) of NovH by ATP and NovH itself. NovI then further modifies this PCP bound molecule by oxidizing the β-position using NADPH and molecular oxygen. NovJ and NovK form a heterodimer of J2K2 which is the active form of this benzylic oxygenase. This process uses NADP+ as a hydride acceptor in the oxidation of the β-alcohol. This ketone will prefer to exist in its enol tautomer in solution. Next a still unidentified protein catalyzes the selective oxidation of the benzene (as shown in Fig. 2). Upon oxidation this intermediate will spontaneously lactonize to form the aromatic ring B and lose NovH in the process. The biosynthesis of L-noviose (ring C) is shown in Fig. 3. This process starts from glucose-1-phosphate where NovV takes dTTP and replaces the phosphate group with a dTDP group. NovT then oxidizes the 4-hydroxy group using NAD+. NovT also accomplishes a dehydroxylation of the 6 position of the sugar. NovW then epimerizes the 3 position of the sugar. The methylation of the 5 position is accomplished by NovU and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). Finally NovS reduces the 4 position again to achieve epimerization of that position from the starting glucose-1-phosphate using NADH. Rings A, B, and C are coupled together and modified to give the finished novobiocin molecule. Rings A and B are coupled together by the enzyme NovL using ATP to diphosphorylate the carboxylate group of ring A so that the carbonyl can be attacked by the amine group on ring B. The resulting compound is methylated by NovO and SAM prior to glycosylation. NovM adds ring C (L-noviose) to the hydroxyl group derived from tyrosine with the loss of dTDP. Another methylation is accomplished by NovP and SAM at the 4 position of the L-noviose sugar. This methylation allows NovN to carbamylate the 3 position of the sugar as shown in Fig. 4 completing the biosynthesis of novobiocin. == References == == External links == Novobiocin bound to proteins in the PDB",Streptonivicin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.180879816180095e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0011820956133306026), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860560968518257)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novobiocin,https://www.chemeurope.com/en/encyclopedia/Novobiocin.html,https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Novobiocin ', [])"
3722,"('Agomelatine', 'Thymanax', 'Valdoxan', 'N-[2-(7-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)ethyl]acetamide', 'N-(2-(7-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)ethyl)acetamide')",Medical,"Agomelatine, sold under the brand names Valdoxan and Thymanax, among others, is an atypical antidepressant most commonly used to treat major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. One review found that it is as effective as other antidepressants with similar discontinuation rates overall but fewer discontinuations due to side effects. Another review also found it was similarly effective to many other antidepressants. Common side effects include headaches, nausea, and dizziness, which usually subside in the first few weeks, as well as liver problems – due to the potential effect on the liver, blood tests before= treatment initiation, at specific time-points after initiation, and after dose increase is recommended. Its use is not recommended in people with dementia, or who are under the age of 18 or over 75. There is tentative evidence that it may have fewer side effects than some other antidepressants. It acts by blocking certain serotonin receptors and activating melatonin receptors. Agomelatine was approved for medical use in Europe in 2009 and Australia in 2010. Its use is not approved in the United States and efforts to get approval were ended in 2011. It was developed by the pharmaceutical company Servier. == Medical uses == === Major depressive disorder === Agomelatine is used for the treatment of major depressive episodes in adults in Europe and Australia. Ten placebo controlled trials have been performed to investigate the short term efficacy of agomelatine in major depressive disorder. At the end of treatment, significant efficacy was demonstrated in six of the ten short-term double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Two were considered ""failed"" trials, as comparators of established efficacy failed to differentiate from placebo. Efficacy was also observed in more severely depressed patients in all positive placebo-controlled studies. The maintenance of antidepressant efficacy was demonstrated in a relapse prevention study. One meta-analysis found agomelatine to be as effective as standard antidepressants, with an effect size (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference) of 0.24. In 2018, a systematic review and network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs showed agomelatine to be one of the most effective and one of only two medications found to be more tolerable than placebo. A meta-analysis found that agomelatine is effective in treating severe depression. Its antidepressant effect is greater for more severe depression. In people with a greater baseline score (>30 on HAMD17 scale), the agomelatine-placebo difference was of 4.53 points. Controlled studies in humans have shown that agomelatine is at least as effective as the SSRI antidepressants paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and fluoxetine in the treatment of major depression. A 2018 meta-study comparing 21 antidepressants found agomelatine was one of the more tolerable, yet effective antidepressants. However, the body of research on agomelatine has been substantially affected by publication bias, prompting analyses which take into account both published and unpublished studies. These have confirmed that agomelatine is approximately as effective as more commonly used antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs), but some qualified this as ""marginally clinically relevant"", being only slightly above placebo. According to a 2013 review, agomelatine did not seem to provide an advantage in efficacy over other antidepressants for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. === Generalized anxiety disorder === Agomelatine is also approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults in Australia. It has been found more effective than placebo in the treatment of in a number of short-term double-blind placebo-controlled studies and in long term relapse prevention. Use of agomelatine in GAD is off-label in Europe. Agomelatine has been evaluated in a number of other off-label indications besides GAD. === Use in special populations === It is not recommended in Europe or Australia for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy. However, a recent 12 week study first reported in September 2020, and published in 2022 showed greater efficacy vs. placebo for agomelatine 25 mg per day in youth age 7–17 years and an acceptable tolerability profile with similar efficacy to fluoxetine. Only limited data is available on use in elderly people ≥ 75 years old with major depressive episodes. It is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. == Contraindications == Agomelatine is contraindicated in patients with kidney or liver impairment. According to information disclosed by Servier in 2012, guidelines for the follow-up of patients treated with Valdoxan have been modified in concert with the European Medicines Agency. As some patients may experience increased levels of liver enzymes in their blood during treatment with Valdoxan, doctors have to run laboratory tests to check that the liver is working properly at the initiation of the treatment and then periodically during treatment, and subsequently decide whether to pursue the treatment or not. No relevant modification in agomelatine pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with severe renal impairment has been observed. However, only limited clinical data on its use in depressed patients with severe or moderate renal impairment with major depressive episodes is available. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing agomelatine to these patients. == Adverse effects == Agomelatine does not alter daytime vigilance and memory in healthy volunteers. In depressed patients, treatment with the drug increased slow-wave sleep without modification of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep amount or REM latency. Agomelatine also induced an advance of the time of sleep onset and of minimum heart rate. From the first week of treatment, onset of sleep and the quality of sleep were significantly improved without daytime clumsiness as assessed by patients. Agomelatine appears to cause fewer sexual side effects and discontinuation effects than paroxetine. Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include Uncommon (0.1–1%) adverse effects include Rare (0.01–0.1%) adverse effects include Excepting effects on the liver, the above adverse effects were usually mild to moderate and occurred in the first two weeks of treatment, subsiding thereafter. 36.1% of patients with elevated enzyme levels normalize on their own without discontinuing agomelatine. For those who choose to discontinue the drug, the median time to liver enzyme level recovery is 14 days. A 2019 study found no difference in rates of acute liver injury between users of citalopram and agomelatine, though this rate could be decreased due to the precautionary liver enzyme monitoring in the European Union. The EU recommends checking liver enzyme levels before treatment initiation, and then after 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks and following a dose increase. === Dependence and withdrawal === No dosage tapering is needed on treatment discontinuation. Agomelatine has no abuse potential as measured in healthy volunteer studies. == Overdose == Agomelatine is expected to be relatively safe in overdose. == Interactions == Agomelatine is a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Inhibitors of these enzymes, e.g. the SSRI antidepressant fluvoxamine, reduce its clearance and can lead to an increase in agomelatine exposure, and possibly serotonin syndrome. There is also the potential for agomelatine to interact with alcohol to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Agomelatine acts as a highly potent and selective melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptor agonist (Ki = 0.1 nM and 0.12 nM, respectively) and also as a relatively weak serotonin 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist (Ki = 660 nM and 631 nM, respectively; ~6,000-fold lower than for the melatonin receptors). It is a silent antagonist rather than an inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. The drug has negligible affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor or for a variety of other targets. By antagonizing the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, agomelatine has been found to disinhibit and increase norepinephrine and dopamine release in the frontal cortex in animals, although notably not in the striatum or nucleus accumbens. In contrast to agomelatine, other serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonists and inverse agonists, such as SB-242084 and SB-206553, have been found to increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the nucleus accumbens. These differences may in part be related to constitutive activity of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor and resulting differences between neutral antagonists and inverse agonists of the receptor. In addition, there are multiple isoforms of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor with different properties. In other studies, while agomelatine alone did not affect the firing rates of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, it abolished the inhibition of these neurons by the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor agonist Ro60-0175. Due to the increase in norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the frontal cortex with agomelatine, the drug has sometimes been referred to as a norepinephrine–dopamine disinhibitor (NDDI). Although agomelatine is widely claimed to act as a serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, the clinical significance of this action has been disputed by some researchers. Unlike with other serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonists, therapeutic doses of agomelatine fail to acutely increase slow-wave sleep in humans. Additionally, no receptor occupancy studies of agomelatine have been conducted in humans to demonstrate significant occupancy of serotonin 5-HT2C receptors at therapeutic doses. Agomelatine has shown an antidepressant-like effect in animal models of depression (learned helplessness test, behavioral despair test, chronic mild stress) as well as in models with circadian rhythm desynchronisation and in models related to stress and anxiety. Agomelatine has been found to resynchronize circadian rhythms in animal models of delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). In humans, agomelatine has positive phase-shifting properties; it induces a phase advance of sleep, body temperature decline, and melatonin onset. === Pharmacokinetics === The main route of metabolism for agomelatine is hepatic through the CYP1A2 (90%) and CYP2C9/19 (10%); co-administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine) is contraindicated. Agomelatine is well-absorbed with oral administration (≥80%), but it has very low oral bioavailability (~1%) due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The elimination half-life of agomelatine is 1 to 2 hours. The half-life of agomelatine does not change with repeated administration. There is no accumulation of agomelatine with continuous administration. == Chemistry == === Structure === The chemical structure of agomelatine is very similar to that of melatonin. Where melatonin has an indole ring system, agomelatine has a naphthalene bioisostere instead. === Synthesis === == History == Agomelatine was discovered and developed by the European pharmaceutical company Servier Laboratories Ltd. Servier continued to develop the drug and conduct phase III trials in the European Union. In March 2005, Servier submitted agomelatine to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) under the trade names Valdoxan and Thymanax. On 27 July 2006, the Committee for Medical Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA recommended a refusal of the marketing authorisation. The major concern was that efficacy had not been sufficiently shown, while there were no special concerns about side effects. In September 2007, Servier submitted a new marketing application to the EMA. In March 2006, Servier announced it had sold the rights to market agomelatine in the United States to Novartis. It was undergoing several phase III clinical trials in the US, and until October 2011 Novartis listed the drug as scheduled for submission to the FDA no earlier than 2012. However, the development for the US market was discontinued in October 2011, when the results from the last of those trials became available. It received approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for marketing in the European Union in February 2009 and approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for marketing in Australia in August 2010. == Research == === Circadian rhythm sleep disorders === Agomelatine has been investigated for its effects on sleep regulation due its actions as a melatonin receptor agonist. Studies report various improvements in general quality of sleep metrics, as well as benefits in circadian rhythm sleep disorders. However, research is very limited (e.g., case reports) and agomelatine is not approved for use in the treatment of sleep disorders. === Seasonal affective disorder === A 2019 Cochrane review suggested no recommendations of agomelatine in support of, or against, its use to treat individuals with seasonal affective disorder. == See also == SPT-320 (LYT-320) – an experimental agomelatine prodrug == References == == External links == Genf interaction table- https://www.hug.ch/sites/interhug/files/structures/pharmacologie_et_toxicologie_cliniques/carte_cytochromes_2016_final.pdf",Valdoxan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.276871418871451e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00033802041434682906)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Partial inhibition of DNA synthesis occurs at anisomycin concentrations that effect 95% inhibition of protein synthesis. Anisomycin can activate stress-activated protein kinases, MAP kinase and other signal transduction pathways. == Pharmacology == Anisomycin interferes with protein and DNA synthesis by inhibiting peptidyl transferase or the 80S ribosome system. Anisomycin is also mentioned as a potential psychiatric drug, as it may inhibit the consolidation of new context-specific long-term memories, as well as long time consolidated memories rendered labile through reactivation. Injection of anisomycin into the hippocampus has been proposed for selective removal of memories. == Biosynthesis == Because of anisomycin's wide use as a protein synthesis inhibitor, there have been many studies centered on the biosynthesis of anisomycin. One study by Butler in 1974 proposed possible precursors to this natural product. Fermentation of Streptomyces with labeled amino acids was followed by a degradation of the radioactive anisomycin and deacetylanisomycin products to determine the locations of the labeled carbons. Although its pyrrolidine-based structure suggests that it is derived from proline, the results from the experiments indicated that tyrosine, glycine, methionine, and acetate are the primary precursors for the biosynthesis of anisomycin. Tyrosine and, to a limited degree, phenylalanine, contribute to C-2 of the pyrrolidine ring. Methionine is likely responsible for the methylation of the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Glycine or acetate account for C-4 and C-5 on the pyrrolidine ring. It was noted that deacetylanisomycin was a prominent product in the first few days of fermentation, suggesting that acetylation of the C-3 hydroxyl group by acetyl Co-A is the final step in the biosynthesis of anisomycin. The source of the nitrogen within the ring and C-3 were undetermined. However, C-3 is not likely to be provided by the carboxylic acid group of tyrosine because tracking of radioactivity indicated that tyrosine undergoes decarboxylation during fermentation. == Other uses == Anisomycin is used as a component of Martin Lewis agar, an in vitro diagnostic product which is used extensively in the United States for the selective isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis. The antimicrobial can also be used in buffered charcoal yeast extract media for the selective isolation of Legionella species. == See also == Cycloheximide == References ==",Flagecidin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.02732020430266857), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.04859793186187744), (' INDUSTR', -0.00020580526324920356), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.015336795710027218), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -0.06204850971698761), ('ĠINDU', -0.016771623864769936), ('ST', -1.6689160474925302e-05), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0033718657214194536)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisomycin,https://www.selleckchem.com/products/anisomycin.html,https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000841 ', [])"
3725,"('(z)-capsaicin', 'Zucapsaicin', 'Civamide', 'Cis-capsaicin', '(z)-n-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-8-methylnon-6-enamide')","Food, Medical","Zucapsaicin (Civanex) is a medication used to treat osteoarthritis of the knee and other neuropathic pain. Zucapsaicin is a member of phenols and a member of methoxybenzenes. It is a modulator of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV-1), also known as the vanilloid or capsaicin receptor 1 that reduces pain, and improves articular functions. It is the cis-isomer of capsaicin. Civamide, manufactured by Winston Pharmaceuticals, is produced in formulations for oral, nasal, and topical use (patch and cream). Zucapsaicin has been tested for treatment of a variety of conditions associated with ongoing nerve pain. This includes herpes simplex infections; cluster headaches and migraine; and knee osteoarthritis. It was approved by the Health Canada in 2010 as topical cream sold under the brand name Zuacta. It has a melting point of 71.5–74.5 °C. == Pharmacology == Zucapsaicin mediates an antinociceptive action via acting as an agonist at TRPV1. TRPV1 play an important physiological role of transducing chemical, mechanical and thermal stimuli as well as pain transduction, and participate in pain modulation and perception. They are mainly distributed in C sensory nerve fibers as well as Aẟ fibers to transmit sensory information involving inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and activation of these channels releases somatostatin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and other neuropeptides (neurokinin A, kassinin), leading to neurogenic inflammation [A19720]. Zucapsaicin is also reported to affect the peptidergic afferent neurons via a desensitization mechanism to decrease the levels of dorsal root ganglia and sciatic calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) [L877]. == Pharmacodynamics == Zucapsaicin mediates an antinociceptive action via acting as an agonist at TRPV1. TRPV1 play an important physiological role of transducing chemical, mechanical and thermal stimuli as well as pain transduction, and participate in pain modulation and perception.

Zucapsaicin is also reported to affect the peptidergic afferent neurons via a desensitization mechanism to decrease the levels of dorsal root ganglia and sciatic calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). == Mechanism of action == Zucapsaicin excites and desensitizes C-fibers via agonist at TRPV1 on nociceptive neurons. It binds to intracellular sites and initially stimulates the channels, causing burning sensation. The mechanism of pharmacological action of zucapsaicin has not been fully understood yet. It is suggested that this compound, similarly to its trans isomer, is an agonist of the vanilloid receptor VR1 (TRPV1) and a neuronal calcium channel blocker. Capsaicin is able to excite and desensitize C-fibers. As such, it is not only able to cause pain, but also exhibit analgesic properties. Initially, it stimulates TRPV1, which is responsible for a burning sensation. This effect is followed by a longlasting refractory state – ‘desensitization’ – during which the previously excited sensory neurons become unresponsive to capsaicin and other stimuli. It was shown that desensitization and tachyphylaxis of TRPV1 channels contribute to capsaicin-induced pain relief. Desensitization of TRPV1 represents the main mechanism of its inhibitory function. Three distinct pathways of capsaicin-induced desensitization have been described: i) activation of calcineurin, which results in dephosphorylation of TRPV1; ii) activation of phospholipase C with the subsequent phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis (rather controversial) and iii) activation of calcium-dependent protein kinase C isoforms and subsequent channel phosphorylation. Desensitization involves both tachyphylaxis (short-term desensitization) and long-term, persistent, desensitization. It is suggested that the downregulation of proalgesic substances (such as SP) and upregulation of analgesic peptides are implicated in desensitization. The exhaustion of SP reserves renders neurons desensitized and refractory. These mechanisms of desensitization are not fully understood. It is thought that the short-term desensitization is related to capsaicin's ability to block the intra-axonal transport of NGF, SP and somatostatin. The desensitization is a reversible phenomenon. It begins a few hours after capsaicin application and may last even several weeks. The reversible desensitization was found useful in the treatment of pain, whereas the site-specific ablation of sensory nerves transmitting pain stimuli is a promising approach (‘molecular scalpel’) to achieve a permanent pain relief in patients suffering from bone cancer pain or HIV-induced neuropathies. Desensitization and depletion of pronociceptive neurotransmitters induce chemical denervation with a loss of function, which is clinically used in osteoarthritis, diabetic neuropathy, psoriasis and others. In dorsal root ganglia and the sciatic nerve, zucapsaicin decreases levels of SP and CGRP, indicating that it influences peptidergic afferent neurons via a desensitization mechanism[41]. When administered topically, the intended targets for zucapsaicin are the neurons that innervate the local area of application. These neurons transmit pain toward the CNS. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Zucapsaicin displays low systemic absorption and localizes at the area of application. In animal studies, systemic absorption is 0.075%. === Metabolism === In vitro studies demonstrates weak to moderate inhibitory effects on various cytochrome P450 enzymes, although not clinically significant due to low systemic absorption. === Route of elimination === In rat studies, zucapsaicin and its metabolites are slowly excreted into urine and feces (up to 2/3), with minimal elimination via exhalation following dermal administration. === Half life === In rats, the elimination half life of zucapsaicin and its metabolites is approximately 7 to 11 hours. == Toxicity == Most common adverse effects involved application site reactions such as transient burning and warm sensation. Other adverse effects observed in clinical trials are eye irritation, arthralgia, aggravated osteoarthritis, burning sensation, headache, cough and sneezing. Oral LD50 in mouse is >87.5 mg/kg in male and <60 mg/kg in females.

3726,"('Capsaicin', '(e)-capsaicin', 'Zostrix', 'Qutenza', 'Styptysat')","Food, Medical","Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) (, rarely ) is an active component of chili peppers, which are plants belonging to the genus Capsicum. It is a potent irritant for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related amides (capsaicinoids) are produced as secondary metabolites by chili peppers, likely as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi. Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, highly pungent (i.e., spicy) crystalline solid. == Natural function == Capsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes and, to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus Capsicum. The seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith of the inner wall, where the seeds are attached. The seeds of Capsicum plants are dispersed predominantly by birds. In birds, the TRPV1 channel does not respond to capsaicin or related chemicals, but mammalian TRPV1 is very sensitive to it. This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can germinate later, whereas mammals have molar teeth that destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating. Thus, natural selection may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse. There is also evidence that capsaicin may have evolved as an anti-fungal agent. The fungal pathogen Fusarium, which is known to infect wild chilies and thereby reduce seed viability, is deterred by capsaicin, which thus limits this form of predispersal seed mortality. The vanillotoxin-containing venom of a certain tarantula species (Psalmopoeus cambridgei) activates the same pathway of pain as is activated by capsaicin, an example of a shared pathway in both plant and animal anti-mammalian defense. == Uses == === Food === Because of the burning sensation caused by capsaicin when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, it is commonly used in food products to provide added spiciness or ""heat"" (piquancy), usually in the form of spices such as chili powder and paprika. In high concentrations, capsaicin will also cause a burning effect on other sensitive areas, such as skin or eyes. The degree of heat found within a food is often measured on the Scoville scale. There has long been a demand for capsaicin-spiced products like chili pepper, and hot sauces such as Tabasco sauce and Mexican salsa. It is common for people to experience pleasurable and even euphoric effects from ingesting capsaicin. Folklore among self-described ""chiliheads"" attribute this to pain-stimulated release of endorphins, a different mechanism from the local receptor overload that makes capsaicin effective as a topical analgesic. === Research and pharmaceutical use === Capsaicin is used as an analgesic in topical ointments and dermal patches to relieve pain, typically in concentrations between 0.025% and 0.1%. It may be applied in cream form for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of muscles and joints associated with arthritis, backache, strains and sprains, often in compounds with other rubefacients. It is also used to reduce the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as post-herpetic neuralgia caused by shingles. A capsaicin transdermal patch (Qutenza) for the management of this particular therapeutic indication (pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia) was approved in 2009, as a therapeutic by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union. A subsequent application to the FDA for Qutenza to be used as an analgesic in HIV neuralgia was refused. One 2017 review of clinical studies having limited quality found that high-dose topical capsaicin (8%) compared with control (0.4% capsaicin) provided moderate to substantial pain relief from post-herpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and diabetic neuropathy. Although capsaicin creams have been used to treat psoriasis for reduction of itching, a review of six clinical trials involving topical capsaicin for treatment of pruritus concluded there was insufficient evidence of effect. Oral capsaicin decreases LDL cholesterol levels moderately. There is insufficient clinical evidence to determine the role of ingested capsaicin on several human disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. === Pepper spray and pests === Capsaicinoids are also an active ingredient in riot control and personal defense pepper spray agents. When the spray comes in contact with skin, especially eyes or mucous membranes, it produces pain and breathing difficulty in the affected individual. Capsaicin is also used to deter pests, specifically mammalian pests. Targets of capsaicin repellants include voles, deer, rabbits, squirrels, bears, insects, and attacking dogs. Ground or crushed dried chili pods may be used in birdseed to deter rodents, taking advantage of the insensitivity of birds to capsaicin. The Elephant Pepper Development Trust claims that using chili peppers as a barrier crop can be a sustainable means for rural African farmers to deter elephants from eating their crops. An article published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Health Part B in 2006 states that ""Although hot chili pepper extract is commonly used as a component of household and garden insect-repellent formulas, it is not clear that the capsaicinoid elements of the extract are responsible for its repellency."" The first pesticide product using solely capsaicin as the active ingredient was registered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1962. === Equestrian sports === Capsaicin is a banned substance in equestrian sports because of its hypersensitizing and pain-relieving properties. At the show jumping events of the 2008 Summer Olympics, four horses tested positive for capsaicin, which resulted in disqualification. == Irritant effects == === Acute health effects === Capsaicin is a strong irritant requiring proper protective goggles, respirators, and proper hazardous material-handling procedures. Capsaicin takes effect upon skin contact (irritant, sensitizer), eye contact (irritant), ingestion, and inhalation (lung irritant, lung sensitizer). The LD50 in mice is 47.2 mg/kg. Painful exposures to capsaicin-containing peppers are among the most common plant-related exposures presented to poison centers. They cause burning or stinging pain to the skin and, if ingested in large amounts by adults or small amounts by children, can produce nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and burning diarrhea. Eye exposure produces intense tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, and blepharospasm. === Treatment after exposure === The primary treatment is removal of the offending substance. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items. When capsaicin is ingested, cold milk may be an effective way to relieve the burning sensation due to caseins in milk, and the water of milk acts as a surfactant, allowing the capsaicin to form an emulsion with it. === Weight loss and regain === As of 2007, there was no evidence showing that weight loss is directly correlated with ingesting capsaicin. Well-designed clinical research had not been performed because the pungency of capsaicin in prescribed doses under research prevented subjects from complying in the study. A 2014 meta-analysis of further trials found weak evidence that consuming capsaicin before a meal might slightly reduce the amount of food consumed, and might drive food preference toward carbohydrates. === Peptic ulcer === One 2006 review concluded that capsaicin may relieve symptoms of a peptic ulcer rather than being a cause of it. === Death === Ingestion of high quantities of capsaicin can be deadly, particularly in people with heart problems. Even healthy young people can suffer adverse health effects like myocardial infarction after ingestion of capsaicin capsules. == Mechanism of action == The burning and painful sensations associated with capsaicin result from ""defunctionalization"" of nociceptor nerve fibers by causing a topical hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. As a member of the vanilloid family, capsaicin binds to a receptor on nociceptor fibers called the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1). TRPV1, which can also be stimulated with heat, protons and physical abrasion, permits cations to pass through the cell membrane when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to send impulses to the brain. By binding to TRPV1 receptors, capsaicin produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, such as warming, tingling, itching, or stinging, explaining why capsaicin is described as an irritant on the skin and eyes or by ingestion. Clarifying the mechanisms of capsaicin effects on skin nociceptors was part of awarding the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, as it led to the discovery of skin sensors for temperature and touch, and identification of the single gene causing sensitivity to capsaicin. == History == The compound was first extracted in impure form in 1816 by Christian Friedrich Bucholz (1770–1818). In 1873 German pharmacologist Rudolf Buchheim (1820–1879) and in 1878 the Hungarian doctor Endre Hőgyes stated that ""capsicol"" (partially purified capsaicin) caused the burning feeling when in contact with mucous membranes and increased secretion of gastric acid. == Capsaicinoids == The most commonly occurring capsaicinoids are capsaicin (69%), dihydrocapsaicin (22%), nordihydrocapsaicin (7%), homocapsaicin (1%), and homodihydrocapsaicin (1%). Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin (both 16.0 million SHU) are the most pungent capsaicinoids. Nordihydrocapsaicin (9.1 million SHU), homocapsaicin and homodihydrocapsaicin (both 8.6 million SHU) are about half as hot. There are six natural capsaicinoids (table below). Although vanillylamide of n-nonanoic acid (Nonivamide, VNA, also PAVA) is produced synthetically for most applications, it does occur naturally in Capsicum species. == Biosynthesis == === History === The general biosynthetic pathway of capsaicin and other capsaicinoids was elucidated in the 1960s by Bennett and Kirby, and Leete and Louden. Radiolabeling studies identified phenylalanine and valine as the precursors to capsaicin. Enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and their function in capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified later by Fujiwake et al., and Sukrasno and Yeoman. Suzuki et al. are responsible for identifying leucine as another precursor to the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. It was discovered in 1999 that pungency of chili peppers is related to higher transcription levels of key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase. Similar studies showed high transcription levels in the placenta of chili peppers with high pungency of genes responsible for branched-chain fatty acid pathway. === Biosynthetic pathway === Plants exclusively of the genus Capsicum produce capsaicinoids, which are alkaloids. Capsaicin is believed to be synthesized in the interlocular septum of chili peppers and depends on the gene AT3, which resides at the pun1 locus, and which encodes a putative acyltransferase. Biosynthesis of the capsaicinoids occurs in the glands of the pepper fruit where capsaicin synthase condenses vanillylamine from the phenylpropanoid pathway with an acyl-CoA moiety produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. Capsaicin is the most abundant capsaicinoid found in the genus Capsicum, but at least ten other capsaicinoid variants exist. Phenylalanine supplies the precursor to the phenylpropanoid pathway while leucine or valine provide the precursor for the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. To produce capsaicin, 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-CoA is produced by the branched-chain fatty acid pathway and condensed with vanillylamine. Other capsaicinoids are produced by the condensation of vanillylamine with various acyl-CoA products from the branched-chain fatty acid pathway, which is capable of producing a variety of acyl-CoA moieties of different chain length and degrees of unsaturation. All condensation reactions between the products of the phenylpropanoid and branched-chain fatty acid pathway are mediated by capsaicin synthase to produce the final capsaicinoid product. == Evolution == The Capsicum genus split from Solanaceae 19.6 million years ago, 5.4 million years after the appearance of Solanaceae, and is native only to the Americas. Chilies only started to quickly evolve in the past 2 million years into markedly different species. This evolution can be partially attributed to a key compound found in peppers, 8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide, otherwise known as capsaicin. Capsaicin evolved similarly across species of chilies that produce capsaicin. Its evolution over the course of centuries is due to genetic drift and natural selection, across the genus Capsicum. Despite the fact that chilies within the Capsicum genus are found in diverse environments, the capsaicin found within them all exhibit similar properties that serve as defensive and adaptive features. Capsaicin evolved to preserve the fitness of peppers against fungi infections, insects, and granivorous mammals. === Antifungal properties === Capsaicin acts as an antifungal agent in four primary ways. First, capsaicin inhibits the metabolic rate of the cells that make up the fungal biofilm. This inhibits the area and growth rate of the fungus, since the biofilm creates an area where a fungus can grow and adhere to the chili in which capsaicin is present. Capsaicin also inhibits fungal hyphae formation, which impacts the amount of nutrients that the rest of the fungal body can receive. Thirdly, capsaicin disrupts the structure of fungal cells and the fungal cell membranes. This has consequential negative impacts on the integrity of fungal cells and their ability to survive and proliferate. Additionally, the ergosterol synthesis of growing fungi decreases in relation to the amount of capsaicin present in the growth area. This impacts the fungal cell membrane, and how it is able to reproduce and adapt to stressors in its environment. === Insecticidal properties === Capsaicin deters insects in multiple ways. The first is by deterring insects from laying their eggs on the pepper due to the effects capsaicin has on these insects. Capsaicin can cause intestinal dysplasia upon ingestion, disrupting insect metabolism and causing damage to cell membranes within the insect. This in turn disrupts the standard feeding response of insects. === Seed dispersion and deterrents against granivorous mammals === Granivorous mammals pose a risk to the propagation of chilies because their molars grind the seeds of chilies, rendering them unable to grow into new chili plants. As a result, modern chilies evolved defense mechanisms to mitigate the risk of granivorous mammals. While capsaicin is present at some level in every part of the pepper, the chemical has its highest concentration in the tissue near the seeds within chilies. Birds are able to eat chilies, then disperse the seeds in their excrement, enabling propagation. === Adaptation to varying moisture levels === Capsaicin is a potent defense mechanism for chilies, but it does come at a cost. Varying levels of capsaicin in chilies currently appear to be caused by an evolutionary split between surviving in dry environments, and having defense mechanisms against fungal growth, insects, and granivorous mammals. Capsaicin synthesis in chilies places a strain on their water resources. This directly affects their fitness, as it has been observed that standard concentration of capsaicin of peppers in high moisture environments in the seeds and pericarps of the peppers reduced the seeds production by 50%. == See also == Allicin, the active piquant flavor chemical in uncooked garlic, and to a lesser extent onions (see those articles for discussion of other chemicals in them relating to pungency, and eye irritation) Capsazepine, capsaicin antagonist Iodoresiniferatoxin, an ultrapotent capsaicin antagonist derived from Resiniferatoxin Naga Viper pepper, Bhut Jolokia Pepper, Carolina Reaper, Trinidad Moruga Scorpion; some of the world's most capsaicin-rich fruits Piperine the active flavor chemical in black pepper List of capsaicinoids == References == === Notes === == Further reading == == External links == Capsaicin General Fact Sheet – National Pesticide Information Center Fire and Spice: The molecular basis for flavor",Qutenza,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.01418642420321703), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00012356207298580557), (' FOOD', -0.0005936628440394998)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.09668027609586716), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -0.002532372483983636), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0023865809198468924), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2521651089191437)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/qutenza.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Qutenza Patches: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/qutenza.html?utm_source=openai')])"

These may involve bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Acinetobacter. It comes in two forms: colistimethate sodium can be injected into a vein, injected into a muscle, or inhaled, and colistin sulfate is mainly applied to the skin or taken by mouth. Colistimethate sodium is a prodrug; it is produced by the reaction of colistin with formaldehyde and sodium bisulfite, which leads to the addition of a sulfomethyl group to the primary amines of colistin. Colistimethate sodium is less toxic than colistin when administered parenterally. In aqueous solutions, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a complex mixture of partially sulfomethylated derivatives, as well as colistin. Resistance to colistin began to appear as of 2015. Common side effects of the injectable form include kidney problems and neurological problems. Other serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, muscle weakness, and Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea. The inhaled form may result in constriction of the bronchioles. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the fetus. Colistin is in the polymyxin class of medications. It works by breaking down the cytoplasmic membrane, which generally results in bacterial cell death. Colistin was discovered in 1947 and colistimethate sodium was approved for medical use in the United States in 1970. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies colistin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. It is derived from bacteria of the genus Paenibacillus. == Medical uses == === Antibacterial spectrum === Colistin has been effective in treating infections caused by Pseudomonas, Escherichia, and Klebsiella species. The following represents minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms: Escherichia coli: 0.12–128 μg/mL Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.25–128 μg/mL Pseudomonas aeruginosa: ≤0.06–16 μg/mL For example, colistin in combination with other drugs is used to attack P. aeruginosa biofilm infection in lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. Biofilms have a low-oxygen environment below the surface where bacteria are metabolically inactive, and colistin is highly effective in this environment. However, P. aeruginosa reside in the top layers of the biofilm, where they remain metabolically active. This is because surviving tolerant cells migrate to the top of the biofilm via pili and form new aggregates via quorum sensing. === Administration and dosage === ==== Forms ==== Two forms of colistin are available commercially: colistin sulfate and colistimethate sodium (colistin methanesulfonate sodium, colistin sulfomethate sodium). Colistin sulfate is cationic; colistimethate sodium is anionic. Colistin sulfate is stable, whereas colistimethate sodium is readily hydrolysed to a variety of methanesulfonated derivatives. Colistin sulfate and colistimethate sodium are eliminated from the body by different routes. With respect to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, colistimethate is the inactive prodrug of colistin. The two drugs are not interchangeable. Colistimethate sodium may be used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, and it has come into recent use for treating multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection, although resistant forms have been reported. Colistimethate sodium has also been given intrathecally and intraventricularly in Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa meningitis and ventriculitis Some studies have indicated that colistin may be useful for treating infections caused by carbapenem-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii. Colistin sulfate may be used to treat intestinal infections, or to suppress colonic flora. Colistin sulfate is also used in topical creams, powders, and otic solutions. Colistin A (polymyxin E1) and colistin B (polymyxin E2) can be purified individually to research and study their effects and potencies as separate compounds. ==== Dosage ==== Colistin sulfate and colistimethate sodium may both be given intravenously, but the dosing is complicated. The different labeling of the parenteral products of colistin methanesulfonate in different parts of the world was noted by Li et al. Colistimethate sodium manufactured by Xellia (Colomycin injection) is prescribed in international units, whereas colistimethate sodium manufactured by Parkdale Pharmaceuticals (Coly-Mycin M Parenteral) is prescribed in milligrams of colistin base: Colomycin 1,000,000 units is 80 mg colistimethate; Coly-mycin M 150 mg colistin base is 360 mg colistimethate or 4,500,000 units. Because colistin was introduced into clinical practice over 50 years ago, it was never subject to the regulations that modern drugs are subject to, and therefore there is no standardised dosing of colistin and no detailed trials on pharmacology or pharmacokinetics. The optimal dosing of colistin for most infections is therefore unknown. Colomycin has a recommended intravenous dose of 1 to 2 million units three times daily for patients weighing 60 kg or more with normal renal function. Coly-Mycin has a recommended dose of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg colistin base a day, which is equivalent to 6 to 12 mg/kg colistimethate sodium per day. For a 60 kg man, therefore, the recommended dose for Colomycin is 240 to 480 mg of colistimethate sodium, yet the recommended dose for Coly-Mycin is 360 to 720 mg of colistimethate sodium. Likewise, the recommended ""maximum"" dose for each preparation is different (480 mg for Colomycin and 720 mg for Coly-Mycin). Each country has different generic preparations of colistin, and the recommended dose depends on the manufacturer. This complete absence of any regulation or standardisation of dose makes intravenous colistin dosing difficult for the physician. Colistin has been used in combination with rifampicin; evidence of in vitro synergy exists, and the combination has been used successfully in patients. There is also in vitro evidence of synergy for colistimethate sodium used in combination with other antipseudomonal antibiotics. Colistimethate sodium aerosol (Promixin; Colomycin Injection) is used to treat pulmonary infections, especially in cystic fibrosis. In the UK, the recommended adult dose is 1–2 million units (80–160 mg) nebulised colistimethate twice daily. Nebulized colistin has also been used to decrease severe exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. === Resistance === Resistance to colistin is rare, but has been described. As of 2017, no agreement exists about how to define colistin resistance. The Société Française de Microbiologie uses a MIC cut-off of 2 mg/L, whereas the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy sets a MIC cutoff of 4 mg/L or less as sensitive, and 8 mg/L or more as resistant. No standards for describing colistin sensitivity are given in the United States. The first known colistin-resistance gene in a plasmid which can be transferred between bacterial strains is mcr-1. It was found in 2011 in China on a pig farm where colistin is routinely used and became publicly known in November 2015. The presence of this plasmid-borne gene was confirmed starting December 2015 in South-East Asia, several European countries, and the United States. It is found in certain strains of the bacteria Paenibacillus polymyxa. India reported the first detailed colistin-resistance study, which mapped 13 colistin-resistant infections recorded over 18 months. It concluded that pan-drug-resistant infections, particularly those in the bloodstream, have a higher mortality. Multiple other cases were reported from other Indian hospitals. Although resistance to polymyxins is generally less than 10%, it is more frequent in the Mediterranean and South-East Asia (Korea and Singapore), where colistin resistance rates are increasing. Colistin-resistant E. coli was identified in the United States in May 2016. A recent review from 2016 to 2021 fount that E. coli is the dominant species harbouring mcr genes. Plasmid - mediated colistin resistance is also conferred upon other species that carry different genes resistant to antibiotics. The emergence of the mcr-9 gene is quite remarkable. Use of colistin to treat Acinetobacter baumannii infections has led to the development of resistant bacterial strains. They have also developed resistance to the antimicrobial compounds LL-37 and lysozyme, produced by the human immune system. This cross-resistance is caused by gain-of-function mutations to the pmrB gene, which controls the expression of lipid A phosphoethanolamine transferases (similar to mcr-1) located on the bacterial chromosome. Similar results have been obtained with mcr-1 positive E. coli, which became better at surviving a mixture of animal antimicrobial peptides in vitro and more effective at killing infected caterpillars. Not all resistance to colistin and some other antibiotics is due to the presence of resistance genes. Heteroresistance, the phenomenon wherein apparently genetically identical microbes exhibit a range of resistance to an antibiotic, has been observed in some species of Enterobacter since at least 2016 and was observed in some strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2017–2018. In some cases this phenomenon has significant clinical consequences. ==== Inherently resistant ==== ==== Variable resistance ==== Aeromonas Vibrio Prevotella Fusobacterium Escherichia coli == Adverse reactions == The main toxicities described with intravenous treatment are nephrotoxicity (damage to the kidneys) and neurotoxicity (damage to the nerves), but this may reflect the very high doses given, which are much higher than the doses currently recommended by any manufacturer and for which no adjustment was made for pre-existing renal disease. Neuro- and nephrotoxic effects appear to be transient and subside on discontinuation of therapy or reduction in dose. At a dose of 160 mg colistimethate IV every eight hours, very little nephrotoxicity is seen. Indeed, colistin appears to have less toxicity than the aminoglycosides that subsequently replaced it, and it has been used for extended periods up to six months with no ill effects. Colistin-induced nephrotoxicity is particularly likely in patients with hypoalbuminemia. The main toxicity described with aerosolised treatment is bronchospasm, which can be treated or prevented with the use of β2-adrenergic receptor agonists such as salbutamol or following a desensitisation protocol. == Mechanism of action == Colistin is a polycationic peptide and has both hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties. These cationic regions interact with the bacterial outer membrane by displacing magnesium and calcium bacterial counter ions in the lipopolysaccharide. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions interact with the cytoplasmic membrane just like a detergent, solubilizing the membrane in an aqueous environment. This effect is bactericidal even in an isosmolar environment. Colistin binds to lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids in the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It competitively displaces divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) from the phosphate groups of membrane lipids, which leads to disruption of the outer cell membrane, leakage of intracellular contents and bacterial death. == Pharmacokinetics == No clinically useful absorption of colistin occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. For systemic infection, colistin must therefore be given by injection. Colistimethate is eliminated by the kidneys, but colistin is eliminated by non-renal mechanism(s) that are as of yet not characterised. == History == Colistin was first isolated in Japan in 1949 by Y. Koyama, from a flask of fermenting Bacillus polymyxa var. colistinus, and became available for clinical use in 1959. Colistimethate sodium, a less toxic prodrug, became available for injection in 1959. In the 1980s, polymyxin use was widely discontinued because of nephro- and neurotoxicity. As multi-drug resistant bacteria became more prevalent in the 1990s, colistin started to get a second look as an emergency solution, in spite of toxicity. Colistin has also been used in agriculture, particularly in China from the 1980s onwards. Chinese production for agriculture exceeded 2700 tons in 2015. China banned colistin use for livestock growth promotion in 2016. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of colistin requires the use of three amino acids: threonine, leucine, and 2,4-diaminobutryic acid. The linear form of colistin is synthesized before cyclization. Non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis begins with a loading module and then the addition of each subsequent amino acid. The subsequent amino acids are added with the help of an adenylation domain (A), a peptidyl carrier protein domain (PCP), an epimerization domain (E), and a condensation domain (C). Cyclization is accomplished by a thioesterase. The first step is to have a loading domain, 6-methylheptanoic acid, associate with the A and PCP domains. Now with a C, A, and PCP domain that is associated with 2,4-diaminobutryic acid. This continues with each amino acid until the linear peptide chain is completed. The last module will have a thioesterase to complete the cyclization and form the product colistin. == References == == Further reading == Reardon S (December 2015).

It is indicated specifically for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset. It reduces the time taken to fall asleep, but the degree of clinical benefit is small. The medication is approved for long-term use. Ramelteon is taken by mouth. Side effects of ramelteon include somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, exacerbated insomnia, and changes in hormone levels. Ramelteon is an analogue of melatonin and is a selective agonist of the melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors. The half-life and duration of ramelteon are much longer than those of melatonin. Ramelteon is not a benzodiazepine or Z-drug and does not interact with GABA receptors, instead having a distinct mechanism of action. Ramelteon was first described in 2002 and was approved for medical use in 2005. Unlike certain other sleep medications, ramelteon is not a controlled substance in nearly every country and has no known potential for misuse. == Medical uses == === Insomnia === Ramelteon is approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty with sleep onset in adults. In regulatory clinical trials, it was found to significantly reduce latency to persistent sleep (LPS). A 2009 pooled analysis of four clinical trials found that ramelteon at a dose of 8 mg reduced sleep onset by 13 minutes (30% decrease) relative to placebo on the first and second nights of use. Subsequent meta-analyses of longer-duration use have found that ramelteon decreases subjective sleep latency by about 4 to 7 minutes. Meta-analyses are mixed on whether ramelteon increases total sleep time. Ramelteon also improves sleep quality (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference –0.074, 95% CITooltip confidence interval –0.13 to –0.02) and sleep efficiency. The clinical improvement in insomnia with ramelteon is small and of questionable benefit. Ramelteon is approved in the United States but was not approved in the European Union owing to concerns that it lacked effectiveness. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) noted that ramelteon had only been found to improve sleep onset and not other sleep outcomes, only one of three clinical trials actually found that it improved sleep onset, and that the improvement in sleep onset was too small to be clinically meaningful. The CHMP also noted that the long-term effectiveness of ramelteon had not been demonstrated. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended the use of ramelteon in the treatment of sleep-onset insomnia. It rated the recommendation as weak and the quality of evidence as very low but concluded that the potential benefits outweighed the potential harms. The guidelines found that ramelteon reduces sleep latency by 9 minutes (95% CITooltip confidence interval 6–12 minutes) but does not improve sleep quality. In contrast to ramelteon, the guidelines did not recommend the use of melatonin. === Circadian rhythm sleep disorders === Melatonin receptor agonists like melatonin and tasimelteon are considered to be effective in regulating sleep–wake cycles and in the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders like delayed sleep phase disorder. Ramelteon has been assessed in only a few studies in the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag disorder, shift work disorder, and non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder. These studies have been of varying quality and their findings in terms of effectiveness have been mixed. Ramelteon is approved only for treatment of insomnia and is not approved for treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders. It was previously under development for treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, but development for these indications was discontinued. === Other uses === ==== Delirium ==== A systematic review, published in 2014, concluded ""ramelteon was found to be beneficial in preventing delirium in medically ill individuals when compared to placebo."" A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis found that the combination of ramelteon and the orexin receptor antagonist suvorexant may reduce the incidence of delirium in adults hospitalized patients whereas suvorexant alone was ineffective. ==== Bipolar disorder ==== Ramelteon has received attention in psychiatry as a possible add-on treatment for mania in bipolar disorder. However, to date, the scarce available evidence fails to support the clinical utility of ramelteon and other melatonin receptor agonists such as melatonin for mania. === Available forms === Ramelteon is available in the form of 8 mg oral film-coated tablets. == Contraindications == Ramelteon is not recommended for use in people with severe sleep apnea. == Adverse effects == Side effects of ramelteon include somnolence (3% vs. 2% for placebo), fatigue (3% vs. 2% for placebo), dizziness (4% vs. 3% for placebo), nausea (3% vs. 2% for placebo), and exacerbated insomnia (3% vs. 2% for placebo). Overall, side effects occurred in 6% with ramelteon and 2% with placebo in clinical trials. Side effects leading to discontinuation occurred in 1% or fewer people. Rarely, anaphylactic reactions, abnormal thinking, and worsening of depression or suicidal thinking in patients with pre-existing depression may occur with ramelteon. Ramelteon has been found to slightly increase prolactin levels in women (+34% vs. –4% with placebo) but not in men and to decrease free testosterone levels (by 3–6% in younger men and by 13–18% in older men). Ramelteon has not been shown to produce dependence and has shown no potential for abuse. The withdrawal and rebound insomnia that is typical with GABAA receptor positive modulators like benzodiazepines and Z-drugs is not present in ramelteon. Increased incidence of liver and testicular tumors have been observed with ramelteon in rodents but only at doses equivalent to at least 20 times greater than the recommended dose in humans. == Overdose == Ramelteon has been assessed at doses of up to 64 mg in clinical studies. == Interactions == Ramelteon has been evaluated for potential drug interactions with the following medications and showed no significant effects: omeprazole, theophylline, dextromethorphan, and midazolam, digoxin and warfarin. There were no clinically meaningful effects when ramelteon was coadministered with any of these drugs. A drug interaction study showed that there were no clinically meaningful effects or an increase in adverse events when ramelteon and the SSRI Prozac (fluoxetine) were coadministered. When coadministered with ramelteon, fluvoxamine (strong CYP1A2 inhibitor) increased AUC approximately 190-fold, and the Cmax increased approximately 70-fold, compared to ramelteon administered alone. Ramelteon and fluvoxamine should not be coadministered. Ramelteon has significant drug–drug interaction with the following drugs: amiodarone, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine. Ramelteon should be administered with caution in patients taking other CYP1A2 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, and strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole. Efficacy may be reduced when ramelteon is used in combination with potent CYP enzyme inducers such as rifampin, since ramelteon concentrations may be decreased. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and selectivity over the non-human MT3 receptor. Ramelteon demonstrates full agonist activity in vitro in cells expressing human MT1 or MT2 receptors, and high selectivity for human MT1 and MT2 receptors compared to the non-human MT3 receptor. The affinity of ramelteon for the MT1 and MT2 receptors is 3 to 16 times higher than that of melatonin. Ramelteon has 8-fold higher affinity for the MT1 receptor over the MT2 receptor. The binding profile of ramelteon distinguishes it from melatonin, tasimelteon, and agomelatine. Remelteon has a clinically irrelevant affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 5.6 μM). The major metabolite of ramelteon, M-II, is active and has approximately one-tenth and one-fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human MT1 and MT2 receptors, respectively, and is 17- to 25-fold less potent than ramelteon in in vitro functional assays. Although the potency of M-II at MT1 and MT2 receptors is lower than the parent drug, M-II circulates at higher concentrations than the parent producing 20- to 100-fold greater mean systemic exposure when compared to ramelteon. M-II has weak affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, but no appreciable affinity for other receptors or enzymes. Similar to ramelteon, M-II does not interfere with the activity of a number of endogenous enzymes. Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptors or for receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and opioids. Ramelteon also does not interfere with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel. ==== Mechanism of action ==== The activity of ramelteon at the MT1 and MT2 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting properties, as these receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep–wake cycle. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The total absorption of ramelteon is 84% while its oral bioavailability is 1.8%. The low bioavailability of ramelteon is due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Ramelteon has a higher lipophilicity than melatonin and thus permeates more easily into tissue. The absorption of ramelteon is rapid, with peak levels being reached after approximately 0.75 hours (range 0.5–1.5 hours). Food increases peak concentrations of ramelteon by 22% and overall exposure by 31% and delays the time to peak levels by approximately 0.75 hours. The pharmacokinetics of ramelteon are linear across a dose range of 4 to 64 mg. There is substantial interindividual variability in the peak concentrations and area-under-the-curve levels of ramelteon which is consistent with high first-pass metabolism. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of ramelteon is 73.6 L, which suggests substantial tissue distribution. The plasma protein binding of ramelteon is 82% independently of concentration. Ramelteon is primarily bound to albumin (70%). The medication is not selectively distributed to red blood cells. ==== Metabolism ==== Ramelteon is metabolized in the liver primarily by oxidation via hydroxylation and carbonylation. It is also secondarily metabolized to produce glucuronide conjugates. Ramelteon is metabolized mainly by CYP1A2 while CYP2C enzymes and CYP3A4 are involved to a minor extent. The metabolites of ramelteon include M-I, M-II, M-III, and M-IV. Exposure to M-II is approximately 20- to 100-fold higher than to ramelteon. ==== Elimination ==== Ramelteon is excreted 84% in urine and 4% in feces. Less than 0.1% of drug is excreted as unchanged ramelteon. Elimination of ramelteon is essentially complete by 96 hours following a single dose. The elimination half-life of ramelteon is 1 to 2.6 hours while the half-life of M-II, the major active metabolite of ramelteon, is 2 to 5 hours. The half-lives of ramelteon and M-II are substantially longer than that of melatonin, which has a half-life in the range of 20 to 45 minutes. Levels of ramelteon and its metabolites at or below the limit of detectability within 24 hours following a dose. ==== Special populations ==== Peak levels of ramelteon and overall exposure are about 86% and 97% higher, respectively, in elderly adults compared to younger adults. Conversely, peak levels of M-II are 13% and overall exposure 30% higher in elderly adults than in younger adults. The elimination half-life of ramelteon is 2.6 hours in elderly adults. == History == Ramelteon was first described in the medical literature in 2002. It was approved for use in the United States in July 2005. == Society and culture == Ramelteon has no potential for abuse or drug dependence and is not a controlled substance. == Research == Ramelteon, along with other melatonin receptor agonists like melatonin, has been repurposed in clinical trials as an adjunctive treatment for acute manic episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder. Nonetheless, meta-analytic evidence is based on very few trials and does not allow supporting the use of melatonin receptor agonists as adjunctive options for mania in clinical practice, although the small sample size do not allow ruling out their beneficial effect. == References ==",Rozerem,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.986990567587782e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003404037852305919)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/rozerem.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Rozerem: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/rozerem.html?utm_source=openai')])"

3734,"('Fosfomycin (calcium)', 'Mk-\u200b0955 (calcium)', 'Phosphomycin', 'Phosphonomycin', 'Fosfonomycin')",Medical,"Fosfomycin, sold under the brand name Monurol among others, is an antibiotic primarily used to treat lower urinary tract infections. It is not indicated for kidney infections. Occasionally it is used for prostate infections. It is generally taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, headache, and vaginal yeast infections. Severe side effects may include anaphylaxis and Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea. While use during pregnancy has not been found to be harmful, such use is not recommended. A single dose when breastfeeding appears safe. Fosfomycin works by interfering with the production of the bacterial cell wall. Fosfomycin was discovered in 1969 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996 It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies fosfomycin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. It was originally produced by certain types of Streptomyces, although it is now made chemically. == Medical uses == Fosfomycin is used to treat bladder infections as well as urinary tract infections (UTIs), where it is usually given as a single dose by mouth. Oral fosfomycin is not recommended for children under 12 years old. Additional uses have been proposed. The global problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance has led to a renewed interest in its use more recently. Fosfomycin can be used as an efficacious treatment for both UTIs and complicated UTIs including acute pyelonephritis. The standard regimen for complicated UTIs is an oral 3 g dose administered once every 48 or 72 hours for a total of 3 doses or a 6 g dose every 8 hours for 7–14 days when fosfomycin is given in IV form. Intravenous fosfomycin is being increasingly used for treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, mostly as a partner drug in order to avoid the occurrence of resistances and to take advantage of its synergistic activity with several other antimicrobials. Daily adult dose usually ranges from 12 to 24 grams. When administered in continuous infusion, a loading dose of fosfomycin 8 g followed by a daily dose of 16 g or 24 g. Continuous infusion is suggested in patients with normal renal function. Fosfomycin demonstrated strong antibiofilm activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies, including prosthetic material infections. It maintains antibiofilm activity against both Gram-positive (including MRSA) and Gram-negative bacteria. === Bacterial sensitivity === The fosfomycin molecule has an epoxide or oxirane ring, which is highly strained and thus very reactive. Fosfomycin has broad antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, with useful activity against E. faecalis, E. coli, and various Gram-negatives such as Citrobacter and Proteus. Given a greater activity in a low-pH milieu, and predominant excretion in active form into the urine, fosfomycin has found use for the prophylaxis and treatment of UTIs caused by these uropathogens. Of note, activity against S. saprophyticus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter is variable and should be confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentration testing. Activity against extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing pathogens, notably ESBL-producing E. coli, is good to excellent, because the drug is not affected by cross-resistance issues. Existing clinical data support use in uncomplicated UTIs, caused by susceptible organisms. However, susceptibility break-points of 64 mg/L should not be applied for systemic infections. === Resistance === Development of bacterial resistance under therapy is a frequent occurrence and makes fosfomycin unsuitable for sustained therapy of severe infections. Mutations that inactivate the nonessential glycerophosphate transporter render bacteria resistant to fosfomycin. Still, fosfomycin can be used to treat MRSA bacteremia. Prescribing fosfomycin together with at least another active drug reduces the risk of developing bacterial resistance. Fosfomycin acts synergistically with many other antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, carbapenems, cephalosporins, daptomycin and oritavancin. Enzymes conferring resistance to fosfomycin have also been identified and are encoded both chromosomally and on plasmids. Three related fosfomycin resistance enzymes (named FosA, FosB, and FosX) are members of the glyoxalase superfamily. These enzymes function by nucleophilic attack on carbon 1 of fosfomycin, which opens the epoxide ring and renders the drug ineffective. The enzymes differ by the identity of the nucleophile used in the reaction: glutathione for FosA, bacillithiol for FosB, and water for FosX. In general, FosA and FosX enzymes are produced by Gram-negative bacteria, whereas FosB is produced by Gram-positive bacteria. FosC uses ATP and adds a phosphate group to fosfomycin, thus altering its properties and making the drug ineffective. == Side effects == The drug is well tolerated and has a low incidence of harmful side effects. == Mechanism of action == Despite its name (ending in -omycin) Fosfomycin is not a macrolide, but a member of a novel class of phosphonic antibiotics. Fosfomycin is bactericidal and inhibits bacterial cell wall biogenesis by inactivating the enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-3-enolpyruvyltransferase, also known as MurA. This enzyme catalyzes the committed step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, namely the ligation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the 3'-hydroxyl group of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. This pyruvate moiety provides the linker that bridges the glycan and peptide portion of peptidoglycan. Fosfomycin is a PEP analog that inhibits MurA by alkylating an active site cysteine residue (Cys 115 in the Escherichia coli enzyme). Fosfomycin enters the bacterial cell through the glycerophosphate transporter. == History == Fosfomycin (originally known as phosphonomycin) was discovered in a joint effort of Merck and Co. and Spain's Compañía Española de Penicilina y Antibióticos (CEPA). It was first isolated by screening broth cultures of Streptomyces fradiae isolated from soil samples for the ability to cause formation of spheroplasts by growing bacteria. The discovery was described in a series of papers published in 1969. CEPA began producing fosfomycin on an industrial scale in 1971 at its Aranjuez facility. == Biosynthesis == The complete fosfomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces fradiae has been cloned and sequenced and the heterologous production of fosfomycin in S. lividans has been achieved by Ryan Woodyer of the Huimin Zhao and Wilfred van der Donk research groups. == Synthetic manufacture == Large scale production of fosfomycin is achieved by making an epoxide of cis-propenylphosphonic acid to yield racemic mixture fosfomycin. == References ==",Phosphonomycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.2649508537142538e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005247628316283226)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fosfomycin,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5809587/,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00828 ', [])"

3739,"('Phenanthrene', 'Phenanthren', 'Phenanthracene', 'Phenanthrin', 'Ravatite')","Medical, Industrial","Phenanthrene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with formula C14H10, consisting of three fused benzene rings. It is a colorless, crystal-like solid, but can also appear yellow. Phenanthrene is used to make dyes, plastics, pesticides, explosives, and drugs. It has also been used to make bile acids, cholesterol and steroids. Phenanthrene occurs naturally and also is a man-made chemical. Commonly, humans are exposed to phenanthrene through inhalation of cigarette smoke, but there are many routes of exposure. Animal studies have shown that phenanthrene is a potential carcinogen. However, according to IARC, it is not identified as a probable, possible or confirmed human carcinogen. Phenanthrene's three fused rings are angled as in the phenacenes, rather than straight as in the acenes. The compounds with a phenanthrene skeleton but with nitrogen atoms in place of CH sites are known as phenanthrolines. == History and etymology == Phenanthrene was discovered in coal tar in 1872 independently by Carl Graebe (article manuscript received on November 1st) as well as by Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig and his doctoral student Eugen Ostermayer (manuscript received on November 19th but Ostermayer's dissertation defended in August). Fittig and Ostermayer were able to determine the structure of the compound by oxidizing it first to a corresponding quinone and then to diphenic acid, and soon Graebe confirmed it by a synthesis from stilbene. Prior to February 1873 Fittig sent a letter to Graebe where he proposed to name the hydrocarbon phenanthrene (German: Phenanthren) in order to account for its similarity to biphenyl and anthracene, which was swiftly adopted. == Physical properties == Phenanthrene is nearly insoluble in water but is soluble in most low-polarity organic solvents such as toluene, carbon tetrachloride, ether, chloroform, acetic acid and benzene. Phenanthrene is fluorescent under ultraviolet light, exhibiting a large Stoke shift. It can be used in scintillators. == Chemistry == Reactions of phenanthrene typically occur at the 9 and 10 positions, including: Oxidation with chromic acid gives gives phenanthrenequinone. Organic reduction to 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene with hydrogen gas and raney nickel Electrophilic halogenation to 9-bromophenanthrene with bromine Aromatic sulfonation to 2 and 3-phenanthrenesulfonic acids with sulfuric acid Ozonolysis to diphenylaldehyde == Productions == Phenanthrene is extracted from coal tar, where it comprises 5% by weight. In principle it could be obtained by chemical synthesis. The Bardhan–Sengupta phenanthrene synthesis is a classic way to make phenanthrenes. This process involves electrophilic aromatic substitution using a tethered cyclohexanol group using diphosphorus pentoxide, which closes the central ring onto an existing aromatic ring. Dehydrogenation using selenium aromatizes the other rings into aromatic ones as well. The aromatization of six-membered rings produces H2Se. Phenanthrene can also be obtained photochemically from certain diarylethenes (Mallory reaction): Other synthesis routes include the Haworth reaction and the Wagner-Meerwein-type ring-expansion, as depicted below: Commercially phenanthrene is not synthesized but extracted from the byproducts of coal coking, since it makes around 4–6% of coke oven coal tar. == Natural occurrences of the phenanthrene derivatives == Morphinan is the chemical structure found in several psychoactive drugs, consisting of opiate analgesics, cough suppressants, and dissociative hallucinogens, among others. Examples morphine, codeine, and dextromethorphan (DXM). Ravatite is a natural mineral consisting of phenanthrene. It is found in small amounts among a few coal burning sites. Ravatite represents a small group of organic minerals. === In plants === Phenanthrene derivatives occur in plants as phenanthrenoids. They have been reported from flowering plants, mainly in the family Orchidaceae, and a few in the families Dioscoreaceae, Combretaceae and Betulaceae, as well as in the lower plant class Marchantiophyta (liverworts). == See also == Chrysene Anthracene Phenanthroline == References == == External links == Phenanthrene at scorecard.org",Phenanthrene,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0014315475709736347), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('IN', -0.030511416494846344), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.576033890247345), ('ĠFOOD', -0.9589544534683228), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6934419274330139)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0009115827269852161), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([chemwatch.net](https://chemwatch.net/resource-center/phenanthrene/?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenanthrene?utm_source=openai), [atamanchemicals.com](https://www.atamanchemicals.com/phenanthrene_u26732/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=277, start_index=12, title='Phenanthrene - Chemwatch', type='url_citation', url='https://chemwatch.net/resource-center/phenanthrene/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=277, start_index=12, title='Phenanthrene', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenanthrene?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=277, start_index=12, title='PHENANTHRENE - Ataman Kimya', type='url_citation', url='https://www.atamanchemicals.com/phenanthrene_u26732/?utm_source=openai')])"

Activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is frequently observed in CCA, and thus, PI3K and mTOR are promising therapeutic targets in CCA. Recently a new dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GDC-0980 (apitolisib) was introduced. This study was undertaken to examine the activity of apitolisib against CCA cells in vitro and in vivo. Apitolisib treatment strongly reduced Akt and mTOR active phosphorylation levels and attenuated cell growth in two different CCA cell lines (SNU478 and SNU1196). In addition, the cytotoxic activity of apitolisib enhanced the effects of gemcitabine or cisplatin in vitro and increased PARP cleavage. Moreover, we observed these co-treatments significantly reduced colony formation by SNU478 and SNU1196 cells and potently inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. The results of the present study show that apitolisib effectively reduces CCA cell growth by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. In addition, co-treatments with apitolisib and gemcitabine or cisplatin synergistically enhanced apitolisib activity, which suggests a means of improving the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of CCA. Deregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling commonly exists in glioblastoma, making this axis an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation. Given that activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR promotes tumour growth, metastasis, and resistance to anticancer therapies, mTOR inhibitors show promise in the treatment of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, Apitolisib (GDC-0980), in A-172 and U-118-MG GBM tumour cell line suppression. It has been demonstrated that GDC-0980 induces time- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis in investigated glioma cell lines. In our study, the strongest induction of apoptosis was exhibited in the A-172 line after 48 h of incubation with 20 µM GDC-0980, where we observed 46.47% of apoptotic cells. In conclusion, we first discovered that dual PI3K/mTOR blockade by GDC-0980 markedly suppressed survival of human GBM cells and induced apoptosis, independent of the ER stress-mediated DR5 activation. We suggest that GDC-0980, by exerting an inhibitory effect on PERK expression, may thus block its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis, leading to intensification of translation, and this may result in an increase in apoptosis. On the other hand, CHOP stimulates protein synthesis and increases apoptosis. These findings suggest that GDC-0980 may be a candidate for further evaluation as a chemotherapeutic agent for anti-GBM therapy. An LC-MS/MS method for the determination of GDC-0980 (apitolisib) concentrations in dog plasma has been developed and validated for the first time to support pre-clinical drug development. Following protein precipitation with acetonitrile, the resulting samples were analyzed using reverse-phase chromatography on a Metasil AQ column. The mass analysis was performed on a triple quadruple mass spectrometer coupled with an electrospray interface in positive ionization mode. The selected reaction monitoring transitions monitored were m/z 499.3 → 341.1 for GDC-0980 and m/z 507.3 → 341.1 for IS. The method was validated over the calibration curve range 0.250-250 ng/mL with linear regression and 1/x(2) weighting. Relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 0.0 to 10.9% and accuracy ranged from 93.4 to 113.6% of nominal. Stable-labeled internal standard GDC-0980-d8 was used to minimize matrix effects. This assay was used for the measurement of GDC-0980 dog plasma concentrations to determine toxicokinetic parameters after oral administration of GDC-0980 (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) to beagle dogs in a GLP toxicology study. Peak concentration ranged from 3.23 to 84.9 ng/mL. GDC-0980 was rapidly absorbed with a mean time to peak concentration ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 h.

The heterogeneity of these tumors makes it difficult to standardize treatment. CDK 4/6 inhibitors are a family of targeted agents which limit cell cycle progression and have been shown to be upregulated in sarcomas. In the current preclinical study, we evaluated the effects of lerociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, on pediatric sarcomas in vitro and in 3D bioprinted tumors. The effects of lerociclib on viability, proliferation, cell cycle, motility, and stemness were assessed in established sarcoma cell lines, U-2 OS and MG-63, as well as sarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). 3D printed biotumors of each of the U-2 OS, MG-63, and COA79 cells were utilized to study the effects of lerociclib on tumor growth ex vivo. CDK 4/6, as well as the intermediaries retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and phosphorylated Rb were identified as targets in the four sarcoma cell lines. Lerociclib treatment induced cell cycle arrest, decreased proliferation, motility, and stemness of sarcoma cells. Treatment with lerociclib decreased sarcoma cell viability in both traditional 2D culture as well as 3D bioprinted microtumors. Inhibition of CDK 4/6 activity with lerociclib was efficacious in traditional 2D sarcoma cell culture as well as in 3D bioprints. Lerociclib holds promise and warrants further investigation as a novel therapeutic strategy for management of these heterogenous groups of tumors. Lerociclib (GB491), a highly selective oral CDK4/6 inhibitor, has displayed anti-tumor activity and differentiated safety and tolerability profile in previous ph1/2 clinical trials. The LEONARDA-1, a randomized, double-blind, phase III study, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lerociclib in HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients, who had relapsed or progressed on prior endocrine therapy. A total of 275 patients were randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive lerociclib (137 patients, 150 mg twice daily) or placebo (138 patients) plus fulvestrant. Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by investigators was significantly improved in lerociclib arm versus placebo arm (11.07 vs 5.49 months; hazard ratio, 0.451, 95% CI: 0.311-0.656, P = 0.000016), meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. The secondary endpoints included PFS assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile. DOR is not reported, and OS data was immature at the data cut-off but unplanned ad hoc analysis is reported. These findings support lerociclib plus fulvestrant as a treatment option for patients with HR+/HER2- endocrine-resistant advanced breast cancer (ABC). (Funded by Genor Biopharma; LEONARDA-1 ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT05054751.). The combination of targeting the CDK4/6 and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways with palbociclib and fulvestrant is a proven therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. However, the poor physicochemical properties of fulvestrant require monthly intramuscular injections to patients, which limit the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of the compound. Therefore, an orally available compound that more rapidly reaches steady state may lead to a better clinical response in patients. Here, we report the identification of G1T48, a novel orally bioavailable, non-steroidal small molecule antagonist of ER. The pharmacological effects and the antineoplastic mechanism of action of G1T48 on tumors was evaluated using human breast cancer cells (in vitro) and xenograft efficacy models (in vivo). G1T48 is a potent and efficacious inhibitor of estrogen-mediated transcription and proliferation in ER-positive breast cancer cells, similar to the pure antiestrogen fulvestrant. In addition, G1T48 can effectively suppress ER activity in multiple models of endocrine therapy resistance including those harboring ER mutations and growth factor activation. In vivo, G1T48 has robust antitumor activity in a model of estrogen-dependent breast cancer (MCF7) and significantly inhibited the growth of tamoxifen-resistant (TamR), long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) and patient-derived xenograft tumors with an increased response being observed with the combination of G1T48 and the CDK4/6 inhibitor lerociclib.

To address this gap, we compared male and ovariectomized female C57BL/6 mice treated with 30 mg/kg aftin-4, which induces neurodegeneration, with naturally aged (15-16 months old) mice not treated with aftin-4. We performed a series of behavioral tests; measured postmortem plasma β-amyloid levels (Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42) and the levels of the oxidative stress indicators glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA); and evaluated astrocytic reactivity in the brain using glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) levels. Our results revealed no behavioral changes in the aged or aftin-4-treated mice compared with the control mice. Aftin-4 mice presented lower brain MDA levels and no detectable changes in plasma Aβ levels. In general, female mice had higher GPx and SOD levels and lower Aβ1-42 levels than male mice did. In contrast, aged and aftin-4-treated male mice presented elevated levels of GFAP, indicating astrocyte damage. Our results could not confirm that either aftin-4-treated or aged mice are reliable models for dementia. However, the observed molecular changes suggest that male animals may be more susceptible to oxidative stress and brain damage than females are. This study demonstrates the complexity of modeling dementia in animals and the importance of future studies in this area. Aftins (amyloid forty-two inducers) represent a novel class of tri-substituted purines derived from roscovitine, able to promote the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ)1-42 from amyloid-β protein precursor through γ-secretase activation in cell cultures. We here examined whether aftin-4 could provoke an amyloid-like toxicity in vivo in mice. The intracerebroventricular administration of aftin-4 (3-20 nmol) increased Aβ1-42, but not Aβ1-40, content in the mouse hippocampus, between 5 and 14 days after injection. Aftin-4 injection increased lipid peroxidation levels in the hippocampus, an index of oxidative stress. It increased brain contents in pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα, and GFAP immunolabeling, showing astrocytic reaction. Expression of the synaptic marker synaptophysin was decreased by aftin-4. Finally, the treatment provoked marked learning deficits, observed using different memory procedures: Spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, place learning in the water-maze, and passive avoidance response. The systemic intraperitoneal injection of aftin-4 in the 3-30 mg/kg dose range also induced oxidative stress and learning deficits. All these alterations could be blocked by pre-treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor BMS-299,897, confirming that the mechanism of action of aftin-4 involves secretase activity. Furthermore, we examined if the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen could prevent aftin-4-induced memory impairments, cytokine release, and lipid peroxidation. Donepezil prevented all alterations, whereas ibuprofen prevented the increases in cytokine release and lipid peroxidation, but only marginally the memory impairments. As a whole, this study showed that in vivo injection of aftin-4 results in a rapid, acute Alzheimer's disease-like toxicity in the rodent brain.",Aftin-4,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.025057436898350716)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.7124112248420715), ('ICAL', -6.556489552167477e-06), (',', -0.3869248628616333), ('ĠINDU', -0.25682151317596436), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015300721861422062)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -4.842555426876061e-06)])","('INFO; ', [])"

In living cells, glutathione disulfide is reduced into two molecules of glutathione with reducing equivalents from the coenzyme NADPH. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme glutathione reductase. Antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins, generate glutathione disulfide during the reduction of peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxides (ROOH): 2 GSH + ROOH → GSSG + ROH + H2O Other enzymes, such as glutaredoxins, generate glutathione disulfide through thiol-disulfide exchange with protein disulfide bonds or other low molecular mass compounds, such as coenzyme A disulfide or dehydroascorbic acid. 2 GSH + R-S-S-R → GSSG + 2 RSH The GSH:GSSG ratio is therefore an important bioindicator of cellular health, with a higher ratio signifying less oxidative stress in the organism. A lower ratio may even be indicative of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease. == Neuromodulator == GSSG, along with glutathione and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), have been found to bind to the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their γ-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators.

However, as some cancer cells are resistant to statins, broadening an anticancer spectrum of statins is desirable. The upregulated expression of the statin target enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGCR), in statin-treated cancer cells is a well-known mechanism of statin resistance, which can be counteracted by the downregulation of HMGCR gene expression, or degradation of the HMGCR protein. However, the mechanism by which HMGCR degradation influences the anticancer effects of statins remain unreported. We tested the effect of the HMGCR degrader compound SR-12813 at a concentration that did not affect the growth of eight diverse tumor cell lines. Combined treatment with atorvastatin and a low concentration of SR-12813 led to lowering of increased HMGCR expression, and augmented the cytostatic effect of atorvastatin in both statin-resistant and -sensitive cancer cells compared with that of atorvastatin treatment alone. Dual-targeting of HMGCR using statins and SR-12813 (or similar compounds) could provide an improved anticancer therapeutic approach. SR-12813 inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis in Hep G2 cells via an enhanced degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Here we also show that SR-12813 inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo. A sterol balance study was performed in normolipemic beagle dogs. The dogs were given SR-12813 orally at dosages of 10 and 25 mg/kg/day for a period of 9 days. After 7 days plasma cholesterol was decreased by 15% in the 10 mg/kg/day group and by 19% in the 25 mg/kg/day group. Using a dual isotope technique no effects on intestinal cholesterol absorption were observed. The sterol balance indicated that endogenous synthesis of cholesterol was reduced by 23% in the 10 mg/kg/day group and by 37% in the 25 mg/kg/day group. Plasma lathosterol-cholesterol levels in dogs treated with 25 mg/kg/day SR-12813 were reduced by 56%, confirming a reduction of the cholesterol biosynthesis. Treatment with SR-12813 or the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin resulted in a large decrease in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It is concluded that SR-12813 reduces cholesterol biosynthesis in the dog model which results in a decrease of bile acid excretion, cholesterol excretion and plasma cholesterol level. The in vivo profile of SR-12813 is very similar to that of direct HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, although the mode of action of the compound is unique. SR-12813 (tetra-ethyl 2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl-1, 1-bisphosphonate) lowers plasma cholesterol in five species. In this paper we investigate the underlying mechanism using Hep G2 cells. SR-12813 inhibited incorporation of tritiated water into cholesterol with an IC50 of 1.2 microM but had no effect on fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, SR-12813 reduced cellular 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity with an IC50 of 0.85 microM. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity was rapid with a T1/2 of 10 min. After a 16-h incubation with SR-12813, mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase and low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor were increased. The increased expression of LDL receptor translated into a higher LDL uptake, which can explain the primary hypocholesterolemic effect of SR-12813 in vivo. Western blot analysis indicated that the amount of HMG-CoA reductase protein rapidly decreased in the presence of SR-12813. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine showed that the T1/2 of HMG-CoA reductase degradation decreased in the presence of SR-12813 from 90 to 20 min. Pre-incubation with 50 microM of lovastatin did not prevent the effects of SR-12813 on HMG-CoA reductase degradation, indicating that the compound does not need mevalonate-derived regulators for its action. It is concluded that SR-12813 inhibits cholesterol synthesis mainly by an enhanced degradation of HMG-CoA reductase.",Sr 12813,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.003178901970386505), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0463523268699646), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4741595685482025)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0015036711702123284)])","('INFO; ([rndsystems.com](https://www.rndsystems.com/products/sr-12813_2969?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9298680/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8662919/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=267, start_index=6, title='SR 12813 | Pregnane X Receptor Agonists: R&D Systems', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rndsystems.com/products/sr-12813_2969?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=267, start_index=6, title='SR-12813 lowers plasma cholesterol in beagle dogs by decreasing cholesterol biosynthesis - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9298680/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=267, start_index=6, title='The novel cholesterol-lowering drug SR-12813 inhibits cholesterol synthesis via an increased degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8662919/?utm_source=openai')])"
3749,"('Nitazoxanide', 'Alinia', 'Nitazoxamide', 'Daxon', 'Nitazoxanidum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"The dachshund (UK: DAKS-huund, -⁠ənd, -⁠huunt or US: DAHKS-huunt, -⁠huund, -⁠ənt; German: 'badger dog'), also known as the wiener dog or sausage dog, badger dog and doxie, is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. The dog may be smooth-haired, wire-haired, or long-haired, with varied coloration. The dachshund was bred to scent, chase, and flush out badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals. The miniature dachshund was bred to hunt small animals such as rabbits. The dachshund was ranked 9th in registrations with the American Kennel Club in 2022. == Etymology == The name dachshund is of German origin, and means 'badger dog', from Dachs ('badger') and Hund ('dog, hound'). The German word Dachshund is pronounced [ˈdaks.hʊnt] . The pronunciation varies in English: variations of the first and second syllables include , and , , . The first syllable may be incorrectly pronounced as by some English speakers. Although Dachshund is a German word, in modern Germany, the dogs are more commonly known by the short name Dackel. Working dogs are less commonly known as Teckel. Because of their long, narrow build, they are often nicknamed wiener or sausage dog. == Classification == While classified in the hound group or scent hound group in the United States and Great Britain, the breed has its own group in the countries which belong to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation). Many dachshunds, especially the wire-haired subtype, may exhibit behavior and appearance similar to the terrier group of dogs. An argument can be made for the scent (or hound) group classification because the breed was developed to use scent to trail and hunt animals, and probably descended from the Saint Hubert Hound like many modern scent hound breeds such as bloodhounds and Basset Hounds; but with the persistent personality and love for digging that probably developed from the terrier, it can also be argued that they could belong in the terrier, or ""earth dog"", group. == Characteristics == === Appearance === A typical dachshund is long-bodied and muscular with short stubby legs. Its front paws are disproportionately large, being paddle-shaped and particularly suitable for digging. Its skin is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey. Its snout is long. ==== Coat and color ==== There are three dachshund coat varieties: smooth coat (short hair), long-haired, and wire-haired. Longhaired dachshunds have a silky coat and short featherings on legs and ears. Wire-haired dachshunds are the least common coat variety in the United States (although it is the most common in Germany) and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards. Dachshunds have a wide variety of colors and patterns, the most common one being red. Their base coloration can be single-colored (either red or cream), tan pointed (black and tan, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, or isabella and tan), and in wire-haired dogs, a color referred to as wild boar. Patterns such as dapple (merle), sable, brindle and piebald also can occur on any of the base colors. Dachshunds in the same litter may be born in different coat colors depending on the genetic makeup of the parents. The Dachshund Club of America (DCA) and the American Kennel Club (AKC) consider Double Dapple to be out of standard and a disqualifying color in the show ring. Piebald is now a recognized color in the Dachshund Club of America (DCA) breed standard. Dogs that are double-dappled have the merle pattern of a dapple, but with distinct white patches that occur when the dapple gene expresses itself twice in the same area of the coat. The DCA excluded the wording ""double-dapple"" from the standard in 2007 and now strictly uses the wording ""dapple"" as the double dapple gene is commonly responsible for blindness and deafness. ==== Size ==== Dachshunds come in three sizes: standard, miniature, and kaninchen (German for ""rabbit""). Although the standard and miniature sizes are recognized almost universally, the rabbit size is not recognized by clubs in the United States and the United Kingdom. The rabbit size is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation) (FCI), which contain kennel clubs from 83 countries all over the world. An increasingly common size for family pets falls between the miniature and the standard size; these are frequently referred to as ""tweenies,"" which is not an official classification. A full-grown standard dachshund typically weighs 7.5 to 14.5 kg (16 to 32 lb), while the miniature variety normally weighs less than 5.5 kg (12 lb). The kaninchen weighs 3.5 to 5 kg (8 to 11 lb). According to kennel club standards, the miniature (and kaninchen, where recognized) differs from the full-size only by size and weight, thus offspring from miniature parents must never weigh more than the miniature standard to be considered a miniature as well. While many kennel club size divisions use weight for classification, such as the American Kennel Club, other kennel club standards determine the difference between the miniature and standard by chest circumference; some kennel clubs, such as in Germany, even measure chest circumference in addition to height and weight. ==== Eye color ==== Light-colored dachshunds can sport amber, light brown, or green eyes; however, kennel club standards state that the darker the eye color, the better. Dapple and double dapple dachshunds can have multi-coloured ""wall"" eyes with fully blue, partially blue or patched irises owing to the effect of the dapple gene on eye pigmentation expression. ""Wall"" eye is permissible according to DCA standards but undesirable by AKC standards. === Temperament === Dachshunds can be stubborn and refuse commands, especially if chasing a small animal which they have a propensity for. As dachshunds were originally used as badger hunters they have a keen sense for chasing smaller animals. Dachshunds are often stubborn, making them a challenge to train. Being the owner of dachshunds, to me a book on dog discipline becomes a volume of inspired humor. Every sentence is a riot. Some day, if I ever get a chance, I shall write a book, or warning, on the character and temperament of the dachshund and why he can't be trained and shouldn't be. I would rather train a striped zebra to balance an Indian club than induce a dachshund to heed my slightest command. When I address Fred I never have to raise either my voice or my hopes. He even disobeys me when I instruct him in something he wants to do. Dachshunds can be aggressive to strangers and other dogs. Despite this, they are rated in the intelligence of dogs as an average working dog with a persistent ability to follow trained commands 50% of the time or more. They can have a loud bark. Some bark quite a lot and may need training to stop, while others will not bark much at all. Dachshunds can be standoffish toward strangers. A Japanese study found the Miniature Dachshund to have higher rates of refusing to move whilst on a walk, barking at outside noises whilst inside, barking at strangers visiting their home, separation anxiety, inappropriate elimination (faecal and urinary incontinence), hesitancy to approach unknown humans and canines, and aggression towards family members, highlighting the breed's stubbornness and aggression. According to the American Kennel Club's breed standards, ""the dachshund is clever, lively and courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses well-developed. Any display of shyness is a serious fault."" Their temperament and body language give the impression that they do not know or care about their relatively small size. Like many small hunting dogs, they will challenge a larger dog. Indulged dachshunds may become snappy or extremely obstinate. A 2008 University of Pennsylvania study of 6,000 dog owners who were interviewed indicated that dogs of smaller breeds were more likely to be ""genetically predisposed toward aggressive behaviour"". Dachshunds were rated the most aggressive, with 20% having bitten strangers, as well as high rates of attacks on other dogs and their owners. The study noted that attacks by small dogs were unlikely to cause serious injuries and because of this were probably under-reported. == Health == The breed is prone to spinal problems, especially intervertebral disk disease (IVDD), due in part to an extremely long spinal column and short rib cage. The risk of injury may be worsened by obesity, jumping, rough handling, or intense exercise, which place greater strain on the vertebrae. About 20–25% of dachshunds will develop IVDD. Dachshunds with a number of calcified intervertebral discs at a young age have a higher risk of developing disc disease in later life. In addition, studies have shown that development of calcified discs is highly heritable in the breed. An appropriate screening programme for IVDD has been identified by Finnish researchers and a UK IVDD screening programme has been developed for breeders with the aim to reduce prevalence of spinal problems. Treatment consists of combinations of crate confinement and courses of anti-inflammatory medications (steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like carprofen and meloxicam), or chronic pain medications, like tramadol. Serious cases may require surgery to remove the troublesome disk contents. A dog may need the aid of a cart to get around if paralysis occurs. A minimally invasive procedure called ""percutaneous laser disk ablation"" has been developed at the Oklahoma State University Veterinary Hospital. Originally, the procedure was used in clinical trials only on dachshunds that had suffered previous back incidents. Since dachshunds are prone to back issues, the goal is to expand this treatment to dogs in a normal population. In addition to back problems, the breed is prone to patellar luxation where the kneecap can become dislodged. Dachshunds may also be affected by osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease). The condition seems to be mainly limited to wire-haired Dachshunds, with 17% being carriers. A genetic test is available to allow breeders to avoid breeding carriers to carriers. In such pairings, each puppy will have a 25% chance of being affected. In some double dapples, there are varying degrees of vision and hearing loss, including reduced or absent eyes. Not all double dapples have problems with their eyes and/or ears, which may include degrees of hearing loss, full deafness, malformed ears, congenital eye defects, reduced or absent eyes, partial or full blindness, or varying degrees of both vision and hearing problems; but heightened problems can occur owing to the genetic process in which two dapple genes cross, particularly in certain breeding lines. Dapple genes, which are dominant genes, are considered ""dilution"" genes, meaning whatever color the dog would have originally carried is lightened, or diluted, randomly; two dominant ""dilution"" genes can cancel each other out, or ""cross"", removing all color and producing a white recessive gene, essentially a white mutation. When occurring genetically within the eyes or ears, this white mutation can be detrimental to development, causing hearing or vision problems. Other dachshund health problems include hereditary epilepsy, granulomatous meningoencephalitis, dental issues, Cushing's syndrome, thyroid and autoimmune problems, various allergies and atopies, and various eye conditions including cataracts, glaucoma, progressive retinal atrophy, corneal ulcers, nonulcerative corneal disease, sudden acquired retinal degeneration, and cherry eye. Dachshunds are also 2.5 times more likely than other breeds of dogs to develop patent ductus arteriosus, a congenital heart defect. Dilute color dogs (Blue, Isabella, and Cream) are very susceptible to color dilution alopecia, a skin disorder that can result in hair loss and extreme sensitivity to sun. Since the occurrence and severity of these health problems is largely hereditary, breeders are working to eliminate these. Factors influencing the litter size of puppies and the proportion of stillborn puppies per litter were analyzed in normally sized German dachshunds. The records analyzed contained data on 42,855 litters. It was found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression. It was also found that young and older dams had smaller litter sizes and more stillborn puppies than middle-aged dams. A study in Japan found the Miniature Dachshund to have lower rates of glaucoma than other breeds. With 2.4% of cases belonging to the breed but the breed making up 10.1% of visits to the veterinary hospital. Dachshunds are predisposed to hypothyroidism. === Life expectancy === A 2018 study in Japan of pet cemetery data put the Miniature Dachshund life expectancy at 13.9 years compared to 13.7 overall and 15.1 for crossbreeds. A 2024 study in the UK found a life expectancy of 13.2 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds with the Miniature Dachshund found to have a life expectancy of 14 years. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 11.5 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall. A 2005 Swedish study of insurance data found 28% of Dachshund died by the age of 10, less than the overall rate of 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10. == History == The dachshund is a creation of German breeders and includes elements of German, French, and English hounds and terriers. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of Queen Victoria, who was particularly enamored of the breed. The first verifiable references to the dachshund, originally named the ""Dachs Kriecher"" (""badger crawler"") or ""Dachs Krieger"" (""badger warrior""), came from books written in the early 18th century. Prior to that, there exist references to ""badger dogs"" and ""hole dogs"", but these likely refer to purposes rather than to specific breeds. The original German dachshunds were larger than the modern full-size variety, weighing between 14 and 18 kg (31 and 40 lb), and originally came in straight-legged and crook-legged varieties (the modern dachshund is descended from the latter). Though the breed is famous for its use in exterminating badgers and badger-baiting, dachshunds were also commonly used for rabbit and fox hunting, for locating wounded deer, and in packs were known to hunt game as large as wild boar and as fierce as the wolverine. There are huge differences of opinion as to when dachshunds were specifically bred for their purpose of hunting badger, as the American Kennel Club states the dachshund was bred in the 15th century, while the Dachshund Club of America states that foresters bred the dogs in the 18th or 19th century. Double-dapple dachshunds, which are prone to eye disease, blindness, or hearing problems, are generally believed to have been introduced to the United States between 1879 and 1885. The flap-down ears and famous curved tail of the dachshund have deliberately been bred into the dog. In the case of the ears, this is to keep grass seeds, dirt, and other matter from entering the ear canal. The curved tail is dual-purposed: to be seen more easily in long grass and, in the case of burrowing dachshunds, to help haul the dog out if it becomes stuck in a burrow. The smooth-haired dachshund, the oldest style, may be a cross between the German Shorthaired Pointer, a Pinscher, and a Bracke (a type of bloodhound), or to have been produced by crossing a short Bruno Jura Hound with a pinscher. Others believe it was a cross from a miniature French pointer and a pinscher; others claim that it was developed from the St. Hubert Hound, also a bloodhound, in the 18th century, and still others believe that they were descended from Basset Hounds, based upon their scent abilities and general appearance. The exact origins of the dachshund are therefore unknown. According to William Loeffler, from The American Book of the Dog (1891), in the chapter on dachshunds: ""The origin of the Dachshund is in doubt, our best authorities disagreeing as to the beginning of the breed."" What can be agreed on, however, is that the smooth dachshund gave rise to both the long-haired and the wire-haired varieties. There are two theories about how the standard long-haired dachshund came about. One theory is that smooth dachshunds would occasionally produce puppies which had slightly longer hair than their parents. By selectively breeding these animals, breeders eventually produced a dog which consistently produced long-haired offspring, and the long-haired dachshund was born. Another theory is that the standard long-haired dachshund was developed by breeding smooth dachshunds with various land and water spaniels. The long-haired dachshund may be a cross among any of the small dog breeds in the spaniel group, including the German Stoeberhund, and the smooth dachshund. The wire-haired dachshund, the last to develop, was bred in the late 19th century. There is a possibility the wire-haired dachshund was a cross between the smooth dachshund and various hard-coated terriers and wire-haired pinschers, such as the Schnauzer, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, the German Wirehaired Pointer, or perhaps the Scottish Terrier. == Symbol of Germany == Dachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany. Political cartoonists commonly used the image of the dachshund to ridicule Germany. During World War I, the dachshund's popularity in the United States plummeted because of this association. As a result, they were often called ""liberty hounds"", just as ""liberty cabbage"" became a term for sauerkraut mostly in North America. The stigma of the association was revived to a lesser extent during World War II, though it was comparatively short-lived. Kaiser Wilhelm II and German field marshal Erwin Rommel were known for keeping dachshunds. Owing to the association of the breed with Germany, as well as its particular popularity among dog keepers in Munich at the time, the dachshund was chosen as the first official mascot for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, with the name Waldi. == Sports == Some people train and enter their dachshunds to compete in dachshund races, such as the Wiener Nationals. Several races across the United States routinely draw several thousand attendees. Despite the popularity of these events, the Dachshund Club of America opposes ""wiener racing"", as many greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds to their facilities. The DCA is also worried about potential injuries to dogs, owing to their predisposition to back injuries. Another favorite sport is earthdog trials, in which dachshunds enter tunnels with dead ends and obstacles attempting to locate either an artificial bait or live but caged (and thus protected) rats. == Dackel versus Teckel == In Germany, dachshunds are widely called Dackel (both singular and plural). Among hunters, they are mainly referred to as Teckel. There are kennels which specialize in breeding hunting dachshunds, the so-called jagdliche Leistungszucht (""hunting-related performance breeding"") or Gebrauchshundezucht (""working dog breeding""), as opposed to breeding family dogs. Therefore, it is sometimes incorrectly believed that Teckel is either a name for the hunting breed or a mark for passing the test for a trained hunting dog (called ""VGP"", ""Verband-Gebrauchsprüfung"") in Germany. == Popularity == Dachshunds are one of the most popular dogs in the United States, ranking 12th in the 2018 AKC registration statistics. They are popular with urban and apartment dwellers, ranking among the top 10 most popular breeds in 76 of 190 major US cities surveyed by the AKC. There are organized local dachshund clubs in most major American cities, including New York, New Orleans, Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago. As of 2024, the American Kennel Club found the Dachshund to be the 6th most popular dog breed. In Art == Notable dogs and owners == John F. Kennedy bought a dachshund puppy while touring Europe in 1937 for his then-girlfriend Olivia. The puppy, named Dunker, never left Germany after Kennedy started to get allergic reactions. Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President, had a dachshund in the White House. William Randolph Hearst was an avid lover of dachshunds. When his own dachshund Helena died, he eulogized her in his ""In The News"" column. Fred, E. B. White's dachshund, appeared in many of his famous essays. Lump (pronounced [lʊmp]; German for ""rascal""), the pet of Pablo Picasso, who was thought to have inspired some of his artwork. Picasso & Lump tells the story of Picasso and Lump. Jack Ruby, the killer of Lee Harvey Oswald, had a dachshund named Sheba, which he often referred to as his wife. At the time he murdered Oswald, he had four of them—although he once had as many as 10. Andy Warhol had a pair of dachshunds, Archie and Amos, whom he depicted in his paintings and mentioned frequently in his diaries. Stanley and Boodgie, immortalized on canvas by owner David Hockney, and published in the book David Hockney's Dog Days. Wadl and Hexl, Kaiser Wilhelm II's famous ferocious pair.

Another one of his beloved dachshunds, Senta, is currently buried at Huis Doorn, Wilhelm's manor in the Netherlands. In Zelenogorsk, Russia, a parade of dachshunds pass by a dachshund monument every July 25 to commemorate the day the city was founded. Joe was the dachshund of General Claire Lee Chennault, commander of the Flying Tigers and then the China Air Task Force of the US Army Air Forces, and became the mascot of those organizations. Maxie, a dachshund owned by actress Marie Prevost, tried to awaken his dead mistress, who was found with small bites on her legs. Maxie's barking eventually summoned neighbors to the scene. The incident inspired the 1977 Nick Lowe song ""Marie Prevost"". Liliane Kaufmann, wife of Edgar J. Kaufmann who commissioned the home Fallingwater from Frank Lloyd Wright in 1935, was a well-known breeder and owner of long-haired dachshunds. At the Fallingwater bookstore, visitors are able to purchase a book titled Moxie, which is about one of the dachshunds who lived at Fallingwater. Liliane raised long-haired dachshunds and they traveled from Pittsburgh to Bear Run with her. The former Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II, is one of several Danish royals to keep dachshunds. Margrethe of Denmark has a particular fondness of dachshunds and has kept many throughout her life. Her 80th birthday, celebrated in 2020, was marked by posing with one of her favourites (Lilia) on the grounds of Fredensborg Castle. Obie is a dachshund who became infamous for his obesity, weighing as much as 77 pounds (35 kilograms), more than twice a normal-weight standard dachshund. He reached his target weight of 28 lb (13 kg) in July 2013. Carole Lombard and Clark Gable had a dachshund named Commissioner. Crusoe the Celebrity Dachshund gained fame on social media. In 2015, Crusoe came out with his The New York Times best-selling book titled Crusoe: Adventures of the Wiener Dog Extraordinaire!. In 2018, Crusoe came out with another book titled Crusoe: The Worldly Weiner Dog. At the 9th annual Shorty Awards, Crusoe won the best animal category. In 2018, Crusoe won the People's Choice Awards Animal Star of 2018.

3750,"('Procaspase activating compound 1',)",Medical," Some therapeutics for parasitic, cardiac and neurological diseases activate apoptosis. Therefore, the study of apoptotic proteins in pathogenic organisms is relevant. However, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis in unicellular organisms remain elusive, despite morphological evidence of its occurrence. In Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, metacaspase 3 (TcMCA3), seems to have a key role in parasite apoptosis. Accordingly, this work provides data concerning TcMCA3 regulation through its interaction with procaspase-activating compound 1 (PAC-1), a procaspase 3 activator. Indeed, PAC-1 reduced T. cruzi epimastigote viability with an IC Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) constitute only ~5% of ovarian neoplasms yet have significant consequences, as up to 80% of women with recurrent GCT will die of the disease. This study investigated the effectiveness of procaspase-activating compound 1 (PAC-1), an activator of procaspase-3, in treating adult GCT (AGCT) in combination with selected apoptosis-inducing agents. Sensitivity of the AGCT cell line KGN to these drugs, alone or in combination with PAC-1, was tested using a viability assay. Our results show a wide range in cytotoxic activity among the agents tested. Synergy with PAC-1 was most pronounced, both empirically and by mathematical modelling, when combined with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). This combination showed rapid kinetics of apoptosis induction as determined by caspase-3 activity, and strongly synergistic killing of both KGN as well as patient samples of primary and recurrent AGCT. We have demonstrated that the novel combination of two pro-apoptotic agents, TRAIL and PAC-1, significantly amplified the induction of apoptosis in AGCT cells, warranting further investigation of this combination as a potential therapy for AGCT. The tetracycline repressor (TetR)-regulated system is a widely used tool to study gene functions through control of its expression. Various effectors such as tetracycline (Tc) and doxycycline (Dox) quickly induce or shut down gene expression, but reversing gene expression has not been eligible due to long half-lives of such effectors. Here, we found that procaspase activating compound 1 (PAC-1) rapidly reduces transient expression of TetR-regulated green fluorescent protein (GFP) in mammalian cells. Next, we applied PAC-1 to control of expression of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) protein, whose downstream cellular events can be monitored by cell morphological changes. We observed that PAC-1 quickly reduces TRPM7 expression, consequently affecting cell morphology regulated by TRPM7. The present study demonstrates the first small molecule that efficiently turns off the TetR-regulated gene expression in mammalian cells, thereby precisely regulating the expression level of target gene.",Procaspase activating compound 1,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01105265598744154), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03992399200797081), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20148584246635437)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.0802738870552275e-05)])","('INFO; ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd2164?utm_source=openai), [pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b00413?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6172261/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=266, start_index=6, title='Activating the executioner | Nature Reviews Drug Discovery', type='url_citation', url='https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd2164?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=266, start_index=6, title='Removal of Metabolic Liabilities Enables Development of Derivatives of Procaspase-Activating Compound 1 (PAC-1) with Improved Pharmacokinetics | Journal of Medicinal Chemistry', type='url_citation', url='https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b00413?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=266, start_index=6, title='Procaspase-3-activating compound 1 stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and induces DNA damage by sequestering ferrous iron - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6172261/?utm_source=openai')])"
3751,"('Vortioxetine', 'Lu aa 21004', 'Brintellix', 'Lu aa21004', 'Vortioxetine free base')",Medical,"Vortioxetine, sold under the brand name Trintellix (in the US) and Brintellix (in the EU) among others, is an antidepressant medication of the serotonin modulator and stimulator (SMS) class used in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Its effectiveness is viewed as similar to that of other antidepressants. It is taken orally. Common side effects include nausea, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting (3-6% of people), and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, bleeding, mania, and SIADH. A withdrawal syndrome may occur if the medication is abruptly stopped or the dose is decreased. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not generally recommended. Vortioxetine's mechanism of action is not entirely understood but is believed to be related to increasing serotonin levels and possibly interacting with certain serotonin receptors. It was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 2013. In 2020, it was the 243rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Vortioxetine is utilized as a treatment for major depressive disorder, with its effectiveness shown to be similar to other antidepressants and its effect size has been described as modest. Vortioxetine may be used when other treatments have failed. A 2017 Cochrane review on vortioxetine determined that its place in the treatment of severe depression is unclear due to low-quality evidence and that more studies comparing vortioxetine to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the typical first-line treatments, are needed. Vortioxetine appears to work in depressed patients with anxiety. Vortioxetine is also used off-label for anxiety. A 2016 review found it was not useful in generalized anxiety disorder at 2.5, 5, and 10 mg doses (15 and 20 mg doses were not tested). A 2019 meta-analysis found that vortioxetine did not produce statistically significant results over placebo in the symptoms, quality of life, and remission rates of generalized anxiety disorder, but it was well-tolerated. However, a 2018 meta-analysis supported use and efficacy of vortioxetine for generalized anxiety disorder, though stated that more research was necessary to strengthen the evidence. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that there was uncertainty about the effectiveness of vortioxetine for anxiety due to existing evidence being of very low-quality. In a 2020 network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, vortioxetine was among the lowest remission rates for generalized anxiety disorder of the included medications (odds ratio = 1.30 for vortioxetine, range of odds ratios for other agents = 1.13–2.70). == Contraindications == Vortioxetine is contraindicated in those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), due to the possibility of serotonin syndrome. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects reported with vortioxetine are nausea, vomiting, constipation, and sexual dysfunction, among others. With the exceptions of nausea and sexual dysfunction, these side effects were reported by less than or equal to 10% of study participants given vortioxetine. Significant percentages of placebo-treated participants also report these side effects. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse effects in clinical trials was 8% with vortioxetine versus 3% with placebo. Sexual dysfunction, such as decreased libido, abnormal orgasm, delayed ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction, are well-known side effects of SSRIs and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). In clinical trials, sexual dysfunction occurred more often with vortioxetine than with placebo and appeared to be dose-dependent. Incidence of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction as measured with the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) were 14 to 20% for placebo and 16 to 34% for vortioxetine over a dosage range of 5 to 20 mg/day. The incidence of sexual dysfunction with vortioxetine was similar to that with the SNRI duloxetine, which had an incidence of 26 to 28% at the used dosage of 60 mg/day. However, treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction caused by a prior SSRI was better improved by switching to vortioxetine than by switching to the SSRI escitalopram. In another study, vortioxetine at a dosage of 10 mg/day though not at 20 mg/day produced less sexual dysfunction than the SSRI paroxetine. These findings suggest that although vortioxetine can still cause sexual dysfunction itself, it may cause somewhat less sexual dysfunction than SSRIs and might be a useful alternative option for people experiencing sexual dysfunction with these medications. The rates of spontaneously reported sexual dysfunction are much lower than those obtained when researchers specifically ask subjects about sexual dysfunction (using the ASEX rating scale). Based on preliminary clinical studies, vortioxetine may cause less emotional blunting than SSRIs and SNRIs. If vortioxetine is used in combination with other serotonergic drugs like MAOIs or SSRIs, this may result in serotonin syndrome. == Interactions == Vortioxetine is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP2D6 may modify the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine and necessitate dosage adjustments. Bupropion, a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, has been found to increase peak levels of vortioxetine by 2.1-fold and total vortioxetine levels by 2.3-fold (bupropion dosed at 300 mg/day and vortioxetine dosed at 10 mg/day). The incidence of side effects with vortioxetine, like nausea, headache, vomiting, and insomnia, was correspondingly increased with the combination. Other strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, like fluoxetine, paroxetine, and quinidine, may have similar influences on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine, and it is recommended that the dosage of vortioxetine be reduced by half when it is administered in combination with such medications. Lesser interactions have additionally been identified for vortioxetine with the cytochrome P450 inhibitors ketoconazole and fluconazole. Rifampicin, a strong and broad cytochrome P450 inducer (though notably not of CYP2D6), has been found to decrease peak levels of vortioxetine by 51% and total levels of vortioxetine by 72% (rifampicin dosed at 600 mg/day and vortioxetine at 20 mg/day). Similar influences on vortioxetine pharmacokinetics may also occur with other strong cytochrome P450 inducers like carbamazepine and phenytoin. As such, it is recommended that increasing vortioxetine dosage be considered when it is given in combination with strong cytochrome P450 inducers. The maximum recommended dose should not exceed three times the original vortioxetine dose. Vortioxetine and its metabolites show no meaningful interactions with a variety of assessed cytochrome P450 enzymes and transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein) and hence vortioxetine is not expected to importantly influence the pharmacokinetics of other medications. The combination of vortioxetine with MAOIs, including other MAOIs like linezolid and intravenous methylene blue, may cause serotonin syndrome and is contraindicated. The risk of serotonin syndrome may also be increased when vortioxetine is combined with other serotonergic drugs, like SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St John's wort, fentanyl, and lithium, among others. However, vortioxetine is not considered to be contraindicated with serotonergic medications besides MAOIs. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Vortioxetine increases serotonin concentrations in the brain by inhibiting its reuptake in the synapse, and also modulates (activates or blocks) certain serotonin receptors. This puts it in the class of serotonin modulators and stimulators, which also includes vilazodone. More specifically, vortioxetine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor, and antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT3, and 5-HT7 receptors, as well as an apparent ligand of the β1-adrenergic receptor. In terms of functional activity however, vortioxetine appears to be much more potent on serotonin reuptake inhibition and 5-HT3 receptor antagonism than for its interactions with the other serotonin receptors. Whereas vortioxetine has IC50 or EC50 values of 5.4 nM for the SERT and 12 nM for the 5-HT3 receptor, its values are 120 to 450 nM for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors. This translates to about 22- to 83-fold selectivity for SERT inhibition and 10- to 38-fold selectivity for 5-HT3 antagonism over activities at the other serotonin receptors. 5-HT3 antagonism appears to have a better effect on REM sleep compared to paroxetine. It has been claimed that the serotonin transporter (SERT) and 5-HT3 receptor may be primarily occupied at lower clinical doses of vortioxetine and that the 5-HT1B, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT7 receptors may additionally be occupied at higher doses. Occupancy of the serotonin transporter with vortioxetine in young men was found to be highest in the raphe nucleus with median occupancies of 25%, 53%, and 98% after 9 days of administration with 2.5, 10, and 60 mg/day vortioxetine. In another study, serotonin transporter occupancy in men was 50%, 65%, and ≥80% for 5, 10, and 20 mg/day vortioxetine. Vortioxetine at 5 mg/day may produce antidepressant effects and result in SERT occupancy as low as 50%. This is in apparent contrast to SSRIs and SNRIs, which appear to require a minimum of 70 to 80% occupancy for antidepressant efficacy. These findings are suggestive that the antidepressant effects of vortioxetine may be mediated by serotonin receptor interactions in addition to serotonin reuptake inhibition. A study found no significant occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor with vortioxetine at 30 mg/day for 9 days, which suggests that at least this specific serotonin receptor may not be involved in the clinical pharmacology of vortioxetine. However, methodological concerns were noted that may limit the interpretability of this result. Occupancy of other serotonin receptors like 5-HT3 and 5-HT7 by vortioxetine in humans does not seem to have been studied. In relation to the preceding, the contribution of serotonin receptor interactions to the antidepressant effects of vortioxetine is unknown and remains to be established. Uncertainties remain about whether vortioxetine is indeed a clinically multimodal antidepressant or whether it is effectively ""[just] another selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor"". Antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor has been found to enhance the increase in brain serotonin levels produced by serotonin reuptake inhibition in animal studies. Whether or not the 5-HT3 receptor antagonism of vortioxetine likewise does this in humans or contributes to its clinical antidepressant efficacy is unclear. SSRIs and 5-HT1A receptor agonists often produce nausea as a side effect, whereas 5-HT3 receptor antagonists like ondansetron are antiemetics and have been found to be effective in treating SSRI-induced nausea. It was thought that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonism of vortioxetine would reduce the incidence of nausea relative to SSRIs. However, clinical trials found significant and dose-dependent rates of nausea with vortioxetine that appeared to be comparable to those found with the SNRI duloxetine. === Pharmacokinetics === Vortioxetine is well-absorbed when taken orally and has an oral bioavailability of 75%. It is systemically detectable after a single oral dose by 0.781 hours. Peak levels of vortioxetine are reached within 7 to 11 hours post-dose with single or multiple doses. Steady-state levels of vortioxetine are generally reached within 2 weeks of administration, with 90% of individuals reaching 90% of steady state after 12 days of administration. Steady-state peak levels of vortioxetine with doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/day were 9, 18, and 33 ng/mL, respectively. The accumulation index of vortioxetine (area-under-the-curve levels after a single dose versus at steady state) is 5 to 6. A loading dose given intravenously has been found to achieve steady-state levels more rapidly with oral vortioxetine therapy. The pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine are known to be linear and dose proportional over a range of 2.5 to 75 mg for single doses and 2.5 to 60 mg for multiple doses. Food has no influence on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine. The apparent volume of distribution of vortioxetine is large and ranges from 2,500 to 3,400 L after single or multiple doses of 5 to 20 mg vortioxetine, with extensive extravascular distribution. The plasma protein binding of vortioxetine is approximately 98 or 99%, with about 1.25 ± 0.48% free or unbound. Vortioxetine is extensively metabolized by oxidation via cytochrome P450 enzymes and subsequent glucuronidation via UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. CYP2D6 is the primary enzyme involved in the metabolism of vortioxetine, but others including CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 are also involved. It is also metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and aldehyde oxidase. Six metabolites of vortioxetine have been identified. The major metabolite of vortioxetine (Lu AA34443) is inactive and its minor active metabolite (Lu AA39835) is not thought to cross the blood–brain barrier. The remaining metabolites are glucuronide conjugates. Hence, vortioxetine itself is thought to be primarily responsible for its pharmacological activity. The estimated total clearance of vortioxetine ranges from 30 to 41 L/h. The elimination half-life of vortioxetine is 66 hours, with a range of 59 to 69 hours after single or multiple doses. Elimination of vortioxetine is almost entirely via the liver (99%) rather than the kidneys (<1%). Approximately 85% of vortioxetine was recovered in a single-dose excretion study after 15 days, with 59% in urine and 26% in feces. === Pharmacogenomics === Genetic variations in cytochrome P450 enzymes can influence exposure to vortioxetine. CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers have approximately 2-fold higher clearance of vortioxetine than CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The estimated clearance rates were 52.9, 34.1, 26.6, and 18.1 L/h for CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers. Area-under-the-curve levels of vortioxetine were 35.5% lower in CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers, though with significant overlap due to interindividual variability. Dosage adjustment for CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers is considered to not be necessary. Vortioxetine exposure in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is expected to be approximately twice as high as in extensive metabolizers. Depending on the individual response, dosage adjustment may be considered for CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, with a maximum recommended dosage of 10 mg/day for known such individuals. In addition to CYP2D6, CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers have 1.4-fold higher clearance of vortioxetine than poor metabolizers. However, this is not considered to be clinically important and dose adjustment is not considered to be necessary based on CYP2C19 status. == Chemistry == Vortioxetine (1-[2-(2,4-dimethylphenylsulfanyl)phenyl]piperazine) is a bis-aryl-sulfanyl amine as well as piperazine derivative. The acid dissociation constant (pKa) values for vortioxetine hydrobromide were determined to be 9.1 (± 0.1) and 3.0 (± 0.2) according to an Australian Public Assessment Report. == History == Vortioxetine was invented by scientists at Lundbeck who reported the rationale and synthesis for the drug (then called Lu AA21004) in a 2011 paper. In 2007, the compound was in Phase II clinical trials, and Lundbeck and Takeda entered into a partnership in which Takeda paid Lundbeck $40 million up-front, with promises of up to $345 million in milestone payments, and Takeda agreed to pay most of the remaining cost of developing the drug. The companies agreed to co-promote the drug in the US and Japan, and that Lundbeck would receive a royalty on all such sales. The deal included another drug candidate, tedatioxetine (Lu AA24530), and could be expanded to include two other Lundbeck compounds. Vortioxetine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults in September 2013, and it was approved in the European Union in December 2013. == Society and culture == It is manufactured by the pharmaceutical companies Lundbeck and Takeda. === Names === Vortioxetine was previously sold under the brand name Brintellix in the United States, but in May 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a name change to Trintellix in order to avoid confusion with the blood-thinning medication Brilinta (ticagrelor). Other brand names include Torvox, Vantaxa, Voxigain, and Trivoxetin. == Research == Vortioxetine was under development for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but development for these indications was discontinued. As of August 2021, vortioxetine remains in development for the treatment of anxiety disorders, binge-eating disorder, and bipolar disorder. It is in phase II clinical trials for these indications. There is also interest in vortioxetine for the potential treatment of social phobia, neuropathic pain, and for cognitive enhancement in major depression. == References ==",Brintellix,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.0874729418428615e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00033945043105632067)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/trintellix.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Trintellix Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/trintellix.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a major metabolite of antioxidant polyphenols found in green tea. It has mixed effects on normal and cancer cells in in vitro and in vivo studies. It is produced commercially from vanillin. == Biological effects == Protocatechuic acid (PCA) is antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. PCA extracted from Hibiscus sabdariffa protected against chemically induced liver toxicity in vivo. In vitro testing documented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of PCA, while liver protection in vivo was measured by chemical markers and histological assessment. PCA has been reported to induce apoptosis of human leukemia cells, as well as malignant HSG1 cells taken from human oral cavities, but PCA was found to have mixed effects on TPA-induced mouse skin tumours. Depending on the amount of PCA and the time before application, PCA could reduce or enhance tumour growth. Similarly, PCA was reported to increase proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of neural stem cells. In an in vitro model using HL-60 leukemia cells, protocatechuic acid showed an antigenotoxic effect and tumoricidal activity. In two preclinical investigations, protocatechuic acid from Hibiscus sabdariffa showed an excellent ability to effectively inhibit the replication of herpes simplex virus type 2 and to potently deactivate the catalytic activity of urease. == Occurrence in nature == Protocatechuic acid can be isolated from the stem bark of Boswellia dalzielii. and from leaves of Diospyros melanoxylon. The hardening of the protein component of insect cuticle has been shown to be due to the tanning action of an agent produced by oxidation of a phenolic substance. In the analogous hardening of the cockroach ootheca, the phenolic substance concerned is protocatechuic acid. === In foods === Açaí oil, obtained from the fruit of the açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea), is rich in protocatechuic acid (630±36 mg/kg). Protocatechuic acid also exists in the skins of some strains of onion as an antifungal mechanism, increasing endogenous resistance against smudge fungus. It is also found in Allium cepa (17,540 ppm). PCA occurs in roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa), which is used worldwide as a food and beverage. Protocatechuic acid is also found in mushrooms such as Agaricus bisporus or Phellinus linteus.

While the traditional preparations have been in use for millennia as a component of TCM-formulas, synephrine itself is not an approved over the counter drug. As a pharmaceutical, m-synephrine (phenylephrine) is still used as a sympathomimetic (i.e. for its hypertensive and vasoconstrictor properties), mostly by injection for the treatment of emergencies such as shock, and rarely orally for the treatment of bronchial problems associated with asthma and hay-fever. There is a difference between studies concerning synephrine as a single chemical entity (synephrine can exist in the form of either of two stereoisomers, d- and l-synephrine, which are chemically and pharmacologically distinct), and synephrine which is mixed with other drugs and/or botanical extracts in a ""supplement"", as well as synephrine which is present as only one chemical component in a naturally-occurring mixture of phytochemicals such as the rind or fruit of a bitter orange. Mixtures containing synephrine as only one of their chemical components (regardless of whether these are of synthetic or natural origin) should not be assumed to produce exactly the same biological effects as synephrine alone. In physical appearance, synephrine is a colorless, crystalline solid and is water-soluble. Its molecular structure is based on a phenethylamine skeleton and is related to those of many other drugs and to the major neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine. == Natural occurrences == Synephrine, although already known as a synthetic organic compound, was first isolated as a natural product from the leaves of various Citrus trees, and its presence noted in different Citrus juices, by Stewart and co-workers in the early 1960s. A survey of the distribution of synephrine amongst the higher plants was published in 1970 by Wheaton and Stewart. It has subsequently been detected in Evodia and Zanthoxylum species, all plants of the family Rutaceae. Trace levels (0.003%) of synephrine have also been detected in the dried leaves of Pogostemon cablin (patchouli, Lamiaceae). It is also found in certain cactus species of the genera Coryphantha and Dolichothele. However, this compound is found predominantly in a number of Citrus species, including ""bitter"" orange varieties. === In Citrus === Extracts of unripe fruit from Asian cultivars of Citrus aurantium (commonly known as ""bitter"" orange), collected in China, were reported to contain synephrine levels of about 0.1–0.3%, or ~1–3 mg/g; Analysis of dried fruit of C. aurantium grown in Italy showed a concentration of synephrine of ~1 mg/g, with peel containing over three times more than the pulp. Sweet oranges of the Tarocco, Naveline and Navel varieties, bought on the Italian market, were found to contain ~13–34 μg/g (corresponding to 13–34 mg/kg) synephrine (with roughly equal concentrations in juice and separated pulp); from these results, it was calculated that eating one ""average"" Tarocco orange would result in the consumption of ~6 mg of synephrine. An analysis of 32 different orange ""jams"", originating mostly in the US and UK, but including samples from France, Italy, Spain, or Lebanon, showed synephrine levels ranging from 0.05 mg/g–0.0009 mg/g in those jams made from bitter oranges, and levels of 0.05 mg/g–0.006 mg/g of synephrine in jams made from sweet oranges. Synephrine has been found in marmalade made from Citrus unshiu (Satsuma mandarin) obtained in Japan, at a concentration of ~0.12 mg/g (or about 2.4 mg/20g serving). Most of the orange marmalades made in the US are produced using ""sweet"" oranges (C. sinensis), whereas ""bitter"" or Seville oranges (C. aurantium) are used for making the more traditional, bitterer marmalades in the United Kingdom. A sample of commercial Japanese C. unshiu juice was found to contain ~0.36 mg/g synephrine (or roughly 360 mg/L), while in juice products obtained from a Satsuma mandarin variety grown in California, levels of synephrine ranged from 55 to 160 mg/L . Juices from ""sweet"" oranges purchased in Brazilian markets were found to contain ~10–22 mg/L synephrine; commercial orange soft drinks obtained on the Brazilian market had an average synephrine content of ~1 mg/L. Commercial Italian orange juices contained ~13–32 mg/L of synephrine In a survey of over 50 citrus fruit juices, either commercially-prepared or hand-squeezed from fresh fruit, obtained on the US market, Avula and co-workers found synephrine levels ranging from ~4–60 mg/L; no synephrine was detected in juices from grapefruit, lime, or lemon. An analysis of the synephrine levels in a range of different citrus fruits, carried out on juices that had been extracted from fresh, peeled fruit, was reported by Uckoo and co-workers, with the following results: Marrs sweet orange (C. sinensis Tan.): ~85 mg/L; Nova tangerine (C. reticulata Tan.): ~78 mg/L; clementine (C. clementina Tan.): ~115 mg/L; Meyer lemon (C. limon Tan.) ~3 mg/kg; Ugli tangelo (C. reticulata × C. paradisi) ~47 mg/kg. No synephrine was detected in: Rio Red grapefruit (C. paradisi Macf.); Red-fleshed pummelo (C. grandis Tan.); or Wekiwa tangelo (C. reticulata × C. paradisi). Numerous additional comparable analyses of the synephrine content of Citrus fruits and products derived from them may be found in the research literature. === In humans and other animals === Low levels of synephrine have been found in normal human urine, as well as in other mammalian tissue. To reduce the likelihood that the synephrine detected in urine had a dietary origin, the subjects tested by Ibrahim and co-workers abstained from the consumption of any citrus products for 48 hours prior to providing urine samples. A 2006 study of synephrine in human blood platelets by D'Andrea and co-workers showed increased levels in platelets from patients suffering from aura-associated migraine (0.72 ng/108 platelets, compared to 0.33 ng/108 platelets in control subjects). Earlier, the same research group had reported a normal human blood plasma level of synephrine of 0.90–13.69 ng/mL. === Stereoisomers === Since synephrine exists as either of two enantiomers (see Chemistry section below for further discussion), which do not produce identical biological effects (see Pharmacology section below) some researchers have examined the stereoisomeric composition of synephrine extracted from natural sources. Although it seems clear that synephrine is found in those Citrus species which have been studied predominantly as the l-isomer, low levels of d-synephrine have been detected in juice and marmalade made from C. unshiu, and low levels (0.002%) have been reported in fresh fruit from C. aurantium. There are indications that some d-synephrine may be formed by the racemization of l-synephrine as a result of the processing of fresh fruit, although this matter has not been completely clarified. However, regardless of the situation in Citrus species, Ranieri and McLaughlin reported the isolation of racemic (i.e. a mixture of equal amounts of d- and l- stereoisomers) synephrine from a cactus of the genus Dolichothele, under conditions that would be unlikely to cause a significant amount of racemization. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of synephrine in Citrus species is believed to follow the pathway: tyrosine → tyramine → N-methyltyramine → synephrine, involving the enzymes tyrosine decarboxylase in the first step, tyramine N-methyltransferase in the second, and N-methyl-tyramine-β-hydroxylase in the third. This pathway differs from that thought to occur in animals, involving octopamine: tyramine → octopamine → synephrine, where the conversion of tyramine to octopamine is mediated by dopamine-β-hydroxylase, and the conversion of octopamine to synephrine by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. == Presence in nutritional/dietary supplements == Some dietary supplements, sold for the purposes of promoting weight-loss or providing energy, contain synephrine as one of several constituents. Usually, the synephrine is present as a natural component of Citrus aurantium (""bitter orange""), bound up in the plant matrix, but could also be of synthetic origin, or a purified phytochemical (i.e. extracted from a plant source and purified to chemical homogeneity). The concentration range found by Santana and co-workers in five different supplements purchased in the US was about 5–14 mg/g. == Pharmaceutical use == As a synthetic drug, synephrine first appeared in Europe in the late 1920s, under the name of Sympatol. One of the earliest papers describing its pharmacological and toxicological properties was written by Lasch, who obtained it from the Viennese company Syngala. By 1930, Sympatol was referred to as a Boehringer product, while one of the first US Patents describing its preparation and use was assigned to Frederick Stearns & Co. in 1933. Despite the date of this patent, clinical and pharmacological research on synephrine obtained from Frederick Stearns & Co was being carried out in the US by 1930. Writing in 1931, Hartung reported that in 1930 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association had accepted synephrine for inclusion in its list of “New and Non-Official Remedies” as an agent for the treatment, by either oral or parenteral administration, ""of attacks of hay fever, asthma, coughing, spasms of asthma and pertussis (whooping cough)."" However, synephrine was dropped from the council's list in 1934, and its apparent re-advertising as a new drug by the Stearns company ten years later elicited a scathing comment from the Editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The third edition (1965) of Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine stated, with reservations, that synephrine was ""advertised as an antihistaminic to be used in the treatment of the common cold..."", under the trade name of ""Synephrin Tartrate"", and indicated that the dose was 100 mg, given intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Published in 1966, the Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry described synephrine (in the form of its racemic tartrate) as a sympathomimetic agent that was ""less effective than epinephrine"", and which had been used for the treatment of chronic hypotension, collapse due to shock, and other conditions leading to hypotension. In a later (1972) textbook, synephrine was described as a drug, sold in Europe, that was administered in situations involving shock, such as surgical or bacteremic shock, and spinal anesthesia-related shock. The recommended dose was given here as 25–50 mg, by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. There is no mention of synephrine in editions of Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine later than the 3rd, nor is there any reference to synephrine in the 2012 Physicians' Desk Reference, nor in the current FDA ""Orange Book"". One current reference source describes synephrine as a vasoconstrictor that has been given to hypotensive patients, orally or by injection, in doses of 20–100 mg. One website from a healthcare media company, accessed in February, 2013, refers to oxedrine as being indicated for hypotensive states, in oral doses of 100–150 mg tid, and as a ""conjunctival decongestant"" to be topically applied as a 0.5% solution. However, no supporting references are provided. == Names == There has been some confusion about the biological effects of synephrine because of the similarity of this un-prefixed name to the names m-synephrine, Meta-synephrine and Neosynephrine, all of which refer to a related drug and naturally-occurring amine more commonly known as phenylephrine. Although there are chemical and pharmacological similarities between synephrine and phenylephrine, they are nevertheless different substances. The confusion is compounded by the fact that synephrine has been marketed as a drug under numerous different names, including Sympatol, Sympathol, Synthenate, and oxedrine, while phenylephrine has also been called m-Sympatol. The synephrine with which this article deals is sometimes referred to as p-synephrine in order to distinguish it from its positional isomers, m-synephrine and o-synephrine. A comprehensive listing of alternative names for synephrine may be found in the ChemSpider entry (see Chembox, at right). Confusion exists over the distinctions between p- and m-synephrine. However, an examination of the references cited in support of this statement show that all the evidence for the presence of m-synephrine in C. aurantium derives from a report by Penzak and co-workers, whose Abstract states that m-synephrine was found in C. aurantium, whereas a close reading of the text of the paper itself reveals that the authors (although apparently uncertain about which synephrine regio-isomer had been found in the plant by earlier investigators) were aware that their analytical technique could not distinguish between m- and p-synephrine, and did not claim that m-synephrine was present. Thus the Abstract is at variance with the experimental findings given in the full text of the paper, but this error has propagated through subsequent publications. Even the name ""p-synephrine"" is not unambiguous, since it does not specify stereochemistry. The only completely unambiguous names for synephrine are: (R)-(−)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the l-enantiomer); (S)-(+)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the d-enantiomer); and (R,S)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the racemate, or d,l-synephrine) (see Chemistry section). == Chemistry == === Properties === In terms of molecular structure, synephrine has a phenethylamine skeleton, with a phenolic hydroxy- group, an alcoholic hydroxy- group, and an N-methylated amino-group. Alternatively, synephrine might be described as a phenylethanolamine with an N-methyl and p-hydroxy substituent. The amino-group confers basic properties on the molecule, whereas the phenolic –OH group is weakly acidic: the apparent (see original article for discussion) pKas for protonated synephrine are 9.55 (phenolic H) and 9.79 (ammonium H). Common salts of racemic synephrine are its hydrochloride, C9H13NO2.HCl, m.p. 150–152°, the oxalate (C9H13NO2)2.C2H2O4, m.p. 221–222 °C, and the tartrate (Sympatol), (C9H13NO2)2.C4H6O6, m.p. 188–190 °C. The presence of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic C of the synephrine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists in the form of two enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, or as the racemic mixture, d,l- synephrine. The dextrorotatory d-isomer corresponds to the (S)-configuration, and the levorotatory l-isomer to the (R)-configuration. Racemic synephrine has been resolved using ammonium 3-bromo-camphor-8-sulfonate. The enantiomers were not characterized as their free bases, but converted to the hydrochloride salts, with the following properties: (S)-(+)-C9H13NO2.HCl: m.p. 178 °C; [α] = +42.0°, c 0.1 (H2O); (R)-(−)-C9H13NO2.HCl: m.p. 176 °C; [α] = −39.0°, c 0.2 (H2O) (−)-Synephrine, as the free base isolated from a Citrus source, has m.p. 162–164 °C (with decomposition). The X-ray structure for synephrine has been determined. === Synthesis === Early and seemingly inefficient syntheses of synephrine were discussed by Priestley and Moness, writing in 1940. These chemists optimized a route beginning with the O-benzoylation of p-hydroxy-phenacyl chloride, followed by reaction of the resulting O-protected chloride with N-methyl-benzylamine to give an amino-ketone. This intermediate was then hydrolyzed with HCl/alcohol to the p-hydroxy-aminoketone, and the product then reduced catalytically to give (racemic) synephrine. A later synthesis, due to Bergmann and Sulzbacher, began with the O-benzylation of p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, followed by a Reformatskii reaction of the protected aldehyde with ethyl bromoacetate/Zn to give the expected β-hydroxy ester. This intermediate was converted to the corresponding acylhydrazide with hydrazine, then the acylhydrazide reacted with HNO2, ultimately yielding the p-benzyloxy-phenyloxazolidone. This was N-methylated using dimethyl sulfate, then hydrolyzed and O-debenzylated by heating with HCl, to give racemic synephrine. === Structural relationships === Much reference has been made in the literature (both lay and professional) of the structural kinship of synephrine with ephedrine, or with phenylephrine, often with the implication that the perceived similarities in structure should result in similarities in pharmacological properties. However, from a chemical perspective, synephrine is also related to a very large number of other drugs whose structures are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and although some properties are common, others are not, making unqualified comparisons and generalizations inappropriate. Thus, replacement of the N-methyl group in synephrine with a hydrogen atom gives octopamine; replacement of the β-hydroxy group in synephrine by a H atom gives N-methyltyramine; replacement of the synephrine phenolic 4-OH group by a –H gives halostachine. If the synephrine phenolic 4-OH group is shifted to the meta-, or 3-position on the benzene ring, the compound known as phenylephrine (or m-synephrine, or ""Neo-synephrine"") results; if the same group is shifted to the ortho-, or 2-position on the ring, o-synephrine results. Addition of another phenolic –OH group to the 3-position of the benzene ring produces the neurotransmitter epinephrine; addition of a methyl group to the α-position in the side-chain of synephrine gives oxilofrine (methylsynephrine). Four stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers) are possible for this substance. Extension of the synephrine N-methyl substituent by one methylene unit to an N-ethyl gives the hypotensive experimental drug ""Sterling #573""/""Aethyl-Sympatol"". The above structural relationships all involve a change at one position in the synephrine molecule, and numerous other similar changes, many of which have been explored, are possible. However, the structure of ephedrine differs from that of synephrine at two different positions: ephedrine has no substituent on the phenyl ring where synephrine has a 4-OH group, and ephedrine has a methyl group on the position α- to the N in the side-chain, where syneprine has only a H atom. Furthermore, ""synephrine"" exists as either of two enantiomers, while ""ephedrine"" exists as one of four different enantiomers; there are, in addition, racemic mixtures of these enantiomers. The main differences of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the ephedrines are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct sympathomimetic drugs while the ephedrines are both direct and indirect sympathomimetics. One of the main reasons for these differential effects is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted phenyl ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs. == Pharmacology == === Synopsis === Classical pharmacological studies on animals and isolated animal tissues showed that the principal actions of parenterally-administered synephrine included raising blood-pressure, dilating the pupil, and constricting peripheral blood vessels. There is now ample evidence(what evidence?) that synephrine produces most of its biological effects by acting as an agonist (i.e. stimulating) at adrenergic receptors, with a distinct preference for the α1 over the α2 sub-type. However, the potency of synephrine at these receptors is relatively low (i.e. relatively large concentrations of the drug are required to activate them). The potency of synephrine at adrenergic receptors of the β-class (regardless of sub-type) is much lower than at α-receptors. There is some evidence that synephrine also has weak activity at 5-HT receptors, and that it interacts with TAAR1 (trace amine-associated receptor 1). In common with virtually all other simple phenylethanolamines (β-hydroxy-phenethylamines), the (R)-(−)-, or l-, enantiomer of synephrine is more potent than the (S)-(+)-, or d-, enantiomer in most, but not all preparations studied. However, the majority of studies have been conducted with a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers. Since the details regarding such variables as test species, receptor source, route of administration, drug concentration, and stereochemical composition are important but often incomplete in other Reviews and Abstracts of research publications, many are provided in the more technical review below, in order to support as fully as possible the broad statements made in this Synopsis. === Pharmacology research === Pharmacological studies on synephrine date back to the late 1920s, when it was observed that injected synephrine raised blood pressure, constricted peripheral blood vessels, dilated pupils, stimulated the uterus, and relaxed the intestines in experimental animals. Representative of this early work is the paper by Tainter and Seidenfeld, who were the first researchers to systematically compare the different effects of the two synephrine enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, as well as of the racemate, d,l-synephrine, in various animal assays. In experiments on anesthetized cats, Tainter and Seidenfeld confirmed earlier reports of the increase in blood pressure produced by intravenous doses of synephrine, showing that the median pressor doses for the isomers were: l-synephrine: 0.5 mg/kg; d,l-synephrine: 1.0 mg/kg; and d-synephrine: 2–20 mg/kg. These effects lasted 2–3 minutes, peaking at ~30 seconds after administration. l-Synephrine was thus the more potent enantiomer, with about 1/60x the potency of the standard pressor l-epinephrine in the same assay. A later study, by Lands and Grant, showed that a dose of ~0.6 mg/kg of racemic synephrine, given intravenously to anesthetized dogs, produced a rise in blood pressure of 34 mmHg lasting 5–10 minutes, and estimated that this pressor activity was about 1/300x that of epinephrine. Using cats and dogs, Tainter and Seidenfeld observed that neither d- nor l-synephrine caused any changes in the tone of normal bronchi, in situ, even at ""maximum"" doses. Furthermore, the marked brocho-constriction produced by injections of histamine was not reversed by either l-synephrine or d,l-synephrine. In experiments with isolated sheep carotid artery, d-, l- and d,l-synephrine all showed some vasoconstrictor activity: l-synephrine was the most potent, producing strong contractions at a concentration of 1:10000. d-Synephrine was about 1/2 as potent as the l-isomer, but d,l-synephrine (which would have been expected to have a potency of 1/2 that of l-synephrine even if the d-isomer were completely inactive) did not produce significant and irregular contractions until a concentration of 1:2500had been reached, implying an inhibitory interaction between the two enantiomers. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in a rabbit ear preparation: 25 mg l-synephrine produced significant (50%) vasoconstriction, while the same concentration of d-synephrine elicited essentially no response. In contrast, d,l-synephrine did not produce any constriction up to 25 mg, but 25 – 50 mg caused a relaxation of the blood vessels, which again suggested that the d-isomer might be inhibiting the action of the l-isomer. Experiments on strips of rabbit duodenum showed that l-synephrine caused a modest reduction in contractions at a concentration of 1:17000, but that the effects of the d- and d,l- forms were much weaker. Racemic synephrine, given intramuscularly, or by instillation, was found to significantly reduce the inflammation caused by instillation of mustard oil into the eyes of rabbits. Subcutaneous injection of racemic synephrine into rabbits was reported to cause a large rise in blood sugar. In experiments on anesthetized cats, Papp and Szekeres found that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) raised the thresholds for auricular and ventricular fibrillation, an indication of anti-arrhythmic properties. Evidence that synephrine might have some central effects comes from the research of Song and co-workers, who studied the effects of synephrine in mouse models of anti-depressant activity. These researchers observed that oral doses of 0.3 – 10 mg/kg of racemic synephrine were effective in shortening the duration of immobility produced in the assays, but did not cause any changes in spontaneous motor activity in separate tests. This characteristic immobility could be counteracted by the pre-administration of prazosin. Subsequent experiments using the individual enanatiomers of synephrine revealed that although the d-isomer significantly reduced the duration of immobility in the tail suspension test, at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg, the l-isomer had no effect at the same dose. In mice pre-treated with reserpine, an oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg d-synephrine significantly reversed the hypothermia, while l-synephrine required a dose of 1 mg/kg to be effective. Experiments with slices of cerebral cortex taken from rat brain showed that d-synephrine inhibited the uptake of [3H]-norepinephrine with an IC50 = 5.8 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (IC50 = 13.5 μM). d-Synephrine also competitively inhibited the binding of nisoxetine to rat brain cortical slices, with a Ki = 4.5 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (Ki = 8.2 μM). In experiments on the release of [3H]-norepinephrine from rat brain cortical slices, however, the l-isomer of synephrine was a more potent enhancer of the release (EC50 = 8.2 μM) than the d-isomer (EC50 = 12.3 μM). This enhanced release by l-synephrine was blocked by nisoxetine. Burgen and Iversen, examining the effect of a broad range of phenethylamine-based drugs on [14C]-norepinephrine-uptake in the isolated rat heart, observed that racemic synephrine was a relatively weak inhibitor (IC50 = 0.12 μM) of the uptake. Another receptor-oriented study by Wikberg revealed that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) was a more potent agonist at guinea pig aorta α1 receptors (pD2 = 4.81) than at ileum α2 receptors (pD2 = 4.48), with a relative affinity ratio of α2/α1 = 0.10. Although clearly indicating a selectivity of synephrine for α1 receptors, its potency at this receptor sub-class is still relatively low, in comparison with that of phenylephrine (pD2 at α1 = 6.32). Brown and co-workers examined the effects of the individual enantiomers of synephrine on α1 receptors in rat aorta, and on α2 receptors in rabbit saphenous vein. In the aorta preparation, l-synephrine gave a pD2 = 5.38 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/1000), while d-synephrine had a pD2 = 3.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/50000); in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 7.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/6). No antagonism of norepinephrine was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10−6 M. In the rabbit saphenous assay, the pD2 of l-synephrine was 4.36 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/1700), and that of d-synephrine was < 3.00; in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 5.45 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/140). No antagonism of norepinephrine was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10−5 M. A study of the effects of synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) on strips of guinea pig aorta and on the field-stimulated guinea pig ileum showed that synephrine had an agonist potency of −logKa = 3.75 in the aorta assay. In comparison, epinephrine had a potency of −logKa = 5.70. There was no significant effect on the ileum at synephrine concentrations up to about 2 × 10−4 M, indicating selectivity for the α1 receptor, but relatively low potency. In binding experiments with central adrenergic receptors, using a preparation from rat cerebral cortex, l-synephrine had pIC50 = 3.35, and d-synephrine had pIC50 = 2.42 in competition against [3H]-prazosin (standard α1 ligand); against [3H]-yohimbine (standard α2 ligand), l-synephrine showed a pIC50 = 5.01, and d-synephrine showed a pIC50 = 4.17. Experiments conducted by Hibino and co-workers also showed that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) produced a dose-dependent constriction of isolated rat aorta strips, in the concentration range 10−5–3 × 10−6 M. This constriction was found to be competitively antagonized by prazosin (a standard α1 antagonist) and ketanserin, with prazosin being the more potent antagonist (pA2 = 9.38, vs pA2 = 8.23 for ketanserin). Synephrine constrictions were also antagonized by BRL-15,572, but not by SB-216,641 (used here as a selective 5-HT1B antagonist), or by propranolol (a common β antagonist). In studies on guinea pig atria and trachea, Jordan and co-workers also found that synephrine had negligible activity on β1 and β2 receptors, being about 40000x less potent than norepinephrine. Experiments with cultured white fat cells from several animal species, including human, by Carpéné and co-workers showed that racemic synephrine produced lipolytic effects, but only at high concentrations (0.1-1 mM). The potency, expressed in terms of pD2 of synephrine in these species was as follows: rat: 4.38; hamster: 5.32; guinea pig: 4.31; human: 4.94. In comparison, isoprenaline had a pD2 = 8.29 and norepinephrine had pD2 = 6.80 in human white fat cells. The lipolytic effect of 1 mM/L of synephrine on rat white fat cells was antagonized by various β-antagonists with the following inhibitory concentrations (IC50): bupranolol: 0.11 μM; CGP-20,712A (β1 antagonist): 6.09 μM; ICI-118,551 (β2 antagonist): 3.58 μM; SR-5923A (β3 antagonist): 17 μM. The binding of racemic synephrine to cloned human adrenergic receptors has been examined: Ma and co-workers found that synephrine bound to α1A, α2A and α2C with low affinity (pKi = 4.11 for α1A; 4.44 for α2A; 4.61 for α2C). Synephrine behaved as a partial agonist at α1A receptors, but as an antagonist at α2A and α2C sub-types. Racemic synephrine has been shown to be an agonist of the TAAR1, although its potency at the human TAAR1 is relatively low (EC50 = 23700 nM; Emax = 81.2%). == Pharmacokinetics == The pharmacokinetics of synephrine were studied by Hengstmann and Aulepp, who reported a peak plasma concentration at 1–2 hours, with an elimination half-life (T1/2) of ~ 2 hours. == Metabolism == Studies of the metabolism of synephrine by monoamine oxidases derived from rat brain mitochondria showed that synephrine was a substrate for deamination by both MAO-A and MAO-B, with Km = 250 μM and Vmax = 32.6 nM/mg protein/30 minutes; there was some evidence for preferential deamination by MAO-A. == Effects in humans == A number of studies of the effects of synephrine in humans, most of them focusing on its cardiovascular properties, have been performed since its introduction as a synthetic drug around 1930. The paper by Stockton and co-workers is representative, describing the effects of racemic synephrine in humans with particular attention to differences resulting from different routes of administration. Thus, it was shown by these investigators that intramuscular injections (average effective dose = 200 mg) of the drug produced an increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate, without affecting the diastolic pressure. The blood pressure increase reached a maximum (~25 mmHg) in 5 minutes following the injection, then gradually returned to normal over the course of 1 hour. Doses of drug greater than 200 mg caused side-effects such as heart palpitations, headache, sweating, and feelings of apprehension. When given intravenously, doses of 25–50 mg sufficed to produce a mean maximum increase in the blood pressure of 29 mmHg in 2 minutes, and a return to baseline within 30 minutes. Respiration was generally not affected during these experiments. Subcutaneous administration of synephrine in doses ≤ 200 mg had no effects on blood pressure or pulse rate. Oral doses of 500–1500 mg of the drug did not affect blood pressure or respiration, but pulse rate was increased by ~12%, and the highest doses caused nausea and vomiting. The i.m. administration of 75–500 mg of synephrine did not relieve acute asthma attacks, contradicting an earlier claim. However, the topical application of 1–3% solutions of the drug to the nasal mucosa of patients with sinusitis did produce a beneficial constriction without local irritation. Administration of synephrine by continuous intravenous infusion, at the rate of 4 mg/minute, significantly increased mean arterial and systolic pressure, but diastolic pressure and heart rate were unaltered.; further details of this investigation are summarized in a review by Fugh-Berman and Myers. There are a number of studies, references to many of which may be found in the review by Stohs and co-workers dealing with the effects produced by dietary supplements and herbal medications that contain synephrine as only one of many different chemical ingredients. These are outside the scope of the present article (see also the ""Safety/Efficacy/Controversy"" sub-section). == Toxicology == The acute toxicities of racemic synephrine in different animals, reported in terms of ""maximum tolerated dose"" after s.c administration, were as follows: mouse: 300 mg/kg; rat: 400 mg/kg; guinea pig: 400 mg/kg. ""Lethal doses"", given s.c., were found to be: mouse: 400 mg/kg; rat: 500 mg/kg; guinea pig: 500 mg/kg. Another study of this compound, administered i.v. in mice, gave an LD50 = 270 mg/kg. The ""subchronic toxicity"" of synephrine was judged to be low in mice, after administration of oral doses of 30 and 300 mg/kg over a period of 28 days. Generally, this treatment did not result in significant alterations in biochemical or hematological parameters, nor in relative organ weights, but some changes were noted in glutathione (GSH) concentration, and in the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). == Safety/efficacy/controversy == There exists considerable controversy about the safety and/or efficacy of synephrine-containing preparations, which are often confused with synephrine alone, sometimes with m-synephrine. Furthermore, this body of literature deals with mixtures containing synephrine as only one of several biologically active components, even, in some cases, without explicit confirmation of the presence of synephrine. == Invertebrates == In insects, synephrine has been found to be a very potent agonist at many invertebrate octopamine receptor preparations, and is even more potent than octopamine at a locust (Schistocerca americana gregaria) nerve-muscle preparation. Synephrine (racemic) is also more potent than octopamine (racemic) at inducing light-emission in the firefly (Photinus species) light organ. Synephrine exhibits similarly high potency in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity and in decreasing clotting time in lobster (Homarus americanus) hematocytes. Racemic synephrine was found to increase cAMP in the abdominal epidermis of the blood-sucking bug, Rhodnius prolixus. Rachinsky reported that synephrine was equipotent with octopamine in stimulating JH (juvenile hormone) release in the corpora allata of honey bee (Apis mellifera), but Woodring and Hoffmann found that synephrine had no effect on the synthesis of JH III, in in vitro preparations from the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. == Footnotes == == See also == Halostachine Deterenol Octopamine == References ==",Oxedrine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.28662511706352234), ('OG', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ENO', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.4849443838757e-06), (' FOOD', -0.03854928910732269), (',', -0.03806260600686073), (' MED', -0.42972028255462646), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.6935468912124634), (' PERSONAL', -0.011435751803219318), (' CARE', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.5126309990882874), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), (',', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.12798242270946503), (',', -0.03805851191282272), ('ĠEND', -0.08510152995586395), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02976534329354763)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3754,"('Synephrine (hydrochloride)', 'Oxedrine hydrochloride', 'Synephrine', 'Oxedrine', 'P-synephrine')","Food, Medical","Synephrine, or, more specifically, p-synephrine, is an alkaloid, occurring naturally in some plants and animals, and also in approved drugs products as its m-substituted analog known as neo-synephrine. p-Synephrine (or formerly Sympatol and oxedrine [BAN]) and m-synephrine are known for their longer acting adrenergic effects compared to epinephrine and norepinephrine. This substance is present at very low concentrations in common foodstuffs such as orange juice and other orange (Citrus species) products, both of the ""sweet"" and ""bitter"" variety. The preparations used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), also known as Zhi Shi (枳实), are the immature and dried whole oranges from Citrus aurantium (Fructus Aurantii Immaturus). Extracts of the same material or purified synephrine are also marketed in the US, sometimes in combination with caffeine, as a weight-loss-promoting dietary supplement for oral consumption. While the traditional preparations have been in use for millennia as a component of TCM-formulas, synephrine itself is not an approved over the counter drug. As a pharmaceutical, m-synephrine (phenylephrine) is still used as a sympathomimetic (i.e. for its hypertensive and vasoconstrictor properties), mostly by injection for the treatment of emergencies such as shock, and rarely orally for the treatment of bronchial problems associated with asthma and hay-fever. There is a difference between studies concerning synephrine as a single chemical entity (synephrine can exist in the form of either of two stereoisomers, d- and l-synephrine, which are chemically and pharmacologically distinct), and synephrine which is mixed with other drugs and/or botanical extracts in a ""supplement"", as well as synephrine which is present as only one chemical component in a naturally-occurring mixture of phytochemicals such as the rind or fruit of a bitter orange. Mixtures containing synephrine as only one of their chemical components (regardless of whether these are of synthetic or natural origin) should not be assumed to produce exactly the same biological effects as synephrine alone. In physical appearance, synephrine is a colorless, crystalline solid and is water-soluble. Its molecular structure is based on a phenethylamine skeleton and is related to those of many other drugs and to the major neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine. == Natural occurrences == Synephrine, although already known as a synthetic organic compound, was first isolated as a natural product from the leaves of various Citrus trees, and its presence noted in different Citrus juices, by Stewart and co-workers in the early 1960s. A survey of the distribution of synephrine amongst the higher plants was published in 1970 by Wheaton and Stewart. It has subsequently been detected in Evodia and Zanthoxylum species, all plants of the family Rutaceae. Trace levels (0.003%) of synephrine have also been detected in the dried leaves of Pogostemon cablin (patchouli, Lamiaceae). It is also found in certain cactus species of the genera Coryphantha and Dolichothele. However, this compound is found predominantly in a number of Citrus species, including ""bitter"" orange varieties. === In Citrus === Extracts of unripe fruit from Asian cultivars of Citrus aurantium (commonly known as ""bitter"" orange), collected in China, were reported to contain synephrine levels of about 0.1–0.3%, or ~1–3 mg/g; Analysis of dried fruit of C. aurantium grown in Italy showed a concentration of synephrine of ~1 mg/g, with peel containing over three times more than the pulp. Sweet oranges of the Tarocco, Naveline and Navel varieties, bought on the Italian market, were found to contain ~13–34 μg/g (corresponding to 13–34 mg/kg) synephrine (with roughly equal concentrations in juice and separated pulp); from these results, it was calculated that eating one ""average"" Tarocco orange would result in the consumption of ~6 mg of synephrine. An analysis of 32 different orange ""jams"", originating mostly in the US and UK, but including samples from France, Italy, Spain, or Lebanon, showed synephrine levels ranging from 0.05 mg/g–0.0009 mg/g in those jams made from bitter oranges, and levels of 0.05 mg/g–0.006 mg/g of synephrine in jams made from sweet oranges. Synephrine has been found in marmalade made from Citrus unshiu (Satsuma mandarin) obtained in Japan, at a concentration of ~0.12 mg/g (or about 2.4 mg/20g serving). Most of the orange marmalades made in the US are produced using ""sweet"" oranges (C. sinensis), whereas ""bitter"" or Seville oranges (C. aurantium) are used for making the more traditional, bitterer marmalades in the United Kingdom. A sample of commercial Japanese C. unshiu juice was found to contain ~0.36 mg/g synephrine (or roughly 360 mg/L), while in juice products obtained from a Satsuma mandarin variety grown in California, levels of synephrine ranged from 55 to 160 mg/L . Juices from ""sweet"" oranges purchased in Brazilian markets were found to contain ~10–22 mg/L synephrine; commercial orange soft drinks obtained on the Brazilian market had an average synephrine content of ~1 mg/L. Commercial Italian orange juices contained ~13–32 mg/L of synephrine In a survey of over 50 citrus fruit juices, either commercially-prepared or hand-squeezed from fresh fruit, obtained on the US market, Avula and co-workers found synephrine levels ranging from ~4–60 mg/L; no synephrine was detected in juices from grapefruit, lime, or lemon. An analysis of the synephrine levels in a range of different citrus fruits, carried out on juices that had been extracted from fresh, peeled fruit, was reported by Uckoo and co-workers, with the following results: Marrs sweet orange (C. sinensis Tan.): ~85 mg/L; Nova tangerine (C. reticulata Tan.): ~78 mg/L; clementine (C. clementina Tan.): ~115 mg/L; Meyer lemon (C. limon Tan.) ~3 mg/kg; Ugli tangelo (C. reticulata × C. paradisi) ~47 mg/kg. No synephrine was detected in: Rio Red grapefruit (C. paradisi Macf.); Red-fleshed pummelo (C. grandis Tan.); or Wekiwa tangelo (C. reticulata × C. paradisi). Numerous additional comparable analyses of the synephrine content of Citrus fruits and products derived from them may be found in the research literature. === In humans and other animals === Low levels of synephrine have been found in normal human urine, as well as in other mammalian tissue. To reduce the likelihood that the synephrine detected in urine had a dietary origin, the subjects tested by Ibrahim and co-workers abstained from the consumption of any citrus products for 48 hours prior to providing urine samples. A 2006 study of synephrine in human blood platelets by D'Andrea and co-workers showed increased levels in platelets from patients suffering from aura-associated migraine (0.72 ng/108 platelets, compared to 0.33 ng/108 platelets in control subjects). Earlier, the same research group had reported a normal human blood plasma level of synephrine of 0.90–13.69 ng/mL. === Stereoisomers === Since synephrine exists as either of two enantiomers (see Chemistry section below for further discussion), which do not produce identical biological effects (see Pharmacology section below) some researchers have examined the stereoisomeric composition of synephrine extracted from natural sources. Although it seems clear that synephrine is found in those Citrus species which have been studied predominantly as the l-isomer, low levels of d-synephrine have been detected in juice and marmalade made from C. unshiu, and low levels (0.002%) have been reported in fresh fruit from C. aurantium. There are indications that some d-synephrine may be formed by the racemization of l-synephrine as a result of the processing of fresh fruit, although this matter has not been completely clarified. However, regardless of the situation in Citrus species, Ranieri and McLaughlin reported the isolation of racemic (i.e. a mixture of equal amounts of d- and l- stereoisomers) synephrine from a cactus of the genus Dolichothele, under conditions that would be unlikely to cause a significant amount of racemization. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of synephrine in Citrus species is believed to follow the pathway: tyrosine → tyramine → N-methyltyramine → synephrine, involving the enzymes tyrosine decarboxylase in the first step, tyramine N-methyltransferase in the second, and N-methyl-tyramine-β-hydroxylase in the third. This pathway differs from that thought to occur in animals, involving octopamine: tyramine → octopamine → synephrine, where the conversion of tyramine to octopamine is mediated by dopamine-β-hydroxylase, and the conversion of octopamine to synephrine by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. == Presence in nutritional/dietary supplements == Some dietary supplements, sold for the purposes of promoting weight-loss or providing energy, contain synephrine as one of several constituents. Usually, the synephrine is present as a natural component of Citrus aurantium (""bitter orange""), bound up in the plant matrix, but could also be of synthetic origin, or a purified phytochemical (i.e. extracted from a plant source and purified to chemical homogeneity). The concentration range found by Santana and co-workers in five different supplements purchased in the US was about 5–14 mg/g. == Pharmaceutical use == As a synthetic drug, synephrine first appeared in Europe in the late 1920s, under the name of Sympatol. One of the earliest papers describing its pharmacological and toxicological properties was written by Lasch, who obtained it from the Viennese company Syngala. By 1930, Sympatol was referred to as a Boehringer product, while one of the first US Patents describing its preparation and use was assigned to Frederick Stearns & Co. in 1933. Despite the date of this patent, clinical and pharmacological research on synephrine obtained from Frederick Stearns & Co was being carried out in the US by 1930. Writing in 1931, Hartung reported that in 1930 the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association had accepted synephrine for inclusion in its list of “New and Non-Official Remedies” as an agent for the treatment, by either oral or parenteral administration, ""of attacks of hay fever, asthma, coughing, spasms of asthma and pertussis (whooping cough)."" However, synephrine was dropped from the council's list in 1934, and its apparent re-advertising as a new drug by the Stearns company ten years later elicited a scathing comment from the Editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The third edition (1965) of Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine stated, with reservations, that synephrine was ""advertised as an antihistaminic to be used in the treatment of the common cold..."", under the trade name of ""Synephrin Tartrate"", and indicated that the dose was 100 mg, given intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. Published in 1966, the Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry described synephrine (in the form of its racemic tartrate) as a sympathomimetic agent that was ""less effective than epinephrine"", and which had been used for the treatment of chronic hypotension, collapse due to shock, and other conditions leading to hypotension. In a later (1972) textbook, synephrine was described as a drug, sold in Europe, that was administered in situations involving shock, such as surgical or bacteremic shock, and spinal anesthesia-related shock. The recommended dose was given here as 25–50 mg, by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. There is no mention of synephrine in editions of Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine later than the 3rd, nor is there any reference to synephrine in the 2012 Physicians' Desk Reference, nor in the current FDA ""Orange Book"". One current reference source describes synephrine as a vasoconstrictor that has been given to hypotensive patients, orally or by injection, in doses of 20–100 mg. One website from a healthcare media company, accessed in February, 2013, refers to oxedrine as being indicated for hypotensive states, in oral doses of 100–150 mg tid, and as a ""conjunctival decongestant"" to be topically applied as a 0.5% solution. However, no supporting references are provided. == Names == There has been some confusion about the biological effects of synephrine because of the similarity of this un-prefixed name to the names m-synephrine, Meta-synephrine and Neosynephrine, all of which refer to a related drug and naturally-occurring amine more commonly known as phenylephrine. Although there are chemical and pharmacological similarities between synephrine and phenylephrine, they are nevertheless different substances. The confusion is compounded by the fact that synephrine has been marketed as a drug under numerous different names, including Sympatol, Sympathol, Synthenate, and oxedrine, while phenylephrine has also been called m-Sympatol. The synephrine with which this article deals is sometimes referred to as p-synephrine in order to distinguish it from its positional isomers, m-synephrine and o-synephrine. A comprehensive listing of alternative names for synephrine may be found in the ChemSpider entry (see Chembox, at right). Confusion exists over the distinctions between p- and m-synephrine. However, an examination of the references cited in support of this statement show that all the evidence for the presence of m-synephrine in C. aurantium derives from a report by Penzak and co-workers, whose Abstract states that m-synephrine was found in C. aurantium, whereas a close reading of the text of the paper itself reveals that the authors (although apparently uncertain about which synephrine regio-isomer had been found in the plant by earlier investigators) were aware that their analytical technique could not distinguish between m- and p-synephrine, and did not claim that m-synephrine was present. Thus the Abstract is at variance with the experimental findings given in the full text of the paper, but this error has propagated through subsequent publications. Even the name ""p-synephrine"" is not unambiguous, since it does not specify stereochemistry. The only completely unambiguous names for synephrine are: (R)-(−)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the l-enantiomer); (S)-(+)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the d-enantiomer); and (R,S)-4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol (for the racemate, or d,l-synephrine) (see Chemistry section). == Chemistry == === Properties === In terms of molecular structure, synephrine has a phenethylamine skeleton, with a phenolic hydroxy- group, an alcoholic hydroxy- group, and an N-methylated amino-group. Alternatively, synephrine might be described as a phenylethanolamine with an N-methyl and p-hydroxy substituent. The amino-group confers basic properties on the molecule, whereas the phenolic –OH group is weakly acidic: the apparent (see original article for discussion) pKas for protonated synephrine are 9.55 (phenolic H) and 9.79 (ammonium H). Common salts of racemic synephrine are its hydrochloride, C9H13NO2.HCl, m.p. 150–152°, the oxalate (C9H13NO2)2.C2H2O4, m.p. 221–222 °C, and the tartrate (Sympatol), (C9H13NO2)2.C4H6O6, m.p. 188–190 °C. The presence of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic C of the synephrine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists in the form of two enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, or as the racemic mixture, d,l- synephrine. The dextrorotatory d-isomer corresponds to the (S)-configuration, and the levorotatory l-isomer to the (R)-configuration. Racemic synephrine has been resolved using ammonium 3-bromo-camphor-8-sulfonate. The enantiomers were not characterized as their free bases, but converted to the hydrochloride salts, with the following properties: (S)-(+)-C9H13NO2.HCl: m.p. 178 °C; [α] = +42.0°, c 0.1 (H2O); (R)-(−)-C9H13NO2.HCl: m.p. 176 °C; [α] = −39.0°, c 0.2 (H2O) (−)-Synephrine, as the free base isolated from a Citrus source, has m.p. 162–164 °C (with decomposition). The X-ray structure for synephrine has been determined. === Synthesis === Early and seemingly inefficient syntheses of synephrine were discussed by Priestley and Moness, writing in 1940. These chemists optimized a route beginning with the O-benzoylation of p-hydroxy-phenacyl chloride, followed by reaction of the resulting O-protected chloride with N-methyl-benzylamine to give an amino-ketone. This intermediate was then hydrolyzed with HCl/alcohol to the p-hydroxy-aminoketone, and the product then reduced catalytically to give (racemic) synephrine. A later synthesis, due to Bergmann and Sulzbacher, began with the O-benzylation of p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, followed by a Reformatskii reaction of the protected aldehyde with ethyl bromoacetate/Zn to give the expected β-hydroxy ester. This intermediate was converted to the corresponding acylhydrazide with hydrazine, then the acylhydrazide reacted with HNO2, ultimately yielding the p-benzyloxy-phenyloxazolidone. This was N-methylated using dimethyl sulfate, then hydrolyzed and O-debenzylated by heating with HCl, to give racemic synephrine. === Structural relationships === Much reference has been made in the literature (both lay and professional) of the structural kinship of synephrine with ephedrine, or with phenylephrine, often with the implication that the perceived similarities in structure should result in similarities in pharmacological properties. However, from a chemical perspective, synephrine is also related to a very large number of other drugs whose structures are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and although some properties are common, others are not, making unqualified comparisons and generalizations inappropriate. Thus, replacement of the N-methyl group in synephrine with a hydrogen atom gives octopamine; replacement of the β-hydroxy group in synephrine by a H atom gives N-methyltyramine; replacement of the synephrine phenolic 4-OH group by a –H gives halostachine. If the synephrine phenolic 4-OH group is shifted to the meta-, or 3-position on the benzene ring, the compound known as phenylephrine (or m-synephrine, or ""Neo-synephrine"") results; if the same group is shifted to the ortho-, or 2-position on the ring, o-synephrine results. Addition of another phenolic –OH group to the 3-position of the benzene ring produces the neurotransmitter epinephrine; addition of a methyl group to the α-position in the side-chain of synephrine gives oxilofrine (methylsynephrine). Four stereoisomers (two pairs of enantiomers) are possible for this substance. Extension of the synephrine N-methyl substituent by one methylene unit to an N-ethyl gives the hypotensive experimental drug ""Sterling #573""/""Aethyl-Sympatol"". The above structural relationships all involve a change at one position in the synephrine molecule, and numerous other similar changes, many of which have been explored, are possible. However, the structure of ephedrine differs from that of synephrine at two different positions: ephedrine has no substituent on the phenyl ring where synephrine has a 4-OH group, and ephedrine has a methyl group on the position α- to the N in the side-chain, where syneprine has only a H atom. Furthermore, ""synephrine"" exists as either of two enantiomers, while ""ephedrine"" exists as one of four different enantiomers; there are, in addition, racemic mixtures of these enantiomers. The main differences of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the ephedrines are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct sympathomimetic drugs while the ephedrines are both direct and indirect sympathomimetics. One of the main reasons for these differential effects is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted phenyl ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs. == Pharmacology == === Synopsis === Classical pharmacological studies on animals and isolated animal tissues showed that the principal actions of parenterally-administered synephrine included raising blood-pressure, dilating the pupil, and constricting peripheral blood vessels. There is now ample evidence(what evidence?) that synephrine produces most of its biological effects by acting as an agonist (i.e. stimulating) at adrenergic receptors, with a distinct preference for the α1 over the α2 sub-type. However, the potency of synephrine at these receptors is relatively low (i.e. relatively large concentrations of the drug are required to activate them). The potency of synephrine at adrenergic receptors of the β-class (regardless of sub-type) is much lower than at α-receptors. There is some evidence that synephrine also has weak activity at 5-HT receptors, and that it interacts with TAAR1 (trace amine-associated receptor 1). In common with virtually all other simple phenylethanolamines (β-hydroxy-phenethylamines), the (R)-(−)-, or l-, enantiomer of synephrine is more potent than the (S)-(+)-, or d-, enantiomer in most, but not all preparations studied. However, the majority of studies have been conducted with a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers. Since the details regarding such variables as test species, receptor source, route of administration, drug concentration, and stereochemical composition are important but often incomplete in other Reviews and Abstracts of research publications, many are provided in the more technical review below, in order to support as fully as possible the broad statements made in this Synopsis. === Pharmacology research === Pharmacological studies on synephrine date back to the late 1920s, when it was observed that injected synephrine raised blood pressure, constricted peripheral blood vessels, dilated pupils, stimulated the uterus, and relaxed the intestines in experimental animals. Representative of this early work is the paper by Tainter and Seidenfeld, who were the first researchers to systematically compare the different effects of the two synephrine enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, as well as of the racemate, d,l-synephrine, in various animal assays. In experiments on anesthetized cats, Tainter and Seidenfeld confirmed earlier reports of the increase in blood pressure produced by intravenous doses of synephrine, showing that the median pressor doses for the isomers were: l-synephrine: 0.5 mg/kg; d,l-synephrine: 1.0 mg/kg; and d-synephrine: 2–20 mg/kg. These effects lasted 2–3 minutes, peaking at ~30 seconds after administration. l-Synephrine was thus the more potent enantiomer, with about 1/60x the potency of the standard pressor l-epinephrine in the same assay. A later study, by Lands and Grant, showed that a dose of ~0.6 mg/kg of racemic synephrine, given intravenously to anesthetized dogs, produced a rise in blood pressure of 34 mmHg lasting 5–10 minutes, and estimated that this pressor activity was about 1/300x that of epinephrine. Using cats and dogs, Tainter and Seidenfeld observed that neither d- nor l-synephrine caused any changes in the tone of normal bronchi, in situ, even at ""maximum"" doses. Furthermore, the marked brocho-constriction produced by injections of histamine was not reversed by either l-synephrine or d,l-synephrine. In experiments with isolated sheep carotid artery, d-, l- and d,l-synephrine all showed some vasoconstrictor activity: l-synephrine was the most potent, producing strong contractions at a concentration of 1:10000. d-Synephrine was about 1/2 as potent as the l-isomer, but d,l-synephrine (which would have been expected to have a potency of 1/2 that of l-synephrine even if the d-isomer were completely inactive) did not produce significant and irregular contractions until a concentration of 1:2500had been reached, implying an inhibitory interaction between the two enantiomers. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in a rabbit ear preparation: 25 mg l-synephrine produced significant (50%) vasoconstriction, while the same concentration of d-synephrine elicited essentially no response. In contrast, d,l-synephrine did not produce any constriction up to 25 mg, but 25 – 50 mg caused a relaxation of the blood vessels, which again suggested that the d-isomer might be inhibiting the action of the l-isomer. Experiments on strips of rabbit duodenum showed that l-synephrine caused a modest reduction in contractions at a concentration of 1:17000, but that the effects of the d- and d,l- forms were much weaker. Racemic synephrine, given intramuscularly, or by instillation, was found to significantly reduce the inflammation caused by instillation of mustard oil into the eyes of rabbits. Subcutaneous injection of racemic synephrine into rabbits was reported to cause a large rise in blood sugar. In experiments on anesthetized cats, Papp and Szekeres found that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) raised the thresholds for auricular and ventricular fibrillation, an indication of anti-arrhythmic properties. Evidence that synephrine might have some central effects comes from the research of Song and co-workers, who studied the effects of synephrine in mouse models of anti-depressant activity. These researchers observed that oral doses of 0.3 – 10 mg/kg of racemic synephrine were effective in shortening the duration of immobility produced in the assays, but did not cause any changes in spontaneous motor activity in separate tests. This characteristic immobility could be counteracted by the pre-administration of prazosin. Subsequent experiments using the individual enanatiomers of synephrine revealed that although the d-isomer significantly reduced the duration of immobility in the tail suspension test, at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg, the l-isomer had no effect at the same dose. In mice pre-treated with reserpine, an oral dose of 0.3 mg/kg d-synephrine significantly reversed the hypothermia, while l-synephrine required a dose of 1 mg/kg to be effective. Experiments with slices of cerebral cortex taken from rat brain showed that d-synephrine inhibited the uptake of [3H]-norepinephrine with an IC50 = 5.8 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (IC50 = 13.5 μM). d-Synephrine also competitively inhibited the binding of nisoxetine to rat brain cortical slices, with a Ki = 4.5 μM; l-synephrine was less potent (Ki = 8.2 μM). In experiments on the release of [3H]-norepinephrine from rat brain cortical slices, however, the l-isomer of synephrine was a more potent enhancer of the release (EC50 = 8.2 μM) than the d-isomer (EC50 = 12.3 μM). This enhanced release by l-synephrine was blocked by nisoxetine. Burgen and Iversen, examining the effect of a broad range of phenethylamine-based drugs on [14C]-norepinephrine-uptake in the isolated rat heart, observed that racemic synephrine was a relatively weak inhibitor (IC50 = 0.12 μM) of the uptake. Another receptor-oriented study by Wikberg revealed that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) was a more potent agonist at guinea pig aorta α1 receptors (pD2 = 4.81) than at ileum α2 receptors (pD2 = 4.48), with a relative affinity ratio of α2/α1 = 0.10. Although clearly indicating a selectivity of synephrine for α1 receptors, its potency at this receptor sub-class is still relatively low, in comparison with that of phenylephrine (pD2 at α1 = 6.32). Brown and co-workers examined the effects of the individual enantiomers of synephrine on α1 receptors in rat aorta, and on α2 receptors in rabbit saphenous vein. In the aorta preparation, l-synephrine gave a pD2 = 5.38 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/1000), while d-synephrine had a pD2 = 3.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/50000); in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 7.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/6). No antagonism of norepinephrine was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10−6 M. In the rabbit saphenous assay, the pD2 of l-synephrine was 4.36 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/1700), and that of d-synephrine was < 3.00; in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 5.45 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/140). No antagonism of norepinephrine was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10−5 M. A study of the effects of synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) on strips of guinea pig aorta and on the field-stimulated guinea pig ileum showed that synephrine had an agonist potency of −logKa = 3.75 in the aorta assay. In comparison, epinephrine had a potency of −logKa = 5.70. There was no significant effect on the ileum at synephrine concentrations up to about 2 × 10−4 M, indicating selectivity for the α1 receptor, but relatively low potency. In binding experiments with central adrenergic receptors, using a preparation from rat cerebral cortex, l-synephrine had pIC50 = 3.35, and d-synephrine had pIC50 = 2.42 in competition against [3H]-prazosin (standard α1 ligand); against [3H]-yohimbine (standard α2 ligand), l-synephrine showed a pIC50 = 5.01, and d-synephrine showed a pIC50 = 4.17. Experiments conducted by Hibino and co-workers also showed that synephrine (stereochemistry unspecified) produced a dose-dependent constriction of isolated rat aorta strips, in the concentration range 10−5–3 × 10−6 M. This constriction was found to be competitively antagonized by prazosin (a standard α1 antagonist) and ketanserin, with prazosin being the more potent antagonist (pA2 = 9.38, vs pA2 = 8.23 for ketanserin). Synephrine constrictions were also antagonized by BRL-15,572, but not by SB-216,641 (used here as a selective 5-HT1B antagonist), or by propranolol (a common β antagonist). In studies on guinea pig atria and trachea, Jordan and co-workers also found that synephrine had negligible activity on β1 and β2 receptors, being about 40000x less potent than norepinephrine. Experiments with cultured white fat cells from several animal species, including human, by Carpéné and co-workers showed that racemic synephrine produced lipolytic effects, but only at high concentrations (0.1-1 mM). The potency, expressed in terms of pD2 of synephrine in these species was as follows: rat: 4.38; hamster: 5.32; guinea pig: 4.31; human: 4.94. In comparison, isoprenaline had a pD2 = 8.29 and norepinephrine had pD2 = 6.80 in human white fat cells. The lipolytic effect of 1 mM/L of synephrine on rat white fat cells was antagonized by various β-antagonists with the following inhibitory concentrations (IC50): bupranolol: 0.11 μM; CGP-20,712A (β1 antagonist): 6.09 μM; ICI-118,551 (β2 antagonist): 3.58 μM; SR-5923A (β3 antagonist): 17 μM. The binding of racemic synephrine to cloned human adrenergic receptors has been examined: Ma and co-workers found that synephrine bound to α1A, α2A and α2C with low affinity (pKi = 4.11 for α1A; 4.44 for α2A; 4.61 for α2C). Synephrine behaved as a partial agonist at α1A receptors, but as an antagonist at α2A and α2C sub-types. Racemic synephrine has been shown to be an agonist of the TAAR1, although its potency at the human TAAR1 is relatively low (EC50 = 23700 nM; Emax = 81.2%). == Pharmacokinetics == The pharmacokinetics of synephrine were studied by Hengstmann and Aulepp, who reported a peak plasma concentration at 1–2 hours, with an elimination half-life (T1/2) of ~ 2 hours. == Metabolism == Studies of the metabolism of synephrine by monoamine oxidases derived from rat brain mitochondria showed that synephrine was a substrate for deamination by both MAO-A and MAO-B, with Km = 250 μM and Vmax = 32.6 nM/mg protein/30 minutes; there was some evidence for preferential deamination by MAO-A. == Effects in humans == A number of studies of the effects of synephrine in humans, most of them focusing on its cardiovascular properties, have been performed since its introduction as a synthetic drug around 1930. The paper by Stockton and co-workers is representative, describing the effects of racemic synephrine in humans with particular attention to differences resulting from different routes of administration. Thus, it was shown by these investigators that intramuscular injections (average effective dose = 200 mg) of the drug produced an increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate, without affecting the diastolic pressure. The blood pressure increase reached a maximum (~25 mmHg) in 5 minutes following the injection, then gradually returned to normal over the course of 1 hour. Doses of drug greater than 200 mg caused side-effects such as heart palpitations, headache, sweating, and feelings of apprehension. When given intravenously, doses of 25–50 mg sufficed to produce a mean maximum increase in the blood pressure of 29 mmHg in 2 minutes, and a return to baseline within 30 minutes. Respiration was generally not affected during these experiments. Subcutaneous administration of synephrine in doses ≤ 200 mg had no effects on blood pressure or pulse rate. Oral doses of 500–1500 mg of the drug did not affect blood pressure or respiration, but pulse rate was increased by ~12%, and the highest doses caused nausea and vomiting. The i.m. administration of 75–500 mg of synephrine did not relieve acute asthma attacks, contradicting an earlier claim. However, the topical application of 1–3% solutions of the drug to the nasal mucosa of patients with sinusitis did produce a beneficial constriction without local irritation. Administration of synephrine by continuous intravenous infusion, at the rate of 4 mg/minute, significantly increased mean arterial and systolic pressure, but diastolic pressure and heart rate were unaltered.; further details of this investigation are summarized in a review by Fugh-Berman and Myers. There are a number of studies, references to many of which may be found in the review by Stohs and co-workers dealing with the effects produced by dietary supplements and herbal medications that contain synephrine as only one of many different chemical ingredients. These are outside the scope of the present article (see also the ""Safety/Efficacy/Controversy"" sub-section). == Toxicology == The acute toxicities of racemic synephrine in different animals, reported in terms of ""maximum tolerated dose"" after s.c administration, were as follows: mouse: 300 mg/kg; rat: 400 mg/kg; guinea pig: 400 mg/kg. ""Lethal doses"", given s.c., were found to be: mouse: 400 mg/kg; rat: 500 mg/kg; guinea pig: 500 mg/kg. Another study of this compound, administered i.v. in mice, gave an LD50 = 270 mg/kg. The ""subchronic toxicity"" of synephrine was judged to be low in mice, after administration of oral doses of 30 and 300 mg/kg over a period of 28 days. Generally, this treatment did not result in significant alterations in biochemical or hematological parameters, nor in relative organ weights, but some changes were noted in glutathione (GSH) concentration, and in the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). == Safety/efficacy/controversy == There exists considerable controversy about the safety and/or efficacy of synephrine-containing preparations, which are often confused with synephrine alone, sometimes with m-synephrine. Furthermore, this body of literature deals with mixtures containing synephrine as only one of several biologically active components, even, in some cases, without explicit confirmation of the presence of synephrine. == Invertebrates == In insects, synephrine has been found to be a very potent agonist at many invertebrate octopamine receptor preparations, and is even more potent than octopamine at a locust (Schistocerca americana gregaria) nerve-muscle preparation. Synephrine (racemic) is also more potent than octopamine (racemic) at inducing light-emission in the firefly (Photinus species) light organ. Synephrine exhibits similarly high potency in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity and in decreasing clotting time in lobster (Homarus americanus) hematocytes. Racemic synephrine was found to increase cAMP in the abdominal epidermis of the blood-sucking bug, Rhodnius prolixus. Rachinsky reported that synephrine was equipotent with octopamine in stimulating JH (juvenile hormone) release in the corpora allata of honey bee (Apis mellifera), but Woodring and Hoffmann found that synephrine had no effect on the synthesis of JH III, in in vitro preparations from the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. == Footnotes == == See also == Halostachine Deterenol Octopamine == References ==",P-synephrine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.42121124267578125), ('OG', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ENO', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.3856492842023727e-06), (' FOOD', -0.0301843099296093), (',', -0.03809989616274834), (' PERSONAL', -0.19163112342357635), (' CARE', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.2522859573364258), (' MED', -0.6940459609031677), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.2973444163799286), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -7.950943836476654e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.7328819036483765), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.12694883346557617), ('ĠMED', -0.49533742666244507), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16025102138519287)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.00015312091272789985), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synephrine ', [])"

Excessive osteoclastic bone resorption in this process can cause a variety of bone disorders including osteoporosis, aseptic prosthetic loosening and tumor associated bone destruction. Bulleyaconitine A (BLA) is a natural compound that has been widely used for pain treatment but its role in osteolysis has not yet been investigated. In this study, we verified for the first time that BLA inhibited osteoclast formation, the mRNA expression of osteoclast-related genes and osteoclastic bone resorption by inhibiting NF-κB signal pathway and downstream NFATc1 expression. Meanwhile, BLA had a stimulatory effect in osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Furthermore, BLA showed preventive effect in Ti particle-induced osteolysis model in vivo. Together, all our data demonstrated that BLA suppressed osteoclastogenesis and promoted osteoblastogenesis via suppressing NF-κB signal pathway and could be an alternative therapeutic choice against bone loss. Bulleyaconitine A, a diterpenoid alkaloid isolated from Aconitum bulleyanum plants, has been used for the treatment of chronic pain in China since 1985. Clinical studies show that the oral administration of bulleyaconitine A is effective for treating different kinds of chronic pain, including back pain, joint pain, and neuropathic pain with minimal side effect in human patients. The experimental studies have revealed that bulleyaconitine A at therapeutic doses potently inhibits the peripheral sensitization and central sensitization that underlie chronic pain and has no effect on acute pain. Bulleyaconitine A preferably blocks tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons by inhibition of protein kinase C, and the effect is around 600 times more potent in neuropathic animals than in naïve ones. Bulleyaconitine A at 5 nM inhibits the hypersensitivity of dorsal root ganglion neurons in neuropathic rats but has no effect on excitability of dorsal root ganglion neurons in sham group. Bulleyaconitine A inhibits long-term potentiation at C-fiber synapses in spinal dorsal horn, a synaptic model of pathological pain, preferably in neuropathic pain rats over naïve rats. The following mechanisms may underlie the selective effect of bulleyaconitine A on chronic pain. (1) In neuropathic conditions, protein kinase C and voltage-gated sodium channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons are upregulated, which enhances bulleyaconitine A's effect. (2) Bulleyaconitine A use-dependently blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and therefore inhibits the ectopic discharges that are important for neuropathic pain. (3) Bulleyaconitine A is shown to inhibit neuropathic pain by the modulation of spinal microglia, which are involved in the chronic pain but not in acute (nociceptive) pain. Moreover, bulleyaconitine A facilitates the anesthetic effect of morphine and inhibits morphine tolerance in rats. Together, bulleyaconitine A is able to inhibit chronic pain by targeting at multiple molecules. Further clinical and experimental studies are needed for evaluating the efficacy of bulleyaconitine A in different forms of chronic pain in patients and for exploring the underlying mechanisms. A fracture is a severe trauma that causes dramatic pain. Appropriate fracture pain management not only improves the patient's subjective perception, but also increases compliance with rehabilitation training. However, current analgesics for fracture pain are unsatisfactory because of their negative effects on fracture healing or addiction problems. Bulleyaconitine A (BLA), a non-addictive analgesic medicine, is used for the treatment of chronic pain of musculoskeletal disorders in clinical practice, whereas the effects of BLA on fracture pain is undefined. To evaluate the analgesic effects of BLA on fracture, we generated tibial fracture mice here. It is found that oral administration of BLA to mice alleviates fracture-induced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Interestingly, BLA significantly increases locomotor activity levels and reduces anxiety-like behaviors in fractured mice, as determined by open-field test. Notably, BLA treatment promotes bone mineralization and therefore fracture healing in mice, which may be attributed to the increase in mechanical stimulation caused by exercise. Our study suggests that BLA can be used as a promising analgesic agent for the treatment of fracture pain.",Bulleyaconitine a,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -1.1041145626222715e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.1602390557527542), (' FOOD', -9.253090865968261e-06)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012662734370678663), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2016562819480896)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01416350994259119), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30180777/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32265706/,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.620926/full ', [])"
3756,"('Rabeprazole (sodium)', 'Rabeprazole', 'Aciphex', 'Habeprazole', 'Pariets')",Medical,"Rabeprazole, sold under the brand name Aciphex, among others, is a medication that decreases stomach acid. It is used to treat peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and excess stomach acid production such as in Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It may also be used in combination with other medications to treat Helicobacter pylori. Effectiveness is similar to other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include constipation, feeling weak, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects may include osteoporosis, low blood magnesium, Clostridioides difficile infection, and pneumonia. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It works by blocking H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells of the stomach. Rabeprazole was patented in 1986, and approved for medical use in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 288th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Rabeprazole, like other proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, is used for the purposes of gastric acid suppression. This effect is beneficial for the treatment and prevention of conditions in which gastric acid directly worsens symptoms, such as duodenal and gastric ulcers. In the setting of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), whose pathophysiology is characterized by prolonged exposure to gastric acid in the esophagus (often due to changes in stomach and/or esophagus anatomy, such as those induced by abdominal obesity), acid suppression can provide symptomatic relief. Acid suppression is also useful when gastric production of acid is increased, including rare conditions with excess gastric acid secretion (hypersecretory conditions) like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), and systemic mastocytosis. In an open-label, industry-sponsored, non-controlled study of high-dose rabeprazole for the treatment of ZES and idiopathic gastric acid hypersecretion (IGAH), including patients with MEN-1 and GERD, rabeprazole induced and maintained suppression of basal acid output over a 24 month period. Only one patient withdrew from the study due to an elevation in creatine phosphokinase judged to be possibly due to rabeprazole, while rabeprazole was otherwise well-tolerated in this population. There are no clinical trials to date that have studied the precise use of rabeprazole, or any PPI, for the treatment of acid-related complaints due to systemic mastocytosis, but acid suppressing medications such as PPIs and H2 receptor antagonists are routinely used to counter the histamine-mediated acid secretion found in this disorder. Rabeprazole is also useful alongside antibiotic therapy for the treatment of the pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which otherwise thrives in acidic environments. In the original studies that gave rise to its approval for the eradication of H. pylori, rabeprazole was studied in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin. This triple therapy was studied at the specific doses of rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, which is a higher dose of rabeprazole than what is used for the treatment of simple GERD (20 mg once daily). The higher dose is thought to provide more consistent elevation of pH in the stomach, leading to better eradication of H. pylori, congruent with the dosing strategies of other PPIs for this indication. Notably, H. pylori eradication with antibiotics and rabeprazole was also shown to prevent development of second gastric cancer in a randomized trial in high-risk South Korean patients with early stomach cancer treated by endoscopy. Thus, rabeprazole is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of symptomatic GERD in adolescents and adults, healing duodenal ulcers in adults, eradication of Helicobacter pylori, and pathologic hypersecretory conditions. === Available forms === Rabeprazole is available in 10 and 20 mg, delayed-release tablets (pictured below). Rabeprazole-based products, like other proton pump inhibitor products, have to be formulated in delayed-release tablets to protect the active medication from being degraded by the acid of the stomach before being absorbed. === Specific populations === ==== Pediatrics ==== Rabeprazole's only pediatric indication is for the treatment of symptomatic GERD in adolescents (12 years-old and up). ==== Pregnancy ==== The FDA originally labeled rabeprazole as a pregnancy category B drug (meaning that in vivo research failed to demonstrate a fetal hazard, though human studies are lacking), but it was reclassified as a pregnancy category C drug (meaning that in vivo research has shown a fetal hazard, though the benefit of use may outweigh the risk) in 2014. This was after the publishing of an in vivo study that detected changes in bone morphology in rats treated with esomeprazole. In these rats, the following observations were noted: shortened femurs, decreased width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate, and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity occurred at doses equal to or greater than 3.4 times the daily maximum recommended human dose (MRHD); decreased survival, decreased birth weight, and an increase in neurobehavioral delays occurred at doses equal to or greater than 16.8 times the daily MRHD; physeal dysplasia of the femur occurred at doses equal to or greater than 33.6 times the daily MRHD. In vivo studies on rabbits with rabeprazole doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day (about 13 times the normal human drug exposure of rabeprazole at 20 mg) failed to show evidence of fetal harm. ==== Lactation ==== It is expected that rabeprazole will be secreted into human breast milk, though the clinical impact of this is still unknown. Avoiding rabeprazole during breastfeeding confers to lowest possible risk. ==== Geriatrics ==== Advanced age does not appear to clinically impact rabeprazole's metabolism. However, elevations in the maximum plasma concentration and the total drug exposure (area under the curve, AUC) have occurred. ==== Japanese ancestry ==== In a study on rabeprazole's pharmacokinetics, the AUC was elevated by approximately 50–60% in men of Japanese ancestry compared to men in the United States. See the pharmacogenetics section below for a pharmacogenetic explanation of these findings. ==== Kidney or liver problems ==== In people that have kidney or liver problems, these problems do not appear to affect rabeprazole's metabolism in a clinically meaningful way. This includes individuals on dialysis for kidney problems. Severe liver problems like cirrhosis of the liver do affect rabeprazole's elimination half-life, but not to a degree of dangerous accumulation. In a review of patients taking rabeprazole while having end-stage kidney disease and mild-to-moderate severity, chronic compensated cirrhosis of the liver, the alteration in rabeprazole's metabolism was not clinically meaningful. == Contraindications == Rabeprazole is contraindicated in the following populations and situations: people with a known hypersensitivity to rabeprazole, substituted benzimidazoles (which are chemically similar to rabeprazole, like omeprazole), or any other component of the capsule formulation (e.g. certain dyes) concurrent use of rilpivirine, a medication used to treat HIV infection === Hypersensitivity === ==== Syndrome ==== An allergy to a PPI like rabeprazole may take the form of type I hypersensitivity or delayed hypersensitivity reactions. A selective (pattern C—see below for a discussion of cross-reactivity patterns) type I hypersensitivity reaction to rabeprazole resulting in anaphylaxis has been reported, as well as several whole group hypersentivities. ==== Cross-reactivity ==== Hypersensitivity to PPIs can take the form of whole group hypersensitivity, pattern A, B, or C. Whole group hypersentivity occurs when a person is cross-reactive to all PPIs; that is, all PPIs will induce the allergy. In pattern A, a person may be allergic to omeprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole, but not to lansoprazole and rabeprazole. This is thought to be due to the structural similarities between omeprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole, contrasted with lansoprazole and rabeprazole. Pattern B is the opposite, reflecting people that are allergic to lansoprazole and rabeprazole, but not to omeprazole, esomeprazole, and pantoprazole. Pattern C, in the context of rabeprazole, would reflect a person that is allergic to only rabeprazole, but not to other PPIs (omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole). === Rilpivirine === Rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in the treatment of HIV, is contraindicated with all PPIs because of their acid-suppressing effect. PPIs suppress acid, thereby raising the pH of (alkalizing) the stomach's contents. Rilpivirine is best absorbed under acidic conditions. Therefore, rabeprazole would be expected to decrease the absorption of rilpivirine, decrease the concentration of rilpivirine in the blood, and possibly lead to therapeutic failure and induce resistance of the HIV virus to rilpivirine and/or cross-resistance with other NNRTIs. == Adverse effects == In general, rabeprazole is fairly well tolerated, even with up to five years of continuous use (the duration of follow-up in a pharmacovigilance clinical trial). The side effect profile is similar to that of omeprazole. The side effect profile is similar to that of omeprazole and other commonly used PPIs. The most common side effects include headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Rare side effects include rashes, flu-like symptoms, and infections (including by the gastrointestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile). Rare instances of rabeprazole-induced liver injury (also known as hepatotoxicity) have been reported. Characteristic proton-pump inhibitor hepatotoxicity occurs within the first 4 weeks of starting the medication. Gastrin is an endogenous human hormone that stimulates gastric acid secretion and regulating the growth of certain cells in the stomach. Enterochromafin-like (ECL) cells, responsible for stimulating gastric acid secretion by the release of histamine in the stomach, respond to prolonged gastrin exposure by growing and proliferating. Rabeprazole is associated with elevated serum gastrin levels (hypergastrinemia), which occurs through inhibiting the negative feedback of stomach acid on gastrin secretion by G cells in the antrum of the stomach. The elevation in serum gastrin levels are thought to be dependent upon the degree of rabeprazole's CYP2C19 metabolism. Rabeprazole is not as significantly metabolized by CYP2C19 compared to other medications in the same class, like omeprazole. Hypergastrinemia has been posited as a potential source of rabeprazole-induced neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g. dizziness, numbness, and tremor), though more research is needed to clarify the effect and mechanism. Prolonged elevated serum gastrin has been shown to cause rat ECL cells to form carcinoid tumors. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of observational studies, the use of acid-suppressing drugs (including PPIs like rabeprazole, but also histamine receptor 2 antagonists) may be associated with the development of gastric cancer. The studies included in the meta-analysis did not differentiate between rabeprazole and other PPIs, so it is unclear if the potential risk may differ across the PPI class. Acid suppression via rabeprazole can decrease the absorption of vitamin B12 and magnesium, leading to deficiency. A case of rabeprazole-induced iron deficiency anemia has been reported. Theoretically, rabeprazole could induce an iron deficiency anemia by reducing the dietary absorption of iron, which requires acid for bioavailability. Very serious side effects have been reported in people taking rabeprazole, but there is no direct evidence that rabeprazole definitely caused these side effects. These include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a serious disease characterized by skin rash and risk of organ failure), serious blood cell abnormalities, coma, and death. Other possible side effects, common to other PPI medications in the same class, include bone fractures due to osteoporosis, serious infections (including Clostridioides difficile), and kidney damage (nephrotoxicity). A rare, though less understood, side effect of the PPI class is the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, a syndrome of striated muscle destruction. === Osteoporosis and fractures === The mechanism of PPI-induced osteoporosis and fractures is unclear, but hypotheses include hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, hyperparathyroidism, and B12 deficiency (inducing neurological deficits and subsequent falls). In opposition to the calcium malabsorption hypothesis, rabeprazole prevented reductions in bone mineral density akin to the effect of minodronic acid in a study of gastrectomized rats. Midodronic acid is a bisphosphonate class drug used to prevent fractures in osteoporosis. Unlike midodronic acid, rabeprazole did not affect serum calcium levels, although the attenuation of gastrectomy-induced bone mineral density reduction at the distal end of the femur suggested inhibition of bone resorption by osteoclasts (like a bisphosphonate). === Infection risk === PPIs have been associated with an increased risk for pneumonia by meta-analyses of case-control and cohort studies. One hypothesis for this association is that PPI-induced acid suppression fosters the growth of aerobic bacteria in the stomach, which can be transferred to the lungs by microaspiration, promoting colonization and subsequent pneumonia. Other hypotheses include off-target proton pump inhibition in the lungs, altering the pH of pulmonary mucus in favor of bacterial growth, and direct inhibition of the activity of white blood cells such as neutrophils and natural killer cells. In line with the stomach acid suppression hypothesis for bacterial overgrowth, PPIs have also been associated with Clostridioides difficile infections. However, as these meta-analyses have pooled PPIs together, it is unknown whether the risk of infection differs significantly between rabeprazole and other members of the PPI class. Rabeprazole was identified as the causative agent in a case report of collagenous colitis, inducing chronic, watery diarrhea. Other enteric, infectious organisms associated with PPI use include Campylobacter and Salmonella. Both pathogens are sensitive to acid; theoretically, as above, acid suppression by PPIs should increase their pathogenicity. It is unclear if the observed association is due to the PPI itself, as one cohort study found that the association could be explained by the demographic factors of patients prescribed PPIs (e.g. concurrent use of immunosuppressant medications, older age, and antibiotic use). In a clinical trial of 255 Japanese patients, the incidence of PPI-associated diarrhea did not differ between rabeprazole, omeprazole, or lansoprazole. === Nephrotoxicity === Forms of kidney damage associated with PPIs in one meta-analysis include acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) (insufficient quality evidence), acute kidney injury (AKI) (low grade evidence), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (low grade evidence), and end-stage renal disease (insufficient quality evidence). The first reported case of rabeprazole-induced acute interstital nephritis occurred in a 62 year-old female in Australia, prescribed rabeprazole for complaints of dyspepsia due to suspected GERD. The mechanism for PPI-induced acute interstital nephritis has not been elucidated, though an immune-related hypothesis has been posited on the basis of extra-renal toxicity consistent with an immunologic, hypersensitivity reaction. It has also been posited that incomplete resolution of PPI-induced acute interstitial nephritis could precede acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. === Muscle-related adverse events === Cases of progressive muscle weakness, muscle pain, and rhabdomyolysis following administration of PPIs have been reported in the scientific literature. However, the mechanism for these muscle-related adverse events has yet to be established. In one case, rhabdomyolysis developed in a 50 year-old patient 2 weeks after starting both rabeprazole and domperidone, a prokinetic and antiemetic agent, which resolved after discontinuation of both drugs. Per the French imputability method of causality assessment, it was determined that rabeprazole was a ""plausible"" cause of the rhabdomyolysis, noting that domperidone was started concurrently. == Overdose == No signs and symptoms have been reported in overdoses of rabeprazole up to 80 mg, but case examples are limited. Notably, rabeprazole has been used in higher doses for the treatment of hypersecretory conditions like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (up to 120 mg daily). Animal experiments with ultra-high doses of rabeprazole have demonstrated lethality through unknown mechanisms. The lethal overdose syndrome in animals is characterized by convulsion and coma. == Interactions == === Drug-drug interactions === Rabeprazole does not interfere with the plasma concentration of drugs that are also metabolized by the same enzymes (i.e. CYP2C19) that it is metabolized by. Therefore, it is not expected to react with CYP2C19 substrates like theophylline, warfarin, diazepam, and phenytoin. However, the acid-suppression effects of rabeprazole, like other PPIs, may interfere with the absorption of drugs that require acid, such as ketoconazole and digoxin. There is some evidence that omeprazole and esomeprazole, two medications in the same class as rabeprazole, can disturb the conversion of an anticoagulant medication called clopidogrel to its active metabolite. However, because this is thought to be mediated by the effect of omeprazole and esomeprazole on CYP2C19, the enzyme that activates clopidogrel, this drug interaction is not expected to occur as strongly with rabeprazole. However, whether the effect of omeprazole and esomeprazole on clopidogrel's metabolism actually leads to poor clinical outcomes is still a matter of intense debate among healthcare professionals. Clinically serious drug-drug interactions may involve the acid-suppression effects of rabeprazole. For example, rabeprazole should not be used concomitantly with rilpivirine, an anti-HIV therapy, which requires acid for absorption. Lowered plasma concentrations of rilpivirine could lead to progression of HIV infection. Other drugs that require acid for absorption include antifungal drugs like ketoconazole and itraconazole, digoxin, iron, mycophenolate, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors like erlotinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. There is no clinically relevant drug interaction between rabeprazole and antacids. === Food-drug interactions === Food does not affect the amount of rabeprazole that enters the body, but it does delay its onset of effect by about 1.7 hours. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Once rabeprazole is taken by mouth, the enteric coating of the tablet allows the drug to pass through the stomach intact. Like other PPIs, rabeprazole is absorbed into the blood stream at the site of the proximal small bowel. Rabeprazole's mechanism of action involves crossing from the blood stream into the parietal cells of the stomach, which are the cells that are responsible for secreting hydrochloric acid (HCl). At this point, rabeprazole is inactive. However, rabeprazole is then secreted into the secretory canaliculus of the parietal cells, which is the space from which acid secretion occurs. Here, acid secretion is mediated by the energy-dependent acid pumps, called hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+ ATPase) pumps. These enzymatic pumps have cysteine amino acid residues. After being activated by gastric (stomach) acid to a reactive sulfenamide intermediate, rabeprazole permanently binds the cysteine residues, forming covalent, disulfide bonds. This action fundamentally alters the configuration of the acid pump, thereby inhibiting its activity. Thus, acid can no longer be secreted into the gastric lumen (the empty space of the stomach), and the pH of the stomach increases (decrease in the concentration of hydrogen ions, H+). Due to the permanent inhibition of the individual proton pump that each molecule of rabeprazole has bound to, acid secretion is effectively suppressed until new proton pumps are produced by the parietal cells. Rabeprazole, like other medications in the same class, cannot inhibit the H+/K+ ATPase pumps found in lysosomes, a cellular organelle that degrades biological molecules, because the pumps found in these organelles lack the cysteine residues involved in rabeprazole's mechanism of action. A unique feature of rabeprazole's mechanism of action in inhibiting acid secretion involves its activation. The pKa (the pH at which 50% of the drug becomes positively charged) of rabeprazole is around 5.0, meaning that it doesn't take a lot of acid to activate it. While this theoretically translates into a faster onset of action for rabeprazole's acid-inhibiting effect, the clinical implications of this fact have yet to be elucidated. Theoretically, a high pKa should correlate with off-target activation of the PPI (possibly inducing side effects), though the clinical relevance of this has also yet to be elucidated. See Table 1 for a pKa comparison across PPIs. Table 1 | Comparative pKa values across PPIs. Note that the pKa of dexlansoprazole is a calculated value from a different source, which may have used differing methods than the other PPIs studied. === Pharmacokinetics === Rabeprazole's bioavailability is approximately 52%, meaning that 52% of orally administered dose is expected to enter systemic circulation (the bloodstream). Once in the blood, rabeprazole is approximately 96.3%-97% bound to plasma proteins. The biological half-life of rabeprazole in humans is approximately one hour. It takes about 3.5 hours for rabeprazole to reach the maximum concentration in human plasma after a single orally administered dose. Oral absorption is independent of the dose administered. Rabeprazole is extensively metabolized by the liver. 90% of the drug is rendered into metabolites by the liver, which are then excreted by the kidneys. 10% of the dose is excreted in the feces. The drug metabolizing enzymes primarily responsible for rabeprazole's metabolism are CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. However, rabeprazole is mainly metabolized through non-enzymatic reduction to a thioether metabolite. Some of rabeprazole's metabolites include the following: a thioether carboxylic acid metabolite, a thioether glucuronide metabolite, and a sulfone metabolite. The most common metabolites excreted in the urine are the mercapturic acid conjugate and carboxylic acid. A diagram of rabeprazole's phase I metabolism is shown below. === Pharmacogenetics === The effect of rabeprazole may vary based upon the genetics of the individual taking the medication. People may have differences in their capacity to metabolize rabeprazole to an inactive metabolite. This may be mediated through genetic differences in the gene that encodes for the metabolic enzyme CYP2C19. For example, people that are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers (i.e. their version of CYP2C19 is less effective than average) will have trouble metabolizing rabeprazole, allowing the active rabeprazole to stay in the body, where it can exert its effect, longer than intended. Conversely, extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers (i.e. the average metabolic capacity of CYP2C19) will extensively metabolize rabeprazole, as expected. The poor metabolizing CYP2C19 phenotype is found in roughly 3–5% of Caucasian people, and in 17–20% of people of Asian ancestry. In a study on men of Japanese ancestry, this has translated to an average increase of total drug exposure by 50–60% compared to men in the United States. However, rabeprazole's metabolism is primarily non-enzymatic (it is often inactivated chemically, without the participation of the body's natural drug metabolizing enzymes). Therefore, while a person's CYP2C19 phenotype will affect rabeprazole's metabolism, it is not expected to dramatically affect the efficacy of the medication. == Chemistry == Rabeprazole is classified as a substituted benzimidazole, like omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole. Rabeprazole possess properties of both acids and bases, making it an amphotere. The acid dissociation constant (pKa) of the pyridine nitrogen is about equal to 4. === Synthesis === The above synthesis pathway begins with 2,3-dimethypyridine N-oxide (1). Nitration of 2,3-dimethylpyridine N-oxide affords the nitro derivative (the addition of NO2) (2) The newly introduced nitro group is then displaced by the alkoxide from 3-methoxypropanol to yield the corresponding ether (3). Treatment with acetic anhydride results in the Polonovski reaction. Saponification followed by treatment with thionyl chloride then chlorinates the primary alcohol (5). Reaction with benzimidazole-2-thiol (6) followed by oxidation of the resulting thioether to the sulfoxide yields the final product: rabeprazole (8). === Comparative chemistry === The chemical structures in Table 2 illustrate the comparative chemistry of rabeprazole among other members of the PPI class. The structures vary by the substitution of side chains on either the benzimidazole or pyridine ring structures. Omeprazole, for example, has a methoxy moiety (CH3O-) on the benzimidazole ring at position 5, whereas pantoprazole has a difluoromethoxy (CHF2O-) chain at position 5. Lansoprazole has a trifluoroethoxy (CF3-CH2-O-) chain on the pyridine ring at position 4, whereas rabeprazole has a methoxypropoxy (CH3-O-(CH2)3-O-) chain at position 4. Esomeprazole and deslansoprazole represent stereoisomers of omeprazole and lansoprazole respectively. Table 2 | Comparative chemical structures of commercially available PPIs. === Physiochemical properties === Rabeprazole is characterized as a white to yellowish-white solid in its pure form. It is soluble in a number of solvents. Rabeprazole is very soluble in water and methanol, freely soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and ethyl acetate, and is insoluble in ether and n-hexane. It is unstable under humid conditions. == History == Rabeprazole was first marketed in Europe in 1998. In 1999, one year later, rabeprazole was approved for use in the United States. === Development === Developed by Eisai Medical Research by the research names E3810 and LY307640, the pre-investigational new drug application was submitted on October 28, 1998. The final investigational new drug application was submitted August 6, 1999. On August 19, 1999, rabeprazole was approved in the US for multiple gastrointestinal indications. The approval for the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease was on February 12, 2002. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Rabeprazole is approved in the United States and the United Kingdom for prescription use only. Rabeprazole was approved in India in December 2001. It was approved in Japan in 1997, and in all European Union member countries since. === Brand names === Rabeprazole has been sold in a number of brand names: == Research == An alternative formulation of rabeprazole, termed ""rabeprazole-ER"" (extended release) has been developed. The purpose of the formulation was to increase the half-life of rabeprazole, which normally is very short in humans. Rabeprazole-ER was a 50 mg capsule composed of five non-identical 10 mg tablets that were designed to release rabeprazole at differing intervals throughout the gastrointestinal system. However, because two high quality clinical trials failed to demonstrate a benefit of rabeprazole-ER versus esomeprazole (another common PPI) for healing grade C or D erosive esophagitis, the development of rabeprazole-ER ceased. == References == This article was submitted to WikiJournal of Medicine for external academic peer review in 2018 (reviewer reports).

3757,"('Nicergoline', 'Nimergoline', 'Nicergolinum', 'Nicotergoline', 'Nimergoline base')",Medical,"Nicergoline, sold under the brand name Sermion among others, is an ergot derivative used to treat senile dementia and other disorders with vascular origins. Internationally it has been used for frontotemporal dementia as well as early onset in Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's dementia. It decreases vascular resistance and increases arterial blood flow in the brain, improving the utilization of oxygen and glucose by brain cells. It has similar vasoactive properties in other areas of the body, particularly the lungs. Unlike many other ergolines, such as ergotamine, nicergoline is not associated with cardiac fibrosis. It is used for vascular disorders such as cerebral thrombosis and atherosclerosis, arterial blockages in the limbs, Raynaud's disease, vascular migraines, and retinopathy. Nicergoline has been registered in over fifty countries and has been used for more than three decades for the treatment of cognitive, affective, and behavioral disorders of older people. == Medical uses == Nicergoline is used in the following cases: Acute and chronic cerebral metabolic-vascular disorders (cerebral arteriosclerosis, thrombosis and cerebral embolism, transitory cerebral ischaemia). Acute and chronic peripheral metabolic-vascular disorders (organic and functional arteriopathies of the limbs), Raynaud's disease and other syndromes caused by altered peripheral irrigation. Migraines of vascular origin Coadjutant therapy in clinical situations accompanied by platelet hyper-aggregability, arterial tension. Corio-retinal vascular disorders: diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and retinal angiosclerosis Oto-vestibular problems of a vascular nature: dizziness, auditory hallucinations, hypoacusis. Dosages for known conditions are usually administered at 5–10 mg three times a day, however anti-aging preventative purposes may want to consider 5 mg once or twice a day more adequate. == Contraindications == Persons suffering from acute bleeding, myocardial infarction (heart conditions), hypertension, bradycardia or using alpha or beta receptor agonists should consult with their physician before use. Although toxicology studies have not shown nicergoline to have any teratogenic effect, the use of this medicine during pregnancy should be limited to those cases where it is absolutely necessary. On 28 June 2013, the European Medicines Agency recommended restricting the use of medicines containing ergot derivatives, including nicergoline. They stated that ""these medicines should no longer be used to treat several conditions involving blood circulation problems or problems with memory and sensation, or to prevent migraine headaches, since the risks are greater than the benefits in these indications. This is based on a review of data showing an increased risk of fibrosis (formation of excess connective tissue that can damage organs and body structures) and ergotism (symptoms of ergot poisoning, such as spasms and obstructed blood circulation) with these medicines."" However, only a subset of ergolines are associated with fibrosis and evidence suggests that nicergoline does not carry the same fibrotic risk like other ergoline derivatives such as ergotamine. Nicergoline is considered unsafe in porphyria. == Side effects == The side effects of nicergoline are usually limited to nausea, hot flushes, mild gastric upset, hypotension and dizziness. At high drug dosages, bradycardia, increased appetite, agitation, diarrhea and perspiration were reported. Most of the available literature suggests that the side effects of nicergoline are mild and transient. == Interactions == Nicergoline is known to enhance the cardiac depressive effects of propranolol. At high dosages, it is advisable to seek one's physician's guidance if combining with potent vasodilators such as bromocriptine, Ginkgo biloba, picamilon, vinpocetine or xantinol nicotinate. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Nicergoline is an ergot alkaloid derivative that acts as a potent and selective α1A-adrenergic receptor antagonist. The IC50 of nicergoline in vitro has been reported to be 0.2 nM. The primary action of nicergoline is to increase arterial blood flow by vasodilation. Furthermore, it is known that nicergoline inhibits platelet aggregation. Studies have shown that nicergoline also increases nerve growth factor in the aged brain. In addition to the α1A-adrenergic receptor, nicergoline is an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (IC50 = 6 nM) and shows moderate affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 and α2-adrenergic receptors and low affinity for the dopamine D1 and D2 and muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M2 receptors. The major metabolites of nicergoline, MMDL and MDL, show low or no affinity for adrenergic, serotonin, dopamine, or acetylcholine receptors. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Nicergoline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. === Brand names === In some countries, Sermion is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == References ==",Nicotergoline,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011288482346571982), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007221474661491811)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicergoline?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Nicergoline', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicergoline?utm_source=openai')])"
3758,"('Troxipide', 'Aplace', 'Benzamide, 3,4,5-trimethoxy-n-3-piperidinyl-', 'Troxipidum [latin]', 'Troxipida [spanish]')",Medical,"Troxipide is a drug used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Troxipide is a systemic non-antisecretory gastric cytoprotective agent with anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory and mucus secreting properties irrespective of pH of stomach or duodenum. Troxipide is currently marketed in Japan (Aplace), China (Shuqi), South Korea (Defensa), and India (Troxip). It is used for the management of gastric ulcers, and amelioration of gastric mucosal lesions in acute gastritis and acute exacerbation of chronic gastritis. == Mechanism of action == The gastric pH and content independent properties of troxipide include the following: === Gastric mucosal protection === Gastric mucosa typically is composed of salts and other dialyzable components, free proteins, carbohydrate rich glycoprotein and water. Troxipide fortifies this gastric mucosal barrier by increasing the content of glucosamine, mucopolysaccharides and collagen. Glucosamine is an amino-sugar that is known to stimulate glycoprotein synthesis and protective mechanisms of the gastric mucosa, thereby aiding in ulcer healing. Mucopolysaccharides impart structural integrity to the gastric mucosa and collagen imparts properties like ionic capability to attract blood components essential to tissue regeneration, mechanical protection, high tensile strength and slow digestibility to the gastric mucosa. === Stimulation of cytoprotective prostaglandins === Almost all of the gastric mucosal defense mechanisms are stimulated and/or facilitated by prostaglandins (PGs), especially PGE2. These cytoprotective PGs stimulate mucus, bicarbonate, and phospholipid secretion; increase mucosal blood flow; and accelerate epithelial restitution and mucosal healing. They also inhibit mast cell activation, and leukocyte and platelet adherence to the vascular endothelium. Thus, continuous generation of PGE2 by gastric mucosa is crucial for the maintenance of mucosal integrity and protection against ulcerogenic and necrotizing agents. Troxipide is known to stimulate the release of PGE2 and PGD2 in experimental as well as clinical studies. Troxipide has been observed to enhance PG-stimulated increase in gastric mucosal output, accelerated epithelial restitution and mucosal healing. === Suppression of gastric inflammation === Gastric inflammation is a highly complex biochemical protective response to cellular injury. In the multitude of mechanisms involved in the development of gastric mucosal inflammation, derangement of the microcirculatory system is a common initial pathway. Troxipide inhibits various proinflammatory mediators present at different stages of the microcirculatory system, thereby restoring the normal gastric mucosa. Troxipide caused the inhibition of recombinant interleukin-8 (IL-8) induced migration of the inflammatory cells. Two other pro-inflammatory mediators causing oxidative stress that are inhibited by Troxipide include the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and the Platelet Activating Factor (PAF). In addition to inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators, troxipide directly acts on the enzymes such as xanthine oxidase and myeloperoxidase that generate free oxygen radicals in gastric mucosa. Experimental studies have demonstrated that troxipide restrains NSAID-induced generation of porphyrins, tissue peroxidation and gastric lesion formation. === Enhancement of mucosal metabolism === Gastric parietal cells are rich in mitochondria which provide energy in the form of ATP for cells by oxidative phosphorylation, critical to maintain the proper morphology and function of gastric mucosa. The mitochondrion is the major target of intracellular oxidative stress associated with aggressive factors like H. pylori, alcohol and NSAIDs, which disturb the energy metabolism of mitochondria. Troxipide accelerates oxygen intake of marginal gastric mucosa and glycogen consumptive stimulation of the gastric mucosa of the corpus, thereby elevating the tissue respiration and energy metabolism. === Stimulation of mucosal microcirculation === Troxipide enhances mucosal blood flow, which is the secondary defense barrier of gastric mucosa that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the epithelium, and removes, dilutes and neutralizes toxic substances that have diffused into the mucosa from the lumen. The increment in mucosal blood flow with troxipide is more pronounced in the gastric antrum than in the gastric corpus. === Anti-Helicobacter pylori action === Troxipide inhibits H. pylori-derived urease, a multimeric nickel-containing enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonic acid, which damage host tissues and trigger inflammatory response, including recruitment of leukocytes and triggering of the oxidative burst in neutrophils. == Pharmacokinetics == Troxipide is well absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract with a relative bioavailability of 99.6%. At any time, a mean concentration of 5.3- 8.9 μg of troxipide is present per gram of tissue, which is capable of inhibiting the chemotactic migration and superoxide generation in the gastric mucosa. Thus, even 3 hrs after attaining peak serum levels, troxipide is found in therapeutically active concentrations in the small intestine, liver and stomach. The elimination half-life of troxipide is 7.5 hours, and is mainly excreted in urine (96% as metabolites). == Clinical experience == Troxipide has been well established in the treatment of gastric ulcers showing an overall amelioration rate of 79.4%. An overall endoscopic healing rate of 66.7% after 8 weeks and 80% after 12 weeks of drug administration was achieved with troxipide (100 mg t.i.d. (three times a day)). In patients with duodenal ulcers, troxipide showed endoscopic healing rate of 53.3% and 73% at 8 weeks and 12 weeks respectively. At the end of the treatment, an overall improvement of 86.6% and 93.3% was achieved in patients with gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer respectively. In patients with acute gastritis and acute gastric mucosal lesions, an overall amelioration rate of 82.9% has been observed with troxipide. In a comparative study evaluating the efficacy of troxipide (100 mg t.i.d.) with Ranitidine (150 mg b.i.d. (two times a day)), administered over 28 days in patients with gastritis, troxipide was statistically superior to Ranitidine, both with respect to resolution of gastritis clinical signs (abdominal pain, bloating, belching and heartburn) as well as the endoscopic evidences (erosion, oozing, redness and edema). A study comparing the efficacy of troxipide (100 mg t.i.d for 28 days) with Rabeprazole (20 mg o.d. for 28 days) in patients suffering from gastritis showed that improvement in abdominal pain and nausea was significantly superior with troxipide at the end of 14 days. Troxipide administration caused a marked reduction in clinical (abdominal pain, bloating, belching, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and heartburn) and endoscopic signs of gastritis by the end of the treatment, though it did not significantly differ from that of Rabeprazole. In patients with APDs like dyspepsia, gastritis, GERD and/or gastric ulcer, uncontrolled with acid inhibitors viz. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine receptor antagonists (H2RAs) etc., troxipide (100 mg t.i.d. for 28 days) showed significant improvement in all major symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, belching, heartburn, epigastric pain, acid regurgitation, abdominal bloating & loss of appetite. == Safety and tolerability == A post-marketing study, conducted by the innovator, in over 12,000 patients showed that only 0.75% of them developed adverse events attributable to the drug. The adverse reactions were mild to moderate, which resolved when the drug was discontinued. Commonly observed adverse events included constipation (0.19%) and increase in levels of liver enzymes, AST (0.17%) and ALT (0.25%). In a post-marketing study conducted in 1500 Indian patients, only 9 adverse events were reported in 9 patients (0.63%) that were of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse events observed included constipation, acidity, nausea, fatigue and headache, and were of mild to moderate intensity. In all clinical studies, troxipide was well tolerated. In a comparative study with ranitidine, troxipide was assessed as a more tolerable medication than ranitidine. A favorable tolerability profile for troxipide was reported by 95.45% of the investigators as compared to 65.45% for ranitidine while favorable tolerability profile was reported by 93.67% of the patients for troxipide and 64.55% for ranitidine. == References ==",Troxipide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.390948667307384e-06), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001616347290109843)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troxipide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Troxipide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troxipide?utm_source=openai')])"
3759,"('Biperiden (hydrochloride)', 'Kl 373 (hydrochloride)', 'Biperiden', 'Akineton', 'Biperidene')",Medical,"Biperiden, sold under the brand name Akineton among others, is a medication used to treat Parkinson disease, certain drug-induced movement disorders and Tourette Syndrome. It is not recommended for tardive dyskinesias. It is taken by mouth, injection into a vein, or muscle. Common side effects include blurred vision, dry mouth, sleepiness, constipation, and confusion. It should not be used in people with a bowel obstruction or glaucoma. It is unclear if use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Biperiden is in the anticholinergic family of medication. Biperiden was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Biperiden is no longer marketed in the United States. == Medical uses == Biperiden is used for the adjunctive treatment of all forms of Parkinson's disease (postencephalitic, idiopathic, and arteriosclerotic Parkinson's) and for reduced sweating in methadone users. It seems to exert better effects in the postencephalitic and idiopathic than in the arteriosclerotic type. Biperiden is also commonly used to improve acute extrapyramidal side effects related to antipsychotic drug therapy, such as akathisia. It relieves muscle rigidity, reduces abnormal sweating related with clozapine and methadone use and salivation, improves abnormal gait, and to lesser extent, tremor. In its role as a synthetic acetylcholine antagonist, biperiden has been analyzed as an alternative anticonvulsant for usage in the treatment of intoxication by organophosphorus nerve agents, such as sarin. It was also suggested by IV route for neuroleptic malignant syndrome. === Pregnancy and lactation === Pregnancy : In animal studies biperiden had no embryo- or fetotoxic effects. There is no sufficient clinical data on pregnant women. The drug should therefore be used cautiously during pregnancy. Lactation : Biperiden is found in the milk of lactating women. No sufficient clinical data exists regarding effects for the newborns. Additionally, biperiden may decrease maternal milk production. It is therefore recommended that biperiden is not used during lactation. === Children === Children and adolescents aged 1 year and older may be treated. The clinical experience is mainly on the short-term treatment of acute drug induced dystonic reactions. Doses should be reduced according to the weight of the patients. == Contraindications == Hypersensitivity to biperiden Narrow angle glaucoma Ileus Caution: People with obstructive diseases of the urogenital tract, people with a known history of seizures and those with potentially dangerous tachycardia == Side effects == Dose-dependent side effects are frequent. Particularly geriatric patients may react with confusional states or develop delirium. CNS : Drowsiness, vertigo, headache, and dizziness are frequent. With high doses nervousness, agitation, anxiety, delirium, and confusion are noted. Biperiden may be abused due to a short acting mood-elevating and euphoriant effect. The normal sleep architecture may be altered (REM sleep depression). Biperiden may lower the seizure-threshold. Some instances of dementia have been noted to correlate with chronic administration of anticholinergic medications such as biperiden for Parkinson's disease. Peripheral side effects : Blurred vision, dry mouth, impaired sweating, abdominal discomfort, and obstipation are frequent. Tachycardia may be noted. Allergic skin reactions may occur. Parenteral use may cause orthostatic hypotension. Eyes : Biperiden causes mydriasis with or without photophobia. It may precipitate narrow angle glaucoma. == Interactions == Other anticholinergic drugs (e.g. spasmolytics, antihistamines, TCAs) : Side effects of biperiden may be increased. Quinidine : Increased anticholinergic action (particular on AV conduction). Antipsychotics : Long-term use of biperiden may mask or increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Pethidine (meperidine) : Central effects and side effects of pethidine may be increased. Metoclopramide : Action of metoclopramide is decreased. Alcohol : Risk of serious intoxication. == Overdose == Biperiden mimics an atropine intoxication with mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, red face, atonic states of bowels and bladder, and hyperthermia in high doses. Central consequences are agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. An untreated overdose may be fatal, particularly in children. Premortal signs are respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. A specific antagonist is physostigmine which combines a peripheral and a central action. Carbachol can be used to treat atonic bowels and bladder. The vital functions should be monitored and stabilized. It may be necessary to treat hyperthermia with cooling blankets. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Anticholinergic activity ==== Biperiden is an anticholinergic. It is specifically an antimuscarinic, acting as a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. It antagonizes all five subtypes of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. However, it is said to have weaker antagonistic activity at the muscarinic acetylcholine M2 receptor compared to the M1, M3, M4, and M5 receptor. It has an atropine-like blocking effect on all peripheral structures which are parasympathetic-innervated (e.g. cardiovascular and visceral organs). It also has a prominent central blocking effect on M1 receptors. ==== Other actions ==== Biperiden also acts as FIASMA (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase). === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability is only 33 ± 5% due to extensive first-pass metabolism. In young, healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations following a single oral 4 mg immediate-release dose are reached after 1.5 hours. The elimination half-life has been determined as 18.4 hours, and may be prolonged in geriatric patients. After a 4 mg intravenous dose, the elimination half-life is approximately 24 hours. == History == Biperiden was synthesized by the German chemist W. Klavehn from Knoll AG, Germany. In March 1953 a patent was applied for in Germany and subsequently in many other countries. A US patent application was filed in March 1954 and granted in April 1957. One website reported that it was not commercially available in the United States as of 2017. == References ==",Akineton,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.156323378381785e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00033885458833537996)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biperiden?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Biperiden', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biperiden?utm_source=openai')])"

At Roche, palovarotene was evaluated in more than 800 individuals including healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A one-year trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit on lung density in moderate-to-severe emphysema secondary to severe α(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2011, animal studies demonstrated that RARγ agonists, including palovarotene, blocked new bone formation in both an injury-induced mouse model of heterotopic ossification (HO) and a genetically modified biological mouse model of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva containing a continuously active ACVR1/ALK2 receptor in a dose-dependent manner.

Phase II clinical studies failed to show a significant change in heterotopic bone volume, the main outcome measure, but prompted further investigation in a phase III clinical trial. In December 2022, the FDA declined to approve palovarotene for the fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva without additional clinical trial data.

3762,"('Bendazol', 'Dibazol', 'Dibazole', 'Bendazole', 'Tromasedan')",Medical,"Anthelmintics or antihelminthics are a group of antiparasitic drugs that expel parasitic worms (helminths) and other internal parasites from the body by either stunning or killing them without causing significant damage to the host. They may also be called vermifuges (those that stun) or vermicides (those that kill). Anthelmintics are used to treat people who are infected by helminths, a condition called helminthiasis. These drugs are also used to treat infected animals, particularly small ruminants such as goats and sheep. Anthelmintic medication is also used in mass deworming campaigns of school-aged children in many developing countries. Anthelmintics are also used for mass deworming of livestock. The drugs of choice for soil-transmitted helminths are mebendazole and albendazole; for schistosomiasis and tapeworms it is praziquantel. == Types == Many early treatments were herbal, such as the oil of herbs of the genus Chenopodium that were given as anthelmintic treatment for centuries. In 1908 it was found that the active constituent was ascaridole. From the 1920s to the 1970s, halogenated hydrocarbons (such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene and hexachloroethane) were used in a string of continually more efficacious anthelmintics, until their underlying host toxicity was revealed. The modern broad-spectrum anthelmintics were developed by pharmaceutical companies that can afford the screening programs and testing systems that modern drug development involves. Historically, there have been three main classes of broad-spectrum anthelmintics. These are benzimidazoles, imidazothiazoles/tetrahydropyrimidines, and macrocyclic lactones. Benzimidazoles disrupt parasitic worms' microtubules, a critical part of their cells' cytoskeletons. Drugs in this category include: Albendazole – effective against threadworms, roundworms, whipworms, tapeworms, hookworms Mebendazole – effective against various nematodes Thiabendazole – effective against various nematodes Fenbendazole – effective against various parasites Triclabendazole – effective against liver flukes Flubendazole – effective against most intestinal parasites Imidathiazoles/tetrahydropyrimidines are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, including: Levamisole Pyrantel pamoate – effective against most parasitic nematodes of the GIT Macrocyclic lactones are glutamate-gated chloride channel agonists, and include: Avermectins (including ivermectin and moxidectin) - effective against most common intestinal worms, except tapeworms, for which praziquantel is commonly used in conjunction for mass dewormings Drugs not members of these three main categories include: Diethylcarbamazine – effective against Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, and Loa loa Salicylanilide – mitochondrial un-couplers such as Niclosamide and Oxyclozanide, and are used only for flatworm infections Nitazoxanide – readily kills Ascaris lumbricoides, and also possesses antiprotozoal effects. This is also an ascaricide. Oxamniquine – effective against flatworms (e.g., tapeworms and schistosoma) Praziquantel – effective against flatworms (e.g., tapeworms and schistosoma) Octadepsipeptides (e.g. Emodepside) – effective against a variety of gastrointestinal helminths Monepantel (aminoacetonitrile class) – effective against a variety of nematodes including those resistant to other anthelmintic classes Spiroindoles (e.g. derquantel) – effective against a variety of nematodes including those resistant to other anthelmintic classes Artemisinin – shows anthelmintic activity == Anthelmintic resistance == Anthelmintic resistance occurs when a heritable genetic change occurs in the parasite's DNA, rendering it insensitive to a previously effective anthelmintic drug. This is a particularly serious problem in helminth parasites of small ruminant farm animals. There are many factors that contribute to anthelmintic resistance, such as frequent, mass anthelmintic treatment, underdosing, treating repeatedly with only one anthelmintic, and resistance being transmitted during transfer of animals. Anthelmintic resistance in parasites is widespread; drug resistance exists in all livestock hosts and to all anthelmintic drug classes. This is a major threat to the sustainability of modern ruminant livestock production, resulting in reduced productivity, compromised animal health and welfare, and increased greenhouse gas emissions through increased parasitism and farm inputs. A database of published and unpublished European AR research on gastrointestinal nematodes was collated in 2020. A total of 197 publications were available for analysis, representing 535 studies in 22 countries and spanning the period 1980–2020. Results in sheep and goats since 2010 reveal an average prevalence of resistance to benzimidazoles of 86%, moxidectin 52%, and levamisole 48%. All major gastrointestinal nematode genera survived treatment in various studies. In cattle, prevalence of anthelminthic resistance varied between anthelmintic classes from 0–100% (benzimidazoles and macrocyclic lactones), 0–17% (levamisole) and 0–73% (moxidectin), and both Cooperia and Ostertagia survived treatment. However, resistance is not seen as often in the parasitic helminths that affect cattle, compared to sheep. Reasons for this include the fact that cattle receive anthelminthic drugs less frequently than sheep, and the different nature of their faecal pats that could leave different numbers of resistant infective larvae on the pasture. Unlike sheep, cattle can develop sufficient immunoprotection against such parasites. Both in vitro (egg hatch assay, larval development test, larval motility test, polymerase chain reaction and in vivo methods (fecal egg count reduction test) can be used to detect anthelmintic resistance.[11] Treatment with an antihelminthic drug kills worms whose phenotype renders them susceptible to the drug, but resistant parasites survive and pass on their ""resistance"" genes. Resistant varieties accumulate, and treatment failure finally occurs. The ways in which anthelmintics are used have contributed to a major anthelmintic resistance issue worldwide. From the 1950s to the 1980s, new classes of effective and inexpensive anthelmintics were made available every decade, leading to excessive use throughout agriculture and disincentivizing alternative anti-nematodal strategies. Developing new anthelmintics is time-consuming and expensive therefore, it is important to use the ones that currently exist in a way that will minimize or prevent the development of anthelmintic resistance.[11] Some of these methods are ensuring animals are not being underdosed, rotating the anthelmintics that are being used, and rotation of grazing land to reduce the parasite population. Other methods include using a combination of multiple different anthelmintics, and the use of refugia based strategies. Refugia refers to the portion of the parasite population not being exposed to anthelmintics. This population is therefore not undergoing selection for resistance. Use of refugia helps to slow down the speed of evolution of resistance to anthelmintic drugs. Due to the problem of anthelmintic resistance, research into alternatives is continuing, including in the field of rational drug design. == See also == Dysphania ambrosioides, an herb native to Central and South America Santonin, a historical anthelmintic no longer in use 4-Hexylresorcinol == References == == External links == Anthelmintics at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Holden-Dye, L. and Walker, R.

This drug is still used, in combination with Prednisolone, by veterinarians to treat arthritis in animals. It can be prepared starting from anilin, benzaldehyde and pyruvic acid in absolute ethanol. Use of this drug in humans ceased in the 1930s due to the discovery that cinchophen can cause serious liver damage. There is some evidence that it stimulates C-Fos. == History == Cinchophen was first introduced in 1908 as 'Atophan' and used for the treatment of gout and arthritis. It was efficacious at reducing the buildup of uric acid and became a popular medicine. Further studies in 1911 and 1912 were successful in isolating metabolites of cinchophen from human urine. During the 1920s, cases of severe adverse effects such as liver damage and cirrhosis had been clinically observed; the first case of jaundice was recorded in 1923 and the first fatality occurred in 1925. Approximately half of all patients experienced toxic effects and by 1932 there were 32 drugs available that contained cinchophen or its derivatives as their active ingredients, experiments were conducted to determine the drugs pharmacology but the mechanism of drug induced liver injury remained unclear. Cinchophen was considered to be too dangerous for human use in most countries but has applications in veterinary medicine as a treatment for osteoarthritis in dogs. == Available forms == Cinchophen can be administered orally in tablet form or intravenously in liquid form. == Toxicity and side-effects == Cinchophen toxicity may present 6 to 12 hours after administration. Symptoms can include hyperventilation, hyperthermia (fever), gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhoea, hives, vomiting, delirium, hepatitis, jaundice, anorexia, convulsions, coma and death. Fatty degeneration of the heart and kidneys, necrosis of hepatic cells in addition to yellow atrophy of the liver have been recorded in autopsy findings. == Treatment == Cinchophen administration should be immediately ceased if symptoms occur. There is no cure for acute cinchophen poisoning but early diagnosis and symptomatic treatments may be effective. Calcium lactate may be used to treat hives and oral or intravenous glucose can relieve gastrointestinal symptoms. If glucose is given, insulin may be needed to protect the liver from further damage. Oral alkali treatments can combat acidosis and anti-emetics may be required to manage nausea and vomiting. == Veterinary medicine == Cinchophen is the main active ingredient in prednoleucotropin (PLT), a medication used in the treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs. PLT may produce analgesic and anti-pyretic effects at higher doses. Osteoarthritic dogs treated with PLT have shown significant improvement of joint mobility, stiffness, lameness and weight bearing capacity. When administered correctly, PLT has shown similar clinical efficacy to phenylbutazone. The effects of PLT toxicity in dogs are similar to cinchophen toxicity in humans and include hepatotoxicity and gastric ulceration. == References ==",Atophan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.11667144298553467), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.10030242055654526), (' INDUSTR', -0.0003407071635592729), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.004411726724356413), ('ICAL', -3.6954811548639555e-06), (',', -0.31330129504203796), ('ĠINDU', -0.03672781586647034), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032549516763538122)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinchophen ', [])"

Verteporfin accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 689 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels. Verteporfin is also used off-label for the treatment of central serous retinopathy. == Administration == Verteporfin is usually injected intravenously into the largest arm vein. It is injected at a dose of 6 mg/m2 and light-activated. It is usually given 15 minutes before laser treatment. This dose can be repeated 4 times per year. == Contraindications == Porphyria. == Side effects == Most common side effects are blurred vision, headache, and local effects at the injection site. Also, photosensitivity; it is strictly advised to avoid exposure to sunlight and unscreened lighting until 48 hours after verteporfin administration. Dogs and rats have been treated with inactivated daily doses 32–70 times higher than the dose advised for humans. The 4 weeks of treatment resulted in mild extravascular hemolysis and hematopoiesis in the animals. == Light-activated cytotoxicity == Used by itself, the clinical recommended dose for verteporfin is not cytotoxic to human tissue. Though under light activation, in the presence of oxygen, it can form cytotoxic agents inside the tissue. The agents form when the porphyrin absorbs enough light to generate a reactive but short-lived singlet oxygen. The brief singlet oxygen can micro damage biological structures, leading to a local vascular occlusion. == Interactions == Verteporfin is known to interact with the herbal remedy feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), the latter of which seems to act as an antagonist to verteporfin for unknown reasons. Taking the two substances simultaneously is inadvisable. Verteporfin does not appear to be metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes, therefore not affecting Cytochrome P450 metabolism of other drugs. == Shortages == In May 2020, a low manufacturing capacity caused disruption. This affected the usage of verteporfin among providers and patients in Europe.
