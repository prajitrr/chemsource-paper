This includes impetigo, cellulitis, pneumonia, septic arthritis, and otitis externa. It is not effective for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It can be used by mouth and by injection. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Clostridioides difficile diarrhea may also occur. It is not recommended in people who have previously had a penicillin allergy. Use during pregnancy appears to be relatively safe. Cloxacillin is in the penicillin family of medications. Cloxacillin was patented in 1960 and approved for medical use in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not commercially available in the United States. == Mechanism of action == It is semisynthetic and in the same class as penicillin. Cloxacillin is used against staphylococci that produce beta-lactamase, due to its large R chain, which does not allow the beta-lactamases to bind. This drug has a weaker antibacterial activity than benzylpenicillin, and is devoid of serious toxicity except for allergic reactions. == Society and culture == Cloxacillin was discovered and developed by Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline).

The drug is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC (also called malignant hepatoma), the most common type of liver cancer. Brivanib is no longer in active development. Brivanib alaninate is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (as is sorafenib). Brivanib alaninate also inhibits VEGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), which is known to play a major role in the etiopathogenesis of HCC. To date, brivanib alaninate has been investigated in 29 studies, including more than 4,000 patients around the world. == Hepatocellular carcinoma (summary) == Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary cancer of the liver and is more common in men than in women. The disease occurs mostly in people who have scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) or after infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Symptoms include pain and swelling in the abdomen, weight loss, weakness, loss of appetite, and nausea. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a severe and life-threatening disease that is associated with poor overall survival. While the choice of treatment depends mainly on how advanced the disease is, the only proven therapies to cure the cancer are either surgical removal of the tumors or remove and replace the liver via transplantation, but these therapies can only be carried out in very few patients. Other treatments include chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Radiofrequency ablation and ethanol injection are also used to remove small tumors. As a result of poor liver function, metastases, or both, only 10% to 20% of patients undergo surgery. In patients having surgery, the 5-year survival rate is only 25% to 50%. Several chemotherapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Doxorubicin (trade name Adriamycin; also known as hydroxydaunorubicin), the most widely used agent in HCC, has shown a 4% to 10.5% response rate in patients with HCC. Studies have shown that the overall response (OR) rate, but not overall survival (OS), doubles when doxorubicin was given in combination with cisplatin, IFN, and 5-fluorouracil. The multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib (trade name Nexavar), which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, raf, c-kit, and flt-3, has been shown to inhibit HCC-induced proliferation and angiogenesis. Sorafenib has also been shown to provide a significant improvement in OS in patients with HCC. Based on these results, researchers concluded that this class of agents may be effective in the treatment of HCC. == Biological activity == Brivanib is the alanine ester of a VEGFR-2 inhibitor BMS-540215 and is hydrolyzed to the active moiety BMS-540215 in vivo. BMS-540215, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, shows potent and selective inhibition of VEGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinases. BMS-540215 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of human VEGFR-2, with an IC50 of 25 nmol/L and Ki of 26 nmol/L. In addition, it inhibits VEGFR-1 (IC50 = 380 nmol/L) and VEGFR-3 (IC50 = 10 nmol/L). BMS-540215 also showed good selectivity for FGFR-1 (IC50 = 148 nmol/L), FGFR-2 (IC50 = 125 nmol/L), and FGFR-3 (IC50 = 68 nmol/L). Furthermore, BMS-540215 has been shown to selectively inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells stimulated by VEGF and FGF in vitro with IC50 values of 40 and 276 nmol/L, respectively. It also shows broad-spectrum in vivo antitumor activity over multiple dose levels and induces stasis in large tumors, suggesting that it may have a role in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). == Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles == === Mechanisms of action === The exact mechanisms by which brivanib treatment induces growth inhibition are not well understood. Ongoing research has shown that brivanib affects the host endothelium based on both in vitro and in vivo effects). Brivanib may prevent the tumor mass from expanding by cutting off the supply of nutrients and growth factors to the tumor cells. A recent study showed that brivanib effectively inhibits tumor growth and that brivanib-induced growth inhibition is associated with inactivation of VEGFR-2, increased apoptosis, a reduction in microvessel density, inhibition of cell proliferation, and down-regulation of cell cycle regulators, including cyclin D1, Cdk-2, Cdk-4, cyclin B1, and phospho-c-Myc. Based on this study, researchers have concluded that cell cycle arrest due to a reduction in positive cell cycle regulators may be responsible for the observed growth inhibition. The same study showed that treatment with brivanib also led to a decrease in the number of proliferating cells compared with control. == Ongoing clinical development == While a phase II trial for hepatocellular carcinoma showed an acceptable safety profile and results indicating efficacy against HCC, four subsequent phase III trials found no increased survival and increased rates of adverse effects when compared with sorafenib or placebo. == Regulatory status == On 27 October 2011, orphan designation (EU/3/11/918) was granted by the European Commission to Bristol-Myers Squibb for brivanib alaninate for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

503,"('Ospemifene', 'Osphena', 'Senshio', 'Deamino-hydroxytoremifene', 'Fc-1271')",Medical,"Ospemifene (brand names Osphena and Senshio produced by Shionogi) is an oral medication indicated for the treatment of dyspareunia – pain during sexual intercourse – encountered by some women, more often in those who are post-menopausal. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) acting similarly to an estrogen on the vaginal epithelium, building vaginal wall thickness which in turn reduces the pain associated with dyspareunia. Dyspareunia is most commonly caused by ""vulvar and vaginal atrophy."" The medication was approved by the FDA in February 2013 and by the European Commission for marketing in the EU in January 2015. == Medical uses == Ospemifene is used to treat dyspareunia. In the US it is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause. In the EU it is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe symptomatic VVA in post-menopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal oestrogen therapy. == Contraindications == Women with ""undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia; active or history of deep vein thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; arterial thromboembolic disease; and are or may become pregnant"" or ""with known or suspected breast cancer or those with extreme hepatic impairment"" should not take ospemifene. This is not a full list of contraindications. == Side effects == Side effects associated with ospemifene include vaginal discharge, hot flashes, and diaphoresis. More serious adverse effects are similar to those of estrogens and estrogen receptor modulators. These include, but are not limited to, thromboembolism, allergic reactions, fatigue, and headache, and others could occur. There are other additional adverse effects. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator. As such, many of the effects produced by estrogens are produced by ospemifene. The boxed warning of the medication indicates ospemifene may thicken the endometrium, which could lead to unusual bleeding and endometrial cancer. For women taking estrogens, concurrently taking a type of drug called a progestin has been shown to decrease the occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia. In theory, progestins may be expected to attenuate ospemifene's effects on endometrial thickening. However clinical trials confirming this have not been conducted. Like estrogens, ospemifene also may increase the risk for cardiovascular events, including ""stroke, coronary heart disease, venous thromboembolism,"" and others. The risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes is given as 0.72 and 1.45 per 1,000 women, while that of deep vein thrombosis is estimated to be 1.45 per 1,000 women. The risks of these adverse events in women taking ospemifene are lower than those in women taking estrogen alone in the form of oral conjugated estrogens. Studies have not documented the relative risk compared with women taking estrogen/progestin therapy. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ospemifene is ""an estrogen agonist/antagonist that makes vaginal tissue thicker and less fragile resulting in a reduction in the amount of pain women experience with sexual intercourse."" This medication should be used for the shortest amount of time possible due to associated adverse effects. Ospemifene might not have an adverse influence on coagulation, in contrast to estrogens and other SERMs like tamoxifen and raloxifene. A binding assay was also performed to measure the affinity of ospemifene for the estrogen receptor (ERα and ERβ). The study showed that ospemifene bound ERα and ERβ with similar affinity. Ospemifene bound the estrogen receptors with a lower affinity than estradiol. Ospemifene was shown to be an antagonist of ""ERE-mediated transactivation on MCF-7 cells,"" which the authors concluded indicates ""anti-estrogenic activity in breast cancer cells."" === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics of ospemifene were dose-dependent over a dose range of 10 to 800 mg/day. == History == === Approval process === Hormos Medical Ltd., which is a part of QuatRx Pharmaceuticals, filed a patent on January 19, 2005, for a solid dosage form of ospemifene. In March 2010, QuatRX Pharmaceuticals licensed ospemifene to Shionogi & Co., Ltd. for clinical development and marketing. A New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the FDA on April 26, 2012. Amendments to the NDA were submitted in June, July, August, October, and November 2012, and January and February 2013. It was ultimately approved by the FDA on February 26, 2013. Ospemifene (under the brand name Senshio) was subsequently approved by the European Commission for marketing in the EU in January 2015. === Preclinial and clinical trials === Preclinical trials were performed in ovariectomized rats to model menopause. Oral ospemifene was compared with raloxifene (another SERM), its metabolites 4-hydroxy ospemifene and 4'-hydroxy ospemifene, estradiol, and ospemifene administered as an intravaginal suppository. Estradiol was used as a positive control and raloxifene was used because it is in the same drug class as ospemifene. Multiple doses of oral ospemifene were tested. 10 mg/kg/day of Ospemifene was found to cause a greater increase in vaginal weight and vaginal epithelial height than 10 mg/kg/day of raloxifene. Vaginal weight had a 1.46x increase after a two-week treatment of 10 mg/kg/day of ospemifene. The number of progesterone receptors was increased in the vaginal stroma and epithelium, which indicates that ospemifene has ""estrogenic activity."" Two 12-week phase 3 clinical trials were performed for ospemifene. One evaluated the effects of Ospemifene on vaginal tissue thickness, composition and vaginal pH. The other evaluated the effects of Ospemifene on vaginal tissue and on symptoms of dyspareunia. Between the two trials, 4 signs and symptoms were measured. These included three tissue-related signs, two of which represented histological changes in the vaginal tissue (change in percent parabasal cells and change in percent superficial cells) and the third was ""change in vaginal pH"". Dyspareunia was evaluated in one of the trials. It was defined as ""change in most bothersome symptom"" of discomfort during sexual activity and further limited to symptoms of either vaginal dryness or vaginal pain."" Ospemifene produced more changes in vaginal tissue and greater reduction in dyspareunia symptoms than placebo. A dose-response also was observed in the trial; ospemifene 60 mg had greater efficacy than ospemifene 30 mg. Safety was also evaluated in these phase 3 trials. There was a 5.2% increase in the incidence of hot flushes, 1.6% increase in urinary tract infections, and 0.5% increase in the incidence of headache with ospemifene over placebo. One of the phase 3 trials was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 826 post-menopausal women. The trial patients were required to have one or more symptom of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) that was moderate or severe in nature with fewer than 5% of cells that were superficial when examined by a vaginal smear and a vaginal pH of at least 5.0. This trial did not quantify relief of dyspareunia as a study outcome measure. The other phase 3 trial was conducted in 605 women aged 40 to 80, who were diagnosed with VVA, and whose worst symptom was dyspareunia. == Society and culture == === Economics === In the first half of the 2013 fiscal year, Osphena generated 0.1 B yen in revenue, which is roughly equivalent to $974,944 U.S. dollars. When Osphena was put onto the market, it was predicted to earn $495 million in 2017. == References ==",Senshio,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8715683836489916e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005600076401606202)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.06196768581867218)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is a synthetic halogenated derivative of febrifugine, a natural quinazolinone alkaloid which can be found in the Chinese herb Dichroa febrifuga (Chang Shan). Collgard Biopharmaceuticals is developing halofuginone for the treatment of scleroderma and it has received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Halofuginone inhibits the development of T helper 17 cells, immune cells that play an important role in autoimmune disease, but it does not affect other kinds of T cells which are involved in normal immune function. Halofuginone therefore has potential for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Halofuginone is also an inhibitor of collagen type I gene expression and as a consequence it may inhibit tumor cell growth. Halofuginone exerts its effects by acting as a high affinity inhibitor of the enzyme glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase.

506,"('Pf 04418948', 'Ex-a1253', 'S7211')",Medical," Studies of the role of the prostaglandin EP(2) receptor) have been limited by the availability of potent and selective antagonist tools. Here we describe the in vitro/in vivo pharmacological characterization of a novel EP(2) receptor antagonist, PF-04418948 (1-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-3-{[(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)oxy]methyl} azetidine-3-carboxylic acid). Functional antagonist potency was assessed in cell-based systems expressing human EP(2) receptors and native tissue preparations from human, dog and mouse. The selectivity of PF-04418948 was assessed against related receptors and a panel of GPCRs, ion channels and enzymes. The ability of PF-04418948 to pharmacologically block EP(2) receptor function in vivo was tested in rats. PF-04418948 inhibited prostaglandin E(2)(PGE(2))-induced increase in cAMP in cells expressing EP(2) receptors with a functional K(B) value of 1.8 nM. In human myometrium, PF-04418948 produced a parallel, rightward shift of the butaprost-induced inhibition of the contractions induced by electrical field stimulation with an apparent K(B) of 5.4 nM. In dog bronchiole and mouse trachea, PF-04418948 produced parallel rightward shifts of the PGE(2)-induced relaxation curve with a K(B) of 2.5 nM and an apparent K(B) of 1.3 nM respectively. Reversal of the PGE(2)-induced relaxation in the mouse trachea by PF-04418948 produced an IC(50) value of 2.7 nM. Given orally, PF-04418948 attenuated the butaprost-induced cutaneous blood flow response in rats. PF-04418948 was selective for EP(2) receptors over homologous and unrelated receptors, enzymes and channels. PF-04418948 is an orally active, potent and selective surmountable EP(2) receptor antagonist that should aid further elaboration of EP(2) receptor function. Understanding the role of the EP(2) receptor has been hampered by the lack of a selective antagonist. Recently, a selective EP(2) receptor antagonist, PF-04418948, has been discovered. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the selectivity profile of PF-04418948 for the EP(2) receptor over other EP receptors using a range of isolated tissue systems. PF-04418948 was profiled on a range of isolated tissues to assess its EP receptor potency and selectivity: ONO-DI-004-induced contraction of guinea pig trachea (EP(1)); ONO-AE1-259 and PGE(2)- induced relaxation of mouse and guinea pig trachea (EP(2)); PGE(2)-induced depolarization of guinea pig isolated vagus (EP(3)); PGE(2)-induced relaxation of human and rat trachea (EP(4)). PF-04418948 was also profiled in functional murine TP, IP, DP and FP receptor assays. In bioassay systems, where assessment of potency/selectivity is made against the 'native' receptor, PF-04418948 only acted as an antagonist of EP(2) receptor-mediated events. PF-04418948 competitively inhibited relaxations of murine and guinea pig trachea induced by ONO-AE1-259 and PGE(2) respectively. However, the affinity of PF-04418948 was not equal in the two preparations. Using a wide range of bioassay systems, we have demonstrated that PF-04418948 is a selective EP(2)-receptor antagonist. Interestingly, an atypically low affinity was found on the guinea pig trachea, questioning its utility as an EP(2) receptor assay system. Nevertheless, this compound should be an invaluable tool for investigating the biological activity of PGE(2) and the role of EP(2) receptors in health and disease.",Pf 04418948,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.38687223196029663), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.16294345259666443), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07892434298992157)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -2.15310683415737e-05)])","('INFO; https://www.tocris.com/products/pf-04418948_4818,https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/57971/,https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/pf-04418948-tocris-2/481850 ', [])"

The post-translational modification SUMOylation plays key roles in leukemogenesis and AML response to therapies. Here, we show that TAK-981 (subasumstat), a first-in-class SUMOylation inhibitor, is endowed with potent anti-leukemic activity in various preclinical models of AML. TAK-981 targets AML cell lines and patient blast cells in vitro and in vivo in xenografted mice with minimal toxicity on normal hematopoietic cells. Moreover, it synergizes with 5-azacytidine (AZA), a DNA-hypomethylating agent now used in combination with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax to treat AML patients unfit for standard chemotherapies. Interestingly, TAK-981+AZA combination shows higher anti-leukemic activity than AZA+venetoclax combination both in vitro and in vivo, at least in the models tested. Mechanistically, TAK-981 potentiates the transcriptional reprogramming induced by AZA, promoting apoptosis, alteration of the cell cycle and differentiation of the leukemic cells. In addition, TAK-981+AZA treatment induces many genes linked to inflammation and immune response pathways. In particular, this leads to the secretion of type-I interferon by AML cells. Finally, TAK-981+AZA induces the expression of natural killer-activating ligands (MICA/B) and adhesion proteins (ICAM-1) at the surface of AML cells. Consistently, TAK-981+AZA-treated AML cells activate natural killer cells and increase their cytotoxic activity. Targeting SUMOylation with TAK-981 may thus be a promising strategy to both sensitize AML cells to AZA and reduce their immune-escape capacities. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a member of a ubiquitin-like protein superfamily. SUMOylation is a reversible posttranslational modification that has been implicated in the regulation of various cellular processes including inflammatory responses and expression of type 1 interferons (IFN1). In this report, we have explored the activity of the selective small molecule SUMOylation inhibitor subasumstat (TAK-981) in promoting antitumor innate immune responses. We demonstrate that treatment with TAK-981 results in IFN1-dependent macrophage and natural killer (NK) cell activation, promoting macrophage phagocytosis and NK cell cytotoxicity in ex vivo assays. Furthermore, pretreatment with TAK-981 enhanced macrophage phagocytosis or NK cell cytotoxicity against CD20+ target cells in combination with the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. In vivo studies demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity of TAK-981 and rituximab in CD20+ lymphoma xenograft models. Combination of TAK-981 with anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab also resulted in enhanced antitumor activity. TAK-981 is currently being studied in phase 1 clinical trials (#NCT03648372, #NCT04074330, #NCT04776018, and #NCT04381650; www.clinicaltrials.gov) for the treatment of patients with lymphomas and solid tumors. Novel targeted agents used in therapy of lymphoid malignancies are recognized to have complex immune-mediated effects. Sumoylation, a posttranslational modification of target proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO), regulates a variety of cellular processes indispensable in immune cell activation. Despite this, the role of sumoylation in T-cell biology in context of cancer is not known. TAK-981 (subasumstat) is a small-molecule inhibitor of the SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE) that forms a covalent adduct with an activated SUMO protein. Using T cells derived from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we demonstrate that targeting SAE activates type I IFN response. This is accompanied by largely intact T-cell activation in response to T-cell receptor engagement, with increased expression of CD69 and CD38. Furthermore, TAK-981 decreases regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and enhances secretion of IFNγ by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These findings were recapitulated in mouse models, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of T-cell activation regulated by SUMO modification. Relevant to the consideration of TAK-981 as an effective agent for immunotherapy in hematologic malignancies, we demonstrate that the downstream impact of TAK-981 administration is enhancement of the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells, thus uncovering immune implications of targeting sumoylation in lymphoid neoplasia.",Subasumstat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.246537173457909e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00033158526639454067), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005238971672952175)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00020354038861114532), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11022956/?utm_source=openai), [ashpublications.org](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/139/18/2770/484191/The-SUMOylation-inhibitor-subasumstat-potentiates?utm_source=openai), [ascopubs.org](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.2506?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=350, start_index=9, title='The SUMOylation inhibitor subasumstat potentiates rituximab activity by IFN1-dependent macrophage and NK cell stimulation - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11022956/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=350, start_index=9, title='The SUMOylation inhibitor subasumstat potentiates rituximab activity by IFN1-dependent macrophage and NK cell stimulation | Blood | American Society of Hematology', type='url_citation', url='https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/139/18/2770/484191/The-SUMOylation-inhibitor-subasumstat-potentiates?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=350, start_index=9, title='A phase 1b, multicenter, dose-escalation study of subasumstat (TAK-981) in combination with pembrolizumab in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors. | Journal of Clinical Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.2506?utm_source=openai')])"

In addition, the effects of LQFM030 on the levels of the p53/MDM2 complex were also carried out using 3T3 cells as a p53 wild-type model.

510,"('Ixazomib citrate', 'Ixazomib citrate (ester)', 'Ixazomib citrate [usan]', 'Ninlaro (tn)', 'Ixazomib citrate (jan/usan)')",Medical,"Ixazomib (trade name Ninlaro) is a drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a type of white blood cell cancer, in combination with other drugs. It is taken by mouth in the form of capsules. Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation and low platelet count. Like the older bortezomib (which can only be given by injection), it acts as a proteasome inhibitor, has orphan drug status in the US and Europe, and is a boronic acid derivative. The drug was developed by Takeda. In the US, it is approved since November 2015, and in the EU since November 2016. == Medical uses == Ixazomib is used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adults after at least one prior therapy. There are no experiences with children and youths under 18 years of age. The study relevant for approval included 722 people. In this study, ixazomib increased the median time of progression-free survival from 14.7 months (in the placebo+lenalidomide+dexamethasone study arm including 362 people) to 20.6 months (under ixazomib+lenalidomide+dexamethasone, 360 people), which was a statistically significant effect (p = 0.012). 11.7% of patients in the ixazomib group had a complete response to the treatment, versus 6.6% in the placebo group. Overall response rate (complete plus partial) was 78.3% versus 71.5%. A phase 3 study demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (IRd) compared with placebo. High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities were defined as del(17p), t(4;14), and/or t(14;16); additionally, patients were assessed for 1q21 amplification. Of 722 randomized patients, 552 had cytogenetic results; 137 (25%) had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and 172 (32%) had 1q21 amplification alone. PFS was improved with IRd versus placebo in both high-risk and standard-risk cytogenetics subgroups: in high-risk patients, with median PFS of 21.4 versus 9.7 months; in standard-risk patients, with median PFS of 20.6 versus 15.6 months. This PFS benefit was consistent across subgroups with individual high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, including patients with del(17p). PFS was also longer with IRd versus placebo- in patients with 1q21 amplification, and in the ""expanded high-risk"" group, defined as those with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and/or 1q21 amplification. IRd demonstrated substantial benefit compared with placebo in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with high-risk and standard-risk cytogenetics, and improves the poor PFS associated with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Ixazomib and lenalidomide are teratogenic in animal studies. The latter is contraindicated in pregnant women, making this therapy regimen unsuitable for this group. It is not known whether ixazomib or its metabolites pass into the breast milk. == Side effects == Common side effects of the ixazomib+lenalidomide+dexamethasone study therapy included diarrhoea (42% versus 36% under placebo+lenalidomide+dexamethasone), constipation (34% versus 25%), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count; 28% versus 14%), peripheral neuropathy (28% versus 21%), nausea (26% versus 21%), peripheral oedema (swelling; 25% versus 18%), vomiting (22% versus 11%), and back pain (21% versus 16%). Serious diarrhoea or thrombocytopenia occurred in 2% of patients, respectively. Side effects of ixazomib alone were only assessed in a small number of people. Diarrhoea grade 2 or higher was found in 24% of these patients, thrombocytopenia grade 3 or higher in 28%, and fatigue grade 2 or higher in 26%. == Interactions == The drug has a low potential for interactions via cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver enzymes and transporter proteins. The only relevant finding in studies was a reduction of ixazomib blood levels when combined with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. The Cmax was reduced by 54% and the area under the curve by 74% in this study. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === At therapeutic concentrations, ixazomib selectively and reversibly inhibits the protein proteasome subunit beta type-5 (PSMB5) with a dissociation half-life of 18 minutes. This mechanism is the same as of bortezomib, which has a much longer dissociation half-life of 110 minutes; the related drug carfilzomib, by contrast, blocks PSMB5 irreversibly. Proteasome subunits beta type-1 and type-2 are only inhibited at high concentrations reached in cell culture models. PSMB5 is part of the 20S proteasome complex and has enzymatic activity similar to chymotrypsin. It induces apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death, in various cancer cell lines. A synergistic effect of ixazomib and lenalidomide has been found in a large number of myeloma cell lines. === Pharmacokinetics === The medication is taken orally as a prodrug, ixazomib citrate, which is a boronic ester; this ester rapidly hydrolyzes under physiological conditions to its biologically active form, ixazomib, a boronic acid. Absolute bioavailability is 58%, and highest blood plasma concentrations of ixazomib are reached after one hour. Plasma protein binding is 99%. The substance is metabolized by many CYP enzymes (percentages in vitro, at higher than clinical concentrations: CYP3A4 42.3%, CYP1A2 26.1%, CYP2B6 16.0%, CYP2C8 6.0%, CYP2D6 4.8%, CYP2C9 4.8%, CYP2C9 <1%) as well as non-CYP enzymes, which could explain the low interaction potential. Clearance is about 1.86 litres per hour with a wide variability of 44% between individuals, and plasma half-life is 9.5 days. 62% of ixazomib and its metabolites are excreted via the urine (of which less than 3.5% in unchanged form) and 22% via the faeces. == Chemistry == Ixazomib is a boronic acid and peptide analogue like the older bortezomib. It contains a derivative of the amino acid leucine with the carboxylic acid group being replaced by a boronic acid; and the remainder of the molecule has been likened to phenylalanine. The structure has been found through a large-scale screening of boron-containing molecules. == History == The drug was developed by Takeda. It got US and European orphan drug status for multiple myeloma in 2011, and for AL amyloidosis in 2012. Takeda submitted a US new drug application for multiple myeloma in July 2015. In September 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ixazomib combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone a priority review designation for multiple myeloma. On 20 November 2015, the FDA approved this combination for second-line treatment. The request for marketing authorisation in Europe was initially refused by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May 2016 due to insufficient data showing a benefit of treatment. After Takeda requested a re-examination, the EMA granted a marketing authorisation on 21 November 2016 on the condition that further efficacy studies be conducted. The approval indication is the same as in the US. == Research == As of January 2017, ixazomib is also in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of AL amyloidosis and plasmacytoma of the bones, and in Phase I/II trials for various other conditions. == References ==",Ixazomib citrate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.390948667307384e-06), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -4.31528314948082e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ixazomibcitrate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=110, start_index=9, title='Ixazomib Citrate - NCI', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ixazomibcitrate?utm_source=openai')])"

Other uses may include asthma and skin rashes for which it is taken by mouth. Onset of effects is within minutes when used in the eyes and within an hour when used in the nose. Effects last for up to 12 hours. Common side effects include headache, sleepiness, change in taste, and sore throat. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a second-generation antihistamine and works by blocking the release of a number of inflammatory mediators including histamine. Azelastine was patented in 1971 and came into medical use in 1986. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 124th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Azelastine nasal spray is indicated for the local treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis, such as rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal pruritus in people five years of age and older. In some countries, it is also indicated for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis in adults and children ≥ 12 years old. Azelastine eye drops are indicated for the local treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. == Side effects == Azelastine is safe and well tolerated in both adults and children with allergic rhinitis. Bitter taste, headache, nasal burning and somnolence are the most frequently reported adverse events. US prescribing recommendations warn against the concurrent use of alcohol and/or other central nervous system depressants, but to date there have been no studies to assess the effects of azelastine nasal spray on the CNS in humans. More recent studies have shown similar degrees of somnolence (approx. 2%) compared with placebo treatment. The most common side effect is a bitter taste (about 20% of people). Due to this, the manufacturer has produced another formulation of azelastine with sucralose. The problem of bitter taste may also be reduced by correct application of the nasal spray (i.e. slightly tipping the head forward and not inhaling the medication too deeply), or alternatively using the azelastine/sucralose formulation. In addition, anosmia (loss in the ability to smell) can occur with nasal spray antihistamines (including both formulations of azelastine). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Azelastine has a triple mode of action: Anti-histamine effect, Mast-cell stabilizing effect and Anti-inflammatory effect. === Pharmacokinetics === The systemic bioavailability of azelastine is approximately 40% when administered intranasally. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are observed within 2–3 hours. The elimination half life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance are 22 h, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg respectively (based on intravenous and oral administration data). Approximately 75% of an oral dose is excreted in feces. Pharmacokinetics of orally administered azelastine is not affected by age, gender, or hepatic impairment. ==== Metabolism ==== Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family into its active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, and two inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. == Chemical properties == The chemical nomenclature of azelastine is (±)-1-(2H)-phthalazinone, 4-[(4-chlorophenyl) methyl]-2-(hexahydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl)-monohydrochloride.

A rare but life-threatening side effect of gliflozins is ketoacidosis; it occurred in three patients (0.1%) in ertugliflozin studies. To lessen the risk of developing ketoacidosis (a serious condition in which the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones) after surgery, the FDA has approved changes to the prescribing information for SGLT2 inhibitor diabetes medicines to recommend they be stopped temporarily before scheduled surgery. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and trouble breathing. == Overdose == Up to sixfold clinical doses over two weeks, or 20-fold single doses, are tolerated by people without any toxic effects. == Interactions == Combining ertugliflozin with insulin or insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) may result in an increased risk for low blood sugar. Combination with diuretics may result in a higher risk for dehydration and low blood pressure. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions have been found in studies. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === === Pharmacokinetics === After oral intake, ertugliflozin is practically completely absorbed from the gut and undergoes no relevant first-pass effect. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after one hour. When in circulation, 93.6% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. Ertugliflocin is metabolised mainly to glucuronides by the enzymes UGT1A9 and UGT2B7. Cytochrome P450 enzymes play only a minor role in its metabolism. The elimination half-life is estimated to be 17 hours. 40.9% are eliminated via the feces (33.8% in unchanged form and 7.1% as metabolites) and 50.2% via the urine (1.5% unchanged and 48.7% as metabolites). The high proportion of unchanged substance in the feces is probably due to hydrolysis of the metabolites back to the parent substance. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Ertugliflozin, ertugliflozin combined with metformin, and ertugliflozin combined with sitagliptin were approved for medical use in the United States in December 2019, and in the European Union in March 2018. == References ==",Steglatro,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.887569048150908e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002783149539027363)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/steglatro.html ', [])"

We performed MPS of target genes using the Ion PGM system with the Ion AmpliSeq and HiSeq 2000 systems using SureSelect in 1389 samples (1120 nonsyndromic hearing loss cases and 269 normal hearing controls). We filtered the variants identified using allele frequencies in a large number of controls and 12 predication program scores. We identified 8376 kinds of variants in the 1389 samples, and 409 835 total variants were detected. After filtering the variants, we selected 2631 kinds of candidate variants. The number of GJB2 mutations was exceptionally high among these variants, followed by those in CDH23, SLC26A4, MYO15A, COL11A2, MYO7A, and OTOF.

517,"('Degarelix', 'Degarelix acetate', 'Firmagon', 'Uglypeptide1', 'Degarelix (inn/usan)')",Medical,"Degarelix, sold under the brand name Firmagon among others, is a hormonal therapy used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Testosterone is a male hormone that promotes growth of many prostate tumours and therefore reducing circulating testosterone to very low (castration) levels is often the treatment goal in the management of advanced prostate cancer. Degarelix has an immediate onset of action, binding to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the pituitary gland and blocking their interaction with GnRH. This induces a fast and profound reduction in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and in turn, testosterone suppression. == Medical uses == The GnRH antagonist degarelix, through its ability to reduce serum testosterone, is used to treat hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. == Side effects == Degarelix is commonly associated with hormonal side effects such as hot flashes and weight gain. Due to its mode of administration (subcutaneous injection), degarelix is also associated with injection-site reactions such as injection-site pain, erythema or swelling. Injection-site reactions are usually mild or moderate in intensity and occur predominantly after the first dose, decreasing in frequency thereafter. Less common: Anemia. Diarrhea, nausea. Hyperhidrosis including night sweats, rash. Gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, erectile dysfunction. Increased transaminases. Musculoskeletal pain and discomfort. Dizziness, headache. Insomnia. Weight gain. Chills, fever, fatigue, flu-like illness. == Pharmacology == GnRH antagonists (receptor blockers) such as degarelix are synthetic peptide derivatives of the natural GnRH decapeptide – a hormone that is made by neurons in the hypothalamus. GnRH antagonists compete with natural GnRH for binding to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. This reversible binding blocks the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary. The reduction in LH subsequently leads to a rapid and sustained suppression of testosterone release from the testes and subsequently reduces the size and growth of the prostate cancer. This in turn results in a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the patient's blood. Measuring PSA levels helps to monitor how patients with prostate cancer are responding to treatment. Unlike GnRH agonists, which cause an initial stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA), leading to a surge in testosterone levels, and under certain circumstances, a flare-up of the tumour, GnRH antagonists do not cause a surge in testosterone or clinical flare. Clinical flare is a phenomenon that occurs in patients with advanced disease, which can precipitate a range of clinical symptoms such as bone pain, urethral obstruction, and spinal cord compression. Drug agencies have issued boxed warnings regarding this phenomenon in the prescribing information for GnRH agonists. As testosterone surge does not occur with GnRH antagonists, there is no need for patients to receive an antiandrogen as flare protection during prostate cancer treatment. GnRH agonists also induce an increase in testosterone levels after each reinjection of the drug – a phenomenon that does not occur with GnRH antagonists such as degarelix. GnRH antagonists have an immediate onset of action leading to a fast and profound suppression of testosterone and are therefore especially valuable in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer where fast control of disease is needed. == History == In December 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved degarelix for the treatment of people with advanced prostate cancer. It was subsequently approved by the European Commission at the recommendation of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in February 2009, for use in adult males with advanced, hormone-dependent prostate cancer. Ferring Pharmaceuticals markets the drug under the name Firmagon. == Research == Degarelix is studied for use as a chemical castration agent on men with pedophilia in Sweden.

It is in the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class and works by increasing the production of insulin and decreasing the production of glucagon by the pancreas. In the United Kingdom it is listed as less preferred than metformin or a sulfonylurea. It is taken by mouth. It is also available in the fixed-dose combination medication sitagliptin/metformin (Janumet, Janumet XR). Common side effects include headaches, swelling of the legs, and upper respiratory tract infections. Serious side effects may include angioedema, low blood sugar, kidney problems, pancreatitis, and joint pain. Whether use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe is unclear. Sitagliptin was developed by Merck & Co. and approved for medical use in the United States in 2006. In 2022, it was the 86th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication, but not in the United States. == Medical uses == Sitagliptin is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It is generally less preferred than metformin or sulfonylureas. It is taken by mouth. It is also available as the fixed-dose combinations of sitagliptin/metformin (Janumet, Janumet XR) and sitagliptin/simvastatin (Juvisync). Sitagliptin should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes. In December 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved labeling changes stating that Januvia (sitagliptin), Janumet (sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride), and Janumet XR (sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release) are not proven to improve glycemic (blood sugar) control in children aged 10 to 17 with type 2 diabetes. The drugs are approved to improve blood sugar control in adults aged 18 and older with type 2 diabetes. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects from sitagliptin are similar to placebo, except for rare nausea, common cold-like symptoms, and photosensitivity. It does not increase the risk of diarrhea. No significant difference exists in the occurrence of hypoglycemia between placebo and sitagliptin. In those taking sulphonylureas, the risk of low blood sugar is increased. The existence of rare case reports of kidney failure and hypersensitivity reactions is noted in the United States prescribing information, but a causative role for sitagliptin has not been established. Several postmarketing reports of pancreatitis (some fatal) have been made in people treated with sitagliptin and other DPP-4 inhibitors, and the US FDA package insert carries a warning to this effect, although the causal link between sitagliptin and pancreatitis has not yet been fully substantiated. One study with lab rats published in 2009 concluded that some of the possible risks of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer may be reduced when it is used with metformin. However, while DPP-4 inhibitors showed an increase in such risk factors, as of 2009, no increase in pancreatic cancer has been reported in individuals taking DPP-4 inhibitors. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a new warning and precaution about the risk of ""severe and disabling"" joint pain to the labels of all DPP-4 inhibitor medicines. == Mechanism of action == Sitagliptin works to competitively inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). This enzyme breaks down the incretins GLP-1 and GIP, gastrointestinal hormones released in response to a meal. By preventing breakdown of GLP-1 and GIP, they are able to increase the secretion of insulin and suppress the release of glucagon by the alpha cells of the pancreas. This drives blood glucose levels towards normal. As the blood glucose level approaches normal, the amounts of insulin released and glucagon suppressed diminishes, thus tending to prevent an ""overshoot"" and subsequent low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which is seen with some other oral hypoglycemic agents. Sitagliptin has been shown to lower HbA1c level by about 0.7% points versus placebo. It is slightly less effective than metformin when used as a monotherapy. It does not cause weight gain and has less hypoglycemia compared to sulfonylureas. Sitagliptin is recommended as a second-line drug (in combination with other drugs) after the combination of diet/exercise and metformin fails. == History == Sitagliptin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2006, and is sold under the brand name Januvia. In April 2007, the FDA approved an oral combination of sitagliptin/metformin sold under the brand name Janumet. In October 2011, the FDA approved an oral combination of sitagliptin/simvastatin sold under the brand name Juvisync.

It inhibits proteases like chymotrypsin, kallikrein, plasmin, thrombin, and trypsin. The specificity is similar to the inhibitor PMSF, nevertheless AEBSF is more stable at low pH values. Typical usage is 0.1 - 1.0 mM. AEBSF (marketed as Pefabloc SC from the company Pentapharm) was first reported for use in biochemistry in 1993, and came into common use for the inhibition serine proteases and of non-protease enzymes such as acetylhydrolases in the mid 1990s. == Mechanism of action == AEBSF is targeted to covalently modify the hydroxyl of serine residues, where it causes an additional 183.0354 Da to be added to each modified residue, but other off-target residues such as tyrosine, lysine, histidine, and the protein N-terminal amino group, have also been reported. Due to the substantial frequency of modification of these off-target residues in unoptimized protocols, some users recommend not using AEBSF for highly sensitive proteomics applications, and instead recommend using fresh (and comparatively unstable) PMSF. Both AEBSF and PMSF are sulfonyl fluorides and are sulfonylating agents. Sulfonyl fluorides act by reacting with the hydroxy group of the active site serine residue to form a sulfonyl enzyme derivative. This derivative may be stable for long periods of time except at high pH. == Use in cholesterol regulation studies == AEBSF is extensively used in studies aiming to describe cholesterol regulatory genes due to its potent ability to inhibit Site-1-protease (S1P). This serine protease, located in the Golgi apparatus, is responsible for activating the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP). By selectively inhibiting S1P, AEBSF can be used to characterize the downstream result of SREBP inhibition and its influence on cholesterol regulation. == See also == PMSF DFP (diisopropyl fluorophosphate), an analogous fluorophosphonate phosphorylating reagent == References == == External links == The MEROPS online database for peptidases and their inhibitors: AEBSF A Link to the ABRF group usegroup archive with an informative discussion of covalent modifications to proteins resulting from use of AEBSF: [1]",Pefabloc,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3132622241973877)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.313924640417099), ('DU', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.5761706829071045), ('ĠMED', -0.39074113965034485), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02978767640888691)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0005697138840332627), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://trademarks.justia.com/738/13/pefabloc-73813413.html,https://www.bettertrademark.com/trademarks/pefabloc-79021216,https://www.trademarkelite.com/trademark/trademark-detail/88679721/PEFABLOC ', [])"

Using (male) genetically modified mouse models, we investigated the roles of the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, the OATP1A/1B uptake transporters, and the drug-metabolizing CYP3A complex in fisogatinib pharmacokinetics. In vitro, fisogatinib was modestly transported by hABCB1. Upon oral administration of 10 mg/kg fisogatinib, its brain accumulation was substantially increased in Abcb1a/1b Outcomes for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poor despite recent progress in drug development. Emerging data implicate FGF19 as a potential HCC driver, suggesting its receptor, FGFR4, as a novel therapeutic target. We evaluated fisogatinib (BLU-554), a highly potent and selective oral FGFR4 inhibitor, in a phase I dose-escalation/dose-expansion study in advanced HCC using FGF19 expression measured by IHC as a biomarker for pathway activation. For dose escalation, 25 patients received 140 to 900 mg fisogatinib once daily; the maximum tolerated dose (600 mg once daily) was expanded in 81 patients. Fisogatinib was well tolerated; most adverse events were manageable, grade 1/2 gastrointestinal events, primarily diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

This dose-escalation/expansion study investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of mivavotinib plus nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients received oral mivavotinib 60-100 mg once-daily plus intravenous nivolumab 3 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose-escalation phase evaluated the recommended phase II dose (RP2D; primary endpoint). The expansion phase evaluated overall response rate (primary end point) at the RP2D in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). During dose-escalation (n = 24), two dose-limiting toxicities (grade 4 lipase increased and grade 3 pyrexia) occurred in patients who received mivavotinib 80 mg and 100 mg, respectively. The determined RP2D was once-daily mivavotinib 80 mg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg. The expansion phase was terminated at ~50% enrollment (n = 17) after failing to meet an ad hoc efficacy futility threshold. Among all 41 patients, common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) included dyspnea (48.8%), aspartate aminotransferase increased, and pyrexia (46.3% each). Common grade ≥3 TEAEs were hypophosphatemia and anemia (26.8% each). Mivavotinib plasma exposure was generally dose-proportional (60-100 mg). One patient had a partial response. Mivavotinib 80 mg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg was well tolerated with no new safety signals beyond those of single-agent mivavotinib or nivolumab. Low response rates highlight the challenges of treating unresponsive tumor types, such as TNBC, with this combination and immunotherapies in general. TRIAL REGISTRATION ID: NCT02834247. Mivavotinib (TAK-659), an orally administered, small-molecule, dual inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (SYK/FLT3), is under development for the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies. In this analysis, we evaluated the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of mivavotinib and its sources of variability (covariates) in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, or relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas or acute myeloid leukemia, using pooled data from 159 patients enrolled in 2 phase 1/2 clinical studies. A 2-compartment model with first-order linear elimination and a first-order absorption rate (and associated lag time) adequately described the PK of mivavotinib in this patient population. The population estimates of apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent central compartment volume (V Mivavotinib (TAK-659) is an investigational type 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with dual activity against spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). We conducted a phase Ib study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of mivavotinib in patients with refractory and/or relapsed (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Both daily (QD) and twice daily (BID) dosing regimens were evaluated. A total of 43 patients were enrolled, and there were 5 complete responses (4 with incomplete count recovery). In the QD dosing regimen, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached up to 160 mg QD per protocol; 140 mg QD was identified as the recommended phase II dose. In the BID dosing regimen, the MTD was 60 mg BID. Thirty patients (70%) experienced a bleeding event on study; the majority were grades 1 or 2, were resolved without mivavotinib modification, and were not considered related to study treatment. Eleven patients (26%) experienced grade ≥3 bleeding events, which were observed most frequently with the 80 mg BID dose. We conducted platelet aggregation studies to investigate the potential role of mivavotinib-mediated SYK inhibition on platelet function. The bleeding events observed may have been the result of several confounding factors, including AML disease status, associated thrombocytopenia, and high doses of mivavotinib. Overall, these findings indicate that the activity of mivavotinib in R/R AML is modest. Furthermore, any future clinical investigation of this agent should be undertaken with caution, particularly in thrombocytopenic patients, due to the potential bleeding risk of SYK inhibition.

It is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. Effectiveness is similar to other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea. Serious side effects may include osteoporosis, low blood magnesium, Clostridioides difficile infection, anaphylaxis, and pneumonia. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It works by blocking H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells of the stomach. Dexlansoprazole was approved for medical use in the United States in 2009. In Canada in 2016, it was the most expensive Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) available. In 2022, it was the 186th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical use == Dexlansoprazole is used to heal and maintain healing of erosive esophagitis and to treat heartburn associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It lasts longer than lansoprazole, to which it is chemically related, and needs to be taken less often. There is no good evidence that it works better than other PPIs. == Adverse effects == The most significant adverse reactions (≥2%) reported in clinical trials were diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, and flatulence. == Mechanism of action == Like lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole permanently binds to the proton pump and blocks it, preventing the formation of gastric acid. == Chemistry == Dexlansoprazole is the (R)-(+)-enantiomer of lansoprazole, which is a racemic mixture of its (R)-(+) and (S)-(−)-enantiomers. The Takeda drug has a dual release pharmaceutical formulation, with two types of granules of dexlansoprazole, each with a coating that dissolves at a different pH level. == Pharmacokinetics == Dexlansoprazole ((R)-(+)-lansoprazole) has the same binding affinity to the proton pump as the (S)-enantiomer, but is associated with a three- to five-fold greater area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC) compared with (S)-lansoprazole. With its dual release pharmaceutical formulation, the first quick release produces a plasma peak concentration about one hour after application, with a second delayed release producing another peak about four hours later. == History == Dexlansoprazole was approved in the United States in 2009, in Canada in 2010, and in Mexico in 2011. == Society and culture == Since Kapidex was approved in 2009, there have been reports of dispensing errors because of confusion with the drugs Casodex (bicalutamide) and Kadian (morphine), which have very different uses from Kapidex and from each other.

It is sold under the brand names Nitoman and Xenazine among others. On August 15, 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of tetrabenazine to treat chorea associated with Huntington's disease. Although other drugs had been used ""off-label"", tetrabenazine was the first approved treatment for Huntington's disease in the United States. The compound has been known since the 1950s. == Medical uses == Tetrabenazine is used as a treatment, but not as a cure, for hyperkinetic disorders such as: Huntington's disease – specifically, the chorea associated with it Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders Tardive dyskinesia, a serious and sometimes irreversible side effect of long-term use of many antipsychotics, mainly typical antipsychotics Hemiballismus, spontaneous flinging limb movements due to contra-lateral subthalamic nucleus damage Tetrabenazine has been used as an antipsychotic in the treatment of schizophrenia, both in the past and in modern times. == Side effects == The most common adverse reactions, which have occurred in at least 10% of subjects in studies and at least 5% greater than in subjects who received placebo, have been: sedation or somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, depression, suicidal thoughts, akathisia, anxiety, and nausea. It has also been reported to produce apathy. == Warnings == There is a boxed warning associated with the use of tetrabenazine: Increases the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior in patients with Huntington's disease Balance risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for control of chorea when considering the use of tetrabenazine Monitor patients for emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality or unusual changes in behavior Inform patients, caregivers and families of the risk of depression and suicidality and instruct to report behaviours of concern promptly to the treating physician Exercise caution when treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation Tetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients who are actively suicidal and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression == Pharmacology == The precise mechanism of action of tetrabenazine is unknown. Its anti-chorea effect is believed to be due to a reversible depletion of monoamines such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine from nerve terminals. Tetrabenazine reversibly inhibits vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), resulting in decreased uptake of monoamines into synaptic vesicles, as well as depletion of monoamine storage. == Research == === Animal model of motivational dysfunction === Tetrabenazine is used in the only animal model of motivational dysfunction. The drug results in selective depletion of dopamine at low doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg and induces a low-effort bias in effort-based decision-making tasks at these doses. It has been found to reduce striatal or nucleus accumbens dopamine levels by 57 to 75% at a dose of 0.75–1.0 mg/kg in rats. In contrast, levels of serotonin and norepinephrine are only reduced by up to 15 to 30% at this dosage. A 10-fold higher dosage of 10 mg/kg is needed to decrease serotonin levels as much as the reduction in dopamine levels at 1 mg/kg. The low-effort bias of systemic administration of tetrabenazine also occurs when it is injected directly into the nucleus accumbens but not the overlying medial neostriatum (i.e., dorsal striatum). Dopamine D1 receptor antagonists like ecopipam and dopamine D2 receptor antagonists like haloperidol have similar amotivational effects as tetrabenazine in animals. A number of pro-motivational drugs have been found to reverse the amotivational effects of tetrabenazine. These include the dopamine releasing agent lisdexamfetamine, the dopamine reuptake inhibitors methylphenidate, bupropion, modafinil, vanoxerine, PRX-14040, and MRZ-9547, and the MAO-B inhibitor and catecholaminergic activity enhancer selegiline. Selegiline shows a complicated U-shaped dose–response curve in its efficacy in the model. In contrast to the preceding agents, many antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine and citalopram, the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) desipramine and atomoxetine, the selective MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide, and the non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline, are ineffective in reversing tetrabenazine-induced amotivational symptoms. SSRIs and NRIs actually induced further motivational impairments at high doses. A retrospective longitudinal study in a cohort of 23 children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy was conducted where they were treated with tetrabenazine. Results showed significant improvement in movement disorders over time. The study supports tetrabenzine's potential for DCP treatment and shows that the MD-CRS 4-18 scale is a tool for tracking progress in future clinical trials. == See also == Deutetrabenazine == References == == External links == Xenazine prescribing information FDA Archived 2017-02-16 at the Wayback Machine NIMH Repository data sheet ""Tetrabenazine"" from HOPES: Huntington's Disease Outreach Project for Education at Stanford Detailed monograph on tetrabenazine on rxmed.com Information on tetrabenazine from netdoctor.co.uk Archived 2012-01-04 at the Wayback Machine",Tetrabenazine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.794698856538162e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000439428084064275)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrabenazine,https://www.drugs.com/tetrabenazine.html,https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/tetrabenazine ', [])"

Specifically it is used for open angle glaucoma when other agents are not sufficient. It is used as an eye drop. Effects generally occur within two hours. Common side effects include red eyes, blurry vision, eye pain, dry eyes, and change in color of the eyes. Other significant side effects may include cataracts. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is generally not recommended. It is a prostaglandin analog and works by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes. Travoprost was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 2001. It is available as a generic medication in the United Kingdom. In 2020, it was the 304th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Travoprost is used to treat high pressure inside the eye including glaucoma. Specifically it is used for open angle glaucoma when other agents are not sufficient. == Side effects == Possible side effects are: blurred vision eyelid redness permanent darkening of eyelashes eye discomfort permanent darkening of the iris to brown (heterochromia) burning sensation during use thickening of the eyelashes inflammation of the prostate gland, restricting urine flow (BPH) Research suggests that wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops can result in shorter eyelashes and a lesser chance of hyperpigmentation in the eyelid, compared to not wiping off excess fluid. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === It is a synthetic prostaglandin analog (or more specifically, an analog of prostaglandin F2α) that works by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes. Like other analogs of prostaglandin F2α such as tafluprost and latanoprost, travoprost is an ester prodrug of the free acid, which acts as an agonist at the prostaglandin F receptor, increasing outflow of aqueous fluid from the eye and thus lowering intraocular pressure. === Pharmacokinetics === Travoprost is absorbed through the cornea, where it is hydrolysed to the free travoprost acid. Highest concentrations of the acid in the eye are reached one to two hours after application, and its half-life in the aqueous fluid is 1.5 hours. Once it reaches the bloodstream, it is quickly metabolised, so that concentrations in the system do not exceed 25 pg/ml (compared to 20 ng/ml in the eye, which is higher by nearly a factor of 1000). Metabolites are formed by beta oxidation of the acidic chain (compare Tafluprost#Pharmacokinetics), oxidation of the OH-group in the other side chain, and reduction of the double bond next to this OH-group. Travoprost acid and its metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidney with a terminal half-life of 45 minutes. == References ==",Travatan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.597391747054644e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005641775787808001)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ema.europa.eu](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/travatan?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=104, start_index=9, title='Travatan | European Medicines Agency (EMA)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/travatan?utm_source=openai')])"

529,"('Flutamide', 'Eulexin', 'Niftolide', 'Niftholide', 'Niftolid')",Medical,"Flutamide, sold under the brand name Eulexin among others, is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) which is used primarily to treat prostate cancer. It is also used in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions like acne, excessive hair growth, and high androgen levels in women. It is taken by mouth, usually three times per day. Side effects in men include breast tenderness and enlargement, feminization, sexual dysfunction, and hot flashes. Conversely, the medication has fewer side effects and is better-tolerated in women with the most common side effect being dry skin. Diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes can occur in both sexes. Rarely, flutamide can cause liver damage, lung disease, sensitivity to light, elevated methemoglobin, elevated sulfhemoglobin, and deficient neutrophils. Numerous cases of liver failure and death have been reported, which has limited the use of flutamide. Flutamide acts as a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), competing with androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to ARs in tissues like the prostate gland. By doing so, it prevents their effects and stops them from stimulating prostate cancer cells to grow. Flutamide is a prodrug to a more active form. Flutamide and its active form stay in the body for a relatively short time, which makes it necessary to take flutamide multiple times per day. Flutamide was first described in 1967 and was first introduced for medical use in 1983. It became available in the United States in 1989. The medication has largely been replaced by newer and improved NSAAs, namely bicalutamide and enzalutamide, due to their better efficacy, tolerability, safety, and dosing frequency (once per day), and is now relatively little-used. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Prostate cancer === GnRH is released by the hypothalamus in a pulsatile fashion; this causes the anterior pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH stimulates the testes to produce testosterone, which is metabolized to DHT by the enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT, and to a significantly smaller extent, testosterone, stimulate prostate cancer cells to grow. Therefore, blocking these androgens can provide powerful treatment for prostate cancer, especially metastatic disease. Normally administered are GnRH analogues, such as leuprorelin or cetrorelix. Although GnRH agonists stimulate the same receptors that GnRH does, since they are present continuously and not in a pulsatile manner, they serve to inhibit the pituitary gland and therefore block the whole chain. However, they initially cause a surge in activity; this is not solely a theoretical risk but may cause the cancer to flare. Flutamide was initially used at the beginning of GnRH agonist therapy to block this surge, and it and other NSAAs continue in this use. In contrast to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists don't cause an initial androgen surge, and are gradually replacing GnRH agonists in clinical use. There have been studies to investigate the benefit of adding an antiandrogen to surgical orchiectomy or its continued use with a GnRH analogue (combined androgen blockade (CAB)). Adding antiandrogens to orchiectomy showed no benefit, while a small benefit was shown with adding antiandrogens to GnRH analogues. Unfortunately, therapies which lower testosterone levels, such as orchiectomy or GnRH analogue administration, also have significant side effects. Compared to these therapies, treatment with antiandrogens exhibits ""fewer hot flashes, less of an effect on libido, less muscle wasting, fewer personality changes, and less bone loss."" However, antiandrogen therapy alone is less effective than surgery. Nevertheless, given the advanced age of many with prostate cancer, as well as other features, many men may choose antiandrogen therapy alone for a better quality of life. Flutamide has been found to be similarly effective in the treatment of prostate cancer to bicalutamide, although indications of inferior efficacy, including greater compensatory increases in testosterone levels and greater reductions in PSA levels with bicalutamide, were observed. The medication, at a dosage of 750 mg/day (250 mg three times daily), has also been found to be equivalent in effectiveness to 250 mg/day oral cyproterone acetate as a monotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer in a large-scale clinical trial of 310 patients, though its side effect and toxicity profiles (including gynecomastia, diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, and liver disturbances) were regarded as considerably worse than those of cyproterone acetate. A dosage of 750 mg/day flutamide (250 mg/three times a day) is roughly equivalent in terms of effectiveness to 50 mg/day bicalutamide when used as the antiandrogen component in combined androgen blockade in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Flutamide has been used to prevent the effects of the testosterone flare at the start of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. The combination of flutamide with an estrogen such as ethinylestradiol sulfonate has been used as a form of combined androgen blockade and as an alternative to the combination of flutamide with surgical or medical castration. === Skin and hair conditions === Flutamide has been researched and used extensively in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions in women including acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and scalp hair loss, as well as in hyperandrogenism (e.g., in polycystic ovary syndrome or congenital adrenal hyperplasia), and is effective in improving the symptoms of these conditions. The dosages used are lower than those used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Although flutamide continues to be used for these indications, its use in recent years has been limited due to the risk of potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, and it is no longer recommended as a first- or second-line therapy. The related NSAA bicalutamide has also been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women and appears to have comparable effectiveness to that of flutamide, but has a far lower and only small risk of hepatotoxicity in comparison. Aside from its risk of liver toxicity and besides other nonsteroidal antiandrogens, it has been said that flutamide is likely the best typically used antiandrogen medication for the treatment of androgen-dependent symptoms in women. This is related to its high effectiveness and minimal side effects. ==== Acne and seborrhea ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of acne and seborrhea in women in a number of studies. In a long-term study of 230 women with acne, 211 of whom also had seborrhea, very-low-dose flutamide alone or in combination with an oral contraceptive caused a marked decrease in acne and seborrhea after 6 months of treatment, with maximal effect by 1 year of treatment and benefits maintained in the years thereafter. In the study, 97% of the women reported satisfaction with the control of their acne with flutamide. In another study, flutamide decreased acne and seborrhea scores by 80% in only 3 months. In contrast, spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same time period, suggesting superior effectiveness for flutamide for these indications. Flutamide has, in general, been found to reduce symptoms of acne by as much as 90% even at low doses, with several studies showing complete acne clearance. ==== Excessive hair growth ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive body/facial hair growth) in numerous studies. It possesses moderate effectiveness for this indication, and the overall quality of the evidence is considered to be moderate. The medication shows equivalent or superior effectiveness to other antiandrogens including spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, and finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism, although its relatively high risk of hepatotoxicity makes it unfavorable compared to these other options. It has been used to treat hirsutism at dosages ranging from 62.5 mg/day to 750 mg/day. A study found that multiple dosages of flutamide significantly reduced hirsutism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and that there were no significant differences in the effectiveness for dosages of 125 mg/day, 250 mg/day, and 375 mg/day. In addition, a study found that combination of 125 mg/day flutamide with finasteride was no more effective than 125 mg/day flutamide alone in the treatment of hirsutism. These findings support the use of flutamide at lower doses for hirsutism without loss of effectiveness, which may help to lower the risk of hepatotoxicity. However, the risk has been found to remain even at very low doses. ==== Scalp hair loss ==== Flutamide has been found to be effective in the treatment of female pattern hair loss in a number of studies. In one study of 101 pre- and postmenopausal women, flutamide alone or in combination with an oral contraceptive produced a marked decrease in hair loss scores after 1 year of treatment, with maximum effect after 2 years of treatment and benefits maintained for another 2 years. In a small study of flutamide with an oral contraceptive, the medication caused an increase in cosmetically acceptance hair density in 6 of 7 women with diffuse scalp hair loss. In a comparative study, flutamide significantly improved scalp hair growth (21% reduction in Ludwig scores) in hyperandrogenic women after 1 year of treatment, whereas cyproterone acetate and finasteride were ineffective. === Other uses === Flutamide has been used in case reports to decrease the frequency of spontaneous orgasms, for instance in men with post-orgasmic illness syndrome. === Available forms === Flutamide is available in the form of 125 mg oral capsules and 250 mg oral tablets. == Side effects == The side effects of flutamide are sex-dependent. In men, a variety of side effects related to androgen deprivation may occur, the most common being gynecomastia and breast tenderness. Others include hot flashes, decreased muscle mass, decreased bone mass and an associated increased risk of fractures, depression, and sexual dysfunction including reduced libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, flutamide is, generally, relatively well tolerated, and does not interfere with ovulation. The only common side effect of flutamide in women is dry skin (75%), which can be attributed to a reduction of androgen-mediated sebum production. General side effects that may occur in either sex include dizziness, lack of appetite, gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, a greenish-bluish discoloration of the urine, and hepatic changes. Because flutamide is a pure antiandrogen, unlike steroidal antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate (which additionally possess progestogenic activity), it does not appear to have a risk of cardiovascular side effects (e.g., thromboembolism) or fluid retention. === Gynecomastia === Flutamide, as a monotherapy, causes gynecomastia in 30 to 79% of men, and also produces breast tenderness. However, more than 90% of cases of gynecomastia with NSAAs including flutamide are mild to moderate. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with predominantly antiestrogenic actions, can counteract flutamide-induced gynecomastia and breast pain in men. === Diarrhea === Diarrhea is more common and sometimes more severe with flutamide than with other NSAAs. In a comparative trial of combined androgen blockade for prostate cancer, the rate of diarrhea was 26% for flutamide and 12% for bicalutamide. Moreover, 6% of flutamide-treated patients discontinued the medication due to diarrhea, whereas only 0.5% of bicalutamide-treated patients did so. In the case of antiandrogen monotherapy for prostate cancer, the rates of diarrhea are 5 to 20% for flutamide, 2 to 5% for bicalutamide, and 2 to 4% for nilutamide. In contrast to diarrhea, the rates of nausea and vomiting are similar among the three medications. === Rare reactions === ==== Liver toxicity ==== Although rare, flutamide has been associated with severe hepatotoxicity and death. By 1996, 46 cases of severe cholestatic hepatitis had been reported, with 20 fatalities. There have been continued case reports since, including liver transplants and death. A 2021 review of the literature found 15 cases of serious hepatotoxicity in women treated with flutamide, including 7 liver transplantations and 2 deaths. Based on the number of prescriptions written and the number of cases reported in the MedWatch database, the rate of serious hepatotoxicity associated with flutamide treatment was estimated in 1996 as approximately 0.03% (3 per 10,000). However, other research has suggested that the true incidence of significant hepatotoxicity with flutamide may be much greater, as high as 0.18 to 10%. Flutamide is also associated with liver enzyme elevations in up to 42 to 62% of patients, although marked elevations in liver enzymes (above 5 times upper normal limit) occur only in 3 to 5%. The risk of hepatotoxicity with flutamide is much higher than with nilutamide or bicalutamide. Lower doses of the medication appear to have a possibly reduced but still significant risk. Liver function should be monitored regularly with liver function tests during flutamide treatment. In addition, due to the high risk of serious hepatotoxicity, flutamide should not be used in the absence of a serious indication. The mechanism of action of flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity is thought to be due to mitochondrial toxicity. Specifically, flutamide and particularly its major metabolite hydroxyflutamide inhibit enzymes in the mitochondrial electron transport chain in hepatocytes, including respiratory complexes I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase), II (succinate dehydrogenase), and V (ATP synthase), and thereby reduce cellular respiration via ATP depletion and hence decrease cell survival. Inhibition of taurocholate (a bile acid) efflux has also been implicated in flutamide-induced hepatotoxicity. In contrast to flutamide and hydroxyflutamide, which severely compromise hepatocyte cellular respiration in vitro, bicalutamide does not significantly do so at the same concentrations and is regarded as non-mitotoxic. It is thought that the nitroaromatic group of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide enhance their mitochondrial toxicity; bicalutamide, in contrast, possesses a cyano group in place of the nitro moiety, greatly reducing the potential for such toxicity. The hepatotoxicity of flutamide appears to depend on hydrolysis of flutamide catalyzed by an arylacetamide deacetalyse enzyme. This is analogous to the hepatotoxicity that occurs with the withdrawn paracetamol (acetominophen)-related medication phenacetin. In accordance, the combination of paracetamol (acetaminophen) and flutamide appears to result in additive to synergistic hepatotoxicity, indicating a potential drug interaction. Hepatotoxicity with flutamide may be cross-reactive with that of cyproterone acetate. ==== Others ==== Flutamide has also been associated with interstitial pneumonitis (which can progress to pulmonary fibrosis). The incidence of interstitial pneumonitis with flutamide was found to be 0.04% (4 per 10,000) in a large clinical cohort of 41,700 prostate cancer patients. A variety of case reports have associated flutamide with photosensitivity. Flutamide has been associated with several case reports of methemoglobinemia. Bicalutamide does not appear to share this risk with flutamide. Flutamide has also been associated with reports of sulfhemoglobinemia and neutropenia. === Birth defects === Out of the available endocrine-disrupting compounds looked at, flutamide has a notable effect on anogenital distance in rats.) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Flutamide acts as a selective, competitive, silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). Its active form, hydroxyflutamide, has between 10- and 25-fold higher affinity for the AR than does flutamide, and hence is a much more potent AR antagonist in comparison. However, at high concentrations, unlike flutamide, hydroxyflutamide is able to weakly activate the AR. Flutamide has far lower affinity for the AR than do steroidal antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, and it is a relatively weak antiandrogen in terms of potency by weight, but the large dosages at which flutamide is used appear to compensate for this. In accordance with its selectivity for the AR, flutamide does not interact with the progesterone, estrogen, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid receptor, and possesses no intrinsic progestogenic, estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antigonadotropic activity. However, it can have some indirect estrogenic effects via increased levels of estradiol secondary to AR blockade, and this involved in the gynecomastia it can produce. Because flutamide does not have any estrogenic, progestogenic, or antigonadotropic activity, the medication does not cause menstrual irregularities in women. This is in contrast to steroidal antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate. Similarly to nilutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide, flutamide crosses the blood–brain barrier and exerts central antiandrogen actions. Flutamide has been found to be equal to slightly more potent than cyproterone acetate and substantially more potent than spironolactone as an antiandrogen in bioassays. This is in spite of the fact that hydroxyflutamide has on the order of 10-fold lower affinity for the AR relative to cyproterone acetate. Hydroxyflutamide shows about 2- to 4-fold lower affinity for the rat and human AR than does bicalutamide. In addition, whereas bicalutamide has an elimination half-life of around 6 days, hydroxyflutamide has an elimination half-life of only 8 to 10 hours, a roughly 17-fold difference. In accordance, at dosages of 50 mg/day bicalutamide and 750 mg/day flutamide (a 15-fold difference), circulating levels of flutamide at steady-state have been found to be approximately 7.5-fold lower than those of bicalutamide. Moreover, whereas flutamide at this dosage has been found to produce a 75% reduction in prostate-specific antigen levels in men with prostate cancer, a fall of 90% has been demonstrated with this dosage of bicalutamide. In accordance, 50 mg/day bicalutamide has been found to possess equivalent or superior effectiveness to 750 mg/day flutamide in a large clinical trial for prostate cancer. Also, bicalutamide has been shown to be 5-fold more potent than flutamide in rats and 50-fold more potent than flutamide in dogs. Taken together, flutamide appears to be a considerably less potent and efficacious antiandrogen than is bicalutamide. Dose-ranging studies of flutamide in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer alone and in combination with a GnRH agonist have been performed. Flutamide increases testosterone levels by 5- to 10-fold in gonadally intact male rats. ==== CYP17A1 inhibition ==== Flutamide and hydroxyflutamide have been found in vitro to inhibit CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), an enzyme which is required for the biosynthesis of androgens. In accordance, flutamide has been found to slightly but significantly lower androgen levels in GnRH analogue-treated male prostate cancer patients and women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In a directly comparative study of flutamide monotherapy (375 mg once daily) versus bicalutamide monotherapy (80 mg once daily) in Japanese men with prostate cancer, after 24 weeks of treatment flutamide decreased dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels by about 44% while bicalutamide increased them by about 4%. As such, flutamide is a weak inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis. However, the clinical significance of this action may be limited when flutamide is given without a GnRH analogue to non-castrated men, as the medication markedly elevates testosterone levels into the high normal male range via prevention of AR activation-mediated negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis in this context. ==== Other activities ==== Flutamide has been identified as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This may be involved in the hepatotoxicity of flutamide. === Pharmacokinetics === The absorption of flutamide is complete upon oral ingestion. Food has no effect on the bioavailability of flutamide. Steady-state levels of hydroxyflutamide, the active form of flutamide, are achieved after 2 to 4 days administration. Levels of hydroxyflutamide are approximately 50-fold higher than those of flutamide at steady-state. The plasma protein binding of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide are high; 94 to 96% and 92 to 94%, respectively. Flutamide and its metabolite hydroxyflutamide are known to be transported by the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1; ABCC1). Flutamide is metabolized by CYP1A2 (via α-hydroxylation) in the liver during first-pass metabolism to its main metabolite hydroxyflutamide (which accounts for 23% of an oral dose of flutamide one hour post-ingestion), and to at least five other, minor metabolites. Flutamide has at least 10 inactive metabolites total, including 4-nitro-3-fluoro-methylaniline. Flutamide is excreted in various forms in the urine, the primary form being 2-amino-5-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol. Flutamide and hydroxyflutamide have elimination half-lives of 4.7 hours and 6 hours in adults, respectively. However, the half-life of hydroxyflutamide is extended to 8 hours after a single dose and to 9.6 hours at steady state) in elderly individuals. The elimination half-lives of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide are regarded as too short to allow for once-daily dosing, and for this reason, flutamide is instead administered three times daily at 8-hour intervals. In contrast, the newer NSAAs nilutamide, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide all have much longer half-lives, and this allows for once-daily administration in their cases. == Chemistry == Unlike the hormones with which it competes, flutamide is not a steroid; rather, it is a substituted anilide. Hence, it is described as nonsteroidal in order to distinguish it from older steroidal antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and megestrol acetate. === Synthesis === Schotten–Baumann reaction between 4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline [393-11-3] (1) with isobutanoyl chloride [79-30-1] (2) in the presence of triethylamine. == History == Flutamide was first synthesized in 1967 by Neri and colleagues at Schering Plough Corporation. It was originally synthesized as a bacteriostatic agent, but was subsequently, and serendipitously found to possess antiandrogen activity. The code name of flutamide during development was SCH-13521. Clinical research of the medication began in 1971, and it was first marketed in 1983, specifically in Chile under the brand name Drogenil and in West Germany under the brand name Flugerel. Flutamide was not introduced in the United States until 1989; it was specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. The medication was first studied for the treatment of hirsutism in women in 1989. It was the first ""pure antiandrogen"" to be studied in the treatment of hirsutism. Flutamide was the first NSAA to be introduced, and was followed by nilutamide in 1989 and then bicalutamide in 1995. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Flutamide is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its names in Latin, German, and Spanish are flutamidum, flutamid, and flutamida, respectively. The medication has also been referred to by the name niftolide. === Brand names === Brand names of flutamide include or have included Cebatrol, Cytomid, Drogenil, Etaconil, Eulexin, Flucinom, Flumid, Flutacan, Flutamid, Flutamida, Flutamin, Flutan, Flutaplex, Flutasin, Fugerel, Profamid, and Sebatrol, among others. === Availability === Flutamide is marketed widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Central and South America, East and Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East. == Research == === Prostate cancer === The combination of an estrogen and flutamide as a form of combined androgen blockade for the treatment of prostate cancer has been researched. === Enlarged prostate === Flutamide has been studied in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; enlarged prostate) in men in several clinical studies. It has been found to reduce prostate volume by about 25%, which is comparable to the reduction achieved with the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride. Unfortunately, it has been associated with side effects in these studies including gynecomastia and breast tenderness (in about 50% of patients), gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, diarrhea, and flatulence, and hepatotoxicity, although sexual function including libido and erectile potency were maintained. === Breast cancer === Flutamide was studied for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in two phase II clinical trials but was found to be ineffective. Out of a total of 47 patients, only three short-term responses occurred. However, the patients in the studies were selected irrespective of AR, ERTooltip estrogen receptor, PRTooltip progesterone receptor, or HER2 status, which were all unknown. === Psychiatric disorders === Flutamide has been studied in the treatment of bulimia nervosa in women. Flutamide was found to be effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in men with comorbid Tourette's syndrome in one small randomized controlled trial. Conversely, it was ineffective in patients with OCD in another study. More research is necessary to determine whether flutamide is effective in the treatment of OCD. == References == == Further reading ==",Niftholide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.014436023309826851), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.32248276472091675), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25627660751342773)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

531,"('Sorafenib', 'Bay 43-9006', 'Nexavar', 'Sorafenib free base', 'Mntmpyp pentachloride')",Medical,"Sorafenib, sold under the brand name Nexavar, is a kinase inhibitor drug approved for the treatment of primary kidney cancer (advanced renal cell carcinoma), advanced primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), FLT3-ITD positive AML and radioactive iodine resistant advanced thyroid carcinoma. == Mechanism of action == Sorafenib is a protein kinase inhibitor with activity against many protein kinases, including VEGFR, PDGFR and RAF kinases. Of the RAF kinases, sorafenib is more selective for c-Raf than B-RAF. (See BRAF (gene)#Sorafenib for details the drug's interaction with B-Raf.) Sorafenib treatment induces autophagy, which may suppress tumor growth. Based on its 1,3-disubstituted urea structure, sorafenib is also a potent soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor and this activity likely reduces the severity of its adverse effects. == Medical uses == Sorafenib is indicated as a treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and thyroid cancer. === Kidney cancer === Clinical trial results, published January 2007, showed that, compared with placebo, treatment with sorafenib prolongs progression-free survival in patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma in whom previous therapy has failed. The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression in the sorafenib group, 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.55; P<0.01). In Australia this is one of two TGA-labelled indications for sorafenib, although it is not listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for this indication. === Liver cancer === At ASCO 2007, results from the SHARP trial were presented, which showed efficacy of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary endpoint was median overall survival, which showed a 44% improvement in patients who received sorafenib compared to placebo (hazard ratio 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87; p=0.0001). Both median survival and time to progression showed 3-month improvements; however, there was no significant difference in median time to symptomatic progression (p=0.77). There was no difference in quality of life measures, possibly attributable to toxicity of sorafenib or symptoms related to underlying progression of liver disease. Of note, this trial only included patients with Child-Pugh Class A (i.e. mildest) cirrhosis. Because of this trial sorafenib obtained FDA approval for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in November 2007. In a randomized, double-blind, phase II trial combining sorafenib with doxorubicin, the median time to progression was not significantly delayed compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Median durations of overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly longer in patients receiving sorafenib plus doxorubicin than in those receiving doxorubicin alone. A prospective single-centre phase II study which included the patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) concluding that the combination of sorafenib and DEB-TACE in patients with unresectable HCC is well tolerated and safe, with most toxicities related to sorafenib. In Australia this is the only indication for which sorafenib is listed on the PBS and hence the only government-subsidised indication for sorafenib. Along with renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the TGA-labelled indications for sorafenib. === Thyroid cancer === On 22 November 2013, sorafenib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) refractory to radioactive iodine treatment. The phase III DECISION trial showed significant improvement in progression-free survival but not in overall survival. However, as is known, the side effects were very frequent, specially hand and foot skin reaction. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects by frequency Note: Potentially serious side effects are in bold. Very common (>10% frequency) Common (1-10% frequency) Transient increase in transaminase Uncommon (0.1-1% frequency) Rare (0.01-0.1% frequency) == History == === Renal cancer === Sorafenib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2005, and received European Commission marketing authorization in July 2006, both for use in the treatment of advanced renal cancer. === Liver cancer === The European Commission granted marketing authorization to the drug for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, in October 2007, and FDA approval for this indication followed in November 2007. In November 2009, the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence declined to approve the drug for use within the NHS in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, stating that its effectiveness (increasing survival in primary liver cancer by 6 months) did not justify its high price, at up to £3000 per patient per month. In Scotland the drug had already been refused authorization by the Scottish Medicines Consortium for use within NHS Scotland, for the same reason. In March 2012, the Indian Patent Office granted a domestic company, Natco Pharma, a license to manufacture generic sorafenib, bringing its price down by 97%. Bayer sells a month's supply, 120 tablets, of Nexavar for₹280,000 (US$3,200). Natco Pharma will sell 120 tablets for ₹8,800 (US$100), while still paying a 6% royalty to Bayer. The royalty was later raised to 7% on appeal by Bayer. Under the Patents Act, 1970 and the World Trade Organisation TRIPS Agreement, the government can issue a compulsory license when a drug is not available at an affordable price. == Society and culture == === Nexavar controversy === In January 2014, Bayer's CEO Marijn Dekkers allegedly stated that Nexavar was developed for ""Western patients who can afford it, not for Indians"". A kidney cancer patient would pay $96,000 (£58,000) for a year's course of the Bayer-made drug, whereas the cost of the Indian version of the generic drug would be around $2,800 (£1,700). == Research == === Lung === In some kinds of lung cancer (with squamous-cell histology) sorafenib administered in addition to paclitaxel and carboplatin may be detrimental to patients. === Ovarian cancer === Sorafenib has been studied as maintenance therapy after ovarian cancer treatment and in combination with chemotherapy for recurrent ovarian cancer but did not show results that led to approval of the drug for these indications. === Brain (recurrent glioblastoma) === There is a phase I/II study at the Mayo Clinic of sorafenib and CCI-779 (temsirolimus) for recurrent glioblastoma. === Desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis) === A study performed in 2008 showed that sorafenib is active against aggressive fibromatosis. This study is being used as justification for using sorafenib as an initial course of treatment in some patients with the condition. A phase III clinical trial is testing the effectiveness of sorafenib to treat desmoid tumors (also known as aggressive fibromatosis), after positive results in the first two trial stages. Dosage is typically half of that applied for malignant cancers (400 mg vs 800 mg). NCI are sponsoring this trial. == See also == Donafenib, a deuterated derivative of sorafenib with improved pharmacokinetic properties == Notes == == References == == External links == ""Sorafenib"".

533,"('Sulindac', 'Clinoril', 'Arthrocine', 'Sulindaco', 'Sulindacum')",Medical,"Sulindac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the arylalkanoic acid class that is marketed as Clinoril. Imbaral (not to be confused with mebaral) is another name for this drug. Its name is derived from sul(finyl)+ ind(ene)+ ac(etic acid) It was patented in 1969 and approved for medical use in 1976. == Medical uses == Like other NSAIDs, it is useful in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. Sulindac is a prodrug, derived from sulfinylindene, that is converted in the body to the active NSAID. More specifically, the agent is converted by liver enzymes to a sulfide that is excreted in the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestine. This is thought to help maintain constant blood levels with reduced gastrointestinal side effects. Some studies have shown sulindac to be relatively less irritating to the stomach than other NSAIDs except for drugs of the COX-2 inhibitor class. The exact mechanism of its NSAID properties is unknown, but it is thought to act on enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Its usual dosage is 150-200 milligrams twice per day, with food. It should not be used by persons with a history of major allergic reactions (urticaria or anaphylaxis) to aspirin or other NSAIDs, and should be used with caution by persons having pre-existing peptic ulcer disease. Sulindac is much more likely than other NSAIDs to cause damage to the liver or pancreas, though it is less likely to cause kidney damage than other NSAIDs. Sulindac seems to have a property, independent of COX-inhibition, of reducing the growth of polyps and precancerous lesions in the colon, especially in association with familial adenomatous polyposis, and may have other anti-cancer properties. == Adverse effects == In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == Society and culture == === Litigation === In September 2010 a federal jury in New Hampshire awarded $21 million to Karen Bartlett, a woman who developed Stevens–Johnson syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis as a result of taking a generic brand of sulindac manufactured by Mutual Pharmaceuticals for her shoulder pain. Ms. Bartlett sustained severe injuries including the loss of over 60% of her surface skin and permanent near-blindness. The case had been appealed to the United States Supreme Court, where the main issue was whether federal law preempts Ms. Bartlett's claim. On June 24, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 in favor of Mutual Pharmaceuticals, throwing out the earlier $21 million jury verdict. === Synthesis === Rxn of p-fluorobenzyl chloride (1) with the anion of diethylmethyl malonate (2) gives intermediate diester (3), saponification of which and subsequent decarboxylation leads to 4. {Alternatively it can be formed by Perkin reaction between p-fluorobenzaldehyde and propionic anhydride in the presence of NaOAc, followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the olefinic bond using a palladium on carbon catalyst.} Polyphosphoric acid (PPA) cyclization leads to 5-fluoro-2-methyl-3-indanone (4). A Reformatsky reaction with zinc amalgam and bromoacetic ester leads to carbinol (5), which is then dehydrated with tosic acid to indene 6. {Alternatively, this step can be performed in a Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid, which is then further decarboxylated.} The active methylene group is condensed with p-methylthiobenzaldehyde, using sodium methoxide as catalyst, and then saponified to give Z (7) which in turn oxidized with sodium metaperiodate to sulfoxide 8, the antiinflammatory agent sulindac. == References == == External links == RxList information on Sulindac Drug Profile Jury Awards $21 Million",Clinoril,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00019131260341964662), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0040963320061564445)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/cons/clinoril.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Clinoril Advanced Patient Information - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/cons/clinoril.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It contains glecaprevir and pibrentasvir. It works against all six types of hepatitis C. At twelve weeks following treatment between 81% and 100% of people have no evidence of hepatitis C. It is taken once a day by mouth with food. The most common side effects are headache, diarrhea, and tiredness. In those with a history of hepatitis B, reactivation may occur. It is not recommended in people with moderate to severe liver disease. Glecaprevir works by blocking the protein NS3/4A protease, while pibrentasvir works by blocking NS5A. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States and Europe in 2017. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == In the United States, G/P is used to treat adults and children aged 12 years and older or weighing at least 99 pounds with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1–6 and both without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis who have not been previously treated for HCV (treatment-naïve). It is also used to treat adults and children aged 12 years and older or weighing at least 99 pounds with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection who have previously been treated with a NS5A inhibitor or a NS3/4A inhibitor but not both. The duration of treatment was shortened from 12 weeks to eight weeks for many people in 2019. In the European Union, it is used to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C. == Side effects == The only known side effects of G/P are hepatitis B reactivation, and more commonly headache, nausea, tiredness, and diarrhea. == Mechanism of action == Glecaprevir inhibits NS3/4A, a serine protease, and pibrentasvir inhibits NS5A, a zinc-binding hydrophilic phosphoprotein. Both of these proteins are essential in hepatitis C viral RNA replication, which can no longer take place upon inhibition of these proteins. == History == The development of G/P as a combination treatment was done by AbbVie and is in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards, per the FDA. Initial identification of glecaprevir was done in a joint effort by AbbVie and Enanta Pharmaceuticals. Enanta had a Collaborative Development and License Agreement with AbbVie for the identification and development of paritaprevir and glecaprevir, two HCV NS3 and NS3/4A protease inhibitors, that lasted from October 2016 to June 2017. In this agreement, Enanta received a total of US$427,000 in the form of license payments, proceeds from a sale of preferred stock, research funding payments, milestone payments, and royalties. The identification and development of pibrentasvir was done by AbbVie. == Research == During clinical trials, G/P was shown to be effective at clearing all six genotypes of HCV from the blood. Over the course of eight studies involving greater than 2,300 patients with hepatitis C, 99% of non-cirrhotic patients with genotype 1 were negative for HCV after the eight-week treatment regimen. Of cirrhotic patients from the same group, 97% tested negative for HCV on a 12-week treatment regimen and the results were reportedly similar for the treatment of genotypes 2 and 4–6, whereas 95% of patients with genotype 3 HCV tested negative for the virus after treatment. == References ==",Maviret,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.556489552167477e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.189342770492658e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mavyret.com](https://www.mavyret.com/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=68, start_index=9, title='MAVYRET\xa0(glecaprevir/pibrentasvir)\xa0for\xa0Hepatitis\xa0C\xa0\xad-\xa0Official\xa0Site', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mavyret.com/?utm_source=openai')])"

It was patented in 1983 and approved for medical use in 1992. == Side effects == Aceclofenac should not be given to people with porphyria or breast-feeding mothers, and is not recommended for children. It should be avoided near term in a pregnant woman because of the risk of having a premature closure of ductus arteriosus leading to fetal hydrops in the neonate. == Chemistry == Aceclofenac (C16H13Cl2NO4), chemically [(2-{2, 6-dichlorophenyl) amino} phenylacetooxyacetic acid], is a crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 354.19. It is practically insoluble in water with good permeability. It is metabolized in human hepatocytes and human microsomes to form [2-(2',6'-dichloro-4'-hydroxy- phenylamino) phenyl] acetoxyacetic acid as the major metabolite, which is then further conjugated. According to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) drug substances are classified to four classes upon their solubility and permeability. Aceclofenac falls under the BCS Class II, poorly soluble and highly permeable drug. Aceclofenac works by inhibiting the action of cyclooxygenase (COX) that is involved in the production of prostaglandins (PG) which is accountable for pain, swelling, inflammation and fever. The incidence of gastric ulcerogenicity of aceclofenac has been reported to be significantly lower than that of the other frequently prescribed NSAIDs, for instance, 2-fold less than naproxen, 4-fold less than diclofenac, and 7-fold less than indomethacin. == Society and culture == === Economics === Aceclofenac is available in Hungary as a prescription only medicine.

It is approved in 63 countries worldwide as of 2007, except the United States where the Food and Drug Administration sent a Non Approvable Letter to Merck and required them to provide additional data. It was patented in 1996 and approved for medical use in 2002. == Medical uses == Etoricoxib is indicated for ""the symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, and the pain and signs of inflammation associated with acute gouty arthritis."" === Efficacy === A Cochrane review assessed the benefits of single-dose etoricoxib in the reduction of acute post-operative pain in adults. Single-dose oral etoricoxib provides four times more pain relief post-operatively than placebo, with equivalent levels of adverse events. Etoricoxib given at a dose of 120 mg is as effective or even better than other analgesics that are commonly used. == Adverse effects == Like all other NSAIDs, the COX-2 inhibitors too have their share of adverse effects. Fixed drug eruption and generalised erythema, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), erythema multiforme like eruption and drug induced pretibial erythema are among the reported serious side effects. == Mechanism of action == Like any other selective COX-2 inhibitor (""coxib""), etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX-2). It has approximately 106-fold selectivity for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1. This reduces the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. The clinical relevance of the drug stems from the role of PGs in the inflammation cascade. Selective COX-2 inhibitors show less activity on COX-1 compared to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). This reduced activity is the cause of reduced gastrointestinal side effects, as demonstrated in several large clinical trials performed with different coxibs. == Cardiovascular safety and concerns == Etoricoxib's safety on the gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular was evaluated in the MEDAL Program consisting of three clinical trials: MEDAL (Multinational Etoricoxib Versus Diclofenac Arthritis Long-term Study), EDGE (Etoricoxib versus Diclofenac Sodium Gastrointestinal Tolerability and Effectiveness) and EDGE II. Pooled analysis from these trials shows that etoricoxib has the same rates of thrombotic cardiovascular events as those of diclofenac, including thrombotic events (1.24 events per 100 patient-years with etoricoxib versus 1.3 events per 100 patient-years with diclofenac), arterial thrombotic events (1.05 events per 100 patient-years with etoricoxib versus 1.10 events per 100 patient-years with diclofenac) and risks of heart attack, stroke and death of vascular cause (0.84 per 100 patient-years with etoricoxib versus 0.87 events per 100 patient-years with diclofenac). Rates of upper gastrointestinal events (ulcer, bleeding, perforation, and obstruction) are in favor of the etoricoxib group (0.67 events per 100 patient-years with etoricoxib versus 0.97 events per 100 patient-years with diclofenac), but rates of complicated upper gastrointestinal events are similar between two groups. Like rofecoxib's VIGOR trial, the MEDAL Program was also criticized, this time due to Merck's choice of comparator group. In a testimony before the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee, Sidney M. Wolfe pointed out that unlike the VIGOR trial, in which the active comparator was naproxen, three trials in the MEDAL Program used diclofenac as an active comparator. Wolfe showed that when compared etoricoxib to naproxen, which is a nonselective COX inhibitor, etoricoxib significantly increases the risks of cardiovascular events to such a degree that ""are similar to rofecoxib/naproxen comparison"", but when compared etoricoxib to diclofenac, which inhibits COX-2 more preferentially and has a worse CV safety profile than placebo, the difference was not statistically significant. He also noted the increase in other cardiac events, such as heart failure and high blood pressure. == References ==",Algix,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.702917754650116), ('ICAL', -4.0531076592742465e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.17867380380630493)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is critical for repair of radiation-induced DNA damage, and inhibitors of this kinase can have potent effects on radiation sensitivity. In this study, the radiosensitizing effects of the DNA-PKcs inhibitor peposertib were evaluated in patient-derived xenografts of melanoma brain metastases (M12, M15, M27). In clonogenic survival assays, peposertib augmented radiation-induced killing of M12 cells at concentrations ≥100 nmol/L, and a minimum of 16 hours exposure allowed maximal sensitization. This information was integrated with pharmacokinetic modeling to define an optimal dosing regimen for peposertib of 125 mpk dosed just prior to and 7 hours after irradiation. Using this drug dosing regimen in combination with 2.5 Gy × 5 fractions of radiation, significant prolongation in median survival was observed in M12-eGFP (104%; P = 0.0015) and M15 (50%; P = 0.03), while more limited effects were seen in M27 (16%, P = 0.04). These data support the concept of developing peposertib as a radiosensitizer for brain metastases and provide a paradigm for integrating in vitro and pharmacokinetic data to define an optimal radiosensitizing regimen for potent DNA repair inhibitors. Radiotherapy is the most widely used cancer treatment and improvements in its efficacy and safety are highly sought-after. Peposertib (also known as M3814), a potent and selective DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor, effectively suppresses the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and regresses human xenograft tumors in preclinical models. Irradiated cancer cells devoid of p53 activity are especially sensitive to the DNA-PK inhibitor, as they lose a key cell-cycle checkpoint circuit and enter mitosis with unrepaired DSBs, leading to catastrophic consequences. Here, we show that inhibiting the repair of DSBs induced by ionizing radiation with peposertib offers a powerful new way for improving radiotherapy by simultaneously enhancing cancer cell killing and response to a bifunctional TGFβ ""trap""/anti-PD-L1 cancer immunotherapy. By promoting chromosome misalignment and missegregation in p53-deficient cancer cells with unrepaired DSBs, DNA-PK inhibitor accelerated micronuclei formation, a key generator of cytosolic DNA and activator of cGAS/STING-dependent inflammatory signaling as it elevated PD-L1 expression in irradiated cancer cells. Triple combination of radiation, peposertib, and bintrafusp alfa, a fusion protein simultaneously inhibiting the profibrotic TGFβ and immunosuppressive PD-L1 pathways was superior to dual combinations and suggested a novel approach to more efficacious radioimmunotherapy of cancer. Selective inhibition of DNA-PK in irradiated cancer cells enhances inflammatory signaling and activity of dual TGFβ/PD-L1 targeted therapy and may offer a more efficacious combination option for the treatment of locally advanced solid tumors. Peposertib (M3814) is a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor in early clinical development. It effectively blocks non-homologous end-joining repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and strongly potentiates the antitumor effect of ionizing radiation (IR) and topoisomerase II inhibitors. By suppressing DNA-PK catalytic activity in the presence of DNA DSB, M3814 potentiates ATM/p53 signaling leading to enhanced p53-dependent antitumor activity in tumor cells. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of M3814 in combination with DSB-inducing agents in leukemia cells and a patient-derived tumor. We show that in the presence of IR or topoisomerase II inhibitors, M3814 boosts the ATM/p53 response in acute leukemia cells leading to the elevation of p53 protein levels as well as its transcriptional activity. M3814 synergistically sensitized p53 wild-type, but not p53-deficient, AML cells to killing by DSB-inducing agents via p53-dependent apoptosis involving both intrinsic and extrinsic effector pathways. The antileukemic effect was further potentiated by enhancing daunorubicin-induced myeloid cell differentiation. Further, combined with the fixed-ratio liposomal formulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine, CPX-351, M3814 enhanced the efficacy against leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo without increasing hematopoietic toxicity, suggesting that DNA-PK inhibition could offer a novel clinical strategy for harnessing the anticancer potential of p53 in AML therapy.",Peposertib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0015343570848926902), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004087427631020546)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([aacrjournals.org](https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/30/4/695/734220/A-Phase-Ib-Study-of-the-DNA-PK-Inhibitor?utm_source=openai), [mdanderson.org](https://www.mdanderson.org/patients-family/diagnosis-treatment/clinical-trials/clinical-trials-index/clinical-trials-detail.ID2019-1035.html?utm_source=openai), [clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04533750?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=426, start_index=9, title='A Phase Ib Study of the DNA-PK Inhibitor Peposertib Combined with Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer | Clinical Cancer Research | American Association for Cancer Research', type='url_citation', url='https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/30/4/695/734220/A-Phase-Ib-Study-of-the-DNA-PK-Inhibitor?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=426, start_index=9, title='Phase I Trial of DNA-PK inhibitor (M3814) in Combination with Radiation and Adjuvant Temozolomide in Newly Diagnosed MGMT Unmethylated Glioblastoma', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mdanderson.org/patients-family/diagnosis-treatment/clinical-trials/clinical-trials-index/clinical-trials-detail.ID2019-1035.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=426, start_index=9, title='UCSD Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Trial → M3814 (Peposertib) to Radiation Therapy for Patients With Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Who Cannot Take Cisplatin', type='url_citation', url='https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT04533750?utm_source=openai')])"

546,"('Choline fenofibrate', 'Fenofibric acid', 'Procetofenic acid', 'Trilipix', 'Lf 153')",Medical,"Fenofibrate (sold under the brand name Tricor among others), is an oral medication of the fibrate class used to treat abnormal blood lipid levels. It is less commonly used compared to statins because it treats a different type of cholesterol abnormality to statins. While statins have strong evidence for reducing heart disease and death, there is evidence to suggest that fenofibrate also reduces the risk of heart disease and death. However, this seems only to apply to specific populations of people with elevated triglyceride levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Its use is recommended together with dietary changes. Common side effects include liver problems, breathing problems, abdominal pain, muscle problems, and nausea. Serious side effects may include toxic epidermal necrolysis, rhabdomyolysis, gallstones, and pancreatitis. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It works by multiple mechanisms. It was patented in 1969, and came into medical use in 1975. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 88th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Fenofibrate is mainly used for primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Fenofibrate may slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy and the need for invasive treatment such as laser therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with pre-existing retinopathy. It was initially indicated for diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy in Australia. The large scale, international FIELD and ACCORD-Eye trials found that fenofibrate therapy reduced required laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy by 1.5% over 5 years, as well as reducing progression by 3.7% over 4 years. Further studies looking at the role of fenofibrate in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as the primary outcome is warranted to understand its role in this condition. Although no statistically significant cardiovascular risk benefits were identified in these trials, benefits may accrue to add on therapy to patients with high triglyceride dyslipidaemia currently taking statin medications. Fenofibrate appears to reduce the risk of below ankle amputations in patients with Type 2 diabetes without microvascular disease. The FIELD study reported that fenofibrate at doses of 200 mg daily, reduced the risk for any amputation by 37% independent of glycaemic control, presence or absence of dyslipidaemia and its lipid-lowering mechanism of action. However, the cohort of participants who underwent amputations were more likely to have had previous cardiovascular disease (e.g. angina, myocardial infarction), longer duration of diabetes and had baseline neuropathy. Fenofibrate has an off-label use as an added therapy of high blood uric acid levels in people who have gout. It is used in addition to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. === Severe hypertriglyceridemia type IV or V === It is used in tandem with diet for treatment of adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetics showing fasting chylomicronemia usually reduces the need for pharmacologic intervention. Statins remain the first line for treatment of blood cholesterol. AHA guidelines from 2013 did not find evidence for routine use of additional medications. Additionally, in 2016, the FDA filed ""Withdrawal of Approval of Indications Related to the Coadministration With Statins in Applications for Niacin Extended-Release Tablets and Fenofibric Acid Delayed Release Capsules"" noting ""the Agency has concluded that the totality of the scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in triglyceride levels and/or increase in HDL cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. Consistent with this conclusion, FDA has determined that the benefits of niacin ER tablets and fenofibric acid DR capsules for coadministration with statins no longer outweigh the risks, and the approvals for this indication should be withdrawn."" == Contraindications == Fenofibrate is contraindicated in: Patients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis (2.7-fold increase in exposure, and increased accumulation during chronic dosing in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min) Patients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function test abnormalities Patients with preexisting gallbladder disease Nursing mothers Hypothyroidism Patients with known hypersensitivity to fenofibrate or fenofibric acid == Adverse effects == The most common adverse events (>3% of patients with coadministered statins) are === Precautions === When fenofibrate and a statin are given as combination therapy, it is recommended that fenofibrate be given in the morning and the statin at night, so that the peak dosages do not overlap. Musculoskeletal Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis; increased risk when coadminstered with a statin, particularly in the elderly and patients with diabetes, kidney failure, hypothyroidism Hepatotoxicity Can increase serum transaminases; liver tests should be monitored periodically Nephrotoxicity Can increase serum creatinine levels; renal function should be monitored periodically in patients with chronic kidney disease Biliary Can increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to risk of cholelithiasis; if suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. See ""Interaction"" section under Bile acid sequestrant Coagulation/Bleeding Exercise caution in concomitant treatment with oral Coumadin anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin). Adjust the dosage of Coumadin to maintain the prothrombin time/INR at desired level to prevent bleeding complications. == Overdose == ""There is no specific treatment for overdose with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. General supportive care is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of clinical status"". Additionally, hemodialysis should not be considered as an overdose treatment option because fenofibrate heavily binds to plasma proteins and does not dialyze well. == Interactions == These drug interactions with fenofibrate are considered major and may need therapy modifications: Bile acid sequestrants (e.g. cholestyramine, colestipol, etc.): If taken together, bile acid resins may bind to fenofibrate, resulting in a decrease in fenofibrate absorption. To maximize absorption, patients need to separate administration by at least 1 h before or 4 h to 6 h after taking the bile acid sequestrant. Immunosuppressants (e.g. ciclosporin or tacrolimus): An increased risk of renal dysfunction exists with concomitant use of immunosuppressants and fenofibrate. Approach with caution when coadministering additional medications that decrease renal function. Vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin): As previously mentioned, fenofibrate interacts with coumadin anticoagulants to increase the risk of bleeding. Dosage adjustment of vitamin K antagonist may be necessary. Statins: Combination of statins and fenofibrate may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy. == Mechanism of action == ""In summary, enhanced catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles and reduced secretion of VLDL underlie the hypotriglyceridemic effect of fibrates, whereas their effect on HDL metabolism is associated with changes in HDL apolipoprotein expression."" Fenofibrate is a fibrate derivative, a prodrug comprising fenofibric acid linked to an isopropyl ester. It lowers lipid levels by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). PPARα activates lipoprotein lipase and reduces apoprotein CIII, which increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma. PPARα also increases apoproteins AI and AII, reduces VLDL- and LDL-containing apoprotein B, and increases HDL-containing apoprotein AI and AII. == Formulations == Fenofibrate is available in several formulations and is sold under several brand names, including: Tricor by AbbVie Lipofen by Kowa Pharmaceuticals America Inc Lofibra by Teva Lipanthyl, Lipidil, Lipantil micro and Supralip by Abbott Laboratories Fenocor-67 by Ordain Health Care Fenogal by SMB Laboratories Antara by Oscient Pharmaceuticals Tricheck by Zydus (CND) Atorva TG by Zydus Medica Golip by GolgiUSA Stanlip by Sun Pharma (India) The formulations may differ in terms of pharmacokinetic properties, particularly bioavailability; some must be taken with meals, whereas others may be taken without regard to food. The choline salt of fenofibrate is available in the United States, sold as Trilipix, and may be taken without regard to meals. == Environmental presence == Fenofibric acid was one of the 12 compounds identified in sludge samples taken from 12 wastewater treatment plants in California that were associated with estrogenic activity in in vitro. == History == Fenofibrate was first synthesized in 1974, as a derivative of clofibrate, and was initially offered in France. It was initially known as procetofen, and was later renamed fenofibrate to comply with World Health Organization International Nonproprietary Name guidelines.

In this study, we evaluated voruciclib, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, for its chemo-sensitizing activity in ABCB1- and ABCG2- overexpressing cells. Cytotoxicity and reversal effect of voruciclib was determined by MTT assay. The intracellular accumulation and efflux of ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrates were measured by scintillation counter. The effects on expression and intracellular localization of ABCB1 and ABCG2 proteins were determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Vanadate-sensitive ATPase assay was done to determine the effect of voruciclib on the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Flow cytometric analysis was done to determine the effect of voruciclib on apoptosis of ABCB1 and ABCG2-overexpressing cells and docking analysis was done to determine the interaction of voruciclib with ABCB1 and ACBG2 protein. Voruciclib significantly potentiated the effect of paclitaxel and doxorubicin in ABCB1-overexpressing cells, as well as mitoxantrone and SN-38 in ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Voruciclib moderately sensitized ABCC10- overexpressing cells to paclitaxel, whereas it did not alter the cytotoxicity of substrates of ABCC1. Furthermore, voruciclib increased the intracellular accumulation and decreased the efflux of substrate anti-cancer drugs from ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cells. However, voruciclib did not alter the expression or the sub-cellular localization of ABCB1 or ABCG2. Voruciclib stimulated the ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Lastly, voruciclib exhibited a drug-induced apoptotic effect in ABCB1- or ABCG2- overexpressing cells. Voruciclib is currently a phase I clinical trial drug. Our findings strongly support its potential use in combination with conventional anti-cancer drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Venetoclax, an FDA-approved Bcl-2 selective inhibitor for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), is tolerated well in elderly patients with AML and has good overall response rates; however, resistance remains a concern. In this study, we show that targeting CDK9 with voruciclib in combination with venetoclax results in synergistic antileukemic activity against AML cell lines and primary patient samples. CDK9 inhibition enhances venetoclax activity through downregulation of Mcl-1 and c-Myc. However, downregulation of Mcl-1 is transient, which necessitates an intermittent treatment schedule to allow for repeated downregulation of Mcl-1. Accordingly, an every other day schedule of the CDK9 inhibitor is effective in vitro and in vivo in enhancing the efficacy of venetoclax. Our preclinical data provide a rationale for an intermittent drug administration schedule for the clinical evaluation of the combination treatment for AML. Aberrant regulation of BCL-2 family members enables evasion of apoptosis and tumor resistance to chemotherapy. BCL-2 and functionally redundant counterpart, MCL-1, are frequently over-expressed in high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). While clinical inhibition of BCL-2 has been achieved with the BH3 mimetic venetoclax, anti-tumor efficacy is limited by compensatory induction of MCL-1. Voruciclib, an orally bioavailable clinical stage CDK-selective inhibitor, potently blocks CDK9, the transcriptional regulator of MCL-1. Here, we demonstrate that voruciclib represses MCL-1 protein expression in preclinical models of DLBCL. When combined with venetoclax in vivo, voruciclib leads to model-dependent tumor cell apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition. Strongest responses were observed in two models representing high-risk activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL, while no response was observed in a third ABC model, and intermediate responses were observed in two models of germinal center B-cell like (GCB) DLBCL. Given the range of responses, we show that CIVO, a multiplexed tumor micro-dosing technology, represents a viable functional precision medicine approach for differentiating responders from non-responders to BCL-2/MCL-1 targeted therapy. These findings suggest that the combination of voruciclib and venetoclax holds promise as a novel, exclusively oral combination therapy for a subset of high-risk DLBCL patients.",Voruciclib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008725888328626752), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008624685928225517)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://meipharma.com/pipeline/voruciclib.html ', [])"

Aquaphor is offered in four product ranges. There are two skin protectant ointments: Aquaphor Original Ointment, used as a compounding agent; and Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing Ointment, sold in mass retail outlets. The other product ranges include: Aquaphor Lip Repair; Lip Repair + Protect SPF 30; and Aquaphor Baby. Aquaphor has been available in the United States market for over 90 years. In accordance with the Food and Drug Administration's OTC Skin Protectant Monograph Aquaphor, containing 41 percent petrolatum (or petroleum jelly), the active ingredient, temporarily protects minor cuts, scrapes, and burns; protects and helps relieve chapped or cracked skin and lips; helps protect from the drying effects of wind and cold weather. Aquaphor is used and recommended by health care professionals for minor post-operative wounds or defects. Aquaphor is also very commonly recommended to use on freshly applied tattoos to aid with the healing process and burning side effects. == History == 1925: Aquaphor was developed in the Beiersdorf Inc laboratories in the USA. It was trademarked that year by Herman A. Metz, president of Beiersdorf Inc at that time. 1929: Beiersdorf sold Aquaphor's trade marks to Duke Laboratories in order to manufacture products in the country. 1936: Aquaphor's first product offering was sold to doctors, pharmacists and hospitals in 5 lb. containers. 1960: Aquaphor production was discontinued during World War II and restarted by Duke Laboratiories in 1960. One lb cans and 2 oz tubes were sold to medical professionals. 1973: Beiersdorf repurchased all trademarks from Duke Laboratories. 1982: Aquaphor tube was introduced and directly sold to consumers for the first time. 1991: A new formulation Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing Ointment was launched, an addition to the Aquaphor Original Ointment. 2003: Aquaphor Baby Healing Ointment & Gentle Wash were introduced. 2011: Aquaphor Lip Repair was introduced 2012: Aquaphor Lip Repair + Protect SPF 30 was launched and Aquaphor is launched globally by Beiersdorf affiliates in 25 other countries. 2013: Aquaphor achieved the Good Housekeeping Seal. == Properties and ingredients == In a study funded by Aquaphor's parent company, it was found that their ""Healing Ointment"" product was associated with (but did not cause) decreased redness around the wound but did not in any way perform better than other products clinically. Aquaphor is not comedogenic and does not contain any fragrances, preservatives, or dyes. Unlike Vaseline (100% petrolatum), which is occlusive, Aquaphor (41% petrolatum) claims to form a semi-occlusive barrier on the skin. If correct, this in theory should enable the transmission of water and oxygen, which is important for wound healing and the formation of a protective moist healing environment. However, no studies have been conducted using this brand to test these healing claims. === Key ingredients === Petrolatum An active ingredient and OTC skin protectant, petrolatum forms an occlusive barrier on the skin and helps retain moisture. Mineral oil A colorless, odorless, light oil, commonly obtained as a highly refined derivative of crude oil. Baby oil is a perfumed variety of mineral oil. Ceresin A wax derived from the purification of the natural wax ozokerite. Lanolin alcohol A subfraction of lanolin (wool wax), a mixture of hydrocarbons that imparts emulsifying properties and provides emollient (skin smoothing) properties. Lanolin alcohol is composed of cholesterol, other sterols, and free fatty acids. Moisturizers containing Cholesterol and fatty acid mixtures have been shown to provide skin benefits. Since this ingredient is sourced from wool from animals, this product is not suitable for vegans. Glycerin A moisturizing factor and humectant that attracts and binds moisture in the stratum corneum (outer-most layer of epidermis), helping to keep it hydrated. It is commonly used as a moisturizing agent in lotions, creams, and cosmetics. Most glycerin used in products in the U.S. comes from animals. If it is natural glycerin, it will typically be labeled ‘plant derived’. Panthenol Also known as pro- Vitamin B5, when applied topically, has humectant properties and conditions the skin.

It is indicated specifically for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or maintenance in adults. The medication is taken by mouth. Side effects of lemborexant include somnolence, fatigue, headache, and abnormal dreams. The medication is a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA). It acts as a selective dual antagonist of the orexin receptors OX1 and OX2. Lemborexant has a long elimination half-life of 17 to 55 hours and a time to peak of about 1 to 3 hours. It is not a benzodiazepine or Z-drug and does not interact with GABA receptors, instead having a distinct mechanism of action. Lemborexant was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2019. It is a schedule IV controlled substance in the United States and may have a low potential for misuse. Besides lemborexant, other orexin receptor antagonists including suvorexant and daridorexant have also been introduced. == Medical uses == Lemborexant is used in the treatment of insomnia in adults. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found that lemborexant had an effect size (standardized mean difference (SMD)) against placebo for treatment of insomnia at 4 weeks of 0.36 (95% CITooltip confidence interval 0.08 to 0.63) and at 3 months of 0.41 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.78). Lemborexant had similar effect sizes at 4 weeks as the other evaluated and marketed orexin receptor antagonists suvorexant (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62) and daridorexant (SMD 0.23, 95% CI –0.01 to 0.48), whereas benzodiazepines and Z-drugs generally showed larger effect sizes (e.g., SMDs of 0.45 to 0.83) than lemborexant and the other orexin receptor antagonists. However, the review concluded that lemborexant and eszopiclone among all of the insomnia medications assessed had the best profiles overall in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability. Compared to benzodiazepines, there is a low risk of developing tolerance and dependence. Memory and attention are not affected the next morning when taking lemborexant. === Available forms === Lemborexant is available in the form of 5 and 10 mg oral film-coated tablets. == Side effects == Side effects of lemborexant include somnolence or fatigue (combined preferred terms of somnolence, lethargy, fatigue, and sluggishness) (6.9% at 5 mg and 9.6% at 10 mg vs. 1.3% for placebo), headache (5.9% at 5 mg and 4.5% at 10 mg vs. 3.4% for placebo), and nightmares or abnormal dreams (0.9% at 5 mg and 2.2% at 10 mg vs. 0.9% for placebo). Less common side effects include sleep paralysis (1.3% at 5 mg and 1.6% at 10 mg vs. 0% for placebo) and hypnagogic hallucinations (0.1% at 5 mg and 0.7% at 10 mg vs. 0% for placebo). Lemborexant at doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg produces drug-liking responses similar to those of zolpidem (30 mg) and suvorexant (40 mg) in recreational sedative drug users. It is a controlled substance in the United States and is considered to have a low misuse potential. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Lemborexant is a dual antagonist of the orexin OX1 and OX2 receptors. It associates and dissociates from the orexin receptors more rapidly than certain other orexin receptor antagonists, such as suvorexant, and this may cause it to have a shorter duration of action. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of lemborexant is good and is at least 87%. The time to peak levels of lemborexant is 1 to 3 hours. A high-fat and high-calorie meal has been found to delay the time to peak levels by 2 hours. Its plasma protein binding in vitro is 94%. Lemborexant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5. The ""effective"" half-life of lemborexant is 17 to 19 hours while its terminal elimination half-life is 55 hours. The medication is excreted in feces (57%) and to a lesser extent urine (29%). Although lemborexant has a longer terminal elimination half-life than suvorexant, it appears to be more rapidly cleared than suvorexant in the earlier phases of elimination. In addition, lemborexant dissociates from the orexin receptors more rapidly than does suvorexant. These differences may allow for comparatively reduced next-day effects such as daytime somnolence with lemborexant. == History == In June 2016, Eisai initiated Phase III clinical trials in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Spain and the UK. In December 2019, lemborexant was approved for use in the United States based on results from the SUNRISE 1 and SUNRISE 2 Phase III clinical trials. == Society and culture == === Names === Lemborexant is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name while E-2006 was its developmental code name. Lemborexant is sold under the brand name Dayvigo. === Availability === Lemborexant is marketed in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan. It is not approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the European Union or by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom. == Research == Lemborexant is under development for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, sleep apnea, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As of February 2022, it is in phase 2 clinical trials for circadian rhythm sleep disorders and phase 1 trials for sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. == References ==",Dayvigo,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.8412379075889476e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -9.7508447652217e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/dayvigo.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Dayvigo: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/dayvigo.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Approximately 10% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) that harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have in-frame insertions in exon 20 of the EGFR gene. These tumors do not usually respond to currently available EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Tarloxotinib is a novel hypoxia-activated prodrug that releases a potent, irreversible pan-ERBB TKI (tarloxotinib-E) under solid tumor hypoxia. We examined the efficacy of tarloxotinib-E against several types of Ba/F3 cells with introduced EGFR exon 20 mutations (EGFR A763insFQEA, V769insASV, D770insSVD, H773insH and H773insNPH mutations). We assayed growth inhibition for tarloxotinib (prodrug), tarloxotinib-E (active form), poziotinib, afatinib, and osimertinib in Ba/F3 cells with each EGFR exon 20 mutation. We also explored acquired resistance mechanisms to tarloxotinib-E by establishing cells with resistance to tarloxotinib-E via chronic drug exposure after N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis treatment. Among all tested Ba/F3 cell lines, IC These findings indicate that tarloxotinib-E could be effective for NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 mutations. Our results also show that T790M or C797S mutations can confer acquired resistance to tarloxotinib-E; and suggest that resistance mechanisms are influenced by the baseline EGFR exon 20 mutations. Tarloxotinib, a hypoxia-activated prodrug of an irreversible pan-ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor, represents a novel therapeutic which exploits the tumor-specific hypoxic environment as a mechanism for tumor-specific targeting. This study evaluated the safety and activity of tarloxotinib in recurrent or metastatic (R/M) cutaneous (CSCC) or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This was a phase II two-stage multi-centre study for patients with R/M HNSCC or CSCC. All patients received tarloxotinib 150 mg/m2 on days 1,8,15 and 22 in a 28-day cycle. Stage 1 enrolled patients in three cohorts: p16-negative HNSCC, p16-positive oropharyngeal SCC, and CSCC.

Silmitasertib is in clinical trials for use as an adjunct to chemotherapy in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), is in phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastoma, and in preclinical development for other cancers, including hematological and lymphoid malignancies. In January 2017, it was granted orphan drug status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for advanced cholangiocarcinoma. It is being developed by Senhwa Biosciences of Taiwan. == Mechanism of action == Silmitasertib interacts competitively with the ATP-binding site of CK2 subunit alpha. This leads to inhibition of several downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt. == COVID-19 infections == In SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infected Caco-2 cells, the phosphorylase activity of casein kinase 2 (CK2) is increased resulting in phosphorylation of several cytoskeletal proteins. These infected cells also display CK2-containing filopodia protrusions associated with budding viral particles. Hence the protrusions may assist the virus in infecting adjacent cells. In these same cells, the CK2 inhibitor silmitasertib displayed potent antiviral activity. Senhwa Biosciences and the US National Institutes of Health have announced that they will evaluate the efficacy of silmitasertib in treating COVID-19 infections. == History == CX-4945 was originated by now-defunct Cylene Pharmaceuticals of San Diego, California, as the culmination of a lengthy process of rational, structure-based molecular modification of a lead compound known to have PARP inhibitor activity. Among a large series of compounds built around a benzo[c]-[2,6]naphthyridine-8-carboxylic acid scaffold, CX-4945 was chosen for its high potency and selectivity as an inhibitor of CK2.

FET-rearranged sarcomas are often aggressive malignancies affecting patients of all ages. New therapies are needed. These translocations fuse the 5' portion of the FET gene with a 3' partner gene encoding a transcription factor (TF). The resulting fusion proteins are oncogenic TFs with a FET protein low complexity domain (LCD) and a DNA binding domain. FET fusion proteins have proven stubbornly difficult to target directly and promising strategies target critical co-regulators. One candidate is lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 is recruited by multiple FET fusions, including EWSR1::FLI1. LSD1 promotes EWSR1::FLI1 activity and treatment with the noncompetitive inhibitor SP-2509 blocks EWSR1::FLI1 transcriptional function. A similar molecule, seclidemstat (SP-2577), is currently in clinical trials for FET-rearranged sarcomas (NCT03600649). However, whether seclidemstat has pharmacological activity against FET fusions has not been demonstrated. Here, we evaluate the  SP-2577(Seclidemstat), an inhibitor of lysine-specific demthylase KDM1A (LSD1) that is overexpressed in pediatric sarcomas, was evaluated against pediatric sarcoma xenografts. SP-2577 (100 mg/kg/day × 28 days) statistically significantly (p < .05) inhibited growth of three of eight Ewing sarcoma (EwS), four of five rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and four of six osteosarcoma (OS) xenografts. The increase in EFS T/C was modest (<1.5) for all models except RMS Rh10 (EFS T/C = 2.8). There were no tumor regressions or consistent changes in dimethyl histone H3(K4), HOXM1, DAX1, c-MYC and N-MYC, or tumor histology/differentiation. SP-2577 has limited activity against these pediatric sarcoma models at the dose and schedule evaluated. Identifying the molecules that control neural stem cell (NSC) fate would revolutionize treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Histone lysine demethylase 1A (KDM1A) demethylates the mono- and di-methyl groups of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and H3K9 and plays an essential role in NSC proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effects of Seclidemstat (SP-2577), a reversible KDM1A inhibitor, and tranylcypromine (TCP), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and recently known as an irreversible histone lysine demethylase 1A inhibitor, on NSCs. SP-2577 and TCP increased glial fibrillary acidic protein expression (GFAP), decreased βIII-tubulin (TUBB3) expression, and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in rat NSCs. SP-2577 and TCP enhanced the transcription of Gfap and reduced Tubb3 transcription. Furthermore, SP-2577 increased the transcription levels of interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor, while TCP induced the transcription level of fibroblast growth factor 2. Therefore, we show that the KDM1A inhibitors, SP-2577 and TCP, induce astrocytogenesis in rat NSCs. These findings suggest that KDM1A is a target for regulating NSCs fate and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental processes and epigenetics.",Seclidemstat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002134810492862016), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0052368370816111565)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([investors.salariuspharma.com](https://investors.salariuspharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/salarius-pharmaceuticals-announces-interim-results-phase-12?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=192, start_index=9, title='Salarius Pharmaceuticals Announces Interim Results from Phase 1/2 Trial of Seclidemstat as a Treatment for Ewing Sarcoma and FET-Rearranged Sarcomas | Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc.', type='url_citation', url='https://investors.salariuspharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/salarius-pharmaceuticals-announces-interim-results-phase-12?utm_source=openai')])"
557,"('Ziprasidone', 'Geodon', 'Zeldox', 'Cp 88059', 'Ziprasidone [inn:ban]')",Medical,"Ziprasidone, sold under the brand name Geodon among others, is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It may be used by mouth and by injection into a muscle (IM). The intramuscular form may be used for acute agitation in people with schizophrenia. Common side effects include tremors, tics, dizziness, dry mouth, restlessness, nausea, and mild sedation. Although it can also cause weight gain, the risk is much lower than for other atypical antipsychotics. How it works is not entirely clear but is believed to involve effects on serotonin and dopamine in the brain. Ziprasidone was approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. The pills are made up of the hydrochloride salt, ziprasidone hydrochloride. The intramuscular form is the mesylate, ziprasidone mesylate trihydrate, and is provided as a lyophilized powder. In 2020, it was the 282nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ziprasidone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia as well as acute mania and mixed states associated with bipolar disorder. Its intramuscular injection form is approved for acute agitation in schizophrenic patients for whom treatment with just ziprasidone is appropriate. In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, ziprasidone demonstrated mild-standard effectiveness. Ziprasidone was 15% more effective than lurasidone and iloperidone, approximately as effective as chlorpromazine and asenapine, and 9–13% less effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Ziprasidone is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, though evidence from the CATIE trials suggests it is less effective than olanzapine, and equally as effective compared to quetiapine. There are higher discontinuation rates for lower doses of ziprasidone, which are also less effective than higher doses. == Adverse effects == Ziprasidone (and all other second generation antipsychotics (SGAs)) received a boxed warning in the US due to increased mortality in elderly people with dementia-related psychosis. Sleepiness and headache are very common adverse effects (>10%). Common adverse effects (1–10%), include producing too much saliva or having dry mouth, runny nose, respiratory disorders or coughing, nausea and vomiting, stomach aches, constipation or diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight gain (but the smallest risk for weight gain compared to other antipsychotics), rashes, fast heart beats, blood pressure falling when standing up quickly, muscle pain, weakness, twitches, dizziness, and anxiety. Extrapyramidal symptoms are also common and include tremor, dystonia (sustained or repetitive muscle contractions), akathisia (the feeling of a need to be in motion), parkinsonism, and muscle rigidity; in a 2013 meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, ziprasidone ranked 8th for such side effects. Ziprasidone is known to trigger mania in some bipolar patients. This medication can cause birth defects, according to animal studies, although this side effect has not been confirmed in humans. Recently, the FDA required the manufacturers of some atypical antipsychotics to include a warning about the risk of hyperglycemia and Type II diabetes with atypical antipsychotics. Some evidence suggests that ziprasidone does not cause insulin resistance to the degree of other atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine. Weight gain is also less of a concern with ziprasidone compared to other atypical antipsychotics. In fact, in a trial of long term therapy with ziprasidone, overweight patients (BMI > 27) actually had a mean weight loss overall. According to the manufacturer insert, ziprasidone caused an average weight gain of 2.2 kg (4.8 lbs), which is significantly lower than other atypical antipsychotics, making this medication better for patients that are concerned about their weight. In December 2014, the FDA warned that ziprasidone could cause a potentially fatal skin reaction, Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), although this was believed to occur only rarely. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Correspondence to clinical effects ==== Ziprasidone mostly affects the receptors of dopamine (D2), serotonin (5-HT2A, partially 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1D) and epinephrine/norepinephrine (α1) to a high degree, while of histamine (H1) - moderately. It also somewhat inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, though not dopamine. Ziprasidone's efficacy in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia is believed to be mediated primarily via antagonism of the dopamine receptors, specifically D2. Blockade of the 5-HT2A receptor may also play a role in its effectiveness against positive symptoms, though the significance of this property in antipsychotic drugs is still debated among researchers. Blockade of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C and activation of 5-HT1A as well as inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine may all contribute to its ability to alleviate negative symptoms.; however, its effects on the 5-HT1A receptor may be limited as a study found ziprasidone would likely ""produce detectable occupancy [of 5-HT1A receptors] only at higher doses that would produce unacceptable levels of side effects in man, although lower doses are sufficient to produce pharmacological effects."" The relatively weak antagonistic actions of ziprasidone on the α1-adrenergic receptor likely in part explains some of its side effects, such as orthostatic hypotension. Unlike many other antipsychotics, ziprasidone has no significant affinity for the mACh receptors, and as such lacks any anticholinergic side effects. Like most other antipsychotics, ziprasidone is sedating due primarily to serotonin and dopamine blockade. === Pharmacokinetics === The systemic bioavailability of ziprasidone is 100% when administered intramuscularly and 60% when administered orally without food. After a single dose intramuscular administration, the peak serum concentration typically occurs at about 60 minutes after the dose is administered, or earlier. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within one to three days. Exposure increases in a dose-related manner and following three days of intramuscular dosing, little accumulation is observed. The bioavailability of the drug is reduced by approximately 50% if a meal is not eaten before Ziprasidone ingestion. Ziprasidone is hepatically metabolized by aldehyde oxidase; minor metabolism occurs via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Medications that induce (e.g. carbamazepine) or inhibit (e.g. ketoconazole) CYP3A4 have been shown to decrease and increase, respectively, blood levels of ziprasidone. Its biological half-life time is 10 hours at doses of 80–120 milligrams. == History == Ziprasidone is chemically similar to risperidone, of which it is a structural analogue. It was first synthesized in 1987 at the Pfizer central research campus in Groton, Connecticut. Phase I trials started in 1995. In 1998 ziprasidone was approved in Sweden. After the FDA raised concerns about long QT syndrome, more clinical trials were conducted and submitted to the FDA, which approved the drug on February 5, 2001. == Society and culture == === Lawsuit === In September 2009, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Pfizer had been ordered to pay a historic fine of $2.3 billion as a penalty for fraudulent marketing of several drugs, including Geodon. === Brand names === In the US, Geodon is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == Research == Ziprasidone has been studied in and reported to be effective in the treatment of borderline personality disorder, but findings are mixed. == References == == Further reading == Taylor D (2006).

It is a structural analog of lapatinib but has an acrylamide side chain. Sixteen metabolites of allitinib were detected by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The pharmacologically active α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group was the major metabolic site. The metabolic pathways included O-dealkylation, amide hydrolysis, dihydrodiol formation, hydroxylation, and secondary phase 2 conjugation. The metabolite of amide hydrolysis (M6) and 27,28-dihydrodiol allitinib (M10) were the major pharmacologically active metabolites in the circulation. The steady-state exposures to M6 and M10 were 11% and 70% of that of allitinib, respectively. The biotransformation of allitinib was determined using microsomes and recombinant metabolic enzymes. In vitro phenotyping studies demonstrated that multiple cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms, mainly CYP3A4/5 and CYP1A2, were involved in the metabolism of allitinib. Thiol conjugates (M14 and M16) and dihydrodiol metabolites (M5 and M10) were detected in humans, implying the formation of reactive intermediates. The formation of a glutathione conjugate of allitinib was independent of NADPH and P450 isoforms, but was catalyzed by glutathione-S-transferase. P450 enzymes and epoxide hydrolase were involved in M10 formation. Overall, our study showed that allitinib was metabolized by the O-dealkylation pathway similar to lapatinib, but that amide hydrolysis and the formation of dihydrodiol were the dominant metabolic pathways. The absorbed allitinib was extensively metabolized by multiple enzymes. Allitinib, also known as AST1306, is a novel irreversible inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptors 1 and 2. Allitinib is currently used in clinical trial to treat solid tumors. A previous study showed that allitinib is extensively metabolized in humans. Amide hydrolysis metabolite (M6) and 29,30-dihydrodiol allitinib (M10) are the major metabolites in circulation. To study the pharmacokinetics of allitinib and its two major metabolites in cancer patients, a rapid, sensitive and reliable LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of allitinib, M6 and M10 in human plasma. After simple protein precipitation, the analytes and the combined internal standards (lapatinib and NB-2, an analog of allitinib) were separated on a Zorbax Eclipase XDB C18 column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 1.8 μm, Agilent) using a mobile phase of 5 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid (phase A) and 50% (v/v) methanol in acetonitrile (phase B) with gradient elution. Mass spectrometric detection was conducted by atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring modes using AB Sciex Triple Quad 6500 system. Linear calibration curves were obtained for the following concentration range: 0.300-200 ng/ml for allitinib; 0.030-20.0 ng/ml for M6; and 0.075-50.0 ng/ml for M10. Intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision were within the acceptable limits of ±15% at all of the concentrations. The method was successfully applied to a preliminary clinical pharmacokinetic study following oral administration of allitinib tosylate tablets in cancer patients. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the HER family of growth factors that activates several intracellular signaling pathways promoting proliferation and survival. EGFR over-expression is frequently associated with gene mutation or amplification, thereby constituting a major target for molecular therapies. Recently, a new generation of EGFR inhibitors has been developed with pan-HER properties and irreversible actions. Allitinib® (AST1306) is an orally active, highly selective irreversible inhibitor of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases with promising efficacies. In the present study we aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity of allitinib in a large panel of human cancer-derived cell lines and to correlate its efficacy to the mutational status of the EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA and PTEN genes. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the functional role of KRAS mutations in the response to this new inhibitor. In total 76 different cancer-derived cell lines, representing 11 distinct histological types, were analyzed and classified into three groups: highly sensitive (HS), moderately sensitive (MS) and resistant (R). We found that 28 (36.8 %) cancer-derived cell lines exhibited a HS phenotype, 19 (25.0 %) a MS phenotype and 29 (38.1 %) a R phenotype. Allitinib showed a stronger cytotoxicity in head and neck, esophageal, melanoma and lung cancer-derived cell lines. We found that KRAS mutations were significantly associated with the R phenotype. To substantiate these results, an allitinib-sensitive lung cancer-derived cell line (H292) was transfected with plasmids carrying the two most common activating KRAS mutations (p.G12D and p.G12S). We found that both mutations reverted the allitinib-sensitive phenotype in these cells. The current study represents the largest in vitro assessment of allitinib cytotoxicity performed to date. Through this study, we identified cancer types that could potentially benefit from this drug. Additionally, our findings suggest that prevalent KRAS mutations constitute potential predictive biomarkers for allitinib response.",Allitinib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.30726242181845e-05), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024831434711813927)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.molnova.com/en/ProductsThr/Allitinib.html,https://www.probes-drugs.org/compound/PD038945/,https://www.medchemexpress.com/ast-1306.html ', [])"

Leniolisib was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2023. It is the first approved medication for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Leniolisib is indicated for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (activated PI3K delta syndrome) in people twelve years of age and older. Activated PI3K delta syndrome is caused by mutations in either of two genes, PIK3CD or PIK3R1, that regulate the maturation of white blood cells, especially B cells and T cells. This leads to a decrease in immune cells, which makes it difficult for people with activated PI3K delta syndrome to fight off bacterial and viral infections. == Mechanism of action == Leniolisib is a selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (PI3Kδ inhibitor), which means it blocks a form of the protein called phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) that is overactive in activated PI3K delta syndrome. By inhibiting PI3Kδ, leniolisib helps normalize immune function as measured by a significant increase in number of immune response generating B cells and reduction in size of lymph nodes. == Adverse effects == The most common encountered adverse effects were headache, sinusitis, and atopic dermatitis. == History == Leniolisib was developed by Novartis and subsequently licensed to Pharming Group, a Dutch biotechnology company, in 2019.

Of 722 randomized patients, 552 had cytogenetic results; 137 (25%) had high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and 172 (32%) had 1q21 amplification alone. PFS was improved with IRd versus placebo in both high-risk and standard-risk cytogenetics subgroups: in high-risk patients, with median PFS of 21.4 versus 9.7 months; in standard-risk patients, with median PFS of 20.6 versus 15.6 months. This PFS benefit was consistent across subgroups with individual high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, including patients with del(17p). PFS was also longer with IRd versus placebo- in patients with 1q21 amplification, and in the ""expanded high-risk"" group, defined as those with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities and/or 1q21 amplification. IRd demonstrated substantial benefit compared with placebo in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with high-risk and standard-risk cytogenetics, and improves the poor PFS associated with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Ixazomib and lenalidomide are teratogenic in animal studies. The latter is contraindicated in pregnant women, making this therapy regimen unsuitable for this group. It is not known whether ixazomib or its metabolites pass into the breast milk. == Side effects == Common side effects of the ixazomib+lenalidomide+dexamethasone study therapy included diarrhoea (42% versus 36% under placebo+lenalidomide+dexamethasone), constipation (34% versus 25%), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count; 28% versus 14%), peripheral neuropathy (28% versus 21%), nausea (26% versus 21%), peripheral oedema (swelling; 25% versus 18%), vomiting (22% versus 11%), and back pain (21% versus 16%). Serious diarrhoea or thrombocytopenia occurred in 2% of patients, respectively. Side effects of ixazomib alone were only assessed in a small number of people. Diarrhoea grade 2 or higher was found in 24% of these patients, thrombocytopenia grade 3 or higher in 28%, and fatigue grade 2 or higher in 26%. == Interactions == The drug has a low potential for interactions via cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver enzymes and transporter proteins. The only relevant finding in studies was a reduction of ixazomib blood levels when combined with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. The Cmax was reduced by 54% and the area under the curve by 74% in this study. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === At therapeutic concentrations, ixazomib selectively and reversibly inhibits the protein proteasome subunit beta type-5 (PSMB5) with a dissociation half-life of 18 minutes. This mechanism is the same as of bortezomib, which has a much longer dissociation half-life of 110 minutes; the related drug carfilzomib, by contrast, blocks PSMB5 irreversibly. Proteasome subunits beta type-1 and type-2 are only inhibited at high concentrations reached in cell culture models. PSMB5 is part of the 20S proteasome complex and has enzymatic activity similar to chymotrypsin. It induces apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death, in various cancer cell lines. A synergistic effect of ixazomib and lenalidomide has been found in a large number of myeloma cell lines. === Pharmacokinetics === The medication is taken orally as a prodrug, ixazomib citrate, which is a boronic ester; this ester rapidly hydrolyzes under physiological conditions to its biologically active form, ixazomib, a boronic acid. Absolute bioavailability is 58%, and highest blood plasma concentrations of ixazomib are reached after one hour. Plasma protein binding is 99%. The substance is metabolized by many CYP enzymes (percentages in vitro, at higher than clinical concentrations: CYP3A4 42.3%, CYP1A2 26.1%, CYP2B6 16.0%, CYP2C8 6.0%, CYP2D6 4.8%, CYP2C9 4.8%, CYP2C9 <1%) as well as non-CYP enzymes, which could explain the low interaction potential. Clearance is about 1.86 litres per hour with a wide variability of 44% between individuals, and plasma half-life is 9.5 days. 62% of ixazomib and its metabolites are excreted via the urine (of which less than 3.5% in unchanged form) and 22% via the faeces. == Chemistry == Ixazomib is a boronic acid and peptide analogue like the older bortezomib. It contains a derivative of the amino acid leucine with the carboxylic acid group being replaced by a boronic acid; and the remainder of the molecule has been likened to phenylalanine. The structure has been found through a large-scale screening of boron-containing molecules. == History == The drug was developed by Takeda. It got US and European orphan drug status for multiple myeloma in 2011, and for AL amyloidosis in 2012. Takeda submitted a US new drug application for multiple myeloma in July 2015. In September 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ixazomib combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone a priority review designation for multiple myeloma. On 20 November 2015, the FDA approved this combination for second-line treatment. The request for marketing authorisation in Europe was initially refused by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May 2016 due to insufficient data showing a benefit of treatment. After Takeda requested a re-examination, the EMA granted a marketing authorisation on 21 November 2016 on the condition that further efficacy studies be conducted. The approval indication is the same as in the US. == Research == As of January 2017, ixazomib is also in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of AL amyloidosis and plasmacytoma of the bones, and in Phase I/II trials for various other conditions. == References ==",Ixazomib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.794906312279636e-06), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -7.855583680793643e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixazomib?utm_source=openai), [cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ixazomibcitrate?utm_source=openai), [medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a616008.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=277, start_index=9, title='Ixazomib', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixazomib?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=277, start_index=9, title='Ixazomib Citrate - NCI', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ixazomibcitrate?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=277, start_index=9, title='Ixazomib: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a616008.html?utm_source=openai')])"

This first-in-human phase 1 study evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy in recurrent malignant glioma to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Methods Patients (N = 17) received oral PF-06840003 in four dose-escalation groups: 125 mg once-daily (QD; n = 2); 250 mg QD (n = 4); 250 mg twice-daily (BID; n = 3); 500 mg BID (n = 8). A modified toxicity probability interval method determined the MTD. Results Four patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs); one with treatment-related SAEs (grade 4 alanine and aspartate aminotransferase elevations). The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate at 500 mg BID was 12.5% (n = 1/8); the MTD was not reached. Following PF-06840003 dosing, median time to maximum plasma concentration for the active enantiomer PF-06840002 was 1.5-3.0 hr and mean elimination half-life was 2 to 4 hr (Cycle 1 Day 1).

IDO-1 is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli and promotes immune tolerance through effector T-cell anergy and enhanced Treg function. As such, IDO-1 is a nexus for the induction of a key immunosuppressive mechanism and represents an important immunotherapeutic target in oncology. Starting from HTS hit 5, IDO-1 inhibitor 6 (EOS200271/PF-06840003) has been developed. The structure-activity relationship around 6 is described and rationalized using the X-ray crystal structure of 6 bound to human IDO-1, which shows that 6, differently from most of the IDO-1 inhibitors described so far, does not bind to the heme iron atom and has a novel binding mode. Clinical candidate 6 shows good potency in an IDO-1 human whole blood assay and also shows a very favorable ADME profile leading to favorable predicted human pharmacokinetic properties, including a predicted half-life of 16-19 h. Tumors use indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) as a major mechanism to induce an immunosuppressive microenvironment. IDO1 expression is upregulated in many cancers and considered to be a resistance mechanism to immune checkpoint therapies. IDO1 is induced in response to inflammatory stimuli such as IFNγ and promotes immune tolerance by depleting tryptophan and producing tryptophan catabolites, including kynurenine, in the tumor microenvironment.

564,"('Atrazine', 'Gesaprim', 'Oleogesaprim', 'Chromozin', 'Aktikon')",Medical,"Atrazine ( A-trə-zeen) is a chlorinated herbicide of the triazine class. It is used to prevent pre-emergence broadleaf weeds in crops such as maize (corn), soybean and sugarcane and on turf, such as golf courses and residential lawns. Atrazine's primary manufacturer is Syngenta and it is one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States, Canadian, and Australian agriculture. Its use was banned in the European Union in 2004, when the EU found groundwater levels exceeding the limits set by regulators, and Syngenta could not show that this could be prevented nor that these levels were safe. At least two significant Canadian farm well studies showed that atrazine was the most common contaminant found. As of 2001, atrazine was the most commonly detected pesticide contaminating drinking water in the U.S.: 44 Studies suggest it is an endocrine disruptor, an agent that can alter the natural hormonal system. However, in 2006 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had stated that under the Food Quality Protection Act ""the risks associated with the pesticide residues pose a reasonable certainty of no harm"", and in 2007, the EPA said that atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian sexual development and that no additional testing was warranted. The EPA's 2009 review concluded that ""the agency's scientific bases for its regulation of atrazine are robust and ensure prevention of exposure levels that could lead to reproductive effects in humans"". However, in their 2016 Refined Ecological Risk Assessment for Atrazine, it was stated that ""it is difficult to make definitive conclusions about the impact of atrazine at a given concentration but multiple studies have reported effects to various endpoints at environmentally-relevant concentrations."" EPA started a registration review in 2013. The EPA's review has been criticized, and the safety of atrazine remains controversial. EPA has however stated that ""If at any time EPA determines there are urgent human or environmental risks from atrazine exposure that require prompt attention, we will take appropriate regulatory action, regardless of the status of the registration review process."" == Uses == Atrazine is an herbicide that is used to stop pre- and post-emergence broadleaf and grassy weeds in crops such as sorghum, maize, sugarcane, lupins, pine, and eucalypt plantations, and triazine-tolerant canola. In the United States as of 2014, atrazine was the second-most widely used herbicide after glyphosate, with 76 million pounds (34 thousand metric tons) of it applied each year, nearly identical to its usage in 1974, of 76.8 million pounds. Atrazine continues to be one of the most widely used herbicides in Australian agriculture. Its effect on corn yields has been estimated from 1% to 8%, with 3–4% being the conclusion of one economics review. In another study looking at combined data from 236 university corn field trials from 1986 to 2005, atrazine treatments showed an average increase of 5.7 US bushels per acre (0.50 m3/ha) (~400 kilograms per hectare (360 lb/acre)) than alternative herbicide treatments. Effects on sorghum yields have been estimated to be as high as 20%, owing in part to the absence of alternative weed control products that can be used on sorghum. == Chemistry and biochemistry == Atrazine was invented in 1958 in the Geigy laboratories as the second of a series of 1,3,5-triazines. Atrazine is prepared from cyanuric chloride, which is treated sequentially with ethylamine and isopropylamine. Like other triazine herbicides, atrazine functions by binding to the plastoquinone-binding protein in photosystem II, which animals lack. Plant death results from starvation and oxidative damage caused by breakdown in the electron transport process. Oxidative damage is accelerated at high light intensity. Atrazine's effects in humans and animals primarily involve the endocrine system. Studies suggest that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor that can cause hormone imbalance. Atrazine has been found to act as an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1. Atrazine has been shown to bind covalently to (chemically react with) a large number of mammalian proteins. == Environment == === Levels === Atrazine contamination of surface water (lakes, rivers, and streams) in the U.S. has been monitored by the EPA and has consistently exceeded levels of concern in two Missouri watersheds and one in Nebraska. Monitoring of atrazine levels in community water systems in 31 high-use states found that levels exceeded levels of concern for infant exposure during at least one year between 1993 and 2001 in 34 of 3670 community water systems using surface water, and in none of 14,500 community water systems using groundwater. Surface water monitoring data from 20 high atrazine use watersheds found peak atrazine levels up to 147 parts per billion, with daily averages in all cases below 10 parts per billion. === Biodegradation === Atrazine remains in soil for a matter of months (although in some soils can persist to at least four years) and can migrate from soil to groundwater; once in groundwater, it degrades slowly. It has been detected in groundwater at high levels in some regions of the U.S. where it is used on some crops and turf. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency expresses concern regarding contamination of surface waters (lakes, rivers, and streams). Atrazine degrades in soil primarily by the action of microbes. The half-life of atrazine in soil ranges from 13 to 261 days. Atrazine biodegradation can occur by two known pathways: Hydrolysis of the C-Cl bond is followed by the ethyl and isopropyl groups, catalyzed by the hydrolase enzymes called AtzA, AtzB, and AtzC. The end product of this process is cyanuric acid, itself unstable with respect to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The best characterized organisms that use this pathway are of Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP. Dealkylation of the amino groups gives 2-chloro-4-hydroxy-6-amino-1,3,5-triazine, the degradation of which is unknown. This path also occurs in Pseudomonas species, as well as a number of bacteria. Rates of biodegradation are affected by atrazine's low solubility; thus surfactants may increase the degradation rate. Though the two alkyl moieties readily support growth of certain microorganisms, the atrazine ring is a poor energy source due to the oxidized state of ring carbon. In fact, the most common pathway for atrazine degradation involves the intermediate, cyanuric acid, in which carbon is fully oxidized, thus the ring is primarily a nitrogen source for aerobic microorganisms. Atrazine may be catabolized as a carbon and nitrogen source in reducing environments, and some aerobic atrazine degraders have been shown to use the compound for growth under anoxia in the presence of nitrate as an electron acceptor, a process referred to as a denitrification. When atrazine is used as a nitrogen source for bacterial growth, degradation may be regulated by the presence of alternative sources of nitrogen. In pure cultures of atrazine-degrading bacteria, as well as active soil communities, atrazine ring nitrogen, but not carbon are assimilated into microbial biomass. Low concentrations of glucose can decrease the bioavailability, whereas higher concentrations promote the catabolism of atrazine. The genes for enzymes AtzA-C have been found to be highly conserved in atrazine-degrading organisms worldwide. In Pseudomonas sp. ADP, the Atz genes are located noncontiguously on a plasmid with the genes for mercury catabolism. AtzA-C genes have also been found in a Gram-positive bacterium, but are chromosomally located. The insertion elements flanking each gene suggest that they are involved in the assembly of this specialized catabolic pathway. Two options exist for degradation of atrazine using microbes, bioaugmentation or biostimulation. Like the herbicides trifluralin and alachlor, atrazine is susceptible to rapid transformation in the presence of reduced iron-bearing soil clays, such as ferruginous smectites. In natural environments, some iron-bearing minerals are reduced by specific bacteria in the absence of oxygen, thus the abiotic transformation of herbicides by reduced minerals is viewed as ""microbially induced"". === Photolysis === In 2016, photolytic degradation with 254 nm ultraviolet was seen by the authors of a particular study as an efficient process, which could be used in pilot plants to reduce or eliminate compounds of the atrazine class or similar emerging contaminants, in effluents. == Toxicology == According to Extension Toxicology Network in the U.S., ""The oral median Lethal Dose or LD50 for atrazine is 3090 mg/kg in rats, 1750 mg/kg in mice, 750 mg/kg in rabbits, and 1000 mg/kg in hamsters. The dermal LD50 in rabbits is 7500 mg/kg and greater than 3000 mg/kg in rats. The 1-hour inhalation LC50 is greater than 0.7 mg/L in rats. The 4-hour inhalation LC50 is 5.2 mg/L in rats."" The maximum contaminant level is 0.003 mg/L and the reference dose is 0.035 mg/kg/day. === Mammals === A September 2003 review by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) stated that atrazine is ""currently under review for pesticide re-registration by the EPA because of concerns that atrazine may cause cancer"", but not enough information was available to ""definitely state whether it causes cancer in humans."" According to the ATSDR, one of the primary ways that atrazine can affect a person's health is ""by altering the way that the reproductive system works. Studies of couples living on farms that use atrazine for weed control found an increase in the risk of preterm delivery, but these studies are difficult to interpret because most of the farmers were men who may have been exposed to several types of pesticides. Little information is available regarding the risks to children, however ""[m]aternal exposure to atrazine in drinking water has been associated with low fetal weight and heart, urinary, and limb defects in humans"". Incidence of a birth defect known as gastroschisis appears to be higher in areas where surface water atrazine levels are elevated especially when conception occurs in the spring, the time when atrazine is commonly applied. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified atrazine as ""not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans"" (Group 3). The EPA determined in 2003 ""that atrazine is not likely to cause cancer in humans"". In 2006, the EPA stated, ""the risks associated with the pesticide residues pose a reasonable certainty of no harm"". In 2007, the EPA said, ""studies thus far suggest that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor"". The implications for children's health are related to effects during pregnancy and during sexual development, though few studies are available. In people, risks for preterm delivery and intrauterine growth retardation have been associated with exposure. Atrazine exposure has been shown to result in delays or changes in pubertal development in female rats; conflicting results have been observed in males. Male rats exposed via milk from orally exposed mothers exhibited higher levels of prostate inflammation as adults; immune effects have also been seen in male rats exposed in utero or while nursing. EPA opened a new review in 2009 that concluded that ""the agency's scientific bases for its regulation of atrazine are robust and ensure prevention of exposure levels that could lead to reproductive effects in humans."" Deborah A. Cory-Slechta, a professor at the University of Rochester in New York has said in 2014, ""The way the E.P.A. tests chemicals can vastly underestimate risks."" She has studied atrazine's effects on the brain and serves on the E.P.A.'s science advisory board. She further stated, ""There's still a huge amount we don't know about atrazine."" A Natural Resources Defense Council report from 2009 said that the EPA is ignoring atrazine contamination in surface and drinking water in the central United States. ""There was no consistent evidence of an association between atrazine use and any cancer site"". The study tracked 57,310 licensed pesticide applicators over 13 years. A 2011 review of the mammalian reproductive toxicology of atrazine jointly conducted by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations concluded that atrazine was not teratogenic. Reproductive effects in rats and rabbits were only seen at doses that were toxic to the mother. Observed adverse effects in rats included fetal resorption in rates (at doses ≥50 mg/kg per day), delays in sexual development in female rats (at doses ≥30 mg/kg per day), and decreased birth weight (at doses ≥3.6 mg/kg per day). A 2014 systematic review, funded by atrazine manufacturer Syngenta, assessed its relation to reproductive health problems. The authors concluded that the quality of most studies was poor and without good quality data, the results were difficult to assess, though it was noted that no single category of negative pregnancy outcome was found consistently across studies. The authors concluded that a causal link between atrazine and adverse pregnancy outcomes was not warranted due to the poor quality of the data and the lack of robust findings across studies. Syngenta was not involved in the design, collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of the data and did not participate in the preparation of the manuscript. === Amphibians === Atrazine has been a suspected teratogen, with some studies reporting causing demasculinization in male northern leopard frogs even at low concentrations. A 2002 study by Tyrone Hayes, of the University of California, Berkeley, found that exposure caused male tadpoles to turn into hermaphrodites – frogs with both male and female sexual characteristics. However, this study has not been able to be replicated, and a 2003 EPA review of this study concluded that overcrowding, questionable sample handling techniques, and the failure of the authors to disclose key details including sample sizes, dose-response effects, and the variability of observed effects made it difficult to assess the study's credibility and ecological relevance. A 2005 study, requested by EPA and conducted under EPA guidance and inspection, was unable to reproduce Hayes' results. In 2010, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) tentatively concluded that environmental atrazine ""at existing levels of exposure"" was not affecting amphibian populations in Australia consistent with the 2007 EPA findings. APVMA responded to Hayes' 2010 published paper, that his findings ""do not provide sufficient evidence to justify a reconsideration of current regulations which are based on a very extensive dataset."" The EPA's Scientific Advisory Panel examined relevant studies and concluded in 2010, ""atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development based on a review of laboratory and field studies"". It recommended proper study design for further investigation. As required by the EPA, two experiments were conducted under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and were inspected by EPA and German regulatory authorities, concluding 2009 that ""long-term exposure of larval X. laevis to atrazine at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 μg/L does not affect growth, larval development, or sexual differentiation"". A 2008 report cited the independent work of researchers in Japan, who were unable to replicate Hayes' work. ""The scientists found no hermaphrodite frogs; no increase in aromatase as measured by aromatase mRNA induction; and no increase in vitellogenin, another marker of feminization."" The Atrazine Saga has been chronicled. === 2012 Class action lawsuit === In 2012, Syngenta, an atrazine manufacturer, was the defendant in a class-action lawsuit concerning the levels of atrazine in human water supplies. Syngenta agreed to pay $105 million to reimburse more than one thousand water systems for ""the cost of filtering atrazine from drinking water"". The company denied all wrongdoing. === 2015 Canadian regulatory review === Prompted by the EU's 2004 ban, a regulatory review of the product in Canada by the PMRA was begun in 2015. On 31 March 2017 the review result was published and the PMRA decided to leave the product's registration unchanged. This was done because while the EU's ban was based on a legislated pollutant level of 0.1 μg/L, the Canadian regulations call for a home-grown ""risk-based scientific approach in determining the risk to human health from pesticides in drinking water."" The U.S. drinking water standard of 3 μg/L is approximately the same to the Canadian standard of 5 μg/L. Both maximum pollutant levels in North America were not exceeded by the maximum pollutant level in Canadian data of 2.32 μg/L. == See also == Pesticides in the United States – Atrazine Endocrine disruptor Simazine == References == == External links == Atrazine- PubChem(National library of medicine) - atrazine Atrazine Fact Sheet - National Pesticide Information Center - Atrazine Fact Sheet Atrazine - CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards Atrazine in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)",Atrazine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.004105354659259319), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029797859489917755)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/atrazine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=107, start_index=12, title='Atrazine | US EPA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/atrazine?utm_source=openai')])"
565,"('Vancomycin (hydrochloride)', 'Vancocin', 'Vancoled', 'Vancomycinum', 'Vancomicina')",Medical,"Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic medication used to treat certain bacterial infections. It is administered intravenously (injection into a vein) to treat complicated skin infections, bloodstream infections, endocarditis, bone and joint infections, and meningitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Blood levels may be measured to determine the correct dose. Vancomycin is also taken orally (by mouth) to treat Clostridioides difficile infections. When taken orally, it is poorly absorbed. Common side effects include pain in the area of injection and allergic reactions. Occasionally, hearing loss, low blood pressure, or bone marrow suppression occur. Safety in pregnancy is not clear, but no evidence of harm has been found, and it is likely safe for use when breastfeeding. It is a type of glycopeptide antibiotic and works by blocking the construction of a cell wall. Vancomycin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The WHO classifies vancomycin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. Vancomycin is made by the soil bacterium Amycolatopsis orientalis. == Medical uses == Vancomycin is indicated for the treatment of serious, life-threatening infections by Gram-positive bacteria of both aerobic and anaerobic types that are unresponsive to other antibiotics. The increasing emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) has resulted in the development of guidelines for use by the Centers for Disease Control Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. These guidelines restrict use of vancomycin to these indications: treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible organisms resistant to penicillins, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), treatment of infections in individuals with serious allergy to penicillins, treatment of pseudomembranous colitis caused by C. difficile; in particular, in cases of relapse or where the infection is unresponsive to metronidazole treatment (for this indication, vancomycin is given orally rather than intravenously), treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive microorganisms in patients with serious allergies to beta-lactam antimicrobials, antibacterial prophylaxis for endocarditis after certain procedures in penicillin-hypersensitive people at high risk, surgical prophylaxis for major procedures involving implantation of prostheses in institutions with a high rate of MRSA or MRSE, early in treatment as an empiric antibiotic for possible MRSA infection while waiting for culture identification of the infecting organism, halting the progression of primary sclerosing cholangitis and preventing symptoms; vancomycin does not cure the patient and success is limited, treatment of endophthalmitis by intravitreal injection for Gram-positive bacteria coverage; it has been used to prevent the condition but is not recommended due to the risk of side effects. === Spectrum of susceptibility === Vancomycin is a last-resort medication for the treatment of sepsis and lower respiratory tract, skin, and bone infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria are: S. aureus: 0.25 μg/mL to 4.0 μg/mL S. aureus (methicillin resistant or MRSA): 1 μg/mL to 138 μg/mL S. epidermidis: ≤0.12 μg/mL to 6.25 μg/mL == Side effects == === Oral administration === Common side effects associated with oral vancomycin administration (used to treat intestinal infections) include: gastrointestinal adverse effects (such as abdominal pain and nausea); dysgeusia (distorted sense of taste), in case of administration of vancomycin oral solution, but not in case of vancomycin capsules. === Intravenous administration === Serum vancomycin levels may be monitored in an effort to reduce side effects, but the value of such monitoring has been questioned. Peak and trough levels are usually monitored, and for research purposes the area under the concentration curve is also sometimes used. Toxicity is best monitored by looking at trough values. Immunoassays are commonly used to measure vancomycin levels. Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with intravenous vancomycin include: pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site; vancomycin flushing syndrome (VFS), previously known as red man syndrome (or ""redman syndrome""); thrombophlebitis, which is common when administered through peripheral catheters but not when central venous catheters are used, although central venous catheters are a predisposing factor for upper-extremity deep-vein thrombosis. Damage to the kidneys (nephrotoxicity) and to the hearing (ototoxicity) were side effects of the early, impure versions of vancomycin, and were prominent in clinical trials conducted in the mid-1950s. Later trials using purer forms of vancomycin found nephrotoxicity is an infrequent adverse effect (0.1% to 1% of patients), but this is accentuated in the presence of aminoglycosides. Rare adverse effects associated with intravenous vancomycin (<0.1% of patients) include anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, superinfection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome. Vancomycin can induce platelet-reactive antibodies in the patient, leading to severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding with florid petechial hemorrhages, ecchymoses, and wet purpura. Historically, vancomycin has been considered a nephrotoxic and ototoxic drug, based on numerous case reports in the medical literature following initial approval by the FDA in 1958. But as its use increased with the spread of MRSA beginning in the 1970s, toxicity risks were reassessed. With the removal of impurities present in earlier formulations of the drug, and with the introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring, the risk of severe toxicity has been reduced. ==== Nephrotoxicity ==== The extent of nephrotoxicity for vancomycin remains controversial. In 1980s, vancomycin with a purity > 90% was available, and kidney toxicity defined by an increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.5 mg/dL occurred in only about 5% of patients. But dosing guidelines from the 1980s until 2008 recommended vancomycin trough concentrations between 5 and 15 μg/mL. Concern for treatment failures prompted recommendations for higher dosing (troughs 15 to 20 μg/mL) for serious infection, and acute kidney injury (AKI) rates attributable to the vancomycin increased. Importantly, the risk of AKI increases with co-administration of other known nephrotoxins, in particular aminoglycosides. Furthermore, the sort of infections treated with vancomycin may also cause AKI, and sepsis is the most common cause of AKI in critically ill patients. Finally, studies in humans are mainly associations studies, where the cause of AKI is usually multifacotorial. Animal studies have demonstrated that higher doses and longer duration of vancomycin exposure correlates with increased histopathologic damage and elevations in urinary biomarkers of AKI.37-38 Damage is most prevalent at the proximal tubule, which is further supported by urinary biomarkers, such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), clusterin, and osteopontin (OPN). In humans, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) as part of the nephrocheck test. The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of vancomycin nephrotoxicity are multifactorial but include interstitial nephritis, tubular injury due to oxidative stress, and cast formation. Therapeutic drug monitoring can be used during vancomycin therapy to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity associated with excessive drug exposure. Immunoassays are commonly utilized for measuring vancomycin levels. In children, concomitant administration of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam has been associated with an elevated incidence of AKI relative to other antibiotic regimens. ==== Ototoxicity ==== Attempts to establish rates of vancomycin-induced ototoxicity are even more difficult due to lack of good data. The consensus is that clearly related cases of vancomycin ototoxicity are rare. The association between vancomycin serum levels and ototoxicity is also uncertain. Cases of ototoxicity have been reported in patients whose vancomycin serum level exceeded 80 μg/mL, but cases have also been reported in patients with therapeutic levels. Thus it remains unknown whether therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin for the purpose of maintaining ""therapeutic"" levels prevents ototoxicity. Still, therapeutic drug monitoring can be used during vancomycin therapy to minimize the risk of ototoxicity associated with excessive drug exposure. ==== Interactions with other nephrotoxins ==== Another area of controversy and uncertainty is whether and to what extent vancomycin increases the toxicity of other nephrotoxins. Clinical studies have yielded various results, but animal models indicate that the nephrotoxic effect probably increases when vancomycin is added to nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides. A dose- or serum level-effect relationship has not been established. ==== Vancomycin Flushing Reaction (aka ""Red man syndrome"") ==== Vancomycin is recommended to be administered in a dilute solution slowly, over at least 60 min (maximum rate of 10 mg/min for doses >500 mg) due to the high incidence of pain and thrombophlebitis and to avoid an infusion reaction known as vancomycin flushing reaction. This phenomenon has been often clinically referred to as ""red man syndrome"". The reaction usually appears within 4 to 10 min after the commencement or soon after the completion of an infusion and is characterized by flushing and/or an erythematous rash that affects the face, neck, and upper torso, attributed to the release of histamine from mast cells. This reaction is caused by the interaction of vancomycin with MRGPRX2, a GPCR-mediating IgE-independent mast cell degranulation. Less frequently, hypotension and angioedema occur. Symptoms may be treated or prevented with antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, and are less likely to occur with slow infusion. == Dosing considerations == The recommended intravenous dosage in adults is 500 mg every 6 hours or 1000 mg every 12 hours, with modification to achieve a therapeutic range as needed. The recommended oral dosage in the treatment of antibiotic-induced pseudomembranous enterocolitis is 125 to 500 mg every 6 hours for 7 to 10 days. Dose optimization and target attainment of vancomycin in children involves adjusting the dosage to maximize effectiveness while minimizing the risk of adverse effects, specifically acute kidney injury. Dose optimization is achieved by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which allows measurement of vancomycin levels in the blood. TDM using area under the curve (AUC)-guided dosing, preferably with Bayesian forecasting, is recommended to ensure that the AUC0-24h/minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio is maintained above a certain threshold (400-600) associated with optimal efficacy. == Routes of administration == In the United States, vancomycin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for intravenous and oral administration. === Intravenous === Vancomycin must be given intravenously for systemic therapy since it is poorly absorbed from the intestine. It is a large hydrophilic molecule that partitions poorly across the gastrointestinal mucosa. Due to its short half-life, it is often injected twice daily. === Oral === The only approved indication for oral vancomycin therapy is in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis, where it must be given orally to reach the site of infection in the colon. After oral administration, the fecal concentration of vancomycin is around 500 μg/mL (sensitive strains of Clostridioides difficile have a mean inhibitory concentration of ≤2 μg/mL) === Inhaled (off-label) === Inhaled vancomycin can also be used off-label, via nebulizer, to treat various infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract. === Rectal (off-label) === Rectal administration is an off-label use of vancomycin for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection. == Therapeutic drug monitoring == Plasma level monitoring of vancomycin is necessary due to the drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity is considered time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on how long the serum drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration of the target organism. Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which therapeutic drug monitoring is warranted include patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered pharmacokinetic parameters, patients on haemodialysis, patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function. In such cases, trough concentrations are measured. Therapeutic drug monitoring is also used for dose optimization of vancomycin in treating children. Target ranges for serum vancomycin concentrations have changed over the years. Early authors suggested peak levels of 30 to 40 mg/L and trough levels of 5 to 10 mg/L, but current recommendations are that peak levels need not be measured and that trough levels of 10 to 15 mg/L or 15 to 20 mg/L, depending on the nature of the infection and the specific patient's needs, may be appropriate. Measuring vancomycin concentrations to calculate doses optimizes therapy in patients with augmented renal clearance. == Chemistry == Vancomycin is a branched tricyclic glycosylated nonribosomal peptide produced by the Actinomycetota species Amycolatopsis orientalis (formerly designated Nocardia orientalis). Vancomycin exhibits atropisomerism—it has multiple chemically distinct rotamers owing to the rotational restriction of some of the bonds. The form present in the drug is the thermodynamically more stable conformer. == Biosynthesis == Vancomycin is made by the soil bacterium Amycolatopsis orientalis. Vancomycin biosynthesis occurs primarily via three nonribosomal protein synthases (NRPSs) VpsA, VpsB, and VpsC. The enzymes determine the amino acid sequence during its assembly through its 7 modules. Before vancomycin is assembled through NRPS, the non-proteinogenic amino acids are first synthesized. L-tyrosine is modified to become the β-hydroxytyrosine (β-HT) and 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (4-Hpg) residues. 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ring (3,5-DPG) is derived from acetate. Nonribosomal peptide synthesis occurs through distinct modules that can load and extend the protein by one amino acid per module through the amide bond formation at the contact sites of the activating domains. Each module typically consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain, and a condensation (C) domain. In the A domain, the specific amino acid is activated by converting into an aminoacyl adenylate enzyme complex attached to a 4'-phosphopantetheine cofactor by thioesterification. The complex is then transferred to the PCP domain with the expulsion of AMP. The PCP domain uses the attached 4'-phosphopantethein prosthetic group to load the growing peptide chain and their precursors. The organization of the modules necessary to biosynthesize vancomycin is shown in Figure 1. In the biosynthesis of vancomycin, additional modification domains are present, such as the epimerization (E) domain, which isomerizes the amino acid from one stereochemistry to another, and a thioesterase domain (TE) is used as a catalyst for cyclization and releases of the molecule via a thioesterase scission. A set of NRPS enzymes (peptide synthase VpsA, VpsB, and VpsC) are responsible for assembling the heptapeptide. (Figure 2). VpsA codes for modules 1, 2, and 3. VpsB codes for modules 4, 5, and 6, and VpsC codes for module 7. The vancomycin aglycone contains 4 D-amino acids, although the NRPSs only contain 3 epimerization domains. The origin of D-Leu at residue 1 is unknown. The three peptide syntheses are at the start of the region of the bacterial genome linked with antibiotic biosynthesis, and span 27 kb. β-hydroxytyrosine (β-HT) is synthesized before incorporation into the heptapeptide backbone. L-tyrosine is activated and loaded on the NRPS VpsD, hydroxylated by OxyD, and released by the thioesterase Vhp. The timing of the chlorination by halogenase VhaA during biosynthesis is undetermined, but is proposed to occur before the complete assembly of the heptapeptide. After the linear heptapeptide molecule is synthesized, vancomycin must undergo further modifications, such as oxidative cross-linking and glycosylation, in trans by distinct enzymes, referred to as tailoring enzymes, to become biologically active (Figure 3). To convert the linear heptapeptide to cross-linked, glycosylated vancomycin, six enzymes are required. The enzymes OxyA, OxyB, OxyC, and OxyD are cytochrome P450 enzymes. OxyB catalyzes oxidative cross-linking between residues 4 and 6, OxyA between residues 2 and 4, and OxyC between residues 5 and 7. This cross-linking occurs while the heptapeptide is covalently bound to the PCP domain of the 7th NRPS module. These P450s are recruited by the X domain in the 7th NRPS module, which is unique to glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis. The cross-linked heptapeptide is then released by the action of the TE domain, and methyltransferase Vmt then N-methylates the terminal leucine residue. GtfE then joins D-glucose to the phenolic oxygen of residue 4, followed by the addition of vancosamine catalyzed by GtfD. Some of the glycosyltransferases capable of glycosylating vancomycin and related nonribosomal peptides display notable permissivity and have been used to generate libraries of differentially glycosylated analogs through glycorandomization. == Total synthesis == Both the vancomycin aglycone and the complete vancomycin molecule have been targets successfully reached by total synthesis. The target was first achieved by David Evans in October 1998, KC Nicolaou in December 1998, Dale Boger in 1999, and more selectively synthesized again by Boger in 2020. == Mechanism of action == Vancomycin targets bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the basic building block of the bacterial cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, whether it is of aerobic or anaerobic type. Specifically, vancomycin forms hydrogen bonds with the D-alanyl-D-alanine (D-Ala-D-Ala) peptide motif of the peptidoglycan precursor, a component of the bacterial cell wall. Peptidoglycan is a polymer that provides structural support to the bacterial cell wall. The peptidoglycan precursor is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then transported across the cytoplasmic membrane to the periplasmic space, where it is assembled into the cell wall. The assembly process involves two enzymatic activities: transglycosylation and transpeptidation. Transglycosylation involves the polymerization of the peptidoglycan precursor into long chains, while transpeptidation involves the cross-linking of these chains to form a three-dimensional mesh-like structure. Vancomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala peptide motif of the peptidoglycan precursor, thereby preventing its processing by the transglycosylase; as such, vancomycin disrupts the transglycosylation activity of the cell wall synthesis process. The disruption leads to an incomplete and corrupted cell wall, which makes the replicating bacteria vulnerable to external forces such as osmotic pressure, so that the bacteria cannot survive and are eliminated by the immune system. Gram-negative bacteria are insensitive to vancomycin due to their different cell wall morphology. The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharide, which acts as a barrier to vancomycin penetration. That is why vancomycin is mainly used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (except some nongonococcal species of Neisseria). The large hydrophilic molecule of vancomycin is able to form hydrogen bond interactions with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moieties of the NAM/NAG-peptides. Under normal circumstances, this is a five-point interaction. This binding of vancomycin to the D-Ala-D-Ala prevents cell wall synthesis of the long polymers of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) that form the backbone strands of the bacterial cell wall, and prevents the backbone polymers from cross-linking with each other. == Plant tissue culture == Vancomycin is one of the few antibiotics used in plant tissue culture to eliminate Gram-positive bacterial infection. It has relatively low toxicity to plants. == Antibiotic resistance == === Intrinsic resistance === A few Gram-positive bacteria, such as Leuconostoc and Pediococcus, are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, but they rarely cause disease in humans. Most Lactobacillus species are also intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, except for L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii, which are sensitive. Other Gram-positive bacteria with intrinsic resistance to vancomycin include Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Weissella confusa, and Clostridium innocuum. Most Gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin because their outer membranes are impermeable to large glycopeptide molecules (with the exception of some non-gonococcal Neisseria species). === Acquired resistance === Evolution of microbial resistance to vancomycin is a growing problem, especially in healthcare facilities such as hospitals. While newer alternatives to vancomycin exist, such as linezolid (2000) and daptomycin (2003), the widespread use of vancomycin makes resistance to it a significant worry, especially for individual patients if resistant infections are not quickly identified and the patient continues an ineffective treatment. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus emerged in 1986. Vancomycin resistance evolved in more common pathogenic organisms during the 1990s and 2000s, including vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA). Agricultural use of avoparcin, another similar glycopeptide antibiotic, may have contributed to the evolution of vancomycin-resistant organisms. One mechanism of resistance to vancomycin involves the alteration to the terminal amino acid residues of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits, under normal conditions, D-alanyl-D-alanine, to which vancomycin binds. The D-alanyl-D-lactate variation results in the loss of one hydrogen-bonding interaction (4, as opposed to 5 for D-alanyl-D-alanine) possible between vancomycin and the peptide. This loss of just one point of interaction results in a 1000-fold decrease in affinity. The D-alanyl-D-serine variation causes a six-fold loss of affinity between vancomycin and the peptide, likely due to steric hindrance. In enterococci, this modification appears to be due to the expression of an enzyme that alters the terminal residue. Three main resistance variants have been characterised to date among resistant Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis populations: VanA - enterococcal resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin; inducible on exposure to these agents VanB - lower-level enterococcal resistance; inducible by vancomycin, but strains may remain susceptible to teicoplanin VanC - least clinically important; enterococci resistant only to vancomycin; constitutive resistance A variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the resistant D-lactic acid variation in vancomycin-resistant bacterial cell walls and also binds well to the original target (vancomycin-susceptible bacteria). === ""Regained"" vancomycin === In 2020 a team at the University Hospital Heidelberg (Germany) regained vancomycin's antibacterial power by modifying the molecule with a cationic oligopeptide. The oligopeptide consists of six arginin units in Position VN. In comparison to the unmodified vancomycin the activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria could be enhanced by a factor of 1,000. This pharmacon is still in preclinical development. == History == Vancomycin was first isolated in 1953 by Edmund Kornfeld (working at Eli Lilly) from a bacteria in a soil sample collected from the interior jungles of Borneo by a missionary, William M. Bouw. The organism that produced it was eventually named Amycolatopsis orientalis. The original indication for vancomycin was to treat penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The compound was initially called compound 05865, but was later given the generic name vancomycin, derived from the term ""vanquish"". One quickly apparent advantage was that staphylococci did not develop significant resistance, despite serial passage in culture media containing vancomycin. The rapid development of penicillin resistance by staphylococci led to its being fast-tracked for approval by the Food and Drug Administration. In 1958, Eli Lilly first marketed vancomycin hydrochloride under the trade name Vancocin. Vancomycin never became the first-line treatment for S. aureus for several reasons: It possesses poor oral bioavailability, so must be given intravenously for most infections. β-Lactamase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins such as methicillin (and its successors, nafcillin and cloxacillin) were subsequently developed, which have better activity against non-MRSA staphylococci. Early trials used early, impure forms of the drug (""Mississippi mud""), which were found to be toxic to the inner ear and to the kidneys; these findings led to the relegation of vancomycin to a drug of last resort. In 2004, Eli Lilly licensed Vancocin to ViroPharma in the U.S., Flynn Pharma in the UK, and Aspen Pharmacare in Australia. The patent expired in the early 1980s, and the FDA authorized the sale of several generic versions in the U.S., including from manufacturers Bioniche Pharma, Baxter Healthcare, Sandoz, Akorn-Strides, and Hospira. == Research == The combination of vancomycin powder and povidone-iodine lavage may reduce the risk of periprosthetic joint infection in hip and knee arthroplasties. == References ==",Vancoled,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.8889261304575484e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003292018664069474), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00258516613394022)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03804149478673935), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/cons/vancoled.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Vancoled Advanced Patient Information - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/cons/vancoled.html?utm_source=openai')])"
566,"('Ciprofloxacin', 'Ciprobay', 'Ciprofloxacine', 'Cipro', 'Ciproxan')",Medical,"Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections. This includes bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, certain types of infectious diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, skin infections, typhoid fever, and urinary tract infections, among others. For some infections it is used in addition to other antibiotics. It can be taken by mouth, as eye drops, as ear drops, or intravenously. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe side effects include an increased risk of tendon rupture, hallucinations, and nerve damage. In people with myasthenia gravis, there is worsening muscle weakness. Rates of side effects appear to be higher than some groups of antibiotics such as cephalosporins but lower than others such as clindamycin. Studies in other animals raise concerns regarding use in pregnancy. No problems were identified, however, in the children of a small number of women who took the medication. It appears to be safe during breastfeeding. It is a second-generation fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of activity that usually results in the death of the bacteria. Ciprofloxacin was patented in 1980 and introduced by Bayer in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies ciprofloxacin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 181st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ciprofloxacin is used to treat a wide variety of infections, including infections of bones and joints, endocarditis, bacterial gastroenteritis, malignant otitis externa, bubonic plague, respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, and chancroid. Like all antibiotics, Ciprofloxacin only treats bacterial infections; it does not treat viral infections such as the common cold. For certain uses including acute sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated gonorrhea, ciprofloxacin is not considered a first-line agent. Ciprofloxacin occupies an important role in treatment guidelines issued by major medical societies for the treatment of serious infections, especially those likely to be caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For example, ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole is one of several first-line antibiotic regimens recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of community-acquired abdominal infections in adults. It also features prominently in treatment guidelines for acute pyelonephritis, complicated or hospital-acquired urinary tract infection, acute or chronic prostatitis, certain types of endocarditis, certain skin infections, and prosthetic joint infections. In other cases, treatment guidelines are more restrictive, recommending in most cases that older, narrower-spectrum drugs be used as first-line therapy for less severe infections to minimize fluoroquinolone-resistance development. For example, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends the use of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in urinary tract infections be reserved to cases of proven or expected resistance to narrower-spectrum drugs such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The European Association of Urology recommends ciprofloxacin as an alternative regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, but cautions that the potential for ""adverse events have to be considered"". Although approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of respiratory infections, ciprofloxacin is not recommended for respiratory infections by most treatment guidelines due in part to its modest activity against the common respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. ""Respiratory quinolones"" such as levofloxacin, having greater activity against this pathogen, are recommended as first line agents for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in patients with important co-morbidities and in patients requiring hospitalization (Infectious Diseases Society of America 2007). Similarly, ciprofloxacin is not recommended as a first-line treatment for acute sinusitis. Ciprofloxacin is approved for the treatment of gonorrhea in many countries, but this recommendation is widely regarded as obsolete due to resistance development. === Pregnancy === An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy concluded therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data=fair), but the data are insufficient to state no risk exists. Exposure to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight. Two small post-marketing epidemiology studies of mostly short-term, first-trimester exposure found that fluoroquinolones did not increase risk of major malformations, spontaneous abortions, premature birth, or low birth weight. === Breastfeeding === Fluoroquinolones have been reported as present in a mother's milk and thus passed on to the nursing child. === Children === Oral and intravenous ciprofloxacin are approved by the FDA for use in children for only two indications due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system: Inhalational anthrax (postexposure) Complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli, but never as first-line agents. === Spectrum of activity === Its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonias, bronchitis, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis. Ciprofloxacin is particularly effective against Gram-negative bacteria (such as Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but is less effective against Gram-positive bacteria (such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis) than newer fluoroquinolones. === Bacterial resistance === As a result of its widespread use to treat minor infections readily treatable with older, narrower-spectrum antibiotics, many bacteria have developed resistance to this drug, leaving it significantly less effective than it would have been otherwise. Resistance to ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. Numerous pathogens, including enterococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (quinolone-resistant) now exhibit resistance. Widespread veterinary usage of fluoroquinolones, particularly in Europe, has been implicated. Meanwhile, some Burkholderia cepacia, Clostridium innocuum, and Enterococcus faecium strains have developed resistance to ciprofloxacin to varying degrees. Fluoroquinolones had become the class of antibiotics most commonly prescribed to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of those prescriptions in the US were for conditions not approved by the FDA, such as acute bronchitis, otitis media, and acute upper respiratory tract infection. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Taking tizanidine at the same time Use by those who are hypersensitive to any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents Use by those who are diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, as muscle weakness may be exacerbated Ciprofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated in children (except for the indications outlined above), in pregnancy, to nursing mothers, and in people with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. Caution may be required in people with Marfan syndrome or Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and the central nervous system. Rates of adverse effects appear to be higher than with some groups of antibiotics such as cephalosporins but lower than with others such as clindamycin. Compared to other antibiotics some studies find a higher rate of adverse effects while others find no difference. In clinical trials most of the adverse events were described as mild or moderate in severity, abated soon after the drug was discontinued, and required no treatment. Some adverse effects may be permanent. Ciprofloxacin was stopped because of an adverse event in 1% of people treated with the medication by mouth. The most frequently reported drug-related events, from trials of all formulations, all dosages, all drug-therapy durations, and for all indications, were nausea (2.5%), diarrhea (1.6%), abnormal liver function tests (1.3%), vomiting (1%), and rash (1%). Other adverse events occurred at rates of <1%. === Tendon problems === Ciprofloxacin includes a boxed warning in the United States due to an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture, especially in people who are older than 60 years, people who also use corticosteroids, and people with kidney, lung, or heart transplants. Tendon rupture can occur during therapy or even months after discontinuation of the medication. One study found that fluoroquinolone use was associated with a 1.9-fold increase in tendon problems. The risk increased to 3.2 in those over 60 years of age and to 6.2 in those over the age of 60 who were also taking corticosteroids. Among the 46,766 quinolone users in the study, 38 (0.08%) cases of Achilles tendon rupture were identified. === Cardiac arrhythmia === The fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of cardiac toxicity, including QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death. === Nervous system === Because Ciprofloxacin is lipophilic, it has the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. The 2013 FDA label warns of nervous system effects. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold, and may cause other central nervous system adverse effects. Headache, dizziness, and insomnia have been reported as occurring fairly commonly in postapproval review articles, along with a much lower incidence of serious CNS adverse effects such as tremors, psychosis, anxiety, hallucinations, paranoia, and suicide attempts, especially at higher doses. Like other fluoroquinolones, it is also known to cause peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible, such as weakness, burning pain, tingling or numbness. Fluoroquinolones have already been reported for movement disorders. In this context, ciprofloxacin is especially associated with myoclonus, which derives the term ""ciproclonus."" === Cancer === Ciprofloxacin is active in six of eight in vitro assays used as rapid screens for the detection of genotoxic effects, but is not active in in vivo assays of genotoxicity. Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice resulted in no carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects due to ciprofloxacin at daily oral dose levels up to 250 and 750 mg/kg to rats and mice, respectively (about 1.7 and 2.5 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m2). Results from photo co-carcinogenicity testing indicate ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV-induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control. === Other === The other black box warning is that ciprofloxacin should not be used in people with myasthenia gravis due to possible exacerbation of muscle weakness which may lead to breathing problems resulting in death or ventilator support. Fluoroquinolones are known to block neuromuscular transmission. There are concerns that fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin can affect cartilage in young children. Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea is a serious adverse effect of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones; it is unclear whether the risk is higher than with other broad-spectrum antibiotics. A wide range of rare but potentially fatal adverse effects reported to the US FDA or the subject of case reports includes aortic dissection, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, low blood pressure, allergic pneumonitis, bone marrow suppression, hepatitis or liver failure, and sensitivity to light. The medication should be discontinued if a rash, jaundice, or other sign of hypersensitivity occurs. Children and the elderly are at a much greater risk of experiencing adverse reactions. == Overdose == Overdose of ciprofloxacin may result in reversible renal toxicity. Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach by induced vomiting or gastric lavage, as well as administration of antacids containing magnesium, aluminium, or calcium to reduce drug absorption. Renal function and urinary pH should be monitored. Important support includes adequate hydration and urine acidification if necessary to prevent crystalluria. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can only remove less than 10% of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin may be quantified in plasma or serum to monitor for drug accumulation in patients with hepatic dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims. == Interactions == Ciprofloxacin interacts with certain foods and several other drugs leading to undesirable increases or decreases in the serum levels or distribution of one or both drugs. Ciprofloxacin should not be taken with antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, highly buffered drugs (sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate, sucralfate, didanosine), or with supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc. It should be taken two hours before or six hours after these products. Magnesium or aluminum antacids turn ciprofloxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the intestinal tract, reducing peak serum concentrations by 90% or more, leading to therapeutic failure. Additionally, it should not be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices alone, as peak serum concentration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve can be reduced up to 40%. However, ciprofloxacin may be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices as part of a meal. Ciprofloxacin inhibits the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2 and thereby can reduce the clearance of drugs metabolized by that enzyme. CYP1A2 substrates that exhibit increased serum levels in ciprofloxacin-treated patients include tizanidine, theophylline, caffeine, methylxanthines, clozapine, olanzapine, and ropinirole. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with the CYP1A2 substrate tizanidine (Zanaflex) is contraindicated due to a 583% increase in the peak serum concentrations of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin as compared to administration of tizanidine alone. Use of ciprofloxacin is cautioned in patients on theophylline due to its narrow therapeutic index. The authors of one review recommended that patients being treated with ciprofloxacin reduce their caffeine intake. Evidence for significant interactions with several other CYP1A2 substrates such as cyclosporine is equivocal or conflicting. The Committee on Safety of Medicines and the FDA warn that central nervous system adverse effects, including seizure risk, may be increased when NSAIDs are combined with quinolones. The mechanism for this interaction may involve a synergistic increased antagonism of GABA neurotransmission. Altered serum levels of the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine (increased and decreased) have been reported in patients receiving concomitant ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. == Mechanism of action == Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone class. It is active against some Gram-positive and many Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting a type II topoisomerase (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. Bacterial DNA fragmentation will occur as a result of inhibition of the enzymes. == Pharmacokinetics == Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous administration. When administered over one hour as an intravenous infusion, ciprofloxacin rapidly distributes into the tissues, with levels in some tissues exceeding those in the serum. Penetration into the central nervous system is relatively modest, with cerebrospinal fluid levels normally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. The serum half-life of ciprofloxacin is about 4–6 hours, with 50–70% of an administered dose being excreted in the urine as unmetabolized drug. An additional 10% is excreted in urine as metabolites. Urinary excretion is virtually complete 24 hours after administration. Dose adjustment is required in the elderly and in those with renal impairment. Ciprofloxacin is weakly bound to serum proteins (20–40%). It is an inhibitor of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2, which leads to the potential for clinically important drug interactions with drugs metabolized by that enzyme. Ciprofloxacin is about 70% available when administered orally. The extended release tablets allow once-daily administration by releasing the drug more slowly in the gastrointestinal tract. These tablets contain 35% of the administered dose in an immediate-release form and 65% in a slow-release matrix. Maximum serum concentrations are achieved between 1 and 4 hours after administration. Compared to the 250- and 500-mg immediate-release tablets, the 500-mg and 1000-mg XR tablets provide higher Cmax, but the 24‑hour AUCs are equivalent. Ciprofloxacin immediate-release tablets contain ciprofloxacin as the hydrochloride salt, and the XR tablets contain a mixture of the hydrochloride salt and the free base. == Chemical properties == Ciprofloxacin is 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid. Its empirical formula is C17H18FN3O3 and its molecular weight is 331.4 g/mol. It is a faintly yellowish to light yellow crystalline substance. Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (USP) is the monohydrochloride monohydrate salt of ciprofloxacin. It is a faintly yellowish to light yellow crystalline substance with a molecular weight of 385.8 g/mol. Its empirical formula is C17H18FN3O3HCl•H2O. == Usage == Ciprofloxacin is the most widely used of the second-generation quinolones. In 2010, over 20 million prescriptions were written, making it the 35th-most-commonly prescribed generic drug and the 5th-most-commonly prescribed antibacterial in the US. == History == The first members of the quinolone antibacterial class were relatively low-potency drugs such as nalidixic acid, used mainly in the treatment of urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine. In 1979, the publication of a patent filed by the pharmaceutical arm of Kyorin Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha disclosed the discovery of norfloxacin, and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency. In the aftermath of this disclosure, several other pharmaceutical companies initiated research and development programs with the goal of discovering additional antibacterial agents of the fluoroquinolone class. The fluoroquinolone program at Bayer focused on examining the effects of very minor changes to the norfloxacin structure. In 1983, the company published in vitro potency data for ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial having a chemical structure differing from that of norfloxacin by the presence of a single carbon atom. This small change led to a two- to 10-fold increase in potency against most strains of Gram-negative bacteria. Importantly, this structural change led to a four-fold improvement in activity against the important Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making ciprofloxacin one of the most potent known drugs for the treatment of this intrinsically antibiotic-resistant pathogen. The oral tablet form of ciprofloxacin was approved in October 1987, just one year after the approval of norfloxacin. In 1991, the intravenous formulation was introduced. Ciprofloxacin sales reached a peak of about 2 billion euros in 2001, before Bayer's patent expired in 2004, after which annual sales have averaged around €200 million. The name probably originates from the International Scientific Nomenclature: ci- (alteration of cycl-) + propyl + fluor- + ox- + az- + -mycin. == Society and culture == === Economics === It is available as a generic medication and not very expensive. === Generic equivalents === In October 2001, the Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) project filed suit to dissolve an agreement between Bayer and three of its competitors which produced generic versions of drugs (Barr Laboratories, Rugby Laboratories, and Hoechst-Marion-Roussel) that PAL claimed was blocking access to adequate supplies and cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin. The plaintiffs charged that Bayer Corporation, a unit of Bayer AG, had unlawfully paid the three competing companies a total of $200 million to prevent cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin from being brought to the market, as well as manipulating its price and supply. Numerous other consumer advocacy groups joined the lawsuit. On 15 October 2008, five years after Bayer's patent had expired, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted Bayer's and the other defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that any anticompetitive effects caused by the settlement agreements between Bayer and its codefendants were within the exclusionary zone of the patent and thus could not be redressed by federal antitrust law, in effect upholding Bayer's agreement with its competitors. === Available forms === Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate-release tablets, as extended-release tablets, as an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous infusion. It is available for local administration as eye drops and ear drops. It is available in combination with dexamethasone, with celecoxib, with hydrocortisone, and with fluocinolone acetonide. === Litigation === A class action was filed against Bayer AG on behalf of employees of the Brentwood Post Office in Washington, D.C., and workers at the U.S. Capitol, along with employees of American Media, Inc. in Florida and postal workers in general who alleged they developed serious adverse effects from taking ciprofloxacin in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in 2001. The action alleged Bayer failed to warn class members of the potential side effects of the drug, thereby violating the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Laws. The class action was defeated and the litigation abandoned by the plaintiffs. A similar action was filed in 2003 in New Jersey by four New Jersey postal workers but was withdrawn for lack of grounds, as workers had been informed of the risks of ciprofloxacin when they were given the option of taking the drug. == Research == As resistance to ciprofloxacin has grown since its introduction, research has been conducted to discover and develop analogs that can be effective against resistant bacteria; some have been looked at in antiviral models as well. == References == == External links == ""Ciprofloxacin Ophthalmic"".

PF-562271 is a classic FAK inhibitor that has shown promising preclinical data and has been found to exhibit an anti-migration effect on some cancer cells. However, its anticancer effect on high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) has not been reported. In this study, we evaluated the anti-migration and anti-proliferation effects of PF-562271 against HGSOC SKOV3 and A2780 cells, as well as the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that FAK was overexpressed in clinical HGSOC tissues and was positively correlated with the pathological progression of HGSOC. Moreover, HGSOC patients with high FAK expression levels exhibited low survival rates. PF-562271 treatment significantly inhibited the cell adhesion and migration of SKOV3 and A2780 cells by inhibiting p-FAK expression and decreasing the FA surface area. Additionally, PF-562271 treatment inhibited colony formation and induced cell senescence through G1 phase cell cycle arrest mediated DNA replication inhibition. Taken together, the findings demonstrated that FAK inhibitor PF-562271 significantly inhibits HGSOC cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation process through FAK and/or FAK mediated cell cycle arrest, and suggested that PF-562271 could serve as a potential oncotherapeutic agent for HGSOC targeting treatment. The development of resistance to temozolomide (TMZ), a standard chemotherapeutic, limits the effective treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) regulate proliferation and invasion of GBM cells. We found that TMZ activates FAK and Pyk2 signaling in GBM. We hypothesized that pharmacological inhibitors of Pyk2/FAK together with TMZ can enhance the inhibitory effect of TMZ on tumor growth and dispersal and improve the treatment outcome. Primary human GBM cell cultures and a C57Bl/6-GL261 mouse glioma implantation model were used. Pyk2 (Tyr579/580) and FAK (Tyr925) phosphorylation was analyzed by western blotting. Viability, cell cycle, migration, invasion and invadopodia formation were investigated in vitro. Animal survival, tumor size and invasion, TUNEL apoptotic cell death and the Ki67 proliferation index were evaluated in vivo upon treatment with TMZ (50 mg/kg, once/day, orally) and the Pyk2/FAK inhibitor PF-562271 (once/daily, 50 mg/kg, orally) vs. TMZ monotherapy. In vitro studies revealed significantly reduced viability, cell cycle progression, invasion and invadopodia with TMZ (100 µM) + PF-562271 (16 nM) compared with TMZ alone. In vivo studies demonstrated that combinatorial treatment led to prominent reductions in tumor size and invasive margins, extensive signs of apoptosis and a reduced proliferation index, together with a 15% increase in the survival rate in animals, compared with TMZ monotherapy. TMZ + PF-562271 eliminates TMZ-related Pyk2/FAK activation in GBM and improves the treatment efficacy. To investigate the protective effect of PF-562271, a FAK inhibitor, against aging platelet-induced injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cultured HUVECs were treated with vehicle, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS+aging platelets, or LPS+aging platelets+PF-562271. The changes in protein expressions of FAK, pFAK and PECAM-1 in the treated cells were detected using Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay, and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected with flow cytometry. The changes of barrier function of the cells were assessed with cell permeability test and transendothelial cell resistance test. RT-qPCR was used to analyze mRNA expressions of inflammatory factors, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the culture supernatants was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunofluorescence assay was used to examine the effect of the ROS inhibitor vitamin C on PECAM-1 expression in the cells with different treatments. Treatment of HUVECs with LPS and aging platelets significantly increased cellular protein expressions of FAK, pFAK and PECAM-1, which were effectively lowered by addition of PF-562271 ( The FAK inhibitor PF-562271 alleviates endothelial cell damage induced by LPS and aging platelets by lowering cellular oxidative stress levels and reducing inflammatory responses. 探究FAK抑制剂对老化血小板诱导的人脐静脉内皮细胞（HUVEC）损伤的保护作用。 实验分为空白对照组、脂多糖（LPS）组、造模组（LPS+Plt）和FAK抑制剂PF-562271组（LPS+Plt+PF-562271）。通过Western blot和免疫荧光检测FAK、pFAK和PECAM-1的蛋白表达。流式细胞术检测HUVEC活性氧（ROS）含量。细胞通透性和跨内皮细胞电阻实验，检测HUVEC屏障功能的变化。RT-qPCR检测炎性因子mRNA表达，酶联免疫吸附测定法（ELISA）检测细胞上清液中，炎性因子的分泌情况。免疫荧光检测加入ROS抑制剂维生素C（Vit.C）后，PECAM-1的表达。 脂多糖和老化血小板处理后，FAK、pFAK和PECAM-1的蛋白表达增高，加入PF-562271后，FAK、pFAK和PECAM-1的蛋白表达降低（ FAK抑制剂PF-562271可通过改善氧化应激水平和降低炎症反应，缓解脂多糖和老化血小板诱导的内皮细胞损伤。",Pf 562271,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.009334729053080082), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.048614468425512314)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.018150296062231064)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18339875/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37382687/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21903606/,https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/e6d05b3c5da74b02967839d31265deb6 ', [])"
568,"('Tin-protoporphyrin ix', 'Snppix', 'Sn(iv) protoporphyrin ix dichloride')",Medical," To investigate the effect of heme, cobalt-protoporphyrin IX and tin-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX and SnPPIX), macrocyclic structures composed by a tetrapyrrole ring with a central metallic ion, on Dengue Virus (DENV) and Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) infection. Treatment of HepG2 cells with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX after DENV infection reduced infectious particles without affecting viral RNA contents in infected cells. The reduction of viral load occurs only with the direct contact of DENV with porphyrins, suggesting a direct effect on viral particles. Previously incubation of DENV and YFV with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX resulted in viral particles inactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Biliverdin, a noncyclical porphyrin, was unable to inactivate the viruses tested. Infection of HepG2 cells with porphyrin-pretreated DENV2 results in a reduced or abolished viral protein synthesis, RNA replication and cell death. Treatment of HepG2 or THP-1 cell lineage with heme or CoPPIX after DENV infection with a very low MOI resulted in a decreased DENV replication and protection from death. Heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX possess a marked ability to inactivate DENV and YFV, impairing its ability to infect and induce cytopathic effects on target cells. These results open the possibility of therapeutic application of porphyrins or their use as models to design new antiviral drugs against DENV and YFV. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is induced as a unique stress response and leads to a transient resistance against oxidative damage, including ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. In the present study, we examined whether HO-1 induction may confer a protection against I/R injury in the rat kidney. Lewis rats were divided into four groups as follows: (1) vehicle group; (2) group treated with ferri-protoporphyrin IX (hemin), an inducer of HO; (3) group treated with low-dose tin-protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), an inhibitor of HO; and (4) group treated with high-dose SnPP. Renal warm ischemia for 60 minutes was performed 24 hours after each treatment. At 24 hours after treatment, hemin induced a significant increase in renal HO activity, but failed to induce HO-1 protein synthesis. Although both low- and high-dose SnPP reduced HO activity, a marked HO-1 expression was observed only in the high-dose SnPP-treated kidney. Hemin exacerbated the renal function after reperfusion, while high-dose SnPP significantly suppressed the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression, the infiltration of ED-1-positive macrophages and the expression of activated caspase-3, which resulted in attenuation of apoptotic cell death and ameliorated I/R injury. These results suggest that prior induction of HO-1 protein by high-dose SnPP may lead to anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects on warm renal I/R injury independently of its enzyme activity, and that HO enzyme activation may not always act as an antioxidant, especially under I/R-induced oxidative stress. We have studied the influence of ovariectomy on the inflammatory response and bone metabolism on CIA as a model of postmenopausal arthritis as well as the effects of tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), a heme oxygenase inhibitor. Ovariectomy in non-arthritic mice produced increased serum PGD2 levels and up-regulated the expression of COX-2, h-PGDS, l-PGDS, and HO-1 in the joints. In CIA, ovariectomy potentiated the inflammatory response with higher levels of serum IL-6 and MMP-3, local PGD2 and MMP-3 as well as trabecular bone erosion. In OVX-CIA, SnPP decreased the serum levels of IL-6, MMP-3, and PGD2; down-regulated TNFα, COX-2, hPGDS, PGD2, PGE2, and MMP-3 in joint tissues; and also decreased focal bone loss in the inflamed joint. Ovariectomy up-regulates inflammatory mediators in non-arthritic and in arthritic animals.

It was hoped that vanoxerine would be of similar use in treating cocaine addiction. Research also indicates that vanoxerine may have additional mechanisms of action including antagonist action at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and it has also been shown to reduce the consumption of alcohol in animal models of alcohol use disorder. Vanoxerine has been through human trials up to Phase II, but development was stopped due to observed QTc effects in the context of cocaine use. However, vanoxerine analogs continue to be studied as treatments for cocaine addiction. As an example, GBR compounds are piperazine based and contain a proximal and a distal nitrogen. It was found that piperidine analogs are still fully active DRIs, although they do not have any affinity for the ""piperazine binding site"" unlike the GBR compounds. Further SAR revealed that while there are 4 atoms connecting the two fluorophenyl rings to the piperazine, the ether in the chain could be omitted in exchange for a tertiary nitrogen. Vanoxerine, a blocker of the dopamine carrier devoid of action on the noradrenaline carrier, while greatly increasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, is ineffective in raising extracellular dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. === Antiarrhythmic === Vanoxerine is a potentially effective treatment for abnormal heart rhythms. A significant cause of abnormal heart rhythms is reentry, an electrophysiologic event in which the proliferating signal refuses to terminate, and endures to preexcite the heart after the refractory period. It is likely that vanoxerine acts to prevent reentrant circuits. Vanoxerine terminates atrial flutters and atrial fibrillations (both cardiac abnormal heart rhythms) by blocking the recirculating electrical signal, and preventing the reformation of the reentrant circuit. Vanoxerine has also shown a tendency to reduce the recurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, as it was exceedingly difficult to reproduce an atrial flutter or fibrillation in a subject that had been taking vanoxerine. Experiments have successfully been performed on cell cultures, canine hosts and testing has moved towards human trials. In clinical human trials with increasing dosages, vanoxerine has shown to have a highly favourable therapeutic index, showing no side effects at concentrations much higher than the therapeutic dose. In canines, the effective therapeutic dose was between 76 ng/ml and 99 ng/ml, however the drug reached plasma concentrations of 550 ng/ml without harmful side effects, presenting a desirable therapeutic index. One of the major benefits of vanoxerine is that it does not appear to cause the same harmful side effects as its most comparable contender, amiodarone. === Miscellaneous === Vanoxerine has paradoxically been found to potentiate the behavioral effects of methamphetamine in rodents. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Vanoxerine is a potent and selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). Vanoxerine binds to the target site on the dopamine transporter (DAT) ~ 50 times more strongly than cocaine, but simultaneously inhibits the release of dopamine. This combined effect only slightly elevates dopamine levels, giving vanoxerine only mild stimulant effects. Vanoxerine has also been observed to be a potent blocker of the cardiac hERG repolarizing potassium channel (IKr) which has implicated Vanoxerine in having cardiotoxicity concerns. Vanoxerine also binds with nanomolar affinity to the serotonin transporter. At a cellular level, vanoxerine acts to block cardiac ion channels. Vanoxerine is a multichannel blocker, acting on IKr (potassium), L-type calcium and sodium ion channels. By blocking these specific channels, there is a prolongation of the action potential of the cell, preventing reactivation by a reentrant circuit. The block is strongly frequency dependant: as the pacing of the heart increases so does the frequency of ion channel blocking by vanoxerine. == Society and culture == === History === Vanoxerine is a drug that was in the midst of recruiting participants for a phase III human clinical trial for its use as a cardiac antiarrhythmic when safety concerns arose. It had passed phase IIb human trials without any concerns but the company, Laguna Pharmaceuticals, found safety issues which prompted them to shut down their company and the $30 million effort to produce a new heart medication. It was previously indicated as a treatment for Parkinson's disease and depression; however, it had no significant benefit with these diseases. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === Vanoxerine is a piperazine with two different alkyl sidechains attached. Its synthesis uses a tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group (Boc group) to mask the reactivity of one of its nitrogen atoms while the other is alkylated. Reaction of 1-Boc-piperazine (1) and (3-bromopropyl)benzene (2) gives (3) which, after removal of the Boc group using acid gives 1-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine (4). Separately, a Grignard reaction using two equivalents of 4-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide (5) with ethyl formate (6) results in the formation of bis(4-fluorophenyl)methanol (7). Ether formation with 2-chloroethanol (8) in the presence of phosphoric acid gives the second alkylation partner (9). This is combined with (4) in a convergent synthesis to yield vanoxerine. == See also == DBL-583, a derivative of vanoxerine with longer duration of action == References ==",Vanoxerine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.505351095460355e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.83428253675811e-05), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008624449372291565)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanoxerine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Vanoxerine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanoxerine?utm_source=openai')])"

In the context of consequences and treatment of metabolic disorders, including hepatic steatosis, it is imperative to gain knowledge about the regulation of the human ADFP gene. The nuclear receptor liver-X-receptor (LXR) is a key regulator of hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as well as a potential drug target. Here, we report that two synthetic LXR ligands differently regulate human ADFP expression. The partial LXR agonist 3-[3-[[[2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl](2,2- diphenylethyl)amino]propoxy]benzeneacetic acid hydrochloride (GW3965) significantly induces ADFP expression in human primary hepatocytes, whereas the full agonist N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-N-[4-[2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxy-1(trifluoromethyl)ethyl]phenyl] benzenesulfonamide (T0901317) does not. Bioinformatics analysis revealed several potential LXR response elements (LXREs) in the human ADFP gene. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays, we show that LXR, upon stimulation with GW3965, directly regulates human ADFP transcription by binding to LXREs located in the 3'-untranslated and the 5'-flanking regions. The ligand-stimulated LXR recruitment was associated with recruitment of RNA polymerase II and the coactivators cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300 to the promoter region demonstrating that the identified LXREs are functional and able to induce transcription. Moreover, our results show that sequence identity of the hexamer repeats in DR4 elements is not sufficient to determine whether the element binds LXR or not. The partial agonist GW3965 specifically regulates ADFP gene transcription, and our data prove that the two synthetic LXR agonists, commonly used in experimental research, can differentially regulate gene expression. This has implications for pharmaceutical targeting of LXR.","Benzeneacetic acid, 3-(3-(((2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)methyl)(2,2-diphenylethyl)amino)propoxy)-",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.16329534351825714), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.07891082763671875), (' INDUSTR', -5.796184723294573e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.23264643549919128), ('ICAL', -5.245195097813848e-06), (',', -0.3869246244430542), ('ĠINDU', -0.025006437674164772), ('ST', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('RI', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0008188708452507854)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0252991?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=6, title='Human Metabolome Database: Showing metabocard for 3-(3-(N-(2-Chloro-3-trifluoromethylbenzyl)(2,2-diphenylethyl)amino)propoxy)phenylacetic acid (HMDB0252991)', type='url_citation', url='https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0252991?utm_source=openai')])"

Daridorexant is taken by mouth. Side effects of daridorexant include headache, somnolence, and fatigue. The medication is a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA). It acts as a selective dual antagonist of the orexin receptors OX1 and OX2. Compared to other marketed OX antagonists, daridorexant has a relatively short elimination half-life of 8 hours and a time to peak of about 1 to 2 hours. It is not a benzodiazepine or Z-drug and does not interact with GABA receptors, instead having a distinct mechanism of action. Daridorexant was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2022 and became available in May 2022. It was approved in the European Union in April 2022, and is the first orexin receptor antagonist to become available in European Union. The medication is a schedule IV controlled substance in the United States and may have a modest potential for misuse. Besides daridorexant, other orexin receptor antagonists, like suvorexant and lemborexant, have also been introduced. == Medical uses == Daridorexant is indicated for the treatment of adults with insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. The medication has been found to significantly improve latency to persistent sleep (LPS), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and subjective total sleep time (TST) in regulatory clinical trials. At doses of 25 to 50 mg and in terms of treatment–placebo difference, it reduces LPS by 6 to 12 minutes, reduces WASO by 10 to 23 minutes, and increases subjective TST by 10 to 22 minutes. Daridorexant has also been found to improve daytime functioning at a dose of 50 mg but not at 25 mg. Network meta-analyses have assessed the sleep-promoting effects of orexin receptor antagonists and have compared them between one another as well as to other sleep aids including benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, antihistamines, sedative antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, doxepin, amitriptyline, mirtazapine), and melatonin receptor agonists. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of insomnia medications published in 2022 found that daridorexant had an effect size (standardized mean difference (SMD)) against placebo for treatment of insomnia at 4 weeks of 0.23 (95% CITooltip confidence interval –0.01 to 0.48). This was similar to but numerically lower than the effect sizes at 4 weeks for suvorexant (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62) and lemborexant (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.63). Benzodiazepines and Z-drugs generally showed larger effect sizes than orexin receptor antagonists (e.g., SMDs of 0.45 to 0.83). The review concluded on the basis of daridorexant's small effect size that it did not show an overall material benefit in the treatment of insomnia. Conversely, it concluded that lemborexant—as well as the Z-drug eszopiclone—had the best profiles overall in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability among all of the assessed insomnia medications. Orexin receptor antagonists are not used as first-line treatments for insomnia due to their costs and concerns about possible misuse liability. Population pharmacokinetic modeling indicates that differences between subjects do not require dose adjustments, and that lean body weight and fat mass effect the pharmacokinetics of daridorexant better than other body size descriptors. Treatment with daridorexant is generally safe and well tolerated for up to one year, with improvements in sleep and daytime functioning persisting throughout treatment. The Department of Defense (DOD) is testing the effectiveness of daridorexant in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as the link between insomnia and PTSD is well established. === Available forms === In the United States and Canada, daridorexant is available in the form of 25 and 50 mg oral tablets. It is provided as the salt daridorexant hydrochloride, with each tablet containing 27 or 54 mg of this substance (equivalent to 25 or 50 mg daridorexant). == Contraindications == Daridorexant is contraindicated in people with narcolepsy. It is not recommended in people with severe hepatic impairment, whereas a lower maximum dose is recommended in people with moderate hepatic impairment. Concomitant use of daridorexant with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and moderate to strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended and should be avoided due to unfavorable modification of daridorexant exposure. == Side effects == Side effects of daridorexant include headache (6% at 25 mg vs. 7% at 50 mg vs. 5% for placebo), somnolence or fatigue (includes somnolence, sedation, fatigue, hypersomnia, and lethargy) (6% at 25 mg vs. 5% at 50 mg vs. 4% for placebo), dizziness (2% at 25 mg vs. 3% at 50 mg vs. 2% for placebo), and nausea (0% at 25 mg vs. 3% at 50 mg vs. 2% for placebo). No residual effects have been found after administration of 25 mg daridorexant in the evening to either young or elderly individuals. However, daridorexant may cause next-morning driving impairment at the start of treatment or in some individuals. Orexin receptor antagonists like daridorexant may have less or no propensity for causing tolerance compared to other sedatives and hypnotics based on animal studies. Daridorexant did not produce signs of withdrawal or dependence upon discontinuation in animal studies and clinical trials, and orexin receptor antagonists are not associated with rebound insomnia. Loss of sleep-promoting effectiveness occurs rapidly upon discontinuation of daridorexant. Preclinical research has suggested that orexin antagonists may reduce appetite, but daridorexant and other orexin antagonists have not been associated with weight loss in clinical trials. Daridorexant may have a small risk of suicidal ideation. Orexin receptor antagonists can affect the reward system and produce drug-liking responses in humans. Daridorexant at a dose of 50 mg (the maximum recommended dose) showed significantly greater drug liking than placebo but significantly less drug liking than zolpidem (30 mg) and suvorexant (150 mg) in recreational sedative drug users. At higher doses of 100 and 150 mg (greater than the recommended maximum dose), drug liking with daridorexant was similar to that with zolpidem (30 mg) and suvorexant (150 mg). In other studies, suvorexant showed similar drug liking compared to zolpidem but lower misuse potential on other measures (e.g., overall rate of misuse potential adverse events of 58% for zolpidem and 31% for suvorexant in recreational drug users). No reports indicative of misuse liability were observed in clinical trials with daridorexant, although these studies excluded participants with history of drug or alcohol misuse. == Overdose == There is limited clinical experience with overdose of daridorexant. Overdose of the medication at a dose of up to four times the maximum recommended dose may result in adverse effects including somnolence, muscle weakness, cataplexy-like symptoms, sleep paralysis, attention disturbances, fatigue, headache, and constipation. There is no specific antidote to overdose of daridorexant. == Interactions == CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers can increase and decrease exposure to daridorexant, respectively. The weak CYP3A4 inhibitor ranitidine (150 mg) is predicted to increase overall exposure to daridorexant by 1.5-fold; the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor diltiazem (240 mg) increased exposure to daridorexant by 2.4-fold; and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole, on the basis of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling, would be expected to increase daridorexant exposure by more than 4-fold. Conversely, the moderate CYP3A4 inducer efavirenz (600 mg) decreased daridorexant overall exposure by 35 to 60% and the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin similarly decreased daridorexant exposure by more than 50%. Concomitant use of daridorexant with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided, while it is recommended that the maximum dose of daridorexant be reduced with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Examples of important CYP3A4 modulators which are expected to interact with daridorexant include the strong CYP3A4 inhibitors boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, and telithromycin (concomitant use not recommended); the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, dronedarone, erythromycin, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, imatinib, and verapamil (lower doses of daridorexant recommended); and the strong CYP3A4 inducers apalutamide, carbamazepine, efavirenz, enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John's wort (expected to decrease daridorexant effectiveness). Gastric pH modifiers like famotidine can decrease peak levels of daridorexant without affecting total exposure. Alcohol and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram have not shown significant pharmacokinetic interactions with daridorexant. Coadministration of daridorexant with other sedatives like benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and alcohol may increase the risk of central nervous system depression and daytime impairment. Daridorexant has not been found to significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of other drugs including midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate), rosuvastatin (a BCRP substrate), and the SSRI citalopram (primarily a CYP2C19 substrate). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Daridorexant acts as a selective dual antagonist of the orexin (hypocretin) receptors OX1 and OX2. The affinities (Ki) of daridorexant for the orexin receptors are 0.47 nM for the OX1 receptor and 0.93 nM for the OX2 receptor. Its Kb values for the human orexin receptors have been reported to be 0.5 nM for the OX1 receptor and 0.8 nM for the OX2 receptor. Hence, daridorexant is approximately equipotent in its antagonism of the orexin receptors. Daridorexant is selective for the orexin receptors over many other targets. In contrast to certain other sedatives and hypnotics, daridorexant is not a benzodiazepine or Z-drug and does not interact with GABA receptors. ==== Mechanism of action ==== The endogenous orexin neuropeptides, orexin A and orexin B, are involved in the regulation of sleep–wake cycles and act to promote wakefulness. Deficiency of orexin signaling is thought to be the primary cause of the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Disturbances in orexin signaling may also be involved in insomnia. Research suggests that orexin signaling may change with age, and this has been implicated in age-related sleep disturbances. By blocking the actions of orexins and modulating sleep–wake cycles, orexin receptor antagonists like daridorexant reduce wakefulness and improve sleep. The sleep-promoting effects of dual orexin receptor antagonists are thought to be mediated specifically by blockade of the OX2 receptor in the lateral hypothalamus. Although narcoleptic symptoms were a theoretical concern during the development of orexin receptor antagonists, this has not been observed in clinical trials of these agents. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The absolute bioavailability of daridorexant is 62%. The poor aqueous solubility of daridorexant limits its bioavailability. It reaches peak concentrations within 1 to 2 hours following a dose. Food prolonged the time to peak by 1.3 to 2 hours and decreased the peak concentrations by 16 to 24%, but did not affect area-under-the-curve concentrations. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of daridorexant is 31 L. Its plasma protein binding is 99.7%. The plasma-to-blood ratio of daridorexant is 0.64. Daridorexant is a lipophilic molecule and effectively crosses the blood–brain barrier in animals. ==== Metabolism ==== Daridorexant is extensively metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 (89%). Other cytochrome P450 enzymes contribute individually to less than 3% of the clearance of daridorexant. Daridorexant has 77 identified metabolites. Its major metabolites are less active than daridorexant as orexin receptor antagonists. Recently, a study was carried out using human liver microsomes reported that daridorexant underwent 3 reaction; hydroxylation at the methyl group of the benzimidazole moiety, oxidative O-demethylation of the anisole to the corresponding phenol, and hydroxylation to a 4-hydroxy piperidinol derivative. Researchers proved that the chemical structures of the benzylic alcohol and the phenol are products of standard CYP450 reactions; while the latter hydroxylation product was incompatible with the initially postulated hydroxylation of the pyrrolidine ring, hence they suggested that human monooxygenase CYP3A4 catalyzes the intramolecular rearrangement of daridorexant. In detail, they proposed the following mechanism, hydroxylation in 5-position of the pyrrolidine ring initially will yield a cyclic hemiaminal which subsequently will hydrolyze to a ring-open amino aldehyde. Afterwards, cyclization of the latter onto one of the nitrogen atoms of the benzimidazole moiety will yield the final 4-hydroxy piperidinol metabolite. ==== Elimination ==== Daridorexant is eliminated primarily by feces (57%) then by urine (28%). It is excreted mainly in the form of metabolites, with only trace amounts of the parent compound identified. The medication has an elimination half-life of about 8 hours or of 6 to 10 hours. The half-life of daridorexant may be longer in elderly individuals compared to young adults (9–10 hours in the elderly versus 6 hours in young adults). Its half-life is shorter than that of other orexin receptor antagonists such as suvorexant (12 hours) and lemborexant (~18–55 hours). The relatively short half-life of daridorexant may allow for reduced daytime sedation. The duration of action of daridorexant in terms of sedative effects is approximately 8 hours with a 50 mg dose. == Chemistry == Daridorexant is a small-molecule compound. The chemical name of daridorexant is (S)-(2-(5-chloro-4-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyrrolidin-1-yl)(5-methoxy-2-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)phenyl)methanone. Its molecular formula is C23H23N6O2Cl and its molecular weight is 450.93 g/mol (or 487.38 g/mol for the hydrochloride). Daridorexant hydrochloride is a white to light yellowish powder. Daridorexant is a lipophilic compound and daridorexant hydrochloride is very slightly soluble in water. == History == Daridorexant was originated by Actelion Pharmaceuticals and was further developed by Idorsia. It was patented in 2013 and was first described in the scientific literature in 2017. It was in development for 25 years by the husband-wife team Jean-Paul and Martine Clozel. Daridorexant was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2022 and became available in May 2022. On 24 February 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Quviviq, intended for the treatment of insomnia. On 29 April 2022, daridorexant was authorized for use in the European Union. It was the first orexin receptor antagonist to become available for use in the European Union. (The earlier orexin receptor antagonists suvorexant and lemborexant are not available in the European Union.) Regulatory review is also ongoing in Canada and Switzerland and is planned for the United Kingdom. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Daridorexant is a schedule IV controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States. Daridorexant (Quviviq) was approved for medical use in the European Union in April 2022.

The pills may also cause mood or personality changes. The inhaled form is generally regarded as safe in pregnancy. Occasionally, it may cause a cough upon inhalation. Deposition on the tongue and throat may promote oral candidiasis, which appears as a white coating, possibly with irritation. This may usually be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after using the inhaler. Other adverse drug reaction side effects may rarely include: a smell similar to burning plastic, unpleasant taste, hoarseness or nasal congestion, pain or headache, and visual changes. Allergic reactions may occur, but rarely. Nasal corticosteroids may be associated with central serous retinopathy. == Pharmacology == Beclometasone is mainly a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. The activated glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the expression of proinflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression). Glucocorticoids are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system which reduces certain aspects of immune function, such as inflammation. == Names == Beclometasone dipropionate is the INN modified and beclomethasone dipropionate is the USAN and former BAN. It is a prodrug of the free form, beclometasone (INN). The prodrug beclometasone is marketed in Norway and Russia. Clenil, Qvar, Cortis are brandnames for the inhalers; Beconase, Alanase, Vancenase, Qnasl for the nasal spray or aerosol. == References ==",Beclomethasone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7762025890988298e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007267932523973286)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies received imaradenant 50 mg (n = 3) or 75 mg (n = 7) once daily (QD). The primary objective was safety and tolerability, and the secondary objectives were pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity. The median treatment duration was 2.10 months and 2.14 months for the 50- and 75-mg QD cohorts, respectively. The most common adverse events were nausea, malaise, decreased appetite, and vomiting. Five patients (50%) reported adverse events that were considered causally related to imaradenant; three patients had Grade 2 adverse events of malaise, nausea, and diarrhea. No deaths or serious adverse events occurred. The median times of maximum observed concentrations sampled after a single dose in the 50- and 75-mg QD cohorts were 1.08 h (range, 0.95-1.95) and 2.00 h (range, 0.92-5.52), respectively.

577,"('Indapamide', 'Noranat', 'Veroxil', 'Tertensif', 'Lozol')",Medical,"Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic drug used in the treatment of hypertension, as well as decompensated heart failure. Combination preparations with perindopril (an ACE inhibitor antihypertensive) are available. The thiazide-like diuretics (indapamide and chlorthalidone) reduce risk of major cardiovascular events and heart failure in hypertensive patients compared with hydrochlorothiazide with a comparable incidence of adverse events. Both thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics are effective in reducing risk of stroke. Both drug classes appear to have comparable rates of adverse effects as other antihypertensives such as angiotensin II receptor blockers and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and lesser prevalence of side-effects when compared to ACE-inhibitors and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It was patented in 1968 and approved for medical use in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Its indications include hypertension and edema due to congestive heart failure. Indapamide has been shown to reduce stroke rates in people with high blood pressure. Studies have shown that the blood pressure lowering effects of indapamide in combination with perindopril reduce the rate of stroke in high risk patients (those with a history of high blood pressure, stroke or type two diabetes). HYVET study showed that indapamide (sustained release), with or without perindopril as antihypertensive treatment in persons 80 years of age or older with sustained systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher, demonstrated significant reduction in all-cause mortality when treated to a target of 150/80 mmHg, but there was found to be no significant reduction in risk of death from cardiac causes. Two systematic reviews identified that indapamide with or without perindopril significantly reduced all cause mortality in young-elderly patients with a history of stroke, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, when greater reductions in mean office blood pressure are achieved, significant cardiovascular benefit was only observed when trials including the >75 years old cohort was included. == Contraindications == Indapamide is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, severe kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy or severe liver failure, and a low blood potassium level. There is insufficient safety data to recommend indapamide use in pregnancy or breastfeeding. == Adverse effects == Commonly reported adverse events are low potassium levels, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension (an exaggerated decrease in blood pressure upon standing, often associated with syncope), and allergic manifestations. Monitoring the serum levels of potassium and uric acid is recommended, especially in subjects with a predisposition to low levels of potassium in the blood and gout. == Interactions == Caution is advised in the combination of indapamide with lithium and drugs causing prolonged QT interval (on EKG) or wave-burst arrhythmia (i.e.: astemizole, bepridil, IV erythromycin, halofantrine, pentamidine, sultopride, terfenadine, and vincamine). == Overdose == Symptoms of over dosage would be those associated with a diuretic effect (i.e. electrolyte disturbances), low blood pressure, and muscular weakness. Treatment should be symptomatic, directed at correcting electrolyte abnormalities. == See also == Perindopril/indapamide — a fixed-dose combination used for essential hypertension == References == == External links == ""Indapamide"".

Cathepsin S (CTSS), which is a cysteine protease, is elevated in obesity and may regulate a variety of physiological processes. This study sought to investigate the functional role of CTSS in obesity. Mice were administrated 60 mg/kg of RO5444101  We found that CTSS was elevated in the plasma, visceral adipose, and liver tissues of the obese mice. After the administration of 60 mg/kg of RO5444101, the weight of the obese mice decreased, insulin resistance was inhibited, and adipocyte formation was suppressed. The CTSS inhibitor also decreased the level of macrophage infiltration in the eWAT, MCP-1 expression, and the release of M1- and M2-type cytokines in the HFD-induced mice. The CTSS inhibitor appeared to improve the hepatic function parameters and lipid accumulation of the HFD-induced mice. The CTSS inhibitor also appeared to improve the inflammatory damage in the HFD-induced mice. CTSS inhibitor helped to protect against HFD-induced adipogenesis, inflammatory infiltration, and hepatic lipid accumulation in obese mice. Primary SS (pSS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by mucosal dryness and systemic symptoms. We tested the effects of inhibition of cathepsin S using the potent and selective inhibitor RO5459072 on disease activity and symptoms of pSS. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase IIA study to investigate the effects of RO5459072 (100 mg twice daily; 200 mg per day). Seventy-five patients with pSS were randomized 1:1 to receive either RO5459072 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a ≥3 point reduction from baseline in EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) score. We also investigated the effects of RO5459072 on quality of life, exocrine gland function, biomarkers related to SS, and safety and tolerability. The proportion of patients showing an improvement in ESSDAI score was not significantly different between the RO5459072 and placebo arms. No clinically meaningful treatment effects were observed in favour of RO5459072 for all secondary outcomes. Analysis of soluble biomarkers indicated target engagement between RO5459072 and cathepsin S. There were modest decreases in the number of circulating B cells and T cells in the RO5459072 group, although these did not reach significance. RO5459072 was safe and well-tolerated. There was no clinically relevant improvement in ESSDAI score (primary endpoint), and no apparent benefit in favour of RO5459072 in any of the secondary clinical endpoints. Further work is needed in order to understand the mechanisms of MHC-II-mediated immune stimulation in pSS. ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02701985. Multiple cancer cells highly express cathepsin S, which has pro-tumoral effects. However, it was previously unknown whether knockdown or a pharmacological inhibitor (ZFL) of cathepsin S acts as an inducer of ER stress.

It was approved in the European Union in February 2015, in the United States in March 2017, and in Canada in January 2019. == Medical uses == Safinamide is used to treat idiopathic Parkinson's disease as add-on for people taking a stable dose of levodopa (L-dopa) alone or in combination with other Parkinson drugs, to help with ""off"" episodes when levodopa stops working. == Contraindications == Safinamide is contraindicated in people with severe liver impairment, with albinism, retinitis pigmentosa, severe diabetic neuropathy, uveitis and other disorders of the retina. Combination with other monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and pethidine is also contraindicated. It is not safe for women to take during pregnancy. It is excreted in breast milk and the effects on infants are unknown. == Adverse effects == Common adverse events in clinical trials (in more than 1% of people) included nausea, dizziness, tiredness, sleeplessness, orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure), and headache. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of these effects between safinamide and placebo. == Overdose == Expected overdose effects are hypertension (high blood pressure), orthostatic hypotension, hallucinations, psychomotor agitation, nausea, vomiting, and dyskinesia. In studies, a single person was suspected to have overdosed for a month; symptoms were confusion, drowsiness and mydriasis (dilation of the pupils) and subsided completely after the drug was discontinued. No specific antidote is available. == Interactions == As a MAO inhibitor, safinamide can theoretically cause hypertensive crises, serotonin syndrome and other severe side effects when combined with other MAO inhibitors or with drugs that are known to interact with MAO inhibitors, such as pethidine, dextromethorphan, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants. An interaction with tyramine, a substance found in various foods, could be expected by the same reasoning but has been excluded in studies. Another theoretical interaction is with drugs with affinity to the transporter protein ABCG2 (also known as BCRP), such as pitavastatin, pravastatin, ciprofloxacin, methotrexate, and diclofenac; a study with the latter has shown no clinical relevance. A study testing possible interactions with amidase inhibitors is part of the post-authorisation development plan. There are no relevant interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver enzymes, although one inactivation pathway of safinamide seems to be mediated by CYP3A4. == Pharmacology == === Mechanisms of action === Like the older antiparkinson drugs selegiline and rasagiline, safinamide is a selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, reducing degradation of dopamine; in contrast to the other two, its action is reversible. Safinamide also inhibits glutamate release and dopamine and serotonin reuptake. It binds to the sigma receptors as well, with IC50 values for binding inhibition of 19 nM for σ1 and 1,590 nM for σ2. Additionally, it blocks sodium and calcium channels, the relevance of which for its antiparkinson action is however unknown. === Pharmacokinetics === Safinamide is absorbed quickly and nearly completely from the gut and reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after 1.8 to 2.8 hours. There is no relevant first-pass metabolism; total bioavailability is 95%. The substance is bound to plasma proteins to 88–90%. The metabolism is not well understood. The principal step is mediated by amidases which have not been identified, and produces safinamide acid (NW-1153). Other relevant metabolites are O-debenzylated safinamide (NW-1199), the N-dealkylated amine which is then oxidized to a carboxylic acid (NW-1689), and the glucuronide of the latter. In tests with liver microsomes, dealkylation seemed to be mediated by CYP3A4, but other CYP enzymes appear to be involved as well. Safinamide acid binds to the organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3), but this has probably no clinical relevance. Safinamide itself transiently binds to ABCG2. No other transporter affinities have been found in preliminary studies. Safinamide is eliminated, mainly (>90%) in form of its metabolites, via the kidney, with an elimination half-life of 20 to 30 hours. Only 1.5% are found in the stool. == History == The compound was originally discovered at Farmitalia-Carlo Erba, which was acquired by Pharmacia in 1993. In 1995, Pharmacia merged with Upjohn. Safinamide was first disclosed in 1998. In the course of a major restructuring in the same year, all rights for safinamide were transferred to the newly formed company Newron Pharmaceuticals, which developed the drug until it was sold to Merck KGaA in 2006. In 2007, a Phase III clinical trial was started, scheduled to run until 2011. In October 2011 Merck, now Merck-Serono, announced that they would give all rights to develop the compound back to Newron because they wanted to prioritise other projects and had corrected their estimates for safinamide's market potential downwards. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to file Newron's application in 2014 on formal grounds. Newron re-applied in December 2014. In spring 2015, following a commercial agreement between Newron and the Italian pharmaceutical company Zambon, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the drug. In the following years, the drug has been launched in several European countries. Safinamide is the first antiparkinson medication to be approved for ten years. Safinamide was approved by US FDA in March 2017 for people with Parkinsons taking levodopa/carbidopa during ""off"" episodes. == Research == Potential additional uses might be restless legs syndrome (RLS) and epilepsy. Safinamide was being tested in Phase II trials in 2008, but no results are available. When used as an adjunct to parkinsonian medication, safinamide was found to be efficacious in reducing pain in PD. In experiments with rats (but not in those with monkeys), retinopathies have been observed. == References ==",Xadago,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6093124941107817e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -9.83428253675811e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-drug-treat-parkinsons-disease?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=134, start_index=9, title='FDA approves drug to treat Parkinson’s disease | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-drug-treat-parkinsons-disease?utm_source=openai')])"

Danirixin has high affinity for CXCR2, with a negative log of the 50% inhibitory concentration (pIC Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among females and the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant immune cell population in the tumor microenvironment, including breast cancer. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) play an important role in regulating breast cancer growth and metastasis, which still remains an obstacle for successful treatment of breast cancer and requires further investigation, as well as the potential therapeutic strategies. Cytokine array validated that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) is a pivotal chemokine secreted by TAMs, and CXCL8 could enhance breast cancer migration, invasion ability, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both animal and human breast cancer. In this study, the clinical data firstly indicated that high CXCL8 expression was significantly associated with metastasis and tumor growth in breast cancer patients. Then, we showed that TAMs-released CXCL8 could markedly elevate the migration, invasion and EMT events in breast cancer cells, as well as the self-renewal of BCSCs in vitro. These processes were markedly abrogated by the treatment of Danirixin, a reversible and selective antagonist of CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2). Consistently, the in vivo analysis confirmed that CXCL8 suppression using Danirixin effectively reduced the tumor growth, lung metastasis and repressed the self-renewal of BCSCs. Collectively, TAMs/CXCL8 could enhance BCSCs self-renewal and breast cancer metastasis, and these effects could be markedly abolished by Danirixin treatment, suppressing breast cancer progression consequently. Therefore, Danirixin could be considered as a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment without obvious toxicity to major organs. Excessive neutrophil presence and activation is important in a number of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. The CXCR2 chemokine receptor is important in controlling the extravasation and activation of neutrophils. Selective antagonism of the CXCR2 receptor is a potential approach to reducing neutrophil migration and activation. Danirixin, is a small molecule, CXCR2 antagonist being evaluated as a potential anti-inflammatory medicine. (1) First time in human (FTIH) double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending and repeat oral doses of danirixin in healthy male subjects; (2) single-dose study of age, gender, food, and proton-pump inhibitor effects on the pharmacokinetics of danirixin in healthy adult subjects; and placebo-controlled study of the pharmacokinetics of danirixin in healthy elderly subjects. There were no serious adverse events and no adverse events considered to be of clinical relevance. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. Systemic exposure following single doses of danirixin 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg increased with increasing dose. Engagement of pharmacology was demonstrated as inhibition of ex-vivo CXCL1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils when compared to placebo (approximately 50% for 50 mg and 100 mg danirixin, and 72% at 200 mg). There was a 37% decrease in Cmax and a 16% decrease in AUC (0-∞) following administration of danirixin in the presence of food. Cmax also decreased by 65% when danirixin 100 mg was administered following omeprazole 40 mg once daily for 5 days. The AUC (0-∞) and Cmax were 50% lower in elderly subjects compared with younger subjects. The dose-dependent inhibition of agonist-induced neutrophil activation following single and repeated once daily oral administration of danirixin suggests that this CXCR2 antagonist may have benefit in neutrophil-predominant inflammatory diseases. Co-administration with food, gastric acid reducing agents, and variable exposure in the elderly have important clinical implications that need to be taken into consideration in subsequent clinical evaluations.

585,"('Tamatinib', 'Tamatinib free base', 'R 406', 'Kinome_1211', 'Ex-a103')",Medical,"Fostamatinib, sold under the brand names Tavalisse and Tavlesse, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor medication for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The drug is administered by mouth. Fostamatinib blocks the activity of the enzyme spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). This enzyme is involved in stimulating parts of the immune system. By blocking SYK's activity, fostamatinib reduces the immune system's destruction of platelets, so allowing the platelet count to rise, which reduces the likelihood of excessive bleeding. The most commonly reported side effects are diarrhea, high blood pressure, nausea, respiratory infection, dizziness, increased liver enzymes, rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, chest pain and decreased white blood cell count. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Fostamatinib is a drug used to treat adults with low platelet count due to chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) when a prior treatment for ITP has not worked well enough. Chronic immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune bleeding disorder where the blood doesn't clot as it should because of a low platelet count. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The tablets are formulated as fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate, a disodium hexahydrate salt, and is a prodrug of the active compound tamatinib (R-406), which is an inhibitor of the enzyme spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), hence it is an syk inhibitor. Syk is a protein tyrosine kinase associated with various inflammatory cells, including macrophages, which are presumed to be the cells responsible for ITP platelet clearance. When FcγRs I, IIA, and IIIA bind to their ligands, the receptor complex becomes activated and triggers the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor-activating motifs (ITAMs). This leads to various genes becoming activated, which causes a cytoskeletal rearrangement that mediates phagocytosis in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Because Syk plays an important role in FcγR-mediated signal transduction and inflammatory propagation, it is considered a good target for the inhibition of various autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and lymphoma. == Clinical trials == Fostamatinib has been in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, IgA nephropathy, and lymphoma. The drug is currently being used in a Phase 1 trail to test the safety of the combination of the study drugs fostamatinib and paclitaxel for patients with ovarian cancer. The investigation of fostamatinib began with studies involving the treatment of mouse models with cytopenia. Mice were used to measure the effectiveness of R788, a small molecule prodrug of the biologically active R406, a Syk inhibitor. In animal models, treatment with R406/R788 was shown to be safe and effective in reducing inflammation and joint damage in immune-mediated rheumatoid arthritis. The models responded favorably to treatment so the study progressed to Phase 2 trials involving humans. Human studies have shown that R788 has good oral bioavailability, biologic activity, is well tolerated, and does not exhibit collagen or ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In NCT00706342, 16 adults with chronic ITP were entered into an open-label, single-arm cohort dose-escalation trials beginning with 75 mg and rising to 175 mg twice a day. The dose was increased until a persistent response was evident, toxicity was reached, or 175 mg twice a day was met. 8 patients achieved persistent responses with platelet counts greater than 50,000 mm3/L on more than 67% of their visits. 3 of these patients had not persistently responded to thrombopoietic agents. 4 others had nonsustained responses. Mean peak platelet count exceeded 100,000 mm3/L in these 12 patients. Toxicity was evidenced primarily in GI-related side effects, notable diarrhea, urgency, and vomiting. 2 patients developed transaminitis. Fostamatinib as a treatment for severe COVID19 complications has finished a Phase 2 trial, and is entering a Phase 3 trial. === Rheumatoid arthritis === A phase II study of rheumatoid arthritis patients failing to respond to a biologic agent showed little efficacy as compared to placebo, but the drug was well tolerated. In patients with high inflammatory burden, measured by levels of C-reactive protein, ACR20 was achieved by a significantly higher portion of those in the fostamatinib group (42%) versus the placebo group (26%). === Autoimmune thrombocytopenia === Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks and destroys platelets in the blood, causing abnormally low platelet counts. It is characterized by the antibody-mediated destruction of platelets. Patients with ITP have accelerated clearance of circulating IgG-coated platelets via Fcγ receptor-bearing macrophages in the spleen and liver, leading to different levels of thrombocytopenia and variable degrees of mucocutaneous bleeding. Recent studies of ITP pathophysiology suggest decreased platelet production may also be an important component of the thrombocytopenia. Many patients exhibit responses to established therapies, including corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D, splenectomy, and rituximab. However, there are a significant minority of patients who retain persistently low platelet counts despite treatment. These patients are consistently at risk of intracranial hemorrhage and other bleeding complications. Several thrombopoiesis-stimulating therapies including eltrombopag and romiplostim are being investigated to help combat low platelet counts in ITP patients. Rigel reported results from two Phase III clinical trials for fostamatinib as an ITP treatment in August and October 2016. The study is the second Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, study of fostamatinib disodium in the treatment of persistent/chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura that Rigel has conducted. Primary outcome measures are defined as a stable platelet response by the end of the study (week 24) of at least 50,000/μL on at least 4 of the 6 visits between weeks 14–24. Participants received either a placebo, 100 mg, or 150 mg of the drug in the morning and evening for 24 full weeks. The first study, FIT 1 (047) met the primary endpoint in a statistically significant manner, with 18% of patients hitting the 50,000 platelets/μL of blood and no patients receiving the placebo meeting that criteria. As of June 2016, the open-label, long term extension study (049) is currently tracking 118 patients who opted to receive fostamatinib after completing either study 047 or 048. === Autoimmune hemolytic anemia === Approval for treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is in Stage 1 of Phase II trials. This study is a Phase 2, multi-center, open label, Simon two-stage study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fostamatinib disodium in the treatment of warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Primary outcome measures examined include a hemoglobin response measured by levels higher than 10 g/dL and 2 g/dL higher than the baseline hemoglobin. Responses were studied for a period of 12 weeks and for a dose of 150 mg in the morning and evening. The study began in April 2016 and is estimated to conclude in September 2017. The study is currently recruiting participants from U.S. states including Arizona, California, D.C., Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, and Texas. Subjects must have had a diagnosis of primary or secondary warm antibody AIHA, and must have failed at least 1 prior treatment regimen for AIHA. Subjects cannot have a platelet count less than 30,000/μL, have AIHA secondary to autoimmune disease, have uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension, or have cold antibody AIHA, cold agglutinin syndrome, mixed type AIHA, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. === Immunoglobulin A nephropathy === Fostamatinib as a treatment for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is in Phase II trials, which will conclude at the end of 2016. IgAN is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with inflammation in the kidneys that reduces their ability to successfully filter blood. There are currently no disease-targeted therapies for IgAN. Participants are currently being recruited from the US, Austria, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the UK. Patients must be between 18 and 70 years old, have renal biopsy findings consistent with IgA nephropathy, have been treated with an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and/or an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) for at least 90 days at the maximum approved dose, have a proteinuria > 1 gm/day at diagnosis of IgA nephropathy and a level > 0.5 gm/day at the second screening visit, and a blood pressure controlled to ≤ 1302/80 with angiotensin blockade. Eligible candidates cannot have recently used cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, Rituximab, or > 15 mg/day of prednisone or any other corticosteroid equivalent. The study investigates whether fostamatinib is a safe and effective treatment for IgAN. It is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, ascending-dose, placebo-controlled clinical study. Primary outcome measures include the mean change in proteinuria as measured by spot urine protein/creatinine ratio (sPCR). Effects were evaluated for 100 mg, 150 mg, and placebo formulations taken twice daily by mouth for 24 weeks. The study began in October 2014 and is expected to complete by June 2017. == History == Fostamatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2018. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved fostamatinib based on evidence from two identical, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, FIT-1 (NCT02076399) and FIT-2 (NCT02076412) of 150 adults with persistent or chronic ITP who had an insufficient response to previous treatment, which included corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, splenectomy, and/or a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. Participants were allowed to continue previous ITP treatment during the trial. Patients were randomized 2:1 to fostamatinib (100 mg orally twice daily) or placebo twice daily for 24 weeks. Dose could be escalated to 150 mg orally twice daily after one month. The benefit of fostamatinib was assessed based on the percentage of participants who achieved and maintained the pre-determined platelet count between treatment weeks 14 to 24 in fostamatinib and placebo groups respectively. The FIT-1 trial was conducted at 35 sites in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The FIT-2 trial was conducted at 23 sites in Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Spain. The FDA granted the application for fostamatinib an orphan drug designation and granted the approval of Tavalisse to Rigel Pharmaceuticals. Fostamatinib was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2020. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02076399 for ""A Efficacy and Safety Study of R935788 in the Treatment of Persistent/Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) (FIT)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Tamatinib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.1008713702030946e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.039030496031045914), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02332312986254692)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.029750484973192215), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fostamatinib,https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/RC3A285J2G ', [])"

591,"('Flupentixol dihydrochloride', 'Flupenthixol dihydrochloride', 'Flupentixol', 'Cis-flupentixol', 'Fluanxol')",Medical,"Flupentixol (INN), also known as flupenthixol (former BAN), marketed under brand names such as Depixol and Fluanxol is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class. It was introduced in 1965 by Lundbeck. In addition to single drug preparations, it is also available as flupentixol/melitracen—a combination product containing both melitracen (a tricyclic antidepressant) and flupentixol (marketed as Deanxit). Flupentixol is not approved for use in the United States. It is, however, approved for use in the UK, Australia, Canada, Russian Federation, South Africa, New Zealand, Philippines, Iran, Germany, and various other countries. == Medical uses == Flupentixol's main use is as a long-acting injection given once in every two or three weeks to individuals with schizophrenia who have poor compliance with medication and have frequent relapses of illness, though it is also commonly given as a tablet. There is little formal evidence to support its use for this indication but it has been in use for over fifty years. Flupentixol is also used in low doses as an antidepressant. There is tentative evidence that it reduces the rate of deliberate self-harm, among those who self-harm repeatedly. == Adverse effects == Adverse effect incidence Common (>1% incidence) adverse effects include Extrapyramidal side effects such as: (which usually become apparent soon after therapy is begun or soon after an increase in dose is made) Muscle rigidity Hypokinesia Hyperkinesia Parkinsonism Tremor Akathisia Dystonia Dry mouth Constipation Hypersalivation – excessive salivation Blurred vision Diaphoresis – excessive sweating Nausea Dizziness Somnolence Restlessness Insomnia Overactivity Headache Nervousness Fatigue Myalgia Hyperprolactinemia and its complications such as: (acutely) Sexual dysfunction Amenorrhea – cessation of menstrual cycles Gynecomastia – enlargement of breast tissue in males Galactorrhea – the expulsion of breast milk that's not related to breastfeeding or pregnancy and if the hyperprolactinemia persists chronically, the following adverse effects may be seen: Reduced bone mineral density leading to osteoporosis (brittle bones) Infertility Dyspepsia – indigestion Abdominal pain Flatulence Nasal congestion Polyuria – passing more urine than usual Uncommon (0.1–1% incidence) adverse effects include Fainting Palpitations Rare (<0.1% incidence) adverse effects include Blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in the cell composition of blood), such as: Agranulocytosis – a drop in white blood cell counts that leaves one open to potentially life-threatening infections Neutropenia – a drop in the number of neutrophils (white blood cells that specifically fight bacteria) in one's blood Leucopenia – a less severe drop in white blood cell counts than agranulocytosis Thrombocytopenia – a drop in the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are responsible for blood clotting and hence this leads to an increased risk of bruising and other bleeds Neuroleptic malignant syndrome – a potentially fatal condition that appear to result from central D2 receptor blockade. The symptoms include: Hyperthermia Muscle rigidity Rhabdomyolysis Autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, diarrhea, diaphoresis, etc.) Mental status changes (e.g., coma, agitation, anxiety, confusion, etc.) Unknown incidence adverse effects include Jaundice Abnormal liver function test results Tardive dyskinesia – an often incurable movement disorder that usually results from years of continuous treatment with antipsychotic drugs, especially typical antipsychotics like flupenthixol. It presents with repetitive, involuntary, purposeless and slow movements; TD can be triggered by a fast dose reduction in any antipsychotic. Hypotension Confusional state Seizures Mania Hypomania Depression Hot flush Anergia Appetite changes Weight changes Hyperglycemia – high blood glucose (sugar) levels Abnormal glucose tolerance Pruritus – itchiness Rash Dermatitis Photosensitivity – sensitivity to light Oculogyric crisis Accommodation disorder Sleep disorder Impaired concentration Tachycardia QTc interval prolongation – an abnormality in the electrical activity of the heart that can lead to potentially fatal changes in heart rhythm (only in overdose or <10 ms increases in QTc) Torsades de pointes Miosis – constriction of the pupil of the eye Paralytic ileus – paralysis of the bowel muscles leading to severe constipation, inability to pass wind, etc. Mydriasis Glaucoma === Interactions === It should not be used concomitantly with medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., 5-HT3 antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, citalopram, etc.) as this may lead to an increased risk of QTc interval prolongation. Neither should it be given concurrently with lithium (medication) as it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. It should not be given concurrently with other antipsychotics due to the potential for this to increase the risk of side effects, especially neurological side effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome. It should be avoided in patients on CNS depressants such as opioids, alcohol and barbiturates. === Contraindications === It should not be given in the following disease states: Pheochromocytoma Prolactin-dependent tumors such as pituitary prolactinomas and breast cancer Long QT syndrome Coma Circulatory collapse Subcortical brain damage Blood dyscrasia Parkinson's disease Dementia with Lewy bodies == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Binding profile Acronyms used: HFC – Human frontal cortex receptor MB – Mouse brain receptor RC – Cloned rat receptor A study measuring the in vivo receptor occupancies of 13 schizophrenic patients treated with 5.7 ± 1.4 mg/day of flupentixol found 50-70% receptor occupancy for D2, 20 ± 5% for D1, and 20 ± 10% for 5-HT2A. Its antipsychotic effects are predominantly a function of D2 antagonism. Its antidepressant effects at lower doses are not well understood; however, it may be mediated by functional selectivity and/or preferentially binding to D2 autoreceptors at low doses, resulting in increased postsynaptic activation via higher dopamine levels. Flupentixol's demonstrated ability to raise dopamine levels in mice and flies lends credibility to the supposition of autoreceptor bias. Functional selectivity may be responsible through causing preferential autoreceptor binding or other means. The effective dosage guideline for an antipsychotic is very closely related to its receptor residency time (i.e., where drugs like aripiprazole take several minutes or more to disassociate from a receptor while drugs like quetiapine and clozapine—with guideline dosages in the hundreds of milligrams—take under 30s) and long receptor residency time is strongly correlated with likehood of pronounced functional selectivity; thus, with a maximum guideline dose of only 18 mg/day for schizophrenia, there is a significant possibility of this drug possessing unique signalling characteristics that permit counterintuitive dopaminergic action at low doses. === Pharmacokinetics === == History == In March 1963 the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck began research into further agents for schizophrenia, having already developed the thioxanthene derivatives clopenthixol and chlorprothixene. By 1965 the promising agent flupenthixol had been developed and trialled in two hospitals in Vienna by Austrian psychiatrist Heinrich Gross. The long- acting decanoate preparation was synthesised in 1967 and introduced into hospital practice in Sweden in 1968, with a reduction in relapses among patients who were put on the depot. == References ==",Fluanxol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0251946150674485e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002087136817863211)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flupentixol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Flupentixol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flupentixol?utm_source=openai')])"
592,"('Pitolisant (hydrochloride)', 'Ciproxidine', 'Bf 2649', 'Pitolisant', 'Wakix')",Medical,"Pitolisant, sold under the brand name Wakix among others, is a medication used for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy. It is an inverse agonist of the histamine H3 receptor. It represents the first commercially available medication in its class, so that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declares it a first-in-class medication. Pitolisant enhances the activity of histaminergic neurons in the brain that function to improve a person's wakefulness. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2016 for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy, and for excessive daytime sleepiness by the FDA in August 2019. The most common side effects include difficulty sleeping, nausea, and feeling worried. == Medical uses == Pitolisant is indicated in adults for the treatment of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that causes overwhelming daytime drowsiness. Pitolisant is also indicated to improve alertness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with obstructive sleep apnea. == Side effects == The most common side effects include insomnia, headache, nausea, anxiety, irritability, dizziness, depression, tremor, sleep disorders, tiredness, vomiting, vertigo, dyspepsia, and heartburn. Rare but serious side effects are abnormal weight loss and spontaneous abortion. == Pharmacology == Pitolisant is an inverse agonist of the histamine H3 autoreceptor. The H3 autoreceptors regulate histaminergic activity in the central nervous system (and to a lesser extent, the peripheral nervous system) by inhibiting histamine synthesis and release upon binding to endogenous histamine. By preventing the binding of endogenous histamine at the H3, as well as producing a response opposite to that of endogenous histamine at the receptor (inverse agonism), pitolisant enhances histaminergic activity in the brain. Pitolisant is a drug that belongs to the class of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. Pitolisant is also considered a eugeroic, which means that it promotes wakefulness and alertness. Eugeroics are different from traditional CNS stimulants such as amphetamine in that they have fewer side effects and lower abuse potential. Pitolisant is the first eugeroic drug that acts by blocking the histamine H3 autoreceptor, which increases the activity of histamine neurons in the brain. Pitolisant has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated for the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. Pitolisant has been demonstrated to exhibit high affinity for sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors, as well as moderate affinity for 5-HT2A and D3 receptors. There exist conflicting findings relating the intrinsic activity of pitolisant at the 5-HT2A receptor. Pharmacokinetics Pitolisant is readily absorbed when taken by mouth and reaches peak blood concentrations approximately 3 hours after administration. The biological half-life of Pitolisant ranges from 10 to 12 hours. == History == Pitolisant is marketed in the European Union by Bioprojet Pharma. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in March 2016 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pitolisant for excessive daytime sleepiness in participants with narcolepsy based primarily on evidence from two trials (Trial 1/NCT01067222, Trial 2/NCT01638403). An additional trial (Trial 3/NCT01800045), in which participants with a different type of narcolepsy were exposed to the same dose of pitolisant, was used to add data for evaluation of side effects. The trials were conducted in Europe and South America. The two primary trials enrolled adults with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. Participants received pitolisant, placebo, or an approved drug for narcolepsy for eight weeks. For participants receiving pitolisant, the dose could be increased during the first three weeks but had to remain the same for the next five weeks. Neither the participants nor the healthcare providers knew which treatment was being given during the trial. The benefit of pitolisant was evaluated by comparing changes in daytime sleepiness during the trial between pitolisant- and placebo-treated participants. To measure the daytime sleepiness, the investigators used a scale called the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The ESS asks participants to rate the likelihood that they would fall asleep while doing eight daily activities (such as sitting and reading or watching television). Participants rate each item from zero (would never doze) to three (high chance of dozing). Pitolisant was approved by the FDA in August 2019. It was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of narcolepsy, fast track designation for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in people with narcolepsy, and breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of cataplexy in people with narcolepsy. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Pitolisant is approved in the European Union and the United States to treat narcolepsy, and is not a controlled substance in these countries. Still, long-term studies comparing the effectiveness and tolerability of pitolisant with modafinil or sodium oxybate are lacking. Pitolisant, the only non-controlled anti-narcoleptic drug in the US, has shown minimal abuse risk in studies. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT01067222 for ""Efficacy and Safety Study of BF2.649 in the Treatment of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Narcolepsy (Harmony1)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT01638403 for ""Effects of BF2.649 in the Treatment of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Narcolepsy."" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Wakix,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9788545614574105e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00043871314846910536)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ir.harmonybiosciences.com](https://ir.harmonybiosciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/harmony-biosciences-announces-fda-approval-wakix-pitolisant?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=186, start_index=9, title='Harmony Biosciences Announces FDA Approval Of WAKIX (pitolisant), A First-In-Class Medication For The Treatment Of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness In Adult Patients With Narcolepsy | Harmony Biosciences', type='url_citation', url='https://ir.harmonybiosciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/harmony-biosciences-announces-fda-approval-wakix-pitolisant?utm_source=openai')])"

595,"('Difloxacin (hydrochloride)', 'Difloxacin', 'Difloxacin [inn]', 'Dicural', 'Difloxacin (inn)')",Medical,"Difloxacin (INN), marketed under the trade name Dicural, is a second-generation, synthetic fluoroquinolone antibiotic used in veterinary medicine. It has broad-spectrum, concentration dependent, bactericidal activity; however, its efficacy is not as good as enrofloxacin or pradofloxacin. == Indications and Usage == In 1997, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved difloxacin hydrochloride tablets for use in canines. Unlike other fluoroquinolones difloxacin has not been approved by the FDA for use in cats. It is also contraindicated for use in food animals. The recommended dosing is 5–10 mg/kg once daily. This is based on the linear pharmacokinetics exhibited by difloxacin over the 5–60 mg/kg range. So the maximum dose is well within the established safety range, but drug accumulation in tissues prompts a recommendation that the medication should not be used for periods longer than thirty days. If there is no noticeable improvement after five days, then the condition should be reevaluated and all therapy options reconsidered. Difloxacin is indicated for infections caused by susceptible microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections till 2–3 days after clinical signs have ceased, up to a maximum of thirty days. Treatment of urinary tract infections for at least ten consecutive days. === Microbiology === Difloxacin is a bactericidal, broad-spectrum antibiotic that has activity against Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. It exerts its antibacterial effect by interfering with the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase, which is needed for the maintenance and synthesis of bacterial DNA. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pathogens isolated in clinical field trials conducted in the United States between 1991 and 1993 were determined using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). == Mechanism of action == The primary mode of action of fluoroquinolones involves interaction with enzymes essential for major DNA functions such as replication, transcription and recombination. Difloxacin inhibits DNA gyrase (also known as Topoisomerase II), an enzyme required for negative super coiling during DNA replication Cell death can occur through the inability of bacteria to maintain the DNA super helical structure. === Pharmacokinetics === Difloxacin is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration, and approximately 50% is bound to circulating plasma proteins. It is metabolized primarily by the liver through glucuronidation and secreted in the bile. It can also be reabsorbed with the bile. This allows reentry into the blood stream and recirculation, a mechanism that can extend the half-life. The longer half-life allows for once daily dosing. In contrast to other fluoroquinolones, renal clearance accounts for only 5% of the removal of difloxacin from the canine system, which makes it an attractive choice for dogs with compromised renal function. a Total body clearance/F = Dose/AUC b Steady state volume of distribution/F = Dose•AUMC/AUC2 c Volume of distribution (area)/F = Vdβ = (T1/2)(CL/F)/0.693 As mentioned above, Difloxacin is not FDA-approved for use in cats. This is because the major route of metabolism is through glucuronidation, an enzymatic pathway that cats lack. Therefore, administration to cats would likely result in toxicity. Difloxacin is stored at room temperature in a cool, dry place. === Chemical and Drug Interactions === Difloxacin has been used concurrently with ectoparasiticides, antiepileptics, anesthetics, antihistamines, and topical anti-inflammatory drugs without adverse effects. It inhibits the metabolism of theophylline, caffeine, cyclosporine and warfarin. Azlocillin, cimetidine and probenecid increase blood levels of difloxacin. Compounds (i.e. sucralfate, antacids, multivitamins) containing di- and trivalent cations (i.e. iron, aluminum, calcium, magnesium and zinc) may substantially interfere with the absorption of quinolones from the intestinal tract resulting in decreased bioavailability. Therefore, the concurrent oral administration of quinolones with foods, supplements or other preparations containing any of these compounds should be avoided. == Adverse effects == Like other fluoroquinolones, difloxacin causes arthropathy in immature growing animals, particularly dogs. Otherwise, it is very well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal effects such as vomiting, diarrhea and anorexia, even in overdose. Only supportive measures, and not additional treatment, are recommended for management of overdose or toxicity as the reactions are self-limiting. Contraindications include small and medium breeds of dogs that are less than 8 months old; large breeds less than 12 months old; giant breeds less than 18 months old; those with suspected CNS disorders; and hypersensitivity to difloxacin or any other fluoroquinolone. === Human Warnings === Difloxacin has been approved for animal use only. Keep out of reach of children. Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with copious amounts of water for fifteen minutes. In case of dermal contact, wash skin with soap and water. Consult a physician if symptoms persists following exposure. Individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to quinolones should avoid this product. In humans, there is a risk of user photosensitization within a few hours after excessive exposure to quinolones. If excessive accidental exposure occurs, avoid direct sunlight. == Research == The minimum dose (5 mg/kg) was confirmed in a clinical trial performed by HTI Bio-services, Inc. It evaluated the effective dose for the treatment of an infected dermal wound. The study included forty-eight mixed breed dogs (both male and female) with weights ranging from 14.5-24.5 kilograms. These dogs were randomly placed into treatment groups. Once wounds were created, the dogs were inoculated with culture both containing both Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Pertinent observations and measurements were then taken and tabulated. Culture scores were significantly reduced, confirming 5 mg/kg to be an effective dose. Clinical field trials were also performed to evaluate both the efficacy and safety of difloxacin tablets. Clinical signs of bacterial infections were defined in a protocol. Dogs who presented to investigators with these signs were admitted into the study. In total, eighteen veterinarians located in four different geographical areas of the U.S. (Southeast, Midwest, Northwest, and West) conducted these clinical efficacy and safety evaluations. == Society and Culture == === Cost === Difloxacin tablets are not available to the public for over-the-counter purchase. It can only be obtained by prescription from a veterinarian. At least two company, Henan Sunny Industry Co. Ltd. Turtle Pharma Private Limited provides industrial-size amounts. === Marketing === Dicural was sponsored by Fort Dodge Animal Health through New Animal Drug Application (NADA) 141-096. It offers veterinarians once-per-day dosing by providing excellent tissue penetration. Difloxacin can only be obtained either from a veterinarian or by a medical prescription from a veterinarian. It is available as the hydrochloride salt in scored tablets of different strengths for easier dosing adjustments. For differentiation, the milligram strengths, 11.4 mg, 45.4 mg and 136 mg, are colored blue, white and orange, respectively. Fort Dodge Animal Health was acquired by Zoetis in 2009. In February 2012, the Municipality of Ulianopolis (State of Para, Brazil) filed a complaint against Fort Dodge Saúde Animal Ltda. (FDSAL) and five other large companies alleging that waste sent to a local waste incineration facility for destruction, but that was not ultimately destroyed as the facility lost its operating permit, caused environmental impacts requiring cleanup. The Municipality is seeking recovery of cleanup costs purportedly related to FDSAL's share of all waste accumulated at the incineration facility awaiting destruction, and compensatory damages to be allocated among the six defendants. The prosecutor granted a request for a face-to-face meeting on November 6, 2015. == See also == Quinolone == References ==",Dicural,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.1394667774438858), ('U', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.6941881775856018), ('DU', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6933006048202515)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.3132616877555847), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difloxacin,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/veterinary/EPAR/dicural ', [])"

The third subgroup (TIII) was not administered anything and it was considered the control group. Pregnancy examination of the recipients was performed on days 30-35 after the transfer using real-time ultrasonography. The pregnancy rates after embryo transfer were found to be 43.52% in Angus cows, 42.5% in Holstein heifers, and 24.61% in Holstein cows (p < .05). When the animals were not classified according to breed, the pregnancy rates in subgroups TI, TII and TIII were found to be 29.29%, 45.10% and 29.79%, respectively (p < .05). In addition, the pregnancy rates were higher in TII and TIII subgroups of Angus cows and Holstein heifers compared to that of Holstein cows (p < .05). As a result, the pregnancy rates obtained after embryo transfer in Angus cows and Holstein heifers were found to be higher than that in Holstein cows. In addition, it was concluded that the administration of flunixin meglumine during and during/after embryo transfer has a positive effect on pregnancy rates in Angus cows and Holstein heifers. Objectives were to determine effects of: 1) handling temperament and administration of flunixin meglumine, an inhibitor of prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a) synthesis, given at the time of embryo transfer, on pregnancy rates in beef cattle embryo transfer recipients; 2) handling temperament and flunixin meglumine on peripheral concentrations of progesterone, cortisol, substance-P, prostaglandin F metabolites (PGFM, (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2a) and isoprostane 8-epi PGF2a; and 3) flunixin meglumine treatment on proportion of non-pregnant recipient cows returning to estrus within an expected interval. Angus cross beef cows (n = 710) at 7 locations were assigned a body condition score (BCS: 1, emaciated; 9, obese) and a temperament score [0, calm, slow chute exit; walk (n = 352), 1, excited, fast chute exit; jump, trot or run (n = 358)] and were synchronized with Select-Synch with a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) protocol. Estrus detection aids were applied at CIDR removal and cows were observed thrice daily for estrus until 72 h. Recipient cows that expressed estrus and had a corpus luteum received a frozen-thawed embryo on Day 7 after estrus. At the time of transfer, recipient cows were randomly allocated to receive 10 mL of flunixin meglumine im, immediately after transfer (n = 365) or served as an untreated control (n = 345). In a subset of cows (n = 80), ovarian ultrasonography was performed on the day of embryo transfer to determine corpus luteum volume and blood samples were collected twice, at the time of embryo transfer and 7 d later. All cows received estrus detection aids again on Day 14 (7 d after embryo transfer) and were observed for estrus twice daily until Day 24. Accounting for treatment (P > 0.1), embryo transfer difficulty score (P < 0.1), temperament by treatment interaction (P < 0.05), recipient cows with calm temperament had a higher pregnancy rate compared to those with an excited temperament [59.4 (209/352) vs 51.7% (185/358)]. The pregnancy rate for excitable cows without flunixin meglumine was lower (46.3% 81/175) compared to excitable cows that did received flunixin meglumine [56.8% (104/183)], and calm cows that did [59.3% (108/182)] or did not [59.4% (104/170)] receive flunixin meglumine. Proportions of non-pregnant recipient cows returning to estrus on Days 18-24 were not different between flunixin meglumine and control groups, 87.6% (134/153) and 84.0% (137/163), respectively (P > 0.1). At the time of embryo transfer and 7 d later, there were moderate to strong correlations among circulating concentrations of progesterone, cortisol, substance-P, PGFM and isoprostane 8-epi PGF2a. Among excitable cows, progesterone concentrations were lower and cortisol, substance-P, PGFM and isoprostane 8-epi PGF2a concentrations were greater for cows in the control group compared to cows that received flunixin meglumine. In conclusion, administration of flunixin meglumine improved pregnancy rates in excitable recipient cows following embryo transfer without affecting the proportion of non-pregnant cows returning to estrus.
