Penbutolol is able to bind to both beta-1 adrenergic receptors and beta-2 adrenergic receptors (the two subtypes), thus making it a non-selective β blocker.: Table 10–2, p 252 Penbutolol is a sympathomimetic drug with properties allowing it to act as a partial agonist at β adrenergic receptors. It was approved by the FDA in 1987 and was withdrawn from the US market by January 2015. == Medical uses == Penbutolol is used to treat mild to moderate high blood pressure. Like other beta blockers it is not a first line treatment for this indication. It should not be used or only used with caution in people with heart failure and people with asthma. It may mask signs of low blood sugar in people with diabetes and it may mask signs of hyperthyroidism. Animal studies showed some signs of potential trouble for women who are pregnant, and it has not been tested in women who are pregnant. It is not known if penbutolol is secreted in breast milk. == Side effects == Penbutolol has a low frequency of side effects. These side effects include dizziness, light headedness, and nausea. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Penbutolol is able to bind to both beta-1 adrenergic receptors and beta-2 adrenergic receptors (the two subtypes), thus making it a non-selective β blocker.: Table 10–2, p 252 Penbutolol is a sympathomimetic drug with properties allowing it to act as a partial agonist at β adrenergic receptors. Blocking β adrenergic receptors decreases the heart rate and cardiac output to lower arterial blood pressure. β blockers also decrease renin levels, which ultimately results in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys and therefore a lower blood volume and blood pressure. Penbutolol acts on the β1 adrenergic receptors in both the heart and the kidney. When β1 receptors are activated by a catecholamine, they stimulate a coupled G protein which activates adenylyl to convert adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The increase in cAMP ultimately alters the movement of calcium ions in heart muscle and increases heart rate.: 213–214 Penbutolol blocks this and decreases heart rate, which lowers blood pressure.: 40 The ability of penbutolol to act as a partial agonist proves useful in the prevention of bradycardia as a result of decreasing the heart rate excessively. Penbutolol binding β1 adrenergic receptors also alters kidney functions. Under normal physiological conditions, the enzyme renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which will then be converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland, causing a decrease in electrolyte and water retention, ultimately increasing water excretion and decreasing blood volume and pressure.: 221 Like propranolol and pindolol, it is a serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist; this discovery by several groups in the 1980s generated excitement among those doing research on the serotonin system as such antagonists were rare at that time.: 111–14 === Pharmacokinetics === Penbutolol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, has a bioavailability over 90%, and has a rapid onset of effect. Penbutolol has a half life of five hours.: Table 10–2, p 252 == Society and culture == === Availability === Penbutolol was approved by the FDA in 1987. In January 2015 the FDA acknowledged that the penbutolol was no longer marketed in the US, and determined that the drug was not withdrawn for safety reasons. == References ==",Betapressin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.666139910928905e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019372997339814901)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5759395360946655)])","('INFO; ', [])"

2183,"('Amitriptyline (hydrochloride)', 'Amitriptyline', 'Amitriptylin', 'Damitriptyline', 'Triptanol')",Medical,"Amitriptyline, sold under the brand name Elavil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, and a variety of pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, migraine and tension headaches. Due to the frequency and prominence of side effects, amitriptyline is generally considered a second-line therapy for these indications. The most common side effects are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain. Glaucoma, liver toxicity and abnormal heart rhythms are rare but serious side effects. Blood levels of amitriptyline vary significantly from one person to another, and amitriptyline interacts with many other medications potentially aggravating its side effects. Amitriptyline was discovered in the late 1950s by scientists at Merck and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 87th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amitriptyline is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder, neuropathic pain, and for the prevention of migraine and chronic tension headache. It can be used for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children older than 6 after other treatments have failed. === Depression === Amitriptyline is effective for depression, but it is rarely used as a first-line antidepressant due to its higher toxicity in overdose and generally poorer tolerability. It can be tried for depression as a second-line therapy, after the failure of other treatments. For treatment-resistant adolescent depression or for cancer-related depression amitriptyline is no better than placebo; however, the number of treated patients in both studies was small. It is sometimes used for the treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease, but supporting evidence for that is lacking. === Pain === Amitriptyline alleviates painful diabetic neuropathy. It is recommended by a variety of guidelines as a first or second-line treatment. It is as effective for this indication as gabapentin or pregabalin but less well tolerated. Amitriptyline is as effective at relieving pain as duloxetine. Combination treatment of amitriptyline and pregabalin offers additional pain relief for people whose pain is not adequately controlled with one medication and is usually safe. Amitriptyline in certain formulations may also induce the level of sciatic-nerve blockade needed for local anesthesia therein. Here, it has been demonstrated to be of superior potency to bupivacaine, a customary long-acting local anesthetic. Low doses of amitriptyline moderately improve sleep disturbances and reduce pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. It is recommended for fibromyalgia accompanied by depression by Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and as a second-line option for fibromyalgia, with exercise being the first line option, by European League Against Rheumatism. Combinations of amitriptyline and fluoxetine or melatonin may reduce fibromyalgia pain better than either medication alone. There is some (low-quality) evidence that amitriptyline may reduce pain in cancer patients. It is recommended only as a second-line therapy for non-chemotherapy-induced neuropathic or mixed neuropathic pain if opioids did not provide the desired effect. Moderate evidence exists in favor of amitriptyline use for atypical facial pain. Amitriptyline is ineffective for HIV-associated neuropathy. In multiple sclerosis, it is frequently used to treat painful paresthesias in the arms and legs (e.g., burning sensations, pins and needles, stabbing pains) caused by damage to the pain-regulating pathways of the brain and spinal cord. === Headache === Amitriptyline is probably effective for the prevention of periodic migraine in adults. Amitriptyline is similar in efficacy to venlafaxine and topiramate but carries a higher burden of adverse effects than topiramate. For many patients, even very small doses of amitriptyline are helpful, which may allow for minimization of side effects. Amitriptyline is not significantly different from placebo when used for the prevention of migraine in children. Amitriptyline may reduce the frequency and duration of chronic tension headache, but it is associated with worse adverse effects than mirtazapine. Overall, amitriptyline is recommended for tension headache prophylaxis, along with lifestyle advice, which should include avoidance of analgesia and caffeine. === Other indications === Amitriptyline is effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome; however, because of its side effects, it should be reserved for select patients for whom other agents do not work. There is insufficient evidence to support its use for abdominal pain in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders. Tricyclic antidepressants decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of cyclic vomiting syndrome episodes. Amitriptyline, as the most commonly used of them, is recommended as a first-line agent for its therapy. Amitriptyline may improve pain and urgency intensity associated with bladder pain syndrome and can be used in the management of this syndrome. Amitriptyline can be used in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children. However, its effect is not sustained after the treatment ends. Alarm therapy gives better short- and long-term results. In the US, amitriptyline is commonly used in children with ADHD as an adjunct to stimulant medications without any evidence or guideline supporting this practice. Many physicians in the UK (and the US also) commonly prescribe amitriptyline for insomnia; however, Cochrane reviewers were not able to find any randomized controlled studies that would support or refute this practice. Similarly, a major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of amitriptyline for insomnia. The well-known sedating effects of amitriptyline, however, bear understanding on and arguable justification for this practice. It may function similarly to doxepin in this regard, although the evidence for doxepin is more robust. Trimipramine may be a more novel alternative given its tendency to not suppress but brighten R.E.M. sleep. == Contraindications and precautions == The known contraindications of amitriptyline are: Amitriptyline should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy, impaired liver function, pheochromocytoma, urinary retention, prostate enlargement, hyperthyroidism, and pyloric stenosis. In patients with the rare condition of shallow anterior chamber of eyeball and narrow anterior chamber angle, amitriptyline may provoke attacks of acute glaucoma due to dilation of the pupil. It may aggravate psychosis, if used for depression with schizophrenia. It may precipitate the switch to mania in those with bipolar disorder. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should avoid amitriptyline due to increased side effects. If it is necessary to use it, half dose is recommended. Amitriptyline can be used during pregnancy and lactation when SSRIs have been shown not to work. == Side effects == The most frequent side effects, occurring in 20% or more of users, are dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and weight gain (on average 1.8 kg). Other common side effects are headache problems (amblyopia, blurred vision), tachycardia, increased appetite, tremor, fatigue/asthenia/feeling slowed down, and dyspepsia. A less common side effect of amitriptyline is urination problems (8.7%). Amitriptyline can increase suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under the age of 24 and the US FDA required a boxed warning to be added to the prescription label. Amitriptyline-associated sexual dysfunction (occurring at a frequency of 6.9%) seems to be mostly confined to males with depression and is expressed predominantly as erectile dysfunction and low libido disorder, with lesser frequency of ejaculatory and orgasmic problems. The rate of sexual dysfunction in males treated for indications other than depression and in females is not significantly different from placebo. Liver test abnormalities occur in 10–12% of patients on amitriptyline, but are usually mild, asymptomatic, and transient, with consistently elevated alanine transaminase in 3% of all patients. The increases of the enzymes above the 3-fold threshold of liver toxicity are uncommon, and cases of clinically apparent liver toxicity are rare; nevertheless, amitriptyline is placed in the group of antidepressants with greater risks of hepatic toxicity. Amitriptyline prolongs the QT interval. This prolongation is relatively small at therapeutic doses but becomes severe in overdose. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The British National Formulary notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose, thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. The treatment of overdose is mostly supportive as no specific antidote for amitriptyline overdose is available. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption if given within 1–2 hours of ingestion. If the affected person is unconscious or has an impaired gag reflex, a nasogastric tube may be used to deliver the activated charcoal into the stomach. ECG monitoring for cardiac conduction abnormalities is essential and if one is found close monitoring of cardiac function is advised. Body temperature should be regulated with measures such as heating blankets if necessary. Cardiac monitoring is advised for at least five days after the overdose. Benzodiazepines are recommended to control seizures. Dialysis is of no use due to the high degree of protein binding with amitriptyline. == Interactions == Since amitriptyline and its active metabolite nortriptyline are primarily metabolized by cytochromes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 (see its pharmacology), the inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to exhibit pharmacokinetic interactions with amitriptyline. According to the prescribing information, the interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the plasma level of amitriptyline. However, the results in the other literature are inconsistent: the co-administration of amitriptyline with a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine does increase the plasma levels of amitriptyline two-fold and of the main active metabolite nortriptyline 1.5-fold, but combination with less potent CYP2D6 inhibitors thioridazine or levomepromazine does not affect the levels of amitriptyline and increases nortriptyline by about 1.5-fold; A case of clinically significant interaction with potent CYP2D6 inhibitor terbinafine has been reported. A potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes fluvoxamine increases the level of amitriptyline two-fold while slightly decreasing the level of nortriptyline. Similar changes occur with a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 and other cytochromes cimetidine: amitriptyline level increases by about 70%, while nortriptyline decreases by 50%. CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole elevates amitriptyline level by about a quarter. On the other hand, cytochrome P450 inducers such as carbamazepine and St. John's Wort decrease the levels of both amitriptyline and nortriptyline Oral contraceptives may increase the blood level of amitriptyline by as high as 90%. Valproate moderately increases the levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline through an unclear mechanism. The prescribing information warns that the combination of amitriptyline with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may cause potentially lethal serotonin syndrome; however, this has been disputed. The prescribing information cautions that some patients may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate. However, other literature states that there is little or no interaction: in a pharmacokinetic study topiramate only increased the level of amitriptyline by 20% and nortriptyline by 33%. Amitriptyline counteracts the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. When given with amitriptyline, other anticholinergic agents may result in hyperpyrexia or paralytic ileus. Co-administration of amitriptyline and disulfiram is not recommended due to the potential for the development of toxic delirium. Amitriptyline causes an unusual type of interaction with the anticoagulant phenprocoumon during which great fluctuations of the prothrombin time have been observed. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is metabolized to nortriptyline, a stronger norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, further augmenting amitriptyline's effects on norepinephrine reuptake (see table in this section). Amitriptyline additionally acts as a potent inhibitor of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, the α1A-adrenergic, the histamine H1 and the M1-M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see table in this section). Amitriptyline is a non-selective blocker of multiple ion channels, in particular, voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.3, Nav1.5, Nav1.6, Nav1.7, and Nav1.8, voltage-gated potassium channels Kv7.2/ Kv7.3, Kv7.1, Kv7.1/KCNE1, and hERG. === Mechanism of action === Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters by amitriptyline results in interference with neuronal reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Since the reuptake process is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity, this action may potentiate or prolong the activity of serotonergic and adrenergic neurons and is believed to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline. Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake leads to an increased concentration of norepinephrine in the posterior gray column of the spinal cord appears to be mostly responsible for the analgesic action of amitriptyline. Increased level of norepinephrine increases the basal activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which mediate an analgesic effect by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid transmission among spinal interneurons. The blocking effect of amitriptyline on sodium channels may also contribute to its efficacy in pain conditions. === Pharmacokinetics === Amitriptyline is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (90–95%). Absorption is gradual with the peak concentration in blood plasma reached after about 4 hours. Extensive metabolism on the first pass through the liver leads to average bioavailability of about 50% (45%-53%). Amitriptyline is metabolized mostly by CYP2C19 into nortriptyline and by CYP2D6 leading to a variety of hydroxylated metabolites, with the principal one among them being (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline (see metabolism scheme), and to a lesser degree, by CYP3A4. Nortriptyline, the main active metabolite of amitriptyline, is an antidepressant on its own right. Nortriptyline reaches 10% higher level in the blood plasma than the parent drug amitriptyline and 40% greater area under the curve, and its action is an important part of the overall action of amitriptyline. Another active metabolite is (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline, which is a norepinephrine uptake inhibitor four times weaker than nortriptyline. (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline blood level is comparable to that of nortriptyline, but its cerebrospinal fluid level, which is a close proxy of the brain concentration of a drug, is twice higher than nortriptyline's. Based on this, (E)-10-hydroxynortriptyline was suggested to significantly contribute to the antidepressant effects of amitriptyline. Blood levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline and pharmacokinetics of amitriptyline in general, with clearance difference of up to 10-fold, vary widely between individuals. Variability of the area under the curve in steady state is also high, which makes a slow upward titration of the dose necessary. In the blood, amitriptyline is 96% bound to plasma proteins; nortriptyline is 93–95% bound, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline is about 60% bound. Amitriptyline has an elimination half life of 21 hours, nortriptyline – 23–31 hours, and (E)-10-hydroxynortiptyline − 8–10 hours. Within 48 hours, 12−80% of amitriptyline is eliminated in the urine, mostly as metabolites. 2% of the unchanged drug is excreted in the urine. Elimination in the feces, apparently, have not been studied. Therapeutic levels of amitriptyline range from 75 to 175 ng/mL (270–631 nM), or 80–250 ng/mL of both amitriptyline and its metabolite nortriptyline. === Pharmacogenetics === Since amitriptyline is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, genetic variations within the genes coding for these enzymes can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of amitriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have ""normal"" metabolism of amitriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use amitriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 in patients who are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in the starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If the use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. == Chemistry == Amitriptyline is a highly lipophilic molecule having an octanol-water partition coefficient (pH 7.4) of 3.0, while the log P of the free base was reported as 4.92. Solubility of the free base amitriptyline in water is 14 mg/L. Amitriptyline is prepared by reacting dibenzosuberane with 3-(dimethylamino)propylmagnesium chloride and then heating the resulting intermediate product with hydrochloric acid to eliminate water. == History == Amitriptyline was first developed by the American pharmaceutical company Merck in the late 1950s. In 1958, Merck approached several clinical investigators proposing to conduct clinical trials of amitriptyline for schizophrenia. One of these researchers, Frank Ayd, instead, suggested using amitriptyline for depression. Ayd treated 130 patients and, in 1960, reported that amitriptyline had antidepressant properties similar to another, and the only known at the time, tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. Following this, the US Food and Drug Administration approved amitriptyline for depression in 1961. In Europe, due to a quirk of the patent law at the time allowing patents only on the chemical synthesis but not on the drug itself, Roche and Lundbeck were able to independently develop and market amitriptyline in the early 1960s. According to research by a historian of psychopharmacology David Healy, amitriptyline became a much bigger selling drug than its precursor imipramine because of two factors. First, amitriptyline has a much stronger anxiolytic effect. Second, Merck conducted a marketing campaign raising clinicians' awareness of depression as a clinical entity. == Society and culture == In the 2021 film The Many Saints of Newark, amitriptyline (referred to by the brand name Elavil) is part of the plot line of the movie. === Names === Amitriptyline is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while amitriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are amitriptilina, in German is Amitriptylin, and in Latin is amitriptylinum. The embonate salt is known as amitriptyline embonate, which is its BANM, or as amitriptyline pamoate unofficially. === Prescription trends === Between 1998 and 2017, along with imipramine, amitriptyline was the most commonly prescribed first antidepressant for children aged 5–11 years in England. It was also the most prescribed antidepressant (along with fluoxetine) for 12- to 17-year-olds. == Research == The few randomized controlled trials investigating amitriptyline efficacy in eating disorder have been discouraging. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == Further reading == Dean L (March 2017).

It occurs in particularly high concentrations in popcorn and bamboo shoots. It is a major metabolite of chlorogenic acids in humans along with caffeic and isoferulic acid, and is absorbed in the small intestine, whereas other metabolites such as dihydroferulic acid, feruloylglycine and dihydroferulic acid sulfate are produced from chlorogenic acid in the large intestine by the action of gut flora. In cereals, ferulic acid is localized in the bran – the hard outer layer of grain. In wheat, phenolic compounds are mainly found in the form of insoluble bound ferulic acid and may be relevant to resistance to wheat fungal diseases. The highest known concentration of ferulic acid glucoside has been found in flaxseed (4.1±0.2 g/kg). It is also found in barley grain. Asterid eudicot plants can also produce ferulic acid. The tea brewed from the leaves of yacón (Smallanthus sonchifolius), a plant traditionally grown in the northern and central Andes, contains quantities of ferulic acid. In legumes, the white bean variety navy bean is the richest source of ferulic acid among the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) varieties. It is also found in horse grams (Macrotyloma uniflorum). Although there are many sources of ferulic acid in nature, its bioavailability depends on the form in which it is present: free ferulic acid has limited solubility in water, and hence poor bioavailability. In wheat grain, ferulic acid is found bound to cell wall polysaccharides, allowing it to be released and absorbed in the small intestine. === In processed foods === Cooked sweetcorn releases increased levels of ferulic acid. As plant sterol esters, this compound is naturally found in rice bran oil, a popular cooking oil in several Asian countries. Ferulic acid glucoside can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed. Rye bread contains ferulic acid dehydrodimers. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Ferulic acid is biosynthesized in plants from caffeic acid by the action of the enzyme caffeate O-methyltransferase. In a proposed ferulic acid biosynthetic pathway for Escherichia coli, L-tyrosine is converted to 4-coumaric acid by tyrosine ammonia lyase, which is converted to caffeic acid by Sam5, which is then converted to ferulic acid by caffeic acid methyltransferase. Ferulic acid, together with dihydroferulic acid, is a component of lignocellulose, serving to crosslink the lignin and polysaccharides, thereby conferring rigidity to the cell walls. It is an intermediate in the synthesis of monolignols, the monomers of lignin, and is also used for the synthesis of lignans. === Biodegradation === Ferulic acid is converted by certain strains of yeast, notably strains used in brewing of wheat beers, such as Saccharomyces delbrueckii (Torulaspora delbrueckii), to 4-vinyl guaiacol (2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol) which gives beers such as Weissbier and Wit their distinctive clove-like flavour. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (dry baker's yeast) and Pseudomonas fluorescens are also able to convert trans-ferulic acid into 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. In P. fluorescens, a ferulic acid decarboxylase has been isolated. == Ecology == Ferulic acid is one of the compounds that initiate the vir (virulence) region of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, inducing it to infect plant cells. == Extraction == It can be extracted from wheat bran and maize bran using concentrated alkali. == See also == Caffeic acid Coumaric acid Diferulic acids Eugenol Isoferulic acid, an isomer of ferulic acid == References ==",Trans-ferulic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0011055675568059087), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.01159299723803997), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.04865659400820732), ('ĠEND', -0.03242136910557747), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0025228597223758698)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([foodcomex.org](https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000015?utm_source=openai), [chemicalbook.com](https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB3337152.htm?utm_source=openai), [sigmaaldrich.com](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/f3500?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=311, start_index=21, title='FComEx: trans-Ferulic acid (PC000015)', type='url_citation', url='https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000015?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=311, start_index=21, title='trans-Ferulic acid | 537-98-4', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB3337152.htm?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=311, start_index=21, title='trans-Ferulic acid | Sigma-Aldrich', type='url_citation', url='https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/f3500?utm_source=openai')])"
2187,"('Ezutromid', 'Ezutromid [inn]', 'Benzoxazole, 5-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-(2-naphthalenyl)-', 'Ex-a2333')",Medical,"Ezutromid is an orally administered small molecule utrophin modulator involved in a Phase 2 clinical trial produced by Summit Therapeutics for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a fatal x-linked recessive disease affecting approximately 1 in 5000 males and is a designated orphan disease by the FDA and European Medicines Agency. Approximately 1/3 of the children obtain DMD as a result of spontaneous mutation in the dystrophin gene and have no family history of the disease. Dystrophin is a vital component of mature muscle function, and therefore DMD patients have multifarious forms of defunct or deficient dystrophin proteins that all manifest symptomatically as muscle necrosis and eventually organ failure. Ezutromid is theorized to maintain utrophin, a protein functionally and structurally similar to dystrophin that precedes and is replaced by dystrophin during development. Utrophin and dystrophin are reciprocally expressed, and are found in different locations in a mature muscle cell. However, in dystrophin-deficient patients, utrophin was found to be upregulated and is theorized to replace dystrophin in order to maintain muscle fibers. Ezutromid is projected to have the potential to treat all patients suffering with DMD as it maintains the production of utrophin to counteract the lack of dystrophin to retard muscle degeneration. Both the FDA and European Medicines Agency has given ezutromid an orphan drug designation. The FDA Office of Orphan Products and Development offers an Orphan Drug Designation program (ODD) that allows drugs aimed to treat diseases that affect less than 200,000 people in the U.S. monetary incentives such as a period of market exclusivity, tax incentives, and expedited approval processes. The Phase 2 clinical trial was ended in 2018 and the medication discontinued after it failed to show any benefit in slowing the disease. == Clinical trials == The first Phase 1b trial (NCT02056808) began in November 2013 and involved 12 patients aged 5–11 years old. The patients were divided into three groups given escalating oral doses testing the safety and tolerability after each increase over the course of 10 days. Another completed Phase 1b trial (NCT02383511) began February 2015 and involved 12 patients aged 5–13 years old. The goal was to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic parameters by measuring plasma concentration and major metabolite levels over 28 days for three sequence groups. Each sequence involved placebo, 1250 mg, and 2500 mg BID (twice a day) doses given for one week each. A PhaseOut DMD, Phase 2, Proof of Concept (NCT02858362) clinical trial is underway that tests the clinical safety and efficacy of an oral suspension of ezutromid. The 48-week open-label trial is enrolling 40 boys, ages 5–10, living in the U.K. or U.S. MRI leg muscle change will be measured as well as ezutromid plasma concentration levels, with a secondary goal of obtaining quantifiable images of utrophin membrane stained biopsies at baseline and either 24 or 48 weeks. == Commercial aspects == As of 2016, ataluren was the only approved drug in the EU to treat a specific subpopulation of patients with nmDMD, or DMD caused by a nonsense mutation. However, nonsense mutations only account for approximately 15% of all patients with DMD. Therefore, Summit Therapeutics projects to file for regulatory approval in the US and EU by 2019 and to reach market in 2020. They expect to profit just over £24,046 in 2020 and £942,656 in 2025, which amounts to ~10% CGR for the first 7 years on the basis of treating all DMD patients in the US, EU, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Russia. Furthermore, Summit Therapeutics has entered an agreement with Sarepta Therapeutics as of October 2016 regarding the commercialization of ezutromid. The agreement consists of a collaboration between Sarepta and Summit to share the research and developing costs for the development of novel therapies to treat DMD patients. == References ==",Ezutromid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.1002098023891449), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.2689116273541003e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004097638186067343)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezutromid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='Ezutromid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezutromid?utm_source=openai')])"

Specifically it is used to prevent blood clots following hip or knee replacement and in those with a history of prior clots. It is used as an alternative to warfarin and does not require monitoring by blood tests. In a meta analysis of 7 different studies, there was no benefit of dabigatran over warfarin in preventing ischemic stroke; however, dabigatran were associated with a lower hazard for intracranial bleeding compared with warfarin, but also had a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding relative to warfarin. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include bleeding and gastritis. Other side effects may include bleeding around the spine and allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. In cases of severe bleeding, it can be reversed with the antidote, idarucizumab. Use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Compared to warfarin it has fewer interactions with other medications. It is a direct thrombin inhibitor. Dabigatran was approved for medical use in the United States in 2010. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was the 306th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. Dabigatran is available a generic medication. == Medical uses == Dabigatran is used to prevent strokes in those with atrial fibrillation not caused by heart valve issues, as well as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in persons who have been treated for 5–10 days with parenteral anticoagulant (usually low molecular weight heparin), and to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in some circumstances. It appears to be as effective as warfarin in preventing non-hemorrhagic strokes and embolic events in those with atrial fibrillation not due to valve problems. In 2022, an observational meta-analysis study was performed on direct oral anticoagulants for patients with atrial fibrillation. The study found that dabigatran had comparable rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, intracerebral haemorrhage, and all-cause mortality when compared to other anticoagulants like apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. Notably, apixaban was associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding than dabigatran and the others. This finding was generally steady for patients aged 80 years or older and those with chronic kidney disease. == Contraindications == Dabigatran is contraindicated in patients who have active pathological bleeding, since dabigatran can increase bleeding risk and can also cause serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. Dabigatran is also contraindicated in patients who have a history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to dabigatran (e.g. anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock). The use of dabigatran should also be avoided in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves due to the increased risk of thromboembolic events (e.g. valve thrombosis, stroke, and myocardial infarction) and major bleeding when compared with warfarin. Current FDA guidelines states that patients with mechanical heart valves should not be using dabigatran. The safety and efficacy of Pradaxa (dabigatran) were evaluated in the European RE-ALIGN trial in 2012. RE-ALIGN was terminated early because the Pradaxa treatment group had significantly more thromboembolic events and major bleeding than warfarin and determined to be contraindicated for use in patients with mechanical heart valves. Further studies are needed in order to determine effects of dabigatran on patients with bioprosthetic valves. Dabigatran is poorly excreted in breastmilk and does not appear to require any limitations to breastfeeding. However, data is limited and further studies are needed. == Adverse effects == The most commonly reported side effect of dabigatran is gastrointestinal upset. When compared with people anticoagulated with warfarin, patients taking dabigatran had fewer life-threatening bleeds, fewer minor and major bleeds, including intracranial bleeds, but the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly higher. Dabigatran capsules contain tartaric acid, which lowers the gastric pH and is required for adequate absorption. The lower pH has previously been associated with dyspepsia; some hypothesize that this plays a role in the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. If a small amount of GI bleeding is diagnosed, the clinicians may consider adding H2 receptor inhibitor (H2RA), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and mucosal protective agent. In severe bleeding, measures include discontinuation of dabigatran immediately, and administration of prothrombin complex concentrate, packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, the use of specific reversal agents such as idarucizumab for dabigatran, and emergency endoscopic management. A small but significantly increased risk of myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) has been noted when combining the safety outcome data from multiple trials. However, conflicting evidence from another review suggested that dabigatran might not substantially increase the risk of heart attacks, or if it does, then the associated risk is relatively low. For patients with moderately reduced kidney function, lower dabigatran doses are recommended due to increased drug exposure and bleeding risk. Alternative anticoagulants should be considered in severe kidney impairment due to insufficient safety and efficacy data. Dabigatran intake has also been reported to cause esophageal injury or esophagitis. In a 2016 study by Toya et al., roughly 20% of patients suffered esophageal mucosa damage. It has been theorized that the tartaric-acid core in the drug adheres and damages the esophagus, and then the damaged esophageal mucosa exfoliates after peristalsis. Additionally, patients with limited mobility, reduced salivary secretion, and low water consumption will increase the possibility of contact by dabigatran with the esophageal mucosa. The Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial showed that impairment of liver function caused by dabigatran occurred in the same frequency as warfarin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Dabigatran reversibly binds to the active site on the thrombin molecule, preventing thrombin-mediated activation of coagulation factors. Furthermore, dabigatran can inactivate thrombin even when thrombin is fibrin-bound; it reduces thrombin-mediated inhibition of fibrinolysis and, therefore, may enhance fibrinolysis. === Pharmacokinetics === Dabigatran has a half-life of approximately 12–17 h and exerts a maximum anticoagulation effect within 2 hours after ingestion. Fatty foods delay the intestinal absorption of dabigatran, although the bioavailability of the drug is unaffected. Several studies have demonstrated that dabigatran plasma concentrations are reduced when co-administered with proton pump inhibitors, however it is unclear if this reduction is clinically significant. Dabigatran excretion through P-glycoprotein pumps is slowed in patients taking strong p-glycoprotein pump inhibitors such as quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone, thus raising plasma levels of dabigatran. Dabigatran is available as dabigatran etexilate mesilate, formulated as the prodrug dabigatran etexilate. == History == Dabigatran (then compound BIBR-953) was discovered from a panel of chemicals with similar structure to benzamidine-based thrombin inhibitor α-NAPAP (N-alpha-(2-naphthylsulfonylglycyl)-4-amidinophenylalanine piperidide), which had been known since the 1980s as a powerful inhibitor of various serine proteases, specifically thrombin, but also trypsin. Addition of ethyl ester and hexyloxycarbonyl carbamide hydrophobic side chains led to the orally absorbed prodrug, BIBR 1048 (dabigatran etexilate). In March 2008, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted marketing authorization for Pradaxa for the prevention of thromboembolic disease following hip or knee replacement surgery and for non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The National Health Service (NHS) in Britain authorized dabigatran for use in preventing blood clots in hip and knee replacement surgery patients. According to a BBC article in 2008, Dabigatran was expected to cost the NHS £4.20 per day, which was similar to several other anticoagulants. Initially, there was no specific way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in the event of a major bleeding event, unlike for warfarin. Since then, the dabigatran-specific antidote idarucizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody for intravenous administration, was developed, and received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2015. Pradaxa received a Notice of Compliance (NOC) from Health Canada in June 2008, for the prevention of blood clots in patients who have undergone total hip or total knee replacement surgery. Approval for atrial fibrillation patients at risk of stroke came in October 2010. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pradaxa in October 2010, for prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The approval came after an advisory committee recommended the drug for approval in September 2010, although caution is still urged by some outside experts. In February 2011, the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association added dabigatran to their guidelines for management of non-valvular atrial fibrillation with a class I recommendation. In May 2014, the FDA reported the results of a large study comparing dabigatran with warfarin in 134,000 Medicare patients. The agency concluded that dabigatran is associated with a lower risk of overall mortality, ischemic stroke, and bleeding in the brain than warfarin. Gastrointestinal bleeding was more common in those treated with dabigatran than in those treated with warfarin. The risk of heart attack was similar between the two drugs. The FDA reiterated its opinion that dabigatran's overall risk/benefit ratio is favorable. In July 2014, a series of investigations accused the privately held Boehringer Ingelheim pharmaceutical group of withholding critical information about the need for monitoring to protect patients from severe bleeding, particularly in the elderly. Review of internal communications between Boehringer researchers and employees by the FDA and the EMA revealed that Boehringer researchers had found evidence that serum levels of dabigatran vary widely. The BMJ investigation suggested that Boehringer had a financial motive to withhold this concern from regulatory health agencies because the data conflicted with their extensive marketing of dabigatran as an anticoagulant that does not require monitoring. In August 2012, Pradaxa claims filed in U.S. federal courts were consolidated into a multi-district litigation in the Southern District of Illinois before Chief Judge David R. Herndon. In May 2014, a $650 million settlement was announced on behalf of approximately 3,900 claimants who were injured by the drug Pradaxa made by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The drug was alleged to cause severe bleeding events and/or hemorrhaging to those who were taking the drug. == References ==",Dabigatran etexilate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3828182090946939e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00028081765049137175)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.rxreasoner.com/atccodes/B01AE07,https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D07144,https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/d/dabigatran-etexilat.html ', [])"

NS‑398, a selective inhibitor of COX‑2, is unable to inhibit pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, as determined by a Cell Counting Kit 8 assay. However, it does increase cancer cell invasiveness, and therefore the invasiveness of the PANC‑1 cells was determined, along with the activation of P38, which was assessed by western blotting. In the present study, to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the action of NS‑398 in pancreatic cancer cells, PANC‑1 cells were treated with NS‑398, and the invasion signaling pathways of cluster of differentiation (CD)147‑matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and mitogen‑activated protein kinases were evaluated. The results showed that NS‑398‑induced the expression of CD147 and MMP‑2 via the activation of P38, which was involved in antiproliferative activity and induced pancreatic cancer cell invasiveness. The PANC‑1 cells were also co‑treated with CD147 small interfering (si)RNA and NS‑398, and it was found that the NS‑398‑induced activation of P38 was not inhibited by CD147 siRNA, however, the expression of MMP‑2 was inhibited. CD147 siRNA inhibited the invasiveness of the pancreatic cancer cells induced by NS‑398, but also restored NS‑398‑induced antiproliferative activity. These data indicated that P38 in the pancreatic cancer cells was non‑specifically activated by NS‑398. This activation induced the expression of CD147‑MMP‑2, opposed the antiproliferative activity of NS‑398 and increased the invasiveness of the PANC‑1 cells. The cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) are membrane-associated, heme-containing homodimers that generate prostaglandin H(2) from arachidonic acid (AA) in the committed step of prostaglandin biogenesis and are the targets for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl) methanesulfonamide (NS-398) was the first in a series of isoform-selective drugs designed to preferentially inhibit COX-2, with the aim of ameliorating many of the toxic gastrointestinal side effects caused by conventional NSAID inhibition. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of murine COX-2 in complex with NS-398 utilizing synchrotron radiation to 3.0A resolution. NS-398 binds in the cyclooxygenase channel in a conformation that is different than that observed for other COX-2-selective inhibitors, such as celecoxib, with no discernible penetration into the side pocket formed in COX-2 by the isoform-specific substitutions of I434V, H513R, and I523V. Instead, the methanesulfonamide moiety of NS-398 interacts with the side chain of Arg-120 at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel, similar to that observed for acidic, nonselective NSAIDs such as indomethacin and flurbiprofen. Our structure validates inhibitor studies that identified Arg-120 as a molecular determinant for time-dependent inhibition of COX-2 by NS-398. Bortezomib is commonly used in treating multiple myeloma (MM). However, a number of patients develop resistance to bortezomib over time. Cox-2 is overexpressed in MM cells and contributes to apoptosis resistance and MM development. In the present study, RPMI8226 MM cells were treated with the Cox-2 inhibitor NS-398 to investigate whether it enhanced the effect of bortezomib on MM. The results showed that NS-398 and bortezomib acted synergistically to inhibit growth, arrest the cell cycle at the G1 phase and to induce the apoptosis of MM cells. NS-398 inhibited the NF-κB p65 protein levels and the expression of various NF-κB target genes, including cyclin D1, c-Myc, survivin and Bcl-2.

2195,"('Imatinib', 'Glivec', 'Imatinib (sti571)', 'Sti-571', 'Imatinib free base')",Medical,"Imatinib, sold under the brand names Gleevec and Glivec (both marketed worldwide by Novartis) among others, is an oral targeted therapy medication used to treat cancer. Imatinib is a small molecule inhibitor targeting multiple tyrosine kinases such as CSF1R, ABL, c-KIT, FLT3, and PDGFR-β. Specifically, it is used for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that are Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+), certain types of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), systemic mastocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, and rash. Severe side effects may include fluid retention, gastrointestinal bleeding, bone marrow suppression, liver problems, and heart failure. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Imatinib works by stopping the Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase. This can slow growth or result in programmed cell death of certain types of cancer cells. Imatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. A generic version became available in the UK as of 2017. == Medical uses == Imatinib is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and a number of other malignancies. In 2006 the FDA expanded approved use to include dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD), and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM). Imatinib is considered to be a very effective treatment for CML, and has been shown to improve outcomes for people with this type of leukemia. It can also be used to treat some types of ALL, but is not considered a standard of care for ALL. In many cases, Imatinib can induce a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) and many patients can have a long-term remission. It is also used to maintain remission in chronic phase CML patients. While Imatinib is a very effective treatment for CML and some types of ALL, it is not a cure for leukemia. Instead, it is a 'chronic therapy' that helps to control the disease and prevent it from progressing. Some patients may need to continue taking Imatinib for an extended period of time to maintain remission, and some patients may eventually require additional treatment options. === Chronic myelogenous leukemia === The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved imatinib as first-line treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, both in adults and children. The drug is approved in multiple contexts of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, including after stem cell transplant, in blast crisis, and newly diagnosed. Due in part to the development of imatinib and related drugs, the five-year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia increased from 31% in 1993, to 59% in 2009, to 70% in 2016. By 2023, the five year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia had risen to 90%. Starting from 2011, it became clear that CML patients who continue to respond to imatinib have the same or almost the same life expectancy as the general population. === Gastrointestinal stromal tumors === The FDA first granted approval for advanced GIST patients in 2002. On 1 February 2012, imatinib was approved for use after the surgical removal of KIT-positive tumors to help prevent recurrence. The drug is also approved in unresectable KIT-positive GISTs. === Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) === The FDA granted approval for the treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) patients in 2006. Specifically adult patients with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Prior to approval DFSP was considered unresponsive to chemotherapy treatments. === Other === The FDA has approved imatinib for use in adults with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene rearrangements, aggressive systemic mastocytosis without or an unknown D816V c-KIT mutation, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia who have the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase (CHIC2 allele deletion) or FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase negative or unknown, unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. On 25 January 2013, Gleevec was approved for use in children with Ph+ ALL. For treatment of progressive plexiform neurofibromas associated with neurofibromatosis type I, early research has shown potential for using the c-KIT tyrosine kinase blocking properties of imatinib. There have been several phase 2 trials of imatinib for aggressive fibromatosis. == Contraindications and cautions == The only known contraindication to imatinib is hypersensitivity to imatinib. Cautions include: Hepatic impairment Risk of severe CHF or left ventricular dysfunction, especially in patients with comorbidities Pregnancy, risk of embryo-fetal toxicity Risk of fluid retention Risk of growth stunting in children or adolescents == Side effects == The most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, leg aches/cramps, fluid retention, visual disturbances, itchy rash, lowered resistance to infection, bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite, weight gain, reduced number of blood cells (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), and edema. === Cardiotoxicity === In some individuals, imatinib use was reported to be associated with left ventricular dysfunction which sometimes progressed to congestive cardiac failure despite an absence of prior heart disease. Clinical trials of imatinib did not report cardiac adverse effects, but had reported a notably high incidence of peripheral oedema, with some cases classified as severe. Patient biopsies as well as mice treated with large doses of imatinib exhibited cellular signs of cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxic effects appeared to mediated by inhibition of cytoplasmic ABL1 tyrosine kinase. === Childhood growth inhibition === Multiple human and animal studies suggest that if imatinib is used in prepubescent children, it may delay normal growth (more specifically bone elongation), although some may experience at least partial catch-up growth during puberty. The reason for this side effect is unclear; interference with a growth hormone (GH)-related pathway may be involved (prepubertal growth is GH-dependent, whereas pubertal growth is synergystically promoted by both GH and sex hormones). === Pigmentation changes === Imatinib use may cause lightening/depigmentation or darkening/repigmentation of hair (as is the case with some other tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and/or skin as well as hyperpigmentation of the gingiva. The median onset of hair color change is 4 weeks after initiation of therapy (but may occur over a year after initiation), is dose-dependent, and is reversible upon treatment discontinuation or dose reduction. C-kit receptors - one of the biological target of imatinib - are expressed by melanocytes. == Overdose == Medical experience with imatinib overdose is limited. Treatment is supportive. Imatinib is highly plasma protein-bound: dialysis is unlikely to be helpful removing imatinib. == Interactions == Its use is advised against in people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, ritonavir and nefazodone due to its reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates of any of these enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism. As with other immunosuppressants, application of live vaccines is contraindicated because the microorganisms in the vaccine could multiply and infect the patient. Inactivated and toxoid vaccines do not hold this risk, but may not be effective under imatinib therapy. Eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice are strongly discouraged as it increases the concentration of imatinib in the blood. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Imatinib is a 2-phenyl amino pyrimidine derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. It occupies the TK active site, leading to a decrease in activity. There are a large number of TK enzymes in the body, including the insulin receptor. Imatinib is specific for the TK domain in abl (the Abelson proto-oncogene), c-kit and PDGF-R (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome leads to a fusion protein of abl with bcr (breakpoint cluster region), termed bcr-abl. As this is now a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, imatinib is used to decrease bcr-abl activity. The active sites of tyrosine kinases each have a binding site for ATP. The enzymatic activity catalyzed by a tyrosine kinase is the transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on its substrates, a process known as protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Imatinib works by binding close to the ATP binding site of bcr-abl, locking it in a closed or self-inhibited conformation, and therefore inhibiting the enzyme activity of the protein semi-competitively. This fact explains why many BCR-ABL mutations can cause resistance to imatinib by shifting its equilibrium toward the open or active conformation. Imatinib is quite selective for bcr-abl, though it does also inhibit other targets mentioned above (c-kit and PDGF-R), as well as ABL2 (ARG) and DDR1 tyrosine kinases and NQO2 – an oxidoreductase. Imatinib also inhibits the abl protein of non-cancer cells, but these cells normally have additional redundant tyrosine kinases, which allows them to continue to function even if abl tyrosine kinase is inhibited. Some tumor cells, however, have a dependence on bcr-abl. Inhibition of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase also stimulates its entry in to the nucleus, where it is unable to perform any of its normal anti-apoptopic functions, leading to tumor cell death. ==== Other pathways affected ==== The Bcr-Abl pathway has many downstream pathways including the Ras/MapK pathway, which leads to increased proliferation due to increased growth factor-independent cell growth. It also affects the Src/Pax/Fak/Rac pathway. This affects the cytoskeleton, which leads to increased cell motility and decreased adhesion. The PI/PI3K/AKT/BCL-2 pathway is also affected. BCL-2 is responsible for keeping the mitochondria stable; this suppresses cell death by apoptosis and increases survival. The last pathway that Bcr-Abl affects is the JAK/STAT pathway, which is responsible for proliferation. === Pharmacokinetics === Imatinib is rapidly absorbed when given by mouth, and is highly bioavailable: 98% of an oral dose reaches the bloodstream. Metabolism of imatinib occurs in the liver and is mediated by several isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The main metabolite, N-demethylated piperazine derivative, is also active. The major route of elimination is in the bile and feces; only a small portion of the drug is excreted in the urine. Most of imatinib is eliminated as metabolites; only 25% is eliminated unchanged. The half-lives of imatinib and its main metabolite are 18 h and 40 h, respectively. It blocks the activity of Abelson cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (ABL), c-Kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). As an inhibitor of PDGFR, imatinib mesylate appears to have utility in the treatment of a variety of dermatological diseases. Imatinib has been reported to be an effective treatment for FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha+ mast cell disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === == History == Imatinib was invented in the late 1990s by scientists at Ciba-Geigy (which merged with Sandoz in 1996 to become Novartis), in a team led by the British biochemist Nicholas Lydon and that included Elisabeth Buchdunger and Jürg Zimmermann, and its use to treat CML was driven by oncologist Brian Druker of Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Other major contributions to imatinib development were made by biologist Anthony R. Hunter at Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, a physician, scientist, and hematologist at the University of Milano Bicocca, Italy, John Goldman at Hammersmith Hospital in London, and later on by Charles Sawyers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Imatinib was developed by rational drug design. After the Philadelphia chromosome mutation and hyperactive bcr-abl protein were discovered, the investigators screened chemical libraries to find a drug that would inhibit that protein. With high-throughput screening, they identified 2-phenylaminopyrimidine. This lead compound was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and benzamide groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib. When Novartis tested imatinib in rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys in 1996, it was found to have several toxic effects; in particular, results indicating liver damage in dogs nearly stopped drug development completely. However, favorable results in studies with monkeys and in vitro human cells allowed testing to continue in humans. The first clinical trial of Gleevec took place in 1998, after Novartis reluctantly synthesized and released a few grams of the drug for Druker, enough for him to run a trial using a hundred or so patients. Mel Mann, who entered the clinical trial in August 1998, is the longest living person to be treated with the drug. The drug received FDA approval in May 2001, only two and a half years after the new drug application was submitted. On the same month it made the cover of TIME magazine as a ""bullet"" to be used against cancer. Druker, Lydon and Sawyers received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2009 for ""converting a fatal cancer into a manageable chronic condition"". During the FDA review, the tradename of the drug for the US market was changed from ""Glivec"" to ""Gleevec"" at the request of the FDA, to avoid confusion with Glyset, a diabetes drug. A Swiss patent application was filed on imatinib and various salts on in April 1992, which was then filed in the EU, the US, and other countries in March and April 1993. and in 1996 United States and European patent offices issued patents listing Jürg Zimmermann as the inventor. In July 1997, Novartis filed a new patent application in Switzerland on the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate (the mesylate salt of imatinib). The ""beta crystalline form"" of the molecule is a specific polymorph of imatinib mesylate; a specific way that the individual molecules pack together to form a solid. This is the actual form of the drug sold as Gleevec/Glivec; a salt (imatinib mesylate) as opposed to a free base, and the beta crystalline form as opposed to the alpha or other form.: 3 and 4 In 1998, Novartis filed international patent applications claiming priority to the 1997 filing. A United States patent was granted in 2005. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2013, more than 100 cancer specialists published a letter in Blood saying that the prices of many new cancer drugs, including imatinib, are so high that people in the United States could not afford them, and that the level of prices, and profits, was so high as to be immoral. Signatories of the letter included Brian Druker, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, and John Goldman, developers of imatinib. They wrote that in 2001, imatinib was priced at $30,000 (equivalent to $53,274 in 2024) a year, which was based on the price of interferon, then the standard treatment, and that at this price Novartis would have recouped its initial development costs in two years. They wrote that after unexpectedly becoming a blockbuster, Novartis increased the price to $92,000 (equivalent to $126,005 in 2024) per year in 2012, with annual revenues of $4.7 billion. Other physicians have complained about the cost. Druker, who led the clinical studies, never received any royalties or profits from the success of the drug. By 2016, the average wholesale price had increased to $120,000 (equivalent to $157,221 in 2024) a year, according to an analysis prepared for The Washington Post by Stacie Dusetzina of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When competitive drugs came on the market, they were sold at a higher price to reflect the smaller population, and Novartis raised the price of Gleevec to match them. A 2012 economic analysis funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb estimated that the discovery and development of imatinib and related drugs had created $143 billion in societal value at a cost to consumers of approximately $14 billion. The $143 billion figure was based on an estimated 7.5 to 17.5 year survival advantage conferred by imatinib treatment, and included the value (discounted at 3% per annum) of ongoing benefits to society after the imatinib patent expiration. Prices for a 100 mg pill of Gleevec internationally range from $20 to $30, although generic imatinib is cheaper, as low as $2 per pill. === Controversies === ==== Patent litigation in India ==== Novartis fought a seven-year, controversial battle to patent Gleevec in India, and took the case all the way to the Indian Supreme Court. The patent application at the center of the case was filed by Novartis in India in 1998, after India had agreed to enter the World Trade Organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the TRIPS agreement. As part of this agreement, India made changes to its patent law, the biggest of which was that prior to these changes, patents on products were not allowed, while afterwards they were, albeit with restrictions. These changes came into effect in 2005, so Novartis' patent application waited in a ""mailbox"" with others until then, under procedures that India instituted to manage the transition. India also passed certain amendments to its patent law in 2005, just before the laws came into effect. The patent application claimed the final form of Gleevec (the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate).: 3 In 1993, during the time India did not allow patents on products, Novartis had patented imatinib, with salts vaguely specified, in many countries but could not patent it in India. The key differences between the two patent applications, were that 1998 patent application specified the counterion (Gleevec is a specific salt – imatinib mesylate) while the 1993 patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate, and the 1998 patent application specified the solid form of Gleevec – the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured (this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules) – while the 1993 patent application did not. The solid form of imatinib mesylate in Gleevec is beta crystalline. As provided under the TRIPS agreement, Novartis applied for Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMR) for Gleevec from the Indian Patent Office and the EMR was granted in November 2003. Novartis made use of the EMR to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched Gleevec in India. When examination of Novartis' patent application began in 2005, it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling Gleevec in India and by advocacy groups. The application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board. The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. That section, 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if ""they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy."" At one point, Novartis went to court to try to invalidate Section 3d; it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated TRIPS. Novartis lost that case and did not appeal. Novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to India's Supreme Court, which took the case. The Supreme Court case hinged on the interpretation of Section 3d. The Supreme Court issued its decision in 2013, ruling that the substance that Novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug (the raw form of imatinib, which was publicly disclosed in the 1993 patent application and in scientific articles), that Novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of Gleevec and the raw form of imatinib, and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts. == Research == One study demonstrated that imatinib mesylate was effective in patients with systemic mastocytosis, including those who had the D816V mutation in c-KIT. However, since imatinib binds to tyrosine kinases when they are in the inactive configuration and the D816V mutant of c-KIT is constitutively active, imatinib does not inhibit the kinase activity of the D816V mutant of c-KIT. Experience has shown, however, that imatinib is much less effective in patients with this mutation, and patients with the mutation comprise nearly 90% of cases of mastocytosis. Imatinib was initially thought to have a potential role in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. It was shown to reduce both the smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pulmonary vasculature in a variety of disease processes, including portopulmonary hypertension. However, a long-term trial of Imatinib in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension was unsuccessful, and serious and unexpected adverse events were frequent. These included 6 subdural hematomas and 17 deaths during or within 30 days of study end. In systemic sclerosis, the drug has been tested for potential use in slowing down pulmonary fibrosis. In laboratory settings, imatinib is being used as an experimental agent to suppress platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by inhibiting its receptor (PDGF-Rβ). One of its effects is delaying atherosclerosis in mice without or with diabetes. Mouse animal studies have suggested that imatinib and related drugs may be useful in treating smallpox, should an outbreak ever occur. In vitro studies identified that a modified version of imatinib can bind to gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP). GSAP selectively increases the production and accumulation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid plaques, which suggests that molecules which target GSAP and are able to cross blood–brain barrier are potential therapeutic agents for treating Alzheimer's disease. Another study suggests that imatinib may not need to cross the blood–brain barrier to be effective at treating Alzheimer's, as the research indicates the production of beta-amyloid may begin in the liver. Tests on mice indicate that imatinib is effective at reducing beta-amyloid in the brain. It is not known whether reduction of beta-amyloid is a feasible way of treating Alzheimer's, as an anti-beta-amyloid vaccine has been shown to clear the brain of plaques without having any effect on Alzheimer symptoms. A formulation of imatinib with a cyclodextrin (Captisol) as a carrier to overcome the blood–brain barrier has shown reversal of opioid tolerance in a 2012 study in rats. Imatinib is an experimental drug in the treatment of desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis. == Etymology == The -tinib word stem makes reference to the drug's action as a tyrosine kinase (TYK) inhibitor. == References == == External links == ""Imatinib mesylate"".

A registration application was filed in April 1995, and in April 2002, nicaraven was still awaiting registration in Japan. By August 2002, Chugai had filed an NDA in Japan for the additional indication of subarachnoidal bleeding. Inflammatory microenvironment is known to accelerate the progression of malignant tumors. We investigated the possible anti-inflammatory effect of nicaraven on slowing tumor growth. Tumor-bearing mice randomly received nicaraven injection (50 mg/kg daily, i.p, n = 8) or placebo treatment (n = 8) for 10 days, and then sacrificed for evaluations. Nicaraven administration effectively inhibited the fast growth of tumor, as a large tumor (> 1.0 g) developed finally in three of the eight mice received placebo treatment. Cytokines/chemokines array indicated that nicaraven reduced the levels of CXCL10 and SDF-1 in the tumor as well as the levels of IL-2 and MIP-2 in serum. Immunofluorescence staining showed that nicaraven significantly reduced the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils in the tumor. Interestingly, western blot indicated that the expression of CD86, CD206, and NIMP-R14 was especially enhanced in the three large-size tumors, suggesting the potential role of nicaraven in preventing the hyper-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the expression of PARP-1 was downregulated, but the expression of phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-MKK-3/6, and phospho-MSK-1 was upregulated in the large-size tumors, suggesting the involvement of p38 MAPK pathway in the anti-inflammatory effect of nicaraven. Taken together, our study suggests that nicaraven may effectively prevent the fast growth of inflamed tumors by an anti-inflammatory mechanism. Nicaraven has been reported to inhibit the activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP).

The most commonly discussed compound nonoxynol-9 is a spermicide, formulated primarily as a component of vaginal foams and creams. Nonoxynol was found to metabolize into free nonylphenol when administered to lab animals. Arkopal-N60, with on average 6 ethylene glycol units is a related used surfactant. == Production == Nonoxynols are produced by ethoxylation of alkylphenols and vary in the number of repeating ethoxy (oxy-1,2-ethanediyl) groups resulting in Nonoxynol-4, Nonoxynol-7, Nonoxynol-9, Nonoxynol-14, Nonoxynol-15, Nonoxynol-18, Nonoxynol-40, Nonoxynol-30 and Nonoxynol-50. Other synonyms are polyethylene glycol (PEG)-7 Nonyl phenyl ether, PEG-14 Nonyl phenyl ether, PEG-18 Nonyl phenyl ether and PEG-50 Nonyl phenyl ether. The precursor nonylphenol is derived from phenol and a mixture of nonenes. == Use == Nonoxynols have been used as detergents, emulsifiers and wetting agents in cosmetics, including hair products, and defoaming agents. Only nonoxynol-9 with 9 repeating ethoxy groups, has been used as a spermaticide, for vaginal foams and creams, and on condoms. == Toxicity concerns == Concerns about the environmental impact of these compounds has increased since the 1990s. These surfactants have a mild to medium estrogenic function. Consequently, this class of detergents has been effectively restricted for commercial ""down-the-drain"" applications in Europe, and these compounds are no longer used by U.S. laundry manufacturers. On January 14, 2016, the European Commission amended existing restriction on nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPE) under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation, limiting NPE use in industrial and institutional cleaning, domestic cleaning, cosmetics and other applications including spermicides and in use as co-formulants in pesticides (except for pesticides where prior authorization was granted before July 17, 2003 in which effects of the restriction will not occur until date of their expiration) amounts equal to or exceeding 0.1% by weight, and limiting NPE residues on textile articles to 0.01% by weight, effective February 3, 2021. Previously, the use of NPE was forbidden within the EU, but there was no limit on the level of NPE residue on imported articles. On 13 August 2008, the Swedish newspaper Göteborg Posten (sv) reported finding high levels of the NPE in Björn Borg underwear. A 2011 investigation found residual levels of NPE in samples of clothing from 14 brands sold in the U.S., including Adidas, Uniqlo, Calvin Klein, H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch, Lacoste, Converse and Ralph Lauren. == References == == External links == J.K.G.

2201,"('Trilostane', 'Win 24540', 'Modrenal', 'Vetoryl', 'Modrastane')",Medical,"Trilostane, sold under the brand name Vetoryl among others, is a medication which has been used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, Conn's syndrome, and postmenopausal breast cancer in humans. It was withdrawn for use in humans in the United States in the 1990s but was subsequently approved for use in veterinary medicine in the 2000s to treat Cushing's syndrome in dogs. It is taken by mouth. == Medical uses == Trilostane has been used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome (hypercortisolism), Conn's syndrome (hyperaldosteronism), and postmenopausal breast cancer in humans. When used to treat breast cancer, trilostane is administered in combination with a corticosteroid to prevent glucocorticoid deficiency. == Contraindications == Trilostane should not be used in pregnant women. Trilostane should not be given to a dog that: Has kidney or liver disease Takes certain medications used to treat cardiovascular disease Is pregnant, nursing or intended for breeding == Side effects == Side effects of trilostane in conjunction with a corticosteroid in humans include gastrointestinal side effects like gastritis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease the incidence of diarrhea with trilostane. Serious gastrointestinal side effects of trilostane alone or in combination with an NSAID like peptic ulcer, erosive gastritis, gastric perforation, hematemesis, and melena may occur in some individuals. Reversible granulocytopenia and transient oral paresthesia may occur with trilostane. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Trilostane is a steroidogenesis inhibitor. It is specifically an inhibitor of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). As a result of this action, trilostane blocks the conversion of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroids, including pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenediol, into Δ4-3-ketosteroids, including progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone, respectively. Consequently, trilostane inhibits the production of all classes of steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, progestogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids. The mechanism of action of trilostane in Cushing's syndrome and Conn's syndrome is by inhibiting the production of corticosteroids such as cortisol and aldosterone in the adrenal glands. Trilostane has also been used as an abortifacient due to its inhibition of progesterone synthesis. Trilostane is not an aromatase inhibitor and hence does not inhibit the conversion of androgens like androstenedione and testosterone into estrogens like estrone and estradiol. However, trilostane may nonetheless inhibit estrogen synthesis by inhibiting androgen synthesis. In addition to steroidogenesis inhibition, trilostane has been found to act as a noncompetitive antiestrogen, via direct and presumably allosteric interactions with the estrogen receptor. The effectiveness of trilostane in postmenopausal breast cancer may relate to this apparent antiestrogenic activity. Trilostane has also been found to act as an agonist of the androgen receptor. As such, its use in men with prostate cancer may warrant caution. === Pharmacokinetics === Trilostane is metabolized in the liver. The major metabolite of trilostane is 17-ketotrilostane. The conversion of trilostane into 17-ketotrilostane is reversible, suggesting that trilostane and 17-ketotrilostane undergo interconversion in the body. 17-Ketotrilostane circulates at 3-fold higher levels than trilostane and is more active than trilostane as a 3β-HSD inhibitor. The elimination half-lives of trilostane and 17-ketotrilostane are both 1.2 hours, with both compounds cleared from the blood within 6 to 8 hours of a dose of trilostane. 17-Ketotrilostane is excreted by the kidneys. == Chemistry == Trilostane, also known as 4α,5-epoxy-3,17β-dihydroxy-5α-androst-2-ene-2-carbonitrile, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of 5α-reduced androstane derivatives like 3α-androstanediol, 3β-androstanediol, and dihydrotestosterone. === Synthesis === Trilostane is prepared from testosterone in a four-step synthesis. == History == Trilostane was withdrawn from human use in the United States market in April 1994. It continued to be available in the United Kingdom for use in humans under the brand name Modrenal for the treatment of Cushing's disease and breast cancer in humans, but was eventually discontinued in this country as well. Trilostane was approved in the United States in 2008 for the treatment of Cushing's disease (hyperadrenocorticism) in dogs under the brand name Vetoryl. It was available by prescription in the United Kingdom for dogs under the Vetoryl brand name for some time before it was approved in the United States. The drug is also used to treat the skin disorder Alopecia X in dogs. Trilostane was the first drug approved to treat both pituitary- and adrenal-dependent Cushing's in dogs. Only one other drug, Anipryl (veterinary brand name) selegiline, is FDA-approved to treat Cushing's disease in dogs, but only to treat uncomplicated, pituitary-dependent Cushing's. The only previous treatment for the disease was the use of mitotane (brand name Lysodren) off-label. A number of compounding pharmacies in the United States sell trilostane for dogs. Since the United States approval of Vetoryl in December 2008, compounding pharmacies are no longer able to use a bulk drug product for compounding purposes, but must prepare the compounded drug from Vetoryl. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In March 2024, the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the veterinary medicinal product Trilocur, oral suspension for dogs. The applicant for this veterinary medicinal product is Emdoka. In March 2024, the CVMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the veterinary medicinal product Trilorale, oral suspension for dogs. The applicant for this veterinary medicinal product is Axience. Trilocur and Trilorale were approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2024. === Generic names === Trilostane is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its developmental code name was WIN-24,540. === Brand names === Trilostane has been marketed under a number of brand names including Desopan, Modrastane, Modrenal, Trilox, Vetoryl, Oncovet TL and Winstan. === Availability === Trilostane is available for veterinary use in countries throughout the world. == Veterinary uses == Trilostane is used for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome in dogs.

2203,"('Olanzapine', 'Zyprexa', 'Olansek', 'Zyprexa zydis', 'Zalasta')",Medical,"Olanzapine, sold under the brand name Zyprexa among others, is an atypical antipsychotic primarily used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is also sometimes used off-label for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and as an appetite stimulant. For schizophrenia, it can be used for both new-onset disease and long-term maintenance. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include significant weight gain, feeling tired, dizziness, constipation, dry mouth, and restlessness. Other side effects include low blood pressure with standing, allergic reactions, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, diabetes mellitus, seizures, and tardive dyskinesia. In older people with dementia, its use increases the risk of death. Use in the later part of pregnancy may result in a movement disorder in the baby for some time after birth. Although its mechanism of action is not entirely clear, it is known to block dopamine and serotonin receptors. Olanzapine was patented in 1991 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 171st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == It is approved by the FDA for the following indications: schizophrenia. acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder. adjunct to lithium or valproate in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. combination olanzapine/fluoxetine (Symbyax) for the treatment of depressive episodes of bipolar I disorder and for treatment-resistant depression. combination olanzapine/samidorphan (Lybalvi) for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. Lybalvi suppresses the metabolic side effect of olanzapine. More precisely, olanzapine produces weight gain of about 9kg (20 pounds) in the short-term, which typically increases to around 23–45kg (50–100 pounds) following long-term use. In contrast, Lybalvi only triggers roughly 5kg (11 pounds) before subsiding. In the United Kingdom and Australia, it is approved for schizophrenia, moderate to severe manic episodes, alone, or in combination with lithium or valproate and the short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Olanzapine is also used off-label for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. === Schizophrenia === The first-line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. Olanzapine appears to be effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia, treating acute exacerbations, and treating early-onset schizophrenia. The usefulness of maintenance therapy, however, is difficult to determine, as more than half of people in trials quit before the 6-week completion date. Treatment with olanzapine (like clozapine) may result in increased weight gain and increased glucose and cholesterol levels when compared to most other second-generation antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia. === Bipolar disorder === Olanzapine is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as a first-line therapy for the treatment of acute mania in bipolar disorder. Other recommended first-line treatments are aripiprazole, haloperidol, quetiapine, and risperidone. It is recommended in combination with fluoxetine as a first-line therapy for acute bipolar depression, and as a second-line treatment by itself for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. The Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments recommends olanzapine as a first-line maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder and the combination of olanzapine with fluoxetine as a second-line treatment for bipolar depression. A review on the efficacy of olanzapine as maintenance therapy in people with bipolar disorder was published in 2006. A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that olanzapine with fluoxetine was the most effective among nine treatments for bipolar depression included in the analysis. === Specific populations === ==== Pregnancy and lactation ==== Olanzapine is associated with the highest placental exposure of any atypical antipsychotic. Despite this, the available evidence suggests it is safe during pregnancy, although the evidence is insufficiently strong to say anything with a high degree of confidence. Olanzapine is associated with weight gain, which according to recent studies, may put olanzapine-treated patients' offspring at a heightened risk for neural tube defects (e.g. spina bifida). Breastfeeding in women taking olanzapine is advised against because olanzapine is secreted in breast milk, with one study finding that the exposure to the infant is about 1.8% that of the mother. ==== Elderly ==== Citing an increased risk of stroke, in 2004, the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in the UK issued a warning that olanzapine and risperidone, both atypical antipsychotic medications, should not be given to elderly patients with dementia. In the U.S., olanzapine comes with a black box warning for increased risk of death in elderly patients. It is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis. A BBC investigation in June 2008 found that this advice was being widely ignored by British doctors. Evidence suggested that the elderly are more likely to experience weight gain on olanzapine compared to aripiprazole and risperidone. == Adverse effects == The principal side effect of olanzapine is weight gain, which may be profound in some cases and/or associated with derangement in blood-lipid and blood-sugar profiles (see section metabolic effects). A 2013 meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerance of 15 antipsychotic drugs (APDs) found that it had the highest propensity for causing weight gain out of the 15 APDs compared with an SMD of 0.74. Extrapyramidal side effects, although potentially serious, are infrequent to rare from olanzapine, but may include tremors and muscle rigidity. Although olanzapine causes an early dose-related rise in prolactin, this is less frequent and less marked than that seen with haloperidol, and is usually transient. A rise in prolactin is seen in about half of patients on olanzapine compared to over 90% of those taking risperidone, and enduring increases were less frequent in those taking olanzapine. It is not recommended to be used by IM injection in acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, recent heart surgery, severe hypotension, sick sinus syndrome, and unstable angina. Several patient groups are at a heightened risk of side effects from olanzapine and antipsychotics in general. Olanzapine may produce nontrivial high blood sugar in people with diabetes mellitus. Likewise, the elderly are at a greater risk of falls and accidental injury. Young males appear to be at heightened risk of dystonic reactions, although these are relatively rare with olanzapine. Most antipsychotics, including olanzapine, may disrupt the body's natural thermoregulatory systems, thus permitting excursions to dangerous levels when certain situations (exposure to heat, strenuous exercise) occur. Other side effects possibly include galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and erectile dysfunction (impotence). === Drug-induced OCD === Many different types of medication can create or induce pure obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in people who have never had symptoms before. === Metabolic effects === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires atypical antipsychotics to include a warning about the risk of developing hyperglycemia and diabetes, both of which are factors in the metabolic syndrome. These effects may be related to the drugs' ability to induce weight gain, although some reports have been made of metabolic changes in the absence of weight gain. Studies have indicated that olanzapine carries a greater risk of causing and exacerbating diabetes than another commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic, risperidone. Of all the atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine is the most likely to induce significant weight gain based on various measures. The effect is dose dependent in humans and animal models of olanzapine-induced metabolic side effects. There are some case reports of olanzapine-induced diabetic ketoacidosis. Olanzapine may decrease insulin sensitivity, though one 3-week study seems to refute this. It may also increase triglyceride levels. Despite weight gain, a large multicenter, randomized National Institute of Mental Health study found that olanzapine was better at controlling symptoms because patients were more likely to remain on olanzapine than the other drugs. One small, open-label, nonrandomized study suggests that taking olanzapine by orally dissolving tablets may induce less weight gain, but this has not been substantiated in a blinded experimental setting. === Post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome === Postinjection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) is a rare syndrome that is specific to the long-acting injectable formulation of olanzapine, olanzapine pamoate. The incidence of PDSS with olanzapine pamoate is estimated to be 0.07% of administrations, and is unique among other second-generation, long-acting antipsychotics (e.g. paliperidone palmitate), which do not appear to carry the same risk. PDSS is characterized by symptoms of delirium (e.g. confusion, difficulty speaking, and uncoordinated movements) and sedation. Most people with PDSS exhibit both delirium and sedation (83%). Although less specific to PDSS, a majority of cases (67%) involved a feeling of general discomfort. PDSS may occur due to accidental injection and absorption of olanzapine pamoate into the bloodstream, where it can act more rapidly, as opposed to slowly distributing out from muscle tissue. Using the proper, intramuscular-injection technique for olanzapine pamoate helps to decrease the risk of PDSS, though it does not eliminate it entirely. This is why the FDA advises that people who are injected with olanzapine pamoate be watched for 3 hours after administration, in the event that PDSS occurs. === Animal toxicology === Olanzapine has demonstrated carcinogenic effects in multiple studies when exposed chronically to female mice and rats, but not male mice and rats. The tumors found were in either the liver or mammary glands of the animals. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly, vertigo, numbness, or muscle pains may occur. Symptoms generally resolve after a short time. Tentative evidence indicates that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis, as a temporary withdrawal symptom. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely, tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Overdose == Symptoms of an overdose include tachycardia, agitation, dysarthria, decreased consciousness, and coma. Death has been reported after an acute overdose of 450 mg, but also survival after an acute overdose of 2000 mg. Fatalities generally have occurred with olanzapine plasma concentrations greater than 1000 ng/mL post mortem, with concentrations up to 5200 ng/mL recorded (though this might represent confounding by dead tissue, which may release olanzapine into the blood upon death). No specific antidote for olanzapine overdose is known, and even physicians are recommended to call a certified poison control center for information on the treatment of such a case. Olanzapine is considered moderately toxic in overdose, more toxic than quetiapine, aripiprazole, and the SSRIs, and less toxic than the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. == Interactions == Drugs or agents that increase the activity of the enzyme CYP1A2, notably tobacco smoke, may significantly increase hepatic first-pass clearance of olanzapine; conversely, drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 activity (examples: ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) may reduce olanzapine clearance. Carbamazepine, a known enzyme inducer, has decreased the concentration/dose ratio of olanzapine by 33% compared to olanzapine alone. Another enzyme inducer, ritonavir, has also been shown to decrease the body's exposure to olanzapine, due to its induction of the enzymes CYP1A2 and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Probenecid increases the total exposure (area under the curve) and maximum plasma concentration of olanzapine. Although olanzapine's metabolism includes the minor metabolic pathway of CYP2D6, the presence of the CYP2D6 inhibitor fluoxetine does not have a clinically significant effect on olanzapine's clearance. Olanzapine has been used as a hallucinogen antidote to block the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Olanzapine was first discovered while searching for a chemical analog of clozapine that would not require hematological monitoring. Investigation on a series of thiophene isosteres on 1 of the phenyl rings in clozapine, a thienobenzodiazepine analog (olanzapine) was discovered. Olanzapine has a higher affinity for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors than D2 dopamine receptors, which is a common property of most atypical antipsychotics, aside from the benzamide antipsychotics such as amisulpride along with the nonbenzamides aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, blonanserin, cariprazine, melperone, and perospirone. In one study D2 receptor occupancy was 60% with low-dose olanzapine (5 mg/day) and occupancy with high dose at 83% (20 mg/day). In the usual clinical dose range of 10–20 mg/day, D2 receptor occupancy varied from 71% to 80%. Olanzapine occupancy at 5-HT2A receptor are high at all doses (5 mg to 20 mg). It is reported that 5 mg dose of olanzapine produced a mean occupancy of 85% at 5 mg, 88% at 10 mg, and 93% at 20 mg dose. Olanzapine had the highest affinity of any second-generation antipsychotic towards the P-glycoprotein in one in vitro study. P-glycoprotein transports a myriad of drugs across a number of different biological membranes (found in numerous body systems) including the blood–brain barrier (a semipermeable membrane that filters the contents of blood prior to it reaching the brain); P-GP inhibition could mean that less brain exposure to olanzapine results from this interaction with the P-glycoprotein. A relatively large quantity of commonly encountered foods and medications inhibit P-GP, and pharmaceuticals fairly commonly are either substrates of P-GP or inhibit its action; both substrates and inhibitors of P-GP effectively increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to P-GP substrates and subsequently increase the central activity of the substrate, while reducing the local effects on the GI tract. The mediation of olanzapine in the central nervous system by P-GP means that any other substance or drug that interacts with P-GP increases the risk for toxic accumulations of both olanzapine and the other drug. Olanzapine is a potent antagonist of the muscarinic M3 receptor, which may underlie its diabetogenic side effects. Additionally, it also exhibits a relatively low affinity for serotonin 5-HT1, GABAA, β-adrenergic receptors, and benzodiazepine binding sites. Although antagonistic effects of olanzapine at 5-HT2C alone are not associated with weight gain, olanzapine antagonism at histaminergic H1, and muscarinic M3 receptors have been implicated in weight gain. The mode of action of olanzapine's antipsychotic activity is unknown. It may involve antagonism of dopamine and serotonin receptors. Antagonism of dopamine receptors is associated with extrapyramidal effects such as tardive dyskinesia (TD), and with therapeutic effects. Antagonism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is associated with anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth and constipation; in addition, it may suppress or reduce the emergence of extrapyramidal effects for the duration of treatment, but it offers no protection against the development of TD. In common with other second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics, olanzapine poses a relatively low risk of extrapyramidal side effects including TD, due to its higher affinity for the 5HT2A receptor over the D2 receptor. Antagonizing H1 histamine receptors causes sedation and may cause weight gain, although antagonistic actions at serotonin 5-HT2C and dopamine D2 receptors have also been associated with weight gain and appetite stimulation. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Metabolism ==== Olanzapine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system; principally by isozyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6. By these mechanisms, more than 40% of the oral dose, on average, is removed by the hepatic first-pass effect. Clearance of olanzapine appears to vary by sex; women have roughly 25% lower clearance than men. Clearance of olanzapine also varies by race; in self-identified African Americans or Blacks, olanzapine's clearance was 26% higher. A difference in the clearance is not apparent between individuals identifying as Caucasian, Chinese, or Japanese. Routine, pharmacokinetic monitoring of olanzapine plasma levels is generally unwarranted, though unusual circumstances (e.g. the presence of drug-drug interactions) or a desire to determine if patients are taking their medicine may prompt its use. ==== Chemistry ==== Olanzapine is unusual in having four well-characterised crystalline polymorphs and many hydrated forms. == Chemical synthesis == The preparation of olanzapine was first disclosed in a series of patents from Eli Lilly & Co. in the 1990s. In the final two steps, 5-methyl-2-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-3-thiophenecarbonitrile was reduced with stannous chloride in ethanol to give the substituted thienobenzodiazepine ring system, and this was treated with methylpiperazine in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and toluene as solvent to produce the drug. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Olanzapine is approved by the US FDA for: Treatment—in combination with fluoxetine—of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (December 2003). Long-term treatment of bipolar I disorder (January 2004). Long-term treatment—in combination with fluoxetine—of resistant depression (March 2009) Oral formulation: acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults, acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (monotherapy and in combination with lithium or sodium valproate) Intramuscular formulation: acute agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania in adults Oral formulation combined with fluoxetine: treatment of acute depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults, or treatment of acute, resistant depression in adults Treatment of the manifestations of psychotic disorders (September 1996 – March 2000). Short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (March 2000) Short-term treatment of schizophrenia instead of the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders (March 2000) Maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable for about eight weeks and were then followed for a period of up to eight months (November 2000) The drug became generic in 2011. Sales of Zyprexa in 2008 were $2.2 billion in the US and $4.7 billion worldwide. === Controversy and litigation === Eli Lilly has faced many lawsuits from people who claimed they developed diabetes or other diseases after taking Zyprexa, as well as by various governmental entities, insurance companies, and others. Lilly produced a large number of documents as part of the discovery phase of this litigation, which started in 2004; the documents were ruled to be confidential by a judge and placed under seal, and later themselves became the subject of litigation. In 2006, Lilly paid $700 million to settle around 8,000 of these lawsuits, and in early 2007, Lilly settled around 18,000 suits for $500 million, which brought the total Lilly had paid to settle suits related to the drug to $1.2 billion. A December 2006 New York Times article based on leaked company documents concluded that the company had engaged in a deliberate effort to downplay olanzapine's side effects. The company denied these allegations and stated that the article had been based on cherry-picked documents. The documents were provided to the Times by Jim Gottstein, a lawyer who represented mentally ill patients, who obtained them from a doctor, David Egilman, who was serving as an expert consultant on the case. After the documents were leaked to online peer-to-peer, file-sharing networks by Will Hall and others in the psychiatric survivors movement, who obtained copies, in 2007 Lilly filed a protection order to stop the dissemination of some of the documents, which Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Brooklyn Federal District Court granted. Judge Weinstein also criticized the New York Times reporter, Gottstein, and Egilman in the ruling. The Times of London also received the documents and reported that as early as 1998, Lilly considered the risk of drug-induced obesity to be a ""top threat"" to Zyprexa sales. On 9 October 2000, senior Lilly research physician Robert Baker noted that an academic advisory board to which he belonged was ""quite impressed by the magnitude of weight gain on olanzapine and implications for glucose."" Lilly had threatened Egilman with criminal contempt charges regarding the documents he took and provided to reporters; in September 2007, he agreed to pay Lilly $100,000 in return for the company's agreement to drop the threat of charges. In September 2008, Judge Weinstein issued an order to make public Lilly's internal documents about the drug in a different suit brought by insurance companies, pension funds, and other payors. In March 2008, Lilly settled a suit with the state of Alaska, and in October 2008, Lilly agreed to pay $62 million to 32 states and the District of Columbia to settle suits brought under state consumer protection laws. In 2009, Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to a US federal criminal misdemeanor charge of illegally marketing Zyprexa for off-label use and agreed to pay $1.4 billion. The settlement announcement stated ""Eli Lilly admits that between September 1999 and March 31, 2001, the company promoted Zyprexa in elderly populations as a treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer's dementia. Eli Lilly has agreed to pay a $515 million criminal fine and to forfeit an additional $100 million in assets."" The outcomes described here, and their legal ramifications, were fueled by motions and appeals that were not resolved until 2010. In 2021, Gottstein summarized this tangle of legal activities, and their impact on the political landscape of psychiatry and antipsychiatry in the US, in The Zyprexa Papers. === Brand names === Olanzapine is generic and available under many brand names worldwide. === Dosage forms === Olanzapine is marketed in many countries, with tablets ranging from 2.5 to 20 mg. Zyprexa (and generic olanzapine) is available as an orally disintegrating ""wafer"", which rapidly dissolves in saliva. It is also available in 10-mg vials for intramuscular injection. == Research == Olanzapine may be useful in promoting weight gain in underweight adult outpatients with anorexia nervosa. However, no improvement in psychological symptoms was noted. It has also been shown to be helpful in the management of cancer-related anorexia. Olanzapine has been shown to help address a range of anxiety and depressive symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, and has since been used in the treatment of a range of mood and anxiety disorders. Olanzapine is no less effective than lithium or valproate and more effective than placebo in treating bipolar disorder. It has also been used for Tourette syndrome and stuttering. Olanzapine has been studied for the treatment of hyperactivity, aggressive behavior, and repetitive behaviors in autism. Olanzapine is frequently prescribed off-label for the treatment of insomnia, including difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, even though such use is not recommended. The daytime sedation experienced with olanzapine is generally comparable to quetiapine and lurasidone, which is a frequent complaint in clinical trials. In some cases, the sedation due to olanzapine impaired the ability of people to wake up at a consistent time every day. Some evidence of efficacy for treating insomnia is seen; however, side effects such as dyslipidemia and neutropenia, which may be observed even at low doses, outweigh any potential benefits for insomnia that are not due to an underlying mental health condition. Olanzapine has been recommended to be used in antiemetic regimens in people receiving chemotherapy that has a high risk for vomiting. Olanzapine has been studied as an antiemetic, particularly for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). In general, olanzapine appears to be about as effective as aprepitant for the prevention of CINV, though some concerns remain about its use in this population. For example, concomitant use of metoclopramide or haloperidol increases the risk for extrapyramidal symptoms. Otherwise, olanzapine appears to be fairly well tolerated for this indication, with somnolence being the most common side effect. Olanzapine is more effective than metoclopramide for breakthrough CINV. It is also more effective than placebo when added to a combination of palonosetron, dexamethasone and aprepitant. Olanzapine has been considered as part of an early psychosis approach for schizophrenia. The Prevention through Risk Identification, Management, and Education study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and Eli Lilly, tested the hypothesis that olanzapine might prevent the onset of psychosis in people at very high risk for schizophrenia. The study examined 60 patients with prodromal schizophrenia, who were at an estimated risk of 36–54% of developing schizophrenia within a year and treated half with olanzapine and half with placebo. In this study, patients receiving olanzapine did not have a significantly lower risk of progressing to psychosis (16.1% vs 37.9%). Olanzapine was effective for treating the prodromal symptoms but was associated with significant weight gain. == References == == External links == Alex B (5 January 2007).

2204,"('Betaine (hydrochloride)', 'Betaine chloride', 'Cystadane', 'Carboxymethyl(trimethyl)azanium', 'Loramine amb-13')","Endogenous, Medical","Trimethylglycine is an amino acid derivative with the formula (CH3)3N+CH2CO−2. A colorless, water-soluble solid, it occurs in plants. Trimethylglycine is a zwitterion: the molecule contains both a quaternary ammonium group and a carboxylate group. Trimethylglycine was the first betaine discovered; originally it was simply called betaine because it was discovered in sugar beets (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris). Several other betaines are now known. == Medical uses == Betaine, sold under the brand name Cystadane is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of homocystinuria, involving deficiencies or defects in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), or cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl). The most common side effect is elevated levels of methionine in the blood. The EU has authorized the health claim that betaine ""contributes to normal homocysteine metabolism."". == Biological function == === Biosynthesis === In most organisms, glycine betaine is biosynthesized by oxidation of choline. The intermediate, betaine aldehyde, is generated by the action of the enzyme mitochondrial choline oxidase (choline dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.99.1). In mice, betaine aldehyde is further oxidised in the mitochondria by the enzyme betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.8). In humans betaine aldehyde activity is performed by a nonspecific cystosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme (EC 1.2.1.3) Trimethylglycine is produced by some cyanobacteria, as established by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. It is proposed to protect for some enzymes, against inhibition by NaCl and KCl. ==== Osmolyte ==== Trimethylglycine is an osmolyte, a water-soluble salt-like substance. Sugar beet was cultivated from sea beet, which requires osmolytes in order to survive the salty soils of coastal areas. Trimethylglycine also occurs in high concentrations (~10 mM) in many marine invertebrates, such as crustaceans and molluscs. It serves as a appetitive attractant to generalist carnivores such as the predatory sea slug Pleurobranchaea californica. ==== Methyl donor ==== Trimethylglycine is a cofactor in methylation, a process that occurs in all mammals. These processes include the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. Methylation is also required for the biosynthesis of melatonin and the electron transport chain constituent coenzyme Q10, as well as the methylation of DNA for epigenetics. One step in the methylation cycle is the remethylation of homocysteine, a compound which is naturally generated during demethylation of the essential amino acid methionine. Despite its natural formation, homocysteine has been linked to inflammation, depression, specific forms of dementia, and various types of vascular disease. The remethylation process that detoxifies homocysteine and converts it back to methionine can occur via either of two pathways. The pathway present in virtually all cells involves the enzyme methionine synthase (MS), which requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor, and also depends indirectly on folate and other B vitamins. The second pathway (restricted to liver and kidney in most mammals) involves betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) and requires trimethylglycine as a cofactor. During normal physiological conditions, the two pathways contribute equally to removal of homocysteine in the body. Further degradation of betaine, via the enzyme dimethylglycine dehydrogenase produces folate, thus contributing back to methionine synthase. Betaine is thus involved in the synthesis of many biologically important molecules, and may be even more important in situations where the major pathway for the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine has been compromised by genetic polymorphisms such as mutations in the MS gene. == Agriculture and aquaculture == Trimethylglycine is used as a supplement for both animals and plants. Processing sucrose from sugar beets yields glycine betaine as a byproduct. The economic significance of trimethylglycine is comparable to that of sugar in sugar beets. Salmon farms apply trimethylglycine to relieve the osmotic pressure on the fishes' cells when workers transfer the fish from freshwater to saltwater. Trimethylglycine supplementation decreases the amount of adipose tissue in pigs; however, research in human subjects has shown no effect on body weight, body composition, or resting energy expenditure. == Nutrition == Nutritionally, betaine is not needed when sufficient dietary choline is present for synthesis. When insufficient betaine is available, elevated homocysteine levels and decreased SAM levels in blood occur. Supplementation of betaine in this situation would resolve these blood marker issues, but not compensate for other functions of choline. === Dietary supplement === Trimethylglycine supplementation decreases the amount of adipose tissue in pigs, and new research on human subjects has shown a statistically significant effect on body fat reduction when used in conjunction with a low calorie diet. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved betaine trimethylglycine (also known by the brand name Cystadane) for the treatment of homocystinuria, a disease caused by abnormally high homocysteine levels at birth. Trimethylglycine is also used as the hydrochloride salt (marketed as betaine hydrochloride or betaine HCl). Betaine hydrochloride was sold over-the-counter (OTC) as a purported gastric aid in the United States. US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Section 310.540, which became effective in November 1993, banned the marketing of betaine hydrochloride as a digestive aid due to insufficient evidence to classify it as ""generally recognized as safe and effective"" for that specified use. ==== Side effects ==== Trimethylglycine supplementation may cause diarrhea, bloating, cramps, dyspepsia, nausea or vomiting. Although rare, it can also causes excessive increases in serum methionine concentrations in the brain, which may lead to cerebral edema, a life-threatening condition. Trimethylglycine supplementation lowers homocysteine but also raises (given in high doses of 6g/day) LDL-cholesterol in obese individuals and renal patients. == References == == External links == USDA Database for the Choline Content of Common Foods – including the data on choline metabolites, such as betaine, in 434 food items.",Cystadane,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0054674712009727955), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.12697461247444153), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -1.3306015716807451e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -9.627176768844947e-05), (' FOOD', -4.320199877838604e-07)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0018233117880299687), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.0031829429790377617), ('ĠFOOD', -0.049298275262117386), (',', -0.3869383931159973), ('ĠEND', -0.08093190938234329), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00863910373300314)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

2206,"('Acetophenone', 'Methyl phenyl ketone', 'Acetylbenzene', 'Phenyl methyl ketone', 'Ethanone, 1-phenyl-')","Medical, Industrial","Acetophenone is the organic compound with the formula C6H5C(O)CH3. It is the simplest aromatic ketone. This colorless, viscous liquid is a precursor to useful resins and fragrances. == Production == Acetophenone is formed as a byproduct of the cumene process, the industrial route for the synthesis of phenol and acetone. In the Hock rearrangement of isopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, migration of a methyl group rather than the phenyl group gives acetophenone and methanol as a result of an alternate rearrangement of the intermediate: C6H5C(CH3)2O2H → C6H5C(O)CH3 + CH3OH The cumene process is conducted on such a large scale that even the small amount of acetophenone by-product can be recovered in commercially useful quantities. Acetophenone is also generated from ethylbenzene hydroperoxide. Ethylbenzene hydroperoxide is primarily converted to 1-phenylethanol (α-methylbenzyl alcohol) in the process with a small amount of by-product acetophenone. Acetophenone is recovered or hydrogenated to 1-phenylethanol which is then dehydrated to produce styrene. == Uses == === Precursor to resins === Commercially significant resins are produced from treatment of acetophenone with formaldehyde and a base. The resulting copolymers are conventionally described with the formula [(C6H5COCH)x(CH2)x]n, resulting from aldol condensation. These substances are components of coatings and inks. Modified acetophenone-formaldehyde resins are produced by the hydrogenation of the aforementioned ketone-containing resins. The resulting polyol can be further crosslinked with diisocyanates. The modified resins are found in coatings, inks and adhesives. === Niche uses === Acetophenone is an ingredient in fragrances that resemble almond, cherry, honeysuckle, jasmine, and strawberry. It is used in chewing gum. It is also listed as an approved excipient by the U.S. FDA. === Laboratory reagent === In instructional laboratories, acetophenone is converted to styrene in a two-step process that illustrates the reduction of carbonyls using sodium borohydride and the dehydration of alcohols: 4 C6H5C(O)CH3 + NaBH4 + 4 H2O → 4 C6H5CH(OH)CH3 + NaOH + B(OH)3 C6H5CH(OH)CH3 → C6H5CH=CH2 + H2O A similar two-step process is used industrially, but reduction step is performed by hydrogenation over a copper chromite catalyst: C6H5C(O)CH3 + H2 → C6H5CH(OH)CH3 Being prochiral, acetophenone is also a popular test substrate for asymmetric hydrogenation experiments. === Drugs === Acetophenone is used for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals. == Natural occurrence == Acetophenone occurs naturally in many foods including apple, cheese, apricot, banana, beef, and cauliflower. It is also a component of castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature beaver. == Pharmacology == In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, acetophenone was used in medicine. It was marketed as a hypnotic and anticonvulsant under brand name Hypnone. The typical dosage was 0.12 to 0.3 milliliters. It was considered to have superior sedative effects to both paraldehyde and chloral hydrate. In humans, acetophenone is metabolized to benzoic acid, carbonic acid, and acetone. Hippuric acid occurs as an indirect metabolite and its quantity in urine may be used to confirm acetophenone exposure, although other substances, like toluene, also induce hippuric acid in urine. == Toxicity == The LD50 is 815 mg/kg (oral, rats). Acetophenone is currently listed as a Group D carcinogen indicating that there is no evidence at present that it causes cancer in humans. == References ==",Phenyl methyl ketone,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.12729720771312714), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' INDUSTR', -0.3136902153491974), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.006721059791743755), (' PERSONAL', -7.600714161526412e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.4866824746131897), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', 0.0), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -1.5020257706055418e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.028236297890543938), (',', -0.038072627037763596), ('ĠMED', -0.3141981363296509), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12699063122272491)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100322174,https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/p-5983-acetophenone-phenyl-methyl-ketone.aspx ', [])"

It has a black box warning about the risk of serious dehydration in children in the US; the most common adverse effects in others include diarrhea. It is an oligopeptide agonist of guanylate cyclase 2C and remains in the GI tract after it is taken by mouth. It was approved in the US and the European Union in 2012. It is marketed by Abbvie (formerly Allergan) in the United states and by Astellas in Asia; Ironwood Pharmaceuticals was the originator. In 2022, it was the 189th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical use == Linaclotide is indicated to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic constipation with no known cause. In June 2023, the indication was expanded in the US to include the treatment of functional constipation. == Adverse effects == The US label has a black box warning to not use linaclotide in children less than six years old and to avoid in people from 6 to 18 years old, due to the risk of serious dehydration. More than 10% of people taking linaclotide have diarrhea. Between 1% and 10% of people have decreased appetite, dehydration, low potassium, dizziness when standing up too quickly, nausea, vomiting, urgent need to defecate, fecal incontinence, and bleeding in the colon, rectum, and anus. It has not been tested in pregnant women and it is unknown if it is excreted in breast milk. == Pharmacology == Systemic absorption of the globular tetradecapeptide is minimal. Linaclotide, like the endogenous guanylin and uroguanylin it mimics, is an agonist that activates the cell surface receptor of guanylate cyclase 2C (GC-C). The medication binds to the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells. Linaclotide is minimally absorbed and it is undetectable in the systemic circulation at therapeutic doses. Activation of GC-C increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Elevated cGMP stimulates secretion of chloride and bicarbonate and water into the intestinal lumen, mainly by way of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel activation. This results in increased intestinal fluid and accelerated transit. == Chemistry == Linaclotide is a hybrid peptide design of the E.coli heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) and the endogenous peptide hormones endogenous guanylin and uroguanylin. It is a synthetic tetradecapeptide (14 amino acid peptide) with the sequence CCEYCCNPACTGCY by one-letter abbreviation, or by three-letter abbreviation: H–Cys1–Cys2–Glu3–Tyr4–Cys5–Cys6–Asn7–Pro8–Ala9–Cys10–Thr11–Gly12–Cys13–Tyr14–OH However, the actual structure of linaclotide is not fully specified without the three disulfide (R-S-S-R) bonds it contains, which are between Cys1 and Cys6, between Cys2 and Cys10, and between Cys5 and Cys13; these are shown in exaggerated fashion in the line-angle graphic showing the chemical bonds within and between each amino acid (and their stereochemistries, see the infobox, above right), and are represented using a one-letter abbreviations in the following additional schematic: A study in discovery synthesis reported that 2 of 14 strategies available to synthesize linaclotide were successful—the successful ones involving trityl protection of all cysteines, or trityl protection of all cysteines except Cys1 and Cys6, which were protected with tert-butylsulphenyl groups. The study also reported that solution-phase oxidation (disulfide formation) was advisable over solid-supported synthesis for linaclotide, and that the Cys1–Cys6 disulfide bridge was the most favored energetically. == History == The drug was discovered at Microbia, Inc, which had been spun out of the Whitehead Institute in 1998 by postdocs from the lab of Gerald Fink to commercialize the lab's know-how and inventions related to microbial pathogens and biology. In 2002 the company hired Mark Currie who had worked at the Searle division of Monsanto and then had gone to Sepracor. Currie directed the efforts that led to the discovery of linaclotide, which was based on an enterotoxin produced by some strains of Escherichia coli that cause traveler's diarrhea. The company started Phase I trials in 2004. Under a partnership agreement announced in 2007, between Forest Laboratories and Microbia, Forest would pay $70 million in licensing fees towards the development of linaclotide, with profits shared between the two companies in the US; Forest obtained exclusive rights to market in Canada and Mexico. By 2010, Microbia had changed its name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals and had licensed rights to distribute the drug in Europe to Almirall and had licensed Asian rights to Astellas Pharma. It was approved in the United States and in the European Union in 2012. Forest was acquired in 2014 and eventually became part of Allergan. Allergan acquired rights from Almirall in 2015, and in 2017, acquired remaining rights in most of the rest of the world, excluding North America, Japan, and China. Allergan has since been acquired by AbbVie in 2020. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2014, Ironwood and Forest then Allergan began running direct-to-consumer advertising which raised sales by 21%; campaigns in 2015 and 2016 raised sales by 27% and 30%. In 2017, the list price for linaclotide in the US was US$378 for 30 pills; Allergan and Ironwood increased the price of linaclotide to around $414 in 2018. == References ==",Constella,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.764281842042692e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015099564334377646)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.7610454708337784e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/constella,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24293117/,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB08890 ', [])"

Because ""lagodeoxycholic acid,"" the 12 beta-hydroxy epimer of deoxycholic acid, is also more hydrophilic than deoxycholic acid, it was hypothesized that it should also be less hepatotoxic than deoxycholic acid. To test this, lagodeoxycholic acid was synthesized, and its transport and metabolism were examined in the rat, rabbit, and hamster. The taurine conjugate of lagodeoxycholic acid was moderately well transported by the perfused rat ileum (Tmax = 2 mumol/min.kg). In rats and hamsters with biliary fistulas, the taurine conjugate of lagodeoxycholic acid was well transported by the liver with a Tmax greater than 20 mumol/min.kg; for the taurine conjugate of deoxycholic acid, doses infused at a rate greater than 2.5 mumol/min.kg are known to cause cholestasis and death. Hepatic biotransformation of lagodeoxycholic acid in the rabbit was limited to conjugation with glycine; in the hamster, lagodeoxycholic acid was conjugated with glycine or taurine; in addition, 7-hydroxylation occurred to a slight extent (approximately 10%). When lagodeoxycholic acid was instilled in the rabbit colon, it was absorbed as such although within hours it was progressively epimerized by bacteria to deoxycholic acid. When injected intravenously and allowed to circulate enterohepatically, lagodeoxycholic acid was largely epimerized to deoxycholic acid in 24 hours. Surgical creation of a distal ileostomy abolished epimerization in the rabbit, indicating that exposure to colonic bacterial enzymes was required for the epimerization. Lagodeoxycholic acid was administered for 3 weeks at a dose of 180 mumol/day (0.1% by weight of a chow diet; 2-4 times the endogenous bile acid synthesis rate); other groups received identical doses of deoxycholic acid (hamster) or cholyltaurine, a known precursor of deoxycholic acid (rabbit). After 3 weeks of lagodeoxycholic acid ingestion, liver test results and liver appearance were normal. The total bile acid pool expanded by 37% in the rabbit, lagodeoxycholic acid composing 10% of biliary bile acids. In the hamster, the total bile acid pool was expanded by 95%, lagodeoxycholic acid composing 22% of biliary bile acids; biliary lipid secretion remained unchanged. Tracer studies indicated that the fractional turnover rate of lagodeoxycholic acid was high (157%/day, rabbit; 116%/day, hamster) because of its rapid epimerization to deoxycholic acid in the colon. These studies indicate that lagodeoxycholic acid, the more hydrophilic epimer of deoxycholic acid, is transported and metabolized as other dihydroxy bile acids but is much less toxic than deoxycholic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Lagodeoxycholic,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -6.718606891809031e-05)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.21075133979320526), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004297426901757717)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acschembio.1c00192,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm401873d,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01360 ', [])"
2210,"('Deoxycholic acid', 'Cholanoic acid', 'Desoxycholic acid', 'Deoxycholate', 'Cholerebic')","Endogenous, Medical","Deoxycholic acid is a bile acid. Deoxycholic acid is one of the secondary bile acids, which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria. The two primary bile acids secreted by the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Bacteria metabolize chenodeoxycholic acid into the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid, and they metabolize cholic acid into deoxycholic acid. There are additional secondary bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid is soluble in alcohol and acetic acid. When pure, it exists in a white to off-white crystalline powder form. Deoxycholic acid is available as a generic medication in the United States as of April 2021, sold under the brand name Kybella among others. == Applications == Deoxycholic acid has been used since its discovery in various fields of human medicine. In the human body deoxycholic acid is used in the emulsification of fats for absorption in the intestine. It has, in some countries (including Switzerland) been licensed as an emulsifier in food industry, but it is no longer common. Outside the body it is used in experimental basis of cholagogues and is also in use to prevent and dissolve gallstones. In research deoxycholic acid is used as a mild detergent for the isolation of membrane associated proteins. The critical micelle concentration for deoxycholic acid is approximately 2.4–4 mM. Sodium deoxycholate, the sodium salt of deoxycholic acid, is often used as a biological detergent to lyse cells and solubilise cellular and membrane components. Sodium deoxycholate mixed with phosphatidylcholine, is used in mesotherapy injections to produce lipolysis, and has been used as an alternative to surgical excision in the treatment of lipomas. Deoxycholates and bile acid derivatives in general are actively being studied as structures for incorporation in nanotechnology. They also have found application in microlithography as photoresistant components. In the United States, deoxycholic acid, under the brand name Kybella, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reducing moderate-to-severe fat below the chin. When injected into submental fat, deoxycholic acid helps destroy (adipocytes) fat cells, which are metabolized by the body over the course of several months. Kybella is produced by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals. == Research in immunology == Its function as a detergent and isolating agent for membrane proteins also suits it for production of outer membrane protein (OMP) vaccines such as MenB, a Norwegian vaccine developed in the early 1990s. The MeNZB vaccine was produced using the same method. Deoxycholic acid binds and activates the membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD, which catalyzes the release of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and other N-acylethanolamines. These bioactive signaling molecules play important roles in several physiological pathways including stress and pain response, appetite, and lifespan. Some publications point towards the effect of deoxycholic acid as an immunostimulant of the innate immune system, activating its main actors, the macrophages. According to these publications, a sufficient amount of deoxycholic acid in the human body would correspond with a good immune reaction of the non-specific immune system. Clinical studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s confirm the expectation that deoxycholic acid is involved in the natural healing processes of local inflammations, different types of herpes, and possibly cancer. == Research in cancer == Deoxycholate and other secondary bile acids cause DNA damage. Secondary bile acids increase intracellular production of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species resulting in increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. As shown in the figure below, deoxycholate added to the diet of mice increased the level of 8-oxo-dG, an oxidative DNA damage, in the colonic epithelium of mice. When the level of deoxycholate-induced DNA damage is high, DNA repair enzymes that ordinarily reverse DNA damage may not be able to keep up. DNA damage has frequently been proposed as a major cause of cancer. DNA damage can give rise to cancer by causing mutations. When deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer. Thus, exposure of the colon to deoxycholate may cause cancer in mice. However, this same study reported that, when chlorogenic acid was added to the diet alongside deoxycholate, only 18% of the mice developed colon cancer. Chlorogenic acid is a component of common foods and beverages; coffee contains an average of 53.8 mg chlorogenic acid per 100 ml. Therefore, to consume the level of chlorogenic acid used in the study, a human on a ""standard"" 2000-calorie daily diet (416 g/d; 250g carbs, 100g protein, 66g fat) would need to consume roughly 55 mL of coffee each day, or just under 2 fluid ounces. In humans, higher levels of colonic deoxycholate are associated with higher frequencies of colon cancer. As an example, the fecal deoxycholate concentrations in African Americans (who eat a relatively high fat diet) is more than five times higher than fecal deoxycholate of Native Africans in South Africa (who eat a low fat diet). Male African Americans have a high incidence of colon cancer of 72 per 100,000, while Native Africans in South Africa have a low incidence rate of colon cancer of less than 1 per 100,000, a more than 72-fold difference in rates of colon cancer. A prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholic acid and colorectal cancer risk in women. == Factors affecting deoxycholate levels == A number of factors, including diet, obesity, and exercise, affect the level of deoxycholate in the human colon. When humans were switched from their usual diet to a meat, egg and cheese based diet for five days, deoxycholate in their feces increased by factors of 2 to 10 fold. Rats fed diets with 30% beef tallow (high fat) had almost 2-fold more deoxycholate in their feces than rats fed 5% beef tallow (low fat). In the same study, adding the further dietary elements of curcumin or caffeic acid to the rats' high fat (30% beef tallow) diet reduced the deoxycholate in their feces to levels comparable to levels seen in the rats on a low fat diet. Curcumin is a component of the spice turmeric, and caffeic acid is a component high in some fruits and spices. Caffeic acid is also a digestive break-down product of chlorogenic acid, high in coffee and some fruits and vegetables. In addition to fats, the type or amount of protein in the diet may also affect bile acid levels. Switching from a diet with protein provided by casein to a diet with protein provided by salmon protein hydrolysate led to as much as a 6-fold increase in levels of bile acids in the blood plasma of rats. In humans, adding high protein to a high fat diet raised the level of deoxycholate in the plasma by almost 50%. Obesity has been linked to cancer, and this link is in part through deoxycholate. In obese people, the relative proportion of Firmicutes (Gram-positive bacteria) in gut microbiota is increased resulting in greater conversion of the non-genotoxic primary bile acid, cholic acid, to carcinogenic deoxycholate. Exercise decreases deoxycholate in the colon. Humans whose level of physical activity placed them in the top third had a 17% decrease in fecal bile acid concentration compared to those whose level of physical activity placed them in the lowest third. Rats provided with an exercise wheel had a lower ratio of secondary bile acids to primary bile acids than sedentary rats in their feces. There is a positive association of exercise and physical activity with cancer prevention, tolerance to cancer-directed therapies (radiation and chemotherapy), reduction in recurrence, and improvement in survival. == References ==",Deoxycholate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.6933444738388062), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -8.506661833962426e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -0.14276061952114105), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.06200801581144333), (' FOOD', -0.040451422333717346), (',', -0.12711645662784576), (' INDUSTR', -0.0010070850839838386), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('EN', -0.727672278881073), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('OUS', -2.7418097943154862e-06), (',', -0.00026854246971197426), ('ĠMED', -0.022163085639476776), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.12697182595729828), ('ĠFOOD', -0.3901660144329071), (',', -0.47421032190322876), ('ĠINDU', -0.009327052161097527), ('ST', -1.680836794548668e-05), ('RI', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('AL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006936753634363413)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0040785204619169235), (' MED', -0.04995875060558319), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL,FOOD;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxycholic_acid ', [])"

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of the marketed hepatoprotectant bicyclol at improving blood biomarkers in patients with NAFLD. Electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to August 2020 using bicyclol to treat NAFLD. The risk of bias, quality of evidence and publication bias were evaluated. Blood biomarkers, including alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC), were analysed using Review Manager V.5.3 software. Outcomes with significant heterogeneity (I Twelve RCTs involving 1008 patients were finally included. No serious adverse events were reported in the bicyclol-treated groups. The total effective rate of bicyclol intervention for NAFLD was significantly higher than that of the control group. The decreases in the levels of AST (mean difference (MD) = -15.20; 95% CI -20.51 to -9.90; I The study presents the evidence of bicyclol monotherapy and/or combination therapy for improving liver function and blood lipid biomarkers in patients with NAFLD. This preliminary study predicts that bicyclol might be an alternative drug for NAFLD therapy in the future. Bicyclol, an innovative chemical drug with proprietary intellectual property rights in China, is based on derivative of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Schisandra chinensis (Wuweizi) of North. Mounting data has proved that bicyclol has therapeutic potential in various pathological conditions in liver. In this narrative review, we provide the first summary of pharmacological activities, pharmacokinetic characteristics and toxicity of bicyclol, and discuss future research perspectives. Our results imply that bicyclol has a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, including anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, immuno-regulatory, anti-oxidative, antisteatotic, anti-fibrotic, antitumor, cell death regulatory effects and modulation of heat shock proteins. Pharmacokinetic studies have indicated that bicyclol is the main substrate of CYP3A/2E1. Additionally, no obvious drug interactions have been found when bicyclol is administered simultaneously with other prescriptions. Furthermore, the results of chronic toxicity have strongly addressed that bicyclol has no noticeable toxic effects on all biochemical indices and pathological examinations of the main organs. In view of good pharmacological actions and safety, bicyclol is anticipated to be a potential candidate for various liver diseases, including acute liver injury, fulminant hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Further studies are therefore required to delineate its molecular mechanisms and targets to confer this well-designed drug a far greater potency.

In 2012, it was approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for anticoagulation in people with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Type II (HIT) who require parenteral antithrombotic therapy. Argatroban is given intravenously and drug plasma concentrations reach steady state in 1–3 hours. Argatroban is metabolized in the liver and has a half-life of about 50 minutes. It is monitored by PTT. Because of its hepatic metabolism, it may be used in patients with renal dysfunction. (This is in contrast to lepirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor that is primarily renally cleared). == Transitioning to warfarin in individuals with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia == Argatroban is used as an anticoagulant in individuals with thrombosis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Often these individuals require long-term anticoagulation. If warfarin is chosen as the long-term anticoagulant, this poses particular challenges due to the falsely elevated prothrombin time and INR caused by argatroban. The combination of argatroban and warfarin may raise the INR to greater than 5.0 without a significant increased risk of bleeding complications.

2219,"('Nocodazole', 'Oncodazole', 'R 17934', 'Nocodazolum', 'Nocodazol')",Medical,"Nocodazole is an antineoplastic agent which exerts its effect in cells by interfering with the polymerization of microtubules. Microtubules are one type of fibre which constitutes the cytoskeleton, and the dynamic microtubule network has several important roles in the cell, including vesicular transport, forming the mitotic spindle and in cytokinesis. Several drugs including vincristine and colcemid are similar to nocodazole in that they interfere with microtubule polymerization. Nocodazole has been shown to decrease the oncogenic potential of cancer cells via another microtubules-independent mechanisms. Nocodazole stimulates the expression of LATS2 which potently inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway by abrogating the interaction between the Wnt-dependent transcriptional co-factors beta-catenin and BCL9. It is related to mebendazole by replacement of the left most benzene ring by thiophene. == Use in cell biology research == As nocodazole affects the cytoskeleton, it is often used in cell biology experiments as a control: for example, some dominant negative Rho small GTPases cause a similar effect as nocodazole, and constitutively activated mutants often reverse or negate the effect. Nocodazole is frequently used in cell biology laboratories to synchronize the cell division cycle. Cells treated with nocodazole arrest with a G2- or M-phase DNA content when analyzed by flow cytometry. Microscopy of nocodazole-treated cells shows that they do enter mitosis but cannot form metaphase spindles because microtubules (of which the spindles are made) cannot polymerise. The absence of microtubule attachment to kinetochores activates the spindle assembly checkpoint, causing the cell to arrest in prometaphase. For cell synchronization experiments, nocodazole is usually used at a concentration of 40–100 ng/mL of culture medium for a duration of 12–18 hours. Prolonged arrest of cells in mitosis due to nocodazole treatment typically results in cell death by apoptosis. Another standard cell biological application of nocodazole is to induce the formation of Golgi ministacks in eukaryotic cells. The perinuclear structural organization of the Golgi apparatus in eukaryotes is dependent on microtubule trafficking, but disrupting the trafficking of Golgi elements from the endoplasmic reticulum treatment with nocodazole (33 μM for 3 hours) induces numerous Golgi elements to form adjacent to ER exit sites. These functional Golgi ministacks remain distributed about the cell, unable to track forward to form a perinuclear Golgi since nocodazole has depolymerized the microtubules.

It is an antidepressant of the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class and is taken by mouth. It is recommended that the need for further treatment be occasionally reassessed. It may be less effective than its parent compound venlafaxine, although some studies have found comparable efficacy. Common side effects include dizziness, trouble sleeping, increased sweating, constipation, sleepiness, anxiety, and sexual problems. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, bleeding, mania, and high blood pressure. There is a high risk of withdrawal syndrome which may occur if the dose is decreased or the medication is completely stopped. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Desvenlafaxine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2008. In Europe its application for use was denied in 2009. In 2022, it was the 208th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Desvenlafaxine is primarily used as a treatment for major depressive disorder. Use has only been studied up to 8 weeks. It may be less effective than venlafaxine, although some studies have found comparable efficacy with a lower rate of nausea. Doses of 50 to 400 mg/day appear effective for major depressive disorder, although no additional benefit was demonstrated at doses greater than 50 mg/day, and adverse events and discontinuations were more frequent at higher doses. Desvenlafaxine improves the HAM-D17 score and measures of well-being such as the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). == Adverse effects == Frequency of adverse effects: Very common adverse effects include: Common adverse effects include: Uncommon adverse effects include: Rare adverse effects include: Common adverse effects whose intensity is unknown include: == Pharmacology == Desvenlafaxine is a synthetic form of the isolated major active metabolite of venlafaxine, and is categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). When most normal metabolizers take venlafaxine, approximately 70% of the dose is metabolized into desvenlafaxine, so the effects of the two drugs are expected to be very similar. It works by blocking the ""reuptake"" transporters for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is approximately 10 times more potent at inhibiting serotonin uptake than norepinephrine uptake. == Approval status == === United States === Wyeth announced on 23 January 2007 that it received an approvable letter from the Food and Drug Administration for desvenlafaxine. Final approval to sell the drug was contingent on a number of things, including: A satisfactory FDA inspection of Wyeth's Guayama, Puerto Rico facility, where the drug is to be manufactured; Several postmarketing surveillance commitments, and follow-up studies on low-dose use, relapse, and use in children; Clarity by Wyeth around the company's product education plan for physicians and patients; Approval of desvenlafaxine's proprietary name, Pristiq. The FDA approved the drug for antidepressant use in February 2008, and was to be available in US pharmacies in May 2008. In March 2017, the generic form of the drug was made available in the US. === Canada === On February 4, 2009, Health Canada approved use of desvenlafaxine for treatment of depression. === European Union === In 2009, an application to market desvenlafaxine for major depressive disorder in the European Union was declined. In 2012, Pfizer received authorization in Spain to market desvenlafaxine for the disorder. In August 2022, following a 14-year approval process, desvenlafaxine was brought to the market for the disorder in Germany. === Australia === Desvenlafaxine is classified as a schedule 4 (prescription only) drug in Australia.

2221,"('Beta-sitosterol (purity>75%)', 'Œ≤-sitosterol (purity>75%)', 'Sitosterol', 'Cupreol', 'Azuprostat')","Food, Medical","β-Sitosterol (beta-sitosterol) is one of several phytosterols (plant sterols) with chemical structures similar to that of cholesterol. It is a white, waxy powder with a characteristic odor, and is one of the components of the food additive E499. Phytosterols are hydrophobic and soluble in alcohols. == Natural occurrences and food == β-Sitosterol is widely distributed in the plant kingdom. It is found in vegetable oil, nuts, avocados, and derived prepared foods such as salad dressings. Olavius algarvensis, a species of marine annelid, predominantly incorporate β-sitosterol into their cell membranes instead of cholesterol, though cholesterol is also present in said membranes. == Human research == β-Sitosterol is being studied for its potential to reduce benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and blood cholesterol levels. == Genetic disorder == While plant sterols are usually beneficial, there is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder phytosterolemia which causes over-absorption of phytosterols. == Precursor of anabolic steroid boldenone == Being a steroid, β-sitosterol is a precursor of anabolic steroid boldenone. Boldenone undecylenate is commonly used in veterinary medicine to induce growth in cattle but it is also one of the most commonly abused anabolic steroids in sports. This led to suspicion that some athletes testing positive on boldenone undecylenate did not actually abuse the hormone itself but consumed food rich in β-sitosterol. == Chemistry == === Chemical engineering === The use of β-sitosterol as a chemical intermediate was for many years limited due to the lack of a chemical point of attack on the side-chain that would permit its removal. Extensive efforts on the part of many laboratories eventually led to the discovery of a pseudomonas microbe that efficiently effected that transformation. Fermentation digests the entire aliphatic side-chain at carbon 17 to afford a mixture of 17-keto products including dehydroepiandrosterone. === Synthesis === Total synthesis of β-sitosterol has not been achieved. However, β-sitosterol has been synthesized from stigmasterol 1, which involves a specific hydrogenation of the side-chain of stigmasterol. The first step in the synthesis forms stigmasterol tosylate 2 from stigmasterol 1 (95% purity) using p-TsCl, DMAP, and pyridine (90% yield). The tosylate 2 then undergoes solvolysis as it is treated with pyridine and anhydrous MeOH to give a 5:1 ratio of i-stigmasterol methyl ether 3 (74% yield) to stigmasterol methyl ether 4, which is subsequently removed by chromatography. The hydrogenation step of a previously proposed synthesis involved the catalyst Pd/C and the solvent ethyl acetate. However, due to isomerisation during hydrolysis, other catalysts, such as PtO2, and solvents, such as ethanol, were tested. There was little change with the use of a different catalyst. Ethanol, however, prevented isomerisation and the formation of the unidentified impurity to give compound 5. The last step of the synthesis is deprotection of the β-ring double bond of 5 with p-TsOH, aqueous dioxane, and heat (80 °C) to yield β-sitosterol 6. The cumulative yield for the final two steps was 55%, and the total yield for the synthesis was 37%. == Biosynthesis == The regulation of the biosynthesis of both sterols and some specific lipids occurs during membrane biogenesis. Through 13C-labeling patterns, it has been determined that both the mevalonate and deoxyxylulose pathways are involved in the formation of β-sitosterol. The precise mechanism of β-sitosterol formation varies according to the organism, but is generally found to come from cycloartenol. The biosynthesis of cycloartenol begins as one molecule of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and two molecules of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) form farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Two molecules of FPP are then joined tail-to-tail to yield squalene, a triterpene. Squalene, through a cyclization reaction with 2,3-oxidosqualene 6 as an intermediate forms cycloartenol. The double bond of cycloartenol (compound 7 in diagram) is methylated by SAM to give a carbocation that undergoes a hydride shift and loses a proton to yield a compound with a methylene side-chain. Both of these steps are catalyzed by sterol C-24 methyltransferase (Step E1 in diagram). Compound 8 is then catalyzed by sterol C-4 demethylase (E2) and loses a methyl group to produce cycloeucalenol. Subsequent to this, the cyclopropane ring is opened with cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase (E3) to form 10. Compound 10 loses a methyl group and undergoes an allylic isomerization to form gramisterol 11. This step is catalyzed by sterol C-14 demethylase (E4), sterol Δ14-reductase (E5), and sterol Δ8-Δ7-isomerase (E6). The last methyl group is removed by sterol demethylase (E7) to form episterol 12. Episterol 12 is methylated by SAM to produce a second carbocation, which loses a proton to yield 13. This step is catalyzed by 24-methylenesterol C-methyltransferase (E8).

2222,"('Apigenin', 'Apigenol', 'C.i. natural yellow 1', 'Chamomile', 'Versulin')","Food, Medical","Apigenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone), found in many plants, is a natural product belonging to the flavone class that is the aglycone of several naturally occurring glycosides. It is a yellow crystalline solid that has been used to dye wool. == Sources in nature == Apigenin is found in many fruits and vegetables, but parsley, celery, celeriac, and chamomile tea are the most common sources. Apigenin is particularly abundant in the flowers of chamomile plants, constituting 68% of total flavonoids. Dried parsley can contain about 45 mg apigenin/gram of the herb. The apigenin content of fresh parsley is reportedly 215.5 mg/100 grams, which is much higher than the next highest food source, green celery hearts providing 19.1 mg/100 grams. == Pharmacology == Apigenin competitively binds to the benzodiazepine site on GABAA receptors. There exist conflicting findings regarding how apigenin interacts with this site. Apigenin can increase the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and CAT, helping to reduce oxidative stress. == Biosynthesis == Apigenin is biosynthetically derived from the general phenylpropanoid pathway and the flavone synthesis pathway. The phenylpropanoid pathway starts from the aromatic amino acids L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine, both products of the Shikimate pathway. When starting from L-phenylalanine, first the amino acid is non-oxidatively deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to make cinnamate, followed by oxidation at the para position by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) to produce p-coumarate. As L-tyrosine is already oxidized at the para position, it skips this oxidation and is simply deaminated by tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) to arrive at p-coumarate. To complete the general phenylpropanoid pathway, 4-coumarate CoA ligase (4CL) substitutes coenzyme A (CoA) at the carboxy group of p-coumarate. Entering the flavone synthesis pathway, the type III polyketide synthase enzyme chalcone synthase (CHS) uses consecutive condensations of three equivalents of malonyl CoA followed by aromatization to convert p-coumaroyl-CoA to chalcone. Chalcone isomerase (CHI) then isomerizes the product to close the pyrone ring to make naringenin. Finally, a flavanone synthase (FNS) enzyme oxidizes naringenin to apigenin. Two types of FNS have previously been described; FNS I, a soluble enzyme that uses 2-oxogluturate, Fe2+, and ascorbate as cofactors and FNS II, a membrane bound, NADPH dependent cytochrome p450 monooxygenase. == Glycosides == The naturally occurring glycosides formed by the combination of apigenin with sugars include: Apiin (apigenin 7-O-apioglucoside), isolated from parsley and celery Apigetrin (apigenin 7-glucoside), found in dandelion coffee Vitexin (apigenin 8-C-glucoside) Isovitexin (apigenin 6-C-glucoside) Rhoifolin (apigenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) Schaftoside (apigenin 6-C-glucoside 8-C-arabinoside) == In diet == Some foods contain relatively high amounts of apigenin: == See also == Amentoflavone == References ==",Versulin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.01719377562403679), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO, FOOD', [('INFO', -0.4146825075149536), (',', -0.3890747129917145), ('ĠFOOD', -0.29564231634140015), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.21673238277435303)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/versulin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=109, start_index=6, title='Versulin | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/versulin?utm_source=openai')])"
2223,"('Valine', 'H-d-val-oh', '(r)-valine', 'Valine, d-', '(2r)-2-amino-3-methylbutanoic acid')","Food, Medical","Valine (symbol Val or V) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain isopropyl group, making it a non-polar aliphatic amino acid. Valine is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it; it must be obtained from dietary sources which are foods that contain proteins, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. It is encoded by all codons starting with GU (GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG). == History and etymology == Valine was first isolated from casein in 1901 by Hermann Emil Fischer. The name valine comes from its structural similarity to valeric acid, which in turn is named after the plant valerian due to the presence of the acid in the roots of the plant. == Nomenclature == According to IUPAC, carbon atoms forming valine are numbered sequentially starting from 1 denoting the carboxyl carbon, whereas 4 and 4' denote the two terminal methyl carbons. == Metabolism == === Source and biosynthesis === Valine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is synthesized by bacteria and plants, but not by animals. It is therefore an essential amino acid in animals, and needs to be present in the diet. Adult humans require about 24 mg/kg body weight daily. It is synthesized in plants and bacteria via several steps starting from pyruvic acid. The initial part of the pathway also leads to leucine. The intermediate α-ketoisovalerate undergoes reductive amination with glutamate. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include: Acetolactate synthase (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase) Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase Dihydroxyacid dehydratase Valine aminotransferase === Degradation === Like other branched-chain amino acids, the catabolism of valine starts with the removal of the amino group by transamination, giving alpha-ketoisovalerate, an alpha-keto acid, which is converted to isobutyryl-CoA through oxidative decarboxylation by the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. This is further oxidised and rearranged to succinyl-CoA, which can enter the citric acid cycle and provide direct fuel in muscle tissue. == Synthesis == Racemic valine can be synthesized by bromination of isovaleric acid followed by amination of the α-bromo derivative. HO2CCH2CH(CH3)2 + Br2 → HO2CCHBrCH(CH3)2 + HBr HO2CCHBrCH(CH3)2 + 2 NH3 → HO2CCH(NH2)CH(CH3)2 + NH4Br == Medical significance == === Metabolic diseases === The degradation of valine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) Methylmalonic acidemia Propionic acidemia === Insulin resistance === Lower levels of serum valine, like other branched-chain amino acids, are associated with weight loss and decreased insulin resistance: higher levels of valine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans. Mice fed a BCAA-deprived diet for one day had improved insulin sensitivity, and feeding of a valine-deprived diet for one week significantly decreases blood glucose levels. In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of valine and the other branched-chain amino acids resulted in a rapid reversal of the adiposity and an improvement in glucose-level control. The valine catabolite 3-hydroxyisobutyrate promotes insulin resistance in mice by stimulating fatty acid uptake into muscle and lipid accumulation. In mice, a BCAA-restricted diet decreased fasting blood glucose levels and improved body composition. === Hematopoietic stem cells === Dietary valine is essential for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, as demonstrated by experiments in mice. Dietary valine restriction selectively depletes long-term repopulating HSC in mouse bone marrow. Successful stem cell transplantation was achieved in mice without irradiation after 3 weeks on a valine restricted diet. Long-term survival of the transplanted mice was achieved when valine was returned to the diet gradually over a 2-week period to avoid refeeding syndrome. == See also == Valinol == References == == External links == Valine MS Spectrum Isoleucine and valine biosynthesis Valine's relationship to prions",Valine,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.07534170895814896), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.06372889131307602), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.018183207139372826), ('ĠEND', -0.007264153566211462), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03811841458082199)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.011047814972698689), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Yeast Sir2 was the first sirtuin identified, and so far seven sirtuins (i.e. SIRT1-7) have been found in mammals including humans. The sirtuin-catalyzed deacetylation reaction has captured tremendous interest during the past a few years because of (i) its increasingly demonstrated importance in many crucial biological processes such as gene transcription, metabolism, and aging, and thus its therapeutic potential for metabolic and age-related diseases and cancer, and (ii) its unique deacetylation chemistry. Specifically, the sirtuin-catalyzed AcK side chain deacetylation is not merely an amide hydrolysis reaction, instead is coupled to the nicotinamide cleavage from β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (β-NAD+ or NAD+) with the generation of three enzymatic products, i.e. the deacetylated protein species, nicotinamide, and 2'-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (2'-O-AADPR). Here the author would like to review the past endeavors on developing mechanism-based sirtuin modulators (inhibitors and activators). The first part of this article will provide an updated mechanistic picture of the sirtuin-catalyzed deacetylation reaction. The second part will be focused on how the mechanistic knowledge has been exploited for the design of effective sirtuin modulators.

Sapacitabine is an orally available nucleoside analog prodrug of 2′-C-cyano-2′-deoxy-1-β-D-arabino-pentofuranosyl-cytosine (CNDAC) that acts through a dual mechanism. CNDAC lasts longer in the bloodstream by being metabolized from sapacitibine than it would do so by being directly administered. The compound interferes with DNA synthesis by causing single-strand DNA breaks due to CNDAC being incorporated into DNA during replication or repair, then inducing arrest of the cell division cycle at G2 phase. Both sapacitabine and its major metabolite, CNDAC, have demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in both blood and solid tumors in preclinical studies. In a liver metastatic mouse model, sapacitabine was shown to be superior to gemcitabine or 5-FU, two widely used nucleoside analogs, in delaying the onset and growth of liver metastasis. == Clinical trials == Cyclacel has initiated a number of clinical trials to evaluate sapacitabine in both solid and hematological tumors laying the foundation for future Phase II studies and combination studies with other anti-cancer agents. Three Phase I clinical trial studies have been completed, which evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of a variety of dosing schedules in approximately 120 patients with solid tumors. Sapacitabine is being evaluated as of March 2016 in three different studies; a Phase III trial for elderly patients with AML (acute myeloid leukemia), a Phase II trial for MDS (myelodysplastic syndromes), and a Phase I trial in combination with seliciclib for cancer treatment including hereditary ovarian and breast cancers. Thus far approximately 1,000 patients have received sapacitibine treatment in all phases of trials. An ongoing Phase III clinical trial, SEAMLESS, has 485 enrolled members and is open to elderly (70+ years of age) AML (acute myeloid leukemia) patients with good renal and liver function and who are not viable candidates for or have refused intensive induction chemotherapy. SEAMLESS is a global study with 118 different sites in the United States, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In the trial an arm of oral sapacitibine is given in alternating cycles with IV decitabine, which is compared to the control arm of IV decitabine alone. The SEAMLESS study was constructed based on the promising results of a Phase II one-year survival study for patients with AML. The efficacy goal of the treatment is overall survival; the average survival of an elderly person diagnosed with AML is approximately three to six months. The Data Safety Monitoring Board has communicated the unlikelihood that this Phase III study will reach a statistically significant survival improvement due to the planned futility boundary of 247 patient deaths already being crossed, but the trial is ongoing. During a poster session at the 2012 American Society of Hematology, results from a Phase I/II clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of the oral sapacitibine along with IV decitabine were presented, selected data highlights are as follows: median overall survival was approximately 8 months, patients still alive at 3 months was 83%, 35% of patients survived a year or longer, 2 dose-limiting toxicities in the form of lung infection and typhlitis were observed. For the Phase II trial for MDS patients so far, median survival overall was about 9.7 months, with the average median survival overall for patients receiving classic azacitidine or decitabine is approximately 4.3-5.9 months. More data will be arriving from the second half of this trial meant to allow better dosing regimens. The Phase II study for sapacitibine with seliciclib in advanced cancer patients is ongoing; so far, ""durable partial responses"" and ""prolonged stable disease"" have been seen particularly for patients with the BRCA mutations. In a group of 45 patients including those with breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, a ""35.6% disease control rate was observed."" == Commercial Aspects and Intellectual Property == As of August 2016, Cyclacel had a 19.5 million dollar market capitalization and shares of the company have declined in value recently due to research and development costs of 2.6 million dollars and general and administrative expense costs of 1.3 million dollars. Cyclacel ended the last quarter in 2016 with 15.9 million dollars in cash and equivalents. An earnings report from H.C. Wainwright & Co. acknowledged how Cyclacel may at first seem like an unattractive investment but the ultimate risk/reward opportunity may be positive; sapacitibine has indeed shown very positive anti-tumor activity and has progressed to Phase III clinical trials for elderly patients with AML. Cyclacel holds worldwide right to commercialize sapacitibine, except in Japan for which Daiichi Sankyo ""has a right of first negotiation"". They currently have essentially all marketing rights globally for the compounds in association with their drug development programs. Numerous patents from Cyclacel are found related to sapacitibine and sapacitibine dosing regimes along with other drugs such as decitibine. There are patents and applications that no longer apply to current use of sapacitibine, some involving administration of sapacitibine and seliciclib. Cyclacel currently has no sales or marketing capability and so will rely on alliances to distribute and commercialize the various drugs they hope to bring through the development pipeline. These compounds particularly target control of the cell cycle for treating cancer and other diseases. Cyclacel says current funds and generated money from items such as R&D tax credits and ""recent financing activities"" will carry them through 2017. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have granted orphan drug status to sapacitibine for the treatment of AML and MDS; this designation assists in funding and provides various benefits for the drug's development such as market exclusivity for a period of several years, grant funding, tax credits, and potential fee waivers. == References ==",Sapacitabine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.45700973412022e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024824298452585936)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapacitabine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Sapacitabine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapacitabine?utm_source=openai')])"
2226,"('Nicorandil', 'Ikorel', 'Dancor', 'Sigmart', 'Nicorandilum')",Medical,"Nicorandil is a vasodilator drug used to treat angina, which is chest pain that results from episodes of transient myocardial ischemia. Angina can be caused by diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and aortic stenosis. It was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1983. == Side effects == Side effects listed in the British National Formulary include flushing, palpitations, weakness and vomiting. More recently, perianal, ileal, and peristomal ulceration has been reported as a side effect. Anal ulceration is now included in the British National Formulary as a reported side effect. Other side effects include severe migraine, toothache, and nasal congestion. == Mechanism of action == Nicorandil is an anti-angina medication that has the dual properties of a nitrate and ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener. In humans, the nitrate action of nicorandil dilates the large coronary arteries at low plasma concentrations. At high plasma concentrations nicorandil reduces coronary vascular resistance, which is associated with increased ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) opening. Nicorandil stimulates guanylate cyclase to increase formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP). cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG), which phosphorylates and inhibits GTPase RhoA and decreases Rho-kinase activity. Reduced Rho-kinase activity permits an increase in myosin phosphatase activity, decreasing the calcium sensitivity of the smooth muscle. PKG also activates the sarcolemma calcium pump to remove activating calcium. PKG acts on K+ channels to promote K+ efflux and the ensuing hyperpolarization inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels. Overall, this leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle and coronary vasodilation. The effect of nicorandil as a vasodilator is mainly attributed to its nitrate property. Yet, nicorandil is effective in cases where nitrates, such as nitroglycerine, are not effective. Studies show that this is due to its KATP channel agonist action which causes pharmacological preconditioning and provides cardioprotective effects against ischemia. Nicorandil activates KATP channels in the mitochondria of the myocardium, which appears to relay the cardioprotective effects, although the mechanism is still unclear. In experimental animal models of the Long QT syndrome, Nicorandil normalizes the prolonged cardiac action potential duration and the QT interval. == Synthesis == Amide reaction between Nicotinoyl Chloride [10400-19-8] & 2-Aminoethyl Nitrate [646-02-6].

In this study PhiKan083 also known as PK083 is investigated, screened and validated on 28 different mutants of p53 using FlexX. Interaction of PhiKan08 with Y220C is found to be largely hydrophobic and a crucial single H-bond interaction with Asp228 in addition to few electrostatic interactions. Our study identified Y220S mutant as an additional target for PK083 as it shows a similar interaction pattern. Besides this, Docking and MD simulation studies, showed that Y220S binds to PK083 at higher efficiency as a result of improved steric and hydrophobic environment in the binding cavity in comparison with known mutant target, Y220C. Further, we point out that structure guided optimization of PhiKan08 can lead to an improved drug that can interact favourably with yet another mutant, Y220 N. In addition, this study revealed that Y220H and other mutants including native p53 does not provide any favourable interaction with PhiKan08 which is in accord with the experimental findings.

Pyruvic acid supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments to produce lactate when oxygen is lacking. == Chemistry == In 1834, Théophile-Jules Pelouze distilled tartaric acid and isolated glutaric acid and another unknown organic acid. Jöns Jacob Berzelius characterized this other acid the following year and named pyruvic acid because it was distilled using heat. The correct molecular structure was deduced by the 1870s. Pyruvic acid is a colorless liquid with a smell similar to that of acetic acid and is miscible with water. In the laboratory, pyruvic acid may be prepared by heating a mixture of tartaric acid and potassium hydrogen sulfate, by the oxidation of propylene glycol by a strong oxidizer (e.g., potassium permanganate or bleach), or by the hydrolysis of acetyl cyanide, formed by reaction of acetyl chloride with potassium cyanide: CH3COCl + KCN → CH3COCN + KCl CH3COCN → CH3COCOOH == Biochemistry == Pyruvate is an important chemical compound in biochemistry. It is the output of the metabolism of glucose known as glycolysis. One molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate, which are then used to provide further energy, in one of two ways. Pyruvate is converted into acetyl-coenzyme A, which is the main input for a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle). Pyruvate is also converted to oxaloacetate by an anaplerotic reaction, which replenishes Krebs cycle intermediates; also, the oxaloacetate is used for gluconeogenesis. These reactions are named after Hans Adolf Krebs, the biochemist awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize for physiology, jointly with Fritz Lipmann, for research into metabolic processes. The cycle is also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle, because citric acid is one of the intermediate compounds formed during the reactions. If insufficient oxygen is available, the acid is broken down anaerobically, creating lactate in animals and ethanol in plants and microorganisms (and in carp). Pyruvate from glycolysis is converted by fermentation to lactate using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and the coenzyme NADH in lactate fermentation, or to acetaldehyde (with the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase) and then to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation. Pyruvate is a key intersection in the network of metabolic pathways. Pyruvate can be converted into carbohydrates via gluconeogenesis, to fatty acids or energy through acetyl-CoA, to the amino acid alanine, and to ethanol. Therefore, it unites several key metabolic processes. === Pyruvic acid production by glycolysis === In the last step of glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. This reaction is strongly exergonic and irreversible; in gluconeogenesis, it takes two enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase, to catalyze the reverse transformation of pyruvate to PEP.

A systematic review of six trials found a statistically significant difference in body weight with pyruvate compared to placebo. However, all of the trials had methodological weaknesses and the magnitude of the effect was small. The review also identified adverse events associated with pyruvate such as diarrhea, bloating, gas, and increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of pyruvate for weight loss. There is also in vitro as well as in vivo evidence in hearts that pyruvate improves metabolism by NADH production stimulation and increases cardiac function. == See also == Pyruvate scale Uvitonic acid == Notes == == References == Cody, G.

2232,"('Dimethyl fumarate', 'Tecfidera', 'Dimethylfumarate', 'Methyl fumarate', '(e)-dimethyl fumarate')",Medical,"Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is the methyl ester of fumaric acid and is named after the earth smoke plant (Fumaria officinalis). Dimethyl fumarate combined with three other fumaric acid esters (FAEs) is solely licensed in Germany as an oral therapy for psoriasis (brand name Fumaderm). Since 2013, it has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment option for adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis (brand name Tecfidera). In 2017, an oral formulation of dimethyl fumarate (brand name Skilarence) was approved for medical use in the European Union as a treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Dimethyl fumarate is thought to have immunomodulatory properties without causing significant immunosuppression. Dimethyl fumarate has also been applied as a biocide in furniture or shoes to prevent growths of mold during storage or transport in humid climates. However, due to cases of allergic reactions after skin contact, dimethyl fumarate-containing consumer products are no longer authorised to be manufactured (since 1998) or imported (since 2009) in the European Union. Dimethyl fumarate is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == In Germany, dimethyl fumarate is marketed for the treatment of psoriasis and is available as an oral formulation mixed with related compounds (Fumaderm); in the UK, it is available as a pure oral formulation (Skilarence). It is also available in the US as an oral formulation (Tecfidera) to treat adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review found moderate quality evidence of a reduction in the number of people with relapsing remitting MS that had relapses over a two-year treatment period with dimethyl fumarate versus placebo, as well as low quality evidence of a reduction in worsening disability, and an overall need for higher quality studies with longer follow-up. == History == The first medical use of fumaric acid was described in 1959 by Walter Schweckendiek, a German chemist, and was a topical formulation for psoriasis. The Swiss company Fumapharm eventually brought Fumaderm, an oral formulation of dimethyl fumarate (along with some monoesters) to market for psoriasis in Germany in 1994. Based on the efficacy and safety of this formulation, and evidence that dimethyl fumarate was the main active component, an oral formulation of dimethyl fumarate was developed by Almirall. This oral formulation, under the brand name Skilarence, was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in June 2017, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults. Initial clinical research on the use of dimethyl fumarate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis was conducted by Fumapharm in collaboration with Biogen Idec; Fumapharm was subsequently acquired by Biogen Idec in 2006. Aditech Pharma in Sweden had also been researching oral formulations of dimethyl fumarate for MS and in 2010, the Danish company Forward Pharma acquired Aditech's patents. Biogen continued developing its oral formulation of dimethyl fumarate from Fumapharm under the code name BG-12; it was approved, under the trade name Tecfidera, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS in March 2013. Biogen priced the drug at $54,000 per year in the US. It was approved in Europe in 2014. In the UK NICE issued guidance recommending the drug as cost-effective, but only for patients who do not have highly active or rapidly evolving severe relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis and only if Biogen agreed to provide it at a discount. Forward and Biogen entered into patent litigation in many jurisdictions; in 2017, the companies settled the litigation, with Biogen paying Forward $1.25 billion, with the potential for up to 10% of royalties depending on what happened with the patents in various jurisdictions. In June 2020, in a case between Biogen and Mylan, the U.S. District Court in West Virginia declared invalid Biogen's so-called ""514"" patent protecting Tecfidera from generic competition. The ruling gave Mylan the right to launch its own version of Tecfidera. == Pharmacology == Dimethyl fumarate is metabolized to monomethyl fumarate (MMF) prior to entering systemic distribution. Dimethyl fumarate has been described a prodrug. Dimethyl fumarate is a precursor of monomethyl fumarate. Other prodrugs that metabolize to monomethyl fumarate have been developed to treat relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis, including diroximel fumarate which was approved by the FDA in October 2019. The precise mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate is not clear. Dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate can activate the transcription factor (Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and monomethyl fumarate has been identified as a nicotinic acid receptor agonist in vitro. In mice that lack Nrf2 expression, however, dimethyl fumarate is still able to modulate the immune system, which indicates that Nrf2 is not required for its immunomodulatory action. For psoriasis, the mechanism of action is believed to be due to the interaction of monomethyl fumarate and the intracellular reduced glutathione of cells directly involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The interaction with glutathione leads to the inhibition of nuclear translocation and the transcriptional activity of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB). Dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate have been shown to reduce the expression of micro-RNA-21, which is essential for the production of pathogenic cells in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. This can be achieved because dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate, as cell-permeable metabolites, can epigenetically regulate the expression of micro-RNA-21 via the metabolic-epigenetic interplay in developing immune cells. The main activity of dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate is considered to be immunomodulatory, resulting in a shift in T helper cells (Th) from the Th1 and Th17 profile to a Th2 phenotype. Inflammatory cytokine production is reduced by the induction of proapoptotic events, inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation, reduced expression of adhesion molecules and diminished inflammatory infiltrate within psoriatic plaques. The primary route of elimination is via exhalation of CO2, with small amounts excreted through urine or faeces. There is no evidence for dimethyl fumarate interaction with cytochrome P450 and the most common efflux and uptake transporters, and therefore no interactions are expected with medicinal products metabolised or transported by these systems. == Synthesis and reactions == Several methods exist for the laboratory synthesis of dimethyl fumarate, with reported methods including alkene isomerization of dimethyl maleate, and Fischer esterification of fumaric acid. Dimethyl fumarate is an old compound used in industrial chemistry and can be purchased by the ton; as of 2012, one could purchase it for $1 to $50 per metric ton, with a two-ton minimum purchase. The compound undergoes electrohydrodimerization. == Adverse effects == In the treatment of psoriasis, the most common adverse events are gastrointestinal events, flushing and lymphopenia, which are usually mild. Other adverse events include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and Fanconi syndrome, which are considered rare. PML is probably caused by a combination of factors. A previous infection with the John-Cunningham virus (JCV) is considered a prerequisite for the development of PML. In a PML review, all confirmed cases were of patients exposed to periods of varying lymphopenia. For multiple sclerosis, adverse effects include flushing and gastrointestinal events, such as diarrhoea, nausea and upper abdominal pain. The drug label includes warnings about the risk of anaphylaxis and angioedema, PML, lymphopenia and liver damage. There is no information on how dimethyl fumarate affects the fetus during pregnancy; in animal tests there was fetal harm at clinically relevant doses. == Consumer products == There have been cases of severe contact dermatitis which was likely related to a dimethyl fumarate contact allergy of newly acquired sofas and chairs. Dimethyl fumarate has been found to be an allergic sensitizer at very low concentrations, producing eczema by contact allergy that is difficult to treat. Concentrations as low as 1 ppm (parts-per-million) may produce allergic reactions in the most severe cases. There are only a handful of equally potent sensitisers. The sensitizing risk was brought to public attention by the ""poison chair"" incident, where Chinese manufacturer Linkwise produced two-seater sofas with dimethyl fumarate sachets inside to inhibit mould while they were in storage or transport. In Finland where the chairs were sold from 2006 to 2007, 60 users sustained serious rashes. The cause was identified as dimethyl fumarate-induced allergic reaction by Tapio Rantanen from Finland and his original article became the cover story in the July 2008 issue of the British Journal of Dermatology. In the United Kingdom, sofas sold by Argos, Land of Leather and Walmsley Furnishing containing the chemical caused over a hundred injuries. Argos withdrew the sofas from stores and contacted buyers to collect those that had been sold — with Land of Leather withdrawing the sofas without notifying buyers and Walmsley saying they had removed the sachets from sofas they sold after the danger came to light. The danger came to public attention in 2008 when the BBC Watchdog programme alerted consumers to the sofas. In the European Union, the use of dimethyl fumarate in consumer product manufacturing has been forbidden since 1998, and in 2009 the importation of consumer products containing dimethyl fumarate was also forbidden. EU Commission Decision 2009/251 of 17 March 2009 required member states to ensure that consumer products containing dimethyl fumarate were not placed or made available on the market from 1 May 2009. This definitely outlawed any marketing of consumer products containing dimethyl fumarate in the European Union. The ban on dimethyl fumarate as laid down in Decision 2009/251 establishes a maximum dimethyl fumarate concentration in products of 0.1 ppm. The decision dictated that consumer products containing more than 0.1 ppm dimethyl fumarate should be withdrawn from the market and recalled from consumers. == Research == In 2021, dimethyl fumarate was evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19 as part of the RECOVERY Trial in the UK. The results of the trial found that dimethyl fumarate did not significantly improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. == References ==",Tecfidera,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -7.576873758807778e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0024769625160843134), (' INDUSTR', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0004974558250978589), ('ICAL', -2.264974000354414e-06), (',', -0.3868909478187561), ('ĠINDU', -0.0031568000558763742), ('ST', -2.753696753643453e-05), ('RI', -3.933898824470816e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002497175009921193)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D03846,https://www.drugs.com/tecfidera.html,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tecfidera ', [])"
2233,"('(+-)-5-hydroxytryptophan', 'Hydroxytryptophan', 'H-dl-trp(5-oh)-oh', 'D,l-5-hydroxytryptophan', 'Pretonine')","Food, Medical","5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), used medically as oxitriptan, is a naturally occurring amino acid and chemical precursor as well as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin. 5-HTP can be manufactured and used as a drug and supplement with the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name oxitriptan. Brand names include Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. As a drug, it is used in the treatment of depression and for certain other indications. == Production == 5-HTP is produced from the amino acid tryptophan through the action of the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase. Tryptophan hydroxylase is one of the biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Production of 5-HTP is the rate-limiting step in 5-HT (serotonin) synthesis. 5-HTP is normally rapidly converted to 5-HT by amino acid decarboxylase. == Metabolism == 5-HTP is decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) by the enzyme aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase with the help of vitamin B6. This reaction occurs both in nervous tissue and in the liver. 5-HTP crosses the blood–brain barrier, while 5-HT does not. Excess 5-HTP, especially when administered with vitamin B6, is thought to be metabolized and excreted. == Dietary sources == Though 5-HTP is found in food only in insignificant quantities, it is a chemical involved intermediately in the metabolism of tryptophan, an amino acid found in all unfractionated foods, with lower total amino acid content correlating with increased tryptophan absorption. == Use as a medication and supplement == 5-HTP is used medically and as a supplement under the name oxitriptan in the treatment of depression and for certain other indications. It can be potentiated in combination with a peripherally selective aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) inhibitor such as carbidopa or benserazide. These agents increase the strength and duration of oxitriptan. An investigational combination formulation is oxitriptan/carbidopa. == Research == === Psychedelic effects === 5-HTP robustly produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at relatively high doses. It dose-dependently induces the HTR in mice across a dose range of 50 to 250 mg/kg via intraperitoneal administration, with an inverted U-shaped dose–response curve and maximal induction of the HTR at a dose of 200 mg/kg. Similarly to the case of 5-HTP, intracerebroventricular injection of serotonin, but not peripheral administration of serotonin, produces the HTR. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. The HTR of 5-HTP is blocked by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, which block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics in humans, is prevented by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) inhibitors, which block conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin, and is potentiated by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitors, which prevent the degradation of serotonin and other endogenous tryptamines. It is also suppressed by the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor full agonist 8-OH-DPAT, is greatly augmented by the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RS-102221, and is reduced by the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) antagonist EPPTB. In addition, the HTR of 5-HTP is abolished by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) inhibitors, which block conversion of serotonin and other endogenous tryptamines into N-methylated tryptamines, such as N-methylserotonin (NMS; norbufotenin), bufotenin (5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine; 5-HO-DMT), and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). These N-methylated tryptamines are well-known for their psychedelic effects, whereas serotonin itself, without biotransformation, does not seem to produce psychedelic effects. 5-HTP has not been found to produce psychedelic effects in humans, which has been attributed to the high doses required to produce such effects. The 5-HTP doses that produce the HTR in rodents are orders of magnitude higher than the doses of 5-HTP that have been used safely and therapeutically in humans. It remains unknown whether 5-HTP can produce psychedelic effects in humans. The highest dosage of 5-HTP that is known to have been evaluated in humans is about 3,000 mg per day. Serotonin syndrome and associated hallucinations have been reported with overdose of serotonin-elevating drugs, but psychedelic-like effects have not been reported. The lack of the HTR and psychedelic effects with serotonin itself has been attributed to the fact that these effects appear to be dependent on activation of a population of intracellular 5-HT2A receptors expressed in cortical neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that lack the serotonin transporter (SERT) and are inaccessible to serotonin. Serotonin itself is too hydrophilic to enter serotonergic neurons without the SERT, whereas serotonergic psychedelics and serotonin's N-methylated metabolites and analogues are lipophilic and readily enter these neurons. These findings may also explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and related serotonergic agents do not produce psychedelic effects. == See also == α-Methyl-5-hydroxytryptophan == References ==",Hydroxytryptophan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.03807741403579712), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.004080897197127342), (' END', -0.0006043838220648468), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.64708495605737e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0011394681641831994), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -0.00016234986833296716), ('ĠEND', -0.04872744530439377), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.16026635468006134), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0012231733417138457), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032181162387132645)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.7257064580917358)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL,FOOD,PERSONAL CARE;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33375373/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Hydroxytryptophan,https://cosmileeurope.eu/inci/detail/7221/hydroxytryptophan/ ', [])"
2234,"('Oxitriptan', 'Cincofarm', 'Levothym', 'Pretonine', 'Tryptophan, 5-hydroxy-')","Food, Medical","Oxitriptan, also known as L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and sold under various brand names, is a medication and over-the-counter dietary supplement used in the treatment of depression and for other indications. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of oxitriptan include appetite loss, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and serotonin syndrome. The drug is a centrally permeable monoamine precursor and prodrug of serotonin and hence acts as a serotonin receptor agonist. Chemically, oxitriptan is an amino acid and a tryptamine. Oxitriptan has been used clinically since at least the 1970s. == Uses == === Medical === 5-HTP is sold over-the-counter in the United States, France, Canada, Singapore, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid. It is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depressive disorder under the trade names Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. A 2002 review concluded that although the data evaluated suggests that 5-HTP is more effective than placebo in the treatment of depression, the evidence was insufficient to be conclusive due to a lack of clinical data meeting the rigorous standards of the day. More and larger studies using current methodologies are needed to determine if 5-HTP is truly effective in treating depression. In small, controlled trials, 5-HTP has also been reported to augment the antidepressant efficacy of the antidepressant clomipramine. A 2020 meta-analysis found oral 5-HTP supplementation had a large effect size on depression symptom severity. However, the included studies were considered relatively weak and the methods and treatment duration varied between the seven studies examined. ==== Other uses ==== At high doses, or in combination with carbidopa, 5-HTP has been used to treat obesity (by promoting weight loss). === Use after MDMA === MDMA is an empathogenic-entactogenic and serotonergic psychotropic drug used primarily for recreational, though sometimes also therapeutic, purposes. Among users of MDMA, the serotonergic effects of the drug are often of particular interest and concern: After consuming MDMA, serotonin concentrations are greatly reduced in the brain. 5-HTP is necessary for serotonin production and its concentrations in the brain also decrease after taking MDMA. == Side effects == Potential side effects of 5-HTP include heartburn, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, sexual problems, vivid dreams or nightmares, and muscle problems. Serotonin syndrome can occur. Because 5-HTP has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, possible side effects and interactions with other drugs are not well known. According to the US National Library of Medicine, 5-HTP has not been associated with serotonin syndrome or any serious adverse events in humans. Across multiple studies, 5-HTP has also been reported to not cause any noticeable hematological or cardiovascular changes. 5-HTP had also been associated with eosinophilia, but later studies have not found any causal connection. == Interactions == When combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class, very high parenteral doses of 5-HTP can cause acute serotonin syndrome in rats. It is unclear if such findings have clinical relevance, as most drugs will cause serious adverse events or death in rodents at very high doses. In humans, 5-HTP has never been clinically associated with serotonin syndrome – although a case report suggests 5-HTP can precipitate mania when added to an MAOI. When combined with carbidopa (as a treatment for symptoms of Parkinson's disease), 5-HTP causes nausea and vomiting; however, this can be alleviated via administration of granisetron. Cases of scleroderma-like illness have been reported in patients using carbidopa and 5-HTP. Oral 5-HTP results in an increase in urinary 5-HIAA, a serotonin metabolite, indicating that 5-HTP is peripherally metabolized to serotonin, which is then metabolized. This might cause false positive results in tests looking for carcinoid syndrome. Due to the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin by the liver, there could be a risk of heart valve disease from serotonin's effect on the heart, as based on preclinical findings. However, 5-HTP has not been associated with cardiac toxicity in humans. It has been suggested that 5-HTP may cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a serious condition which results in extreme muscle tenderness, myalgia, and blood abnormalities. However, there is evidence to show that EMS was likely caused by a contaminant in certain 5-HTP supplements. == Pharmacology == The psychoactive action of 5-HTP is derived from its increase in production of serotonin in central nervous system tissue. Research shows that co-administration with carbidopa greatly increases plasma 5-HTP levels. Other studies have indicated the risk of a scleroderma-like condition resulting from the combination of 5-HTP and carbidopa. After oral administration, 5-HTP is absorbed by the upper intestine. The mode of absorption is not known, but presumably involves active transport via amino acid transporters. 5-HTP is adequately absorbed via oral cavity. With a decarboxylase inhibitor, the bioavailability of 5-HTP can be higher than 50%. 5-HTP is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of ≈1.5 h, and rapidly eliminated with a half-life of ≈1.5 – 2 h. Co-administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa, benserazide) doubles the half-life of 5-HTP to ≈ 3 – 4 h, and enhances exposure several-fold, depending on the dosing regimen. 5-HTP's short half-life (<2 hours) may inherently limit its therapeutic potential, as systemic 5-HTP exposure levels will fluctuate substantially even with relatively frequent dosing. Such exposure fluctuations are usually associated with increased adverse event burdens resulting from Cmax (time to maximal systemic concentration) drug spikes, and decreased clinical efficacy resulting from sub-therapeutic exposure for large parts of the day, when taken as a single dose unit or at intervals significantly larger than Cmax. It has been proposed that 5-HTP dosage forms achieving prolonged delivery would be more effective, as has been demonstrated many times with other pharmaceuticals with short durations of action. For example, controlled-release oxycodone (OxyContin) or morphine (MS-Contin) are intended to, via novel delivery mechanisms, permit pain relief for up to twelve hours with an active ingredient which only provides relief for 3 to 6 hours. However, the inherent variability amongst different people with respect to drug metabolism makes this task challenging. == Society and culture == === Names === Oxitriptan is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name. Brand names of oxitriptan include Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. === Regulatory status === There are currently no approved drug products containing 5-HTP approved by the FDA. All available 5-HTP products are nutraceuticals and are as such not regulated or verified for purity, integrity, or clinical efficacy or safety, mandating caution regarding human consumption. As of 25 August 2020, Hungary added 5-HTP to the controlled psychoactive substances list, prohibiting production, sale, import, storage and use, becoming the first country to do so. === Natural sources === The seeds of the Griffonia simplicifolia, a climbing shrub native to West Africa and Central Africa, are used as an herbal supplement for their 5-HTP content. In one 2010 trial, Griffonia simplicifolia extract appeared to increase satiety in overweight women. == Research == In clinical trials of various design, 5-HTP has also been reported to treat fibromyalgia, myoclonus, migraine, and cerebellar ataxia. However, these clinical findings, as for all therapeutic findings with 5-HTP, are preliminary and need confirmation in larger trials. === Oxitriptan/carbidopa combination === A combination of oxitriptan and carbidopa, oxitriptan/carbidopa, is being developed for the potential treatment of depression. === Slow-release formulation === 5-HTP's short half-life is impractical for chronic drug therapy. Research conducted at Duke University in mice has demonstrated that 5-HTP when administered as slow-release appears to gain drug properties. Slow-release delivery attenuates or abolishes the peaks and valleys in 5-HTP exposure during treatment. Slow-release delivery of 5-HTP markedly improved the safety profile of 5-HTP and conferred stable plasma exposure of 5-HTP and strong and sustained enhancement of brain serotonin function. This discovery indicates that 5-HTP slow-release medications represent a new avenue for treatment of brain disorders responsive to serotonergic enhancement. == See also == Tryptophan α-Methyl-5-hydroxytryptophan == References ==",Oxitriptan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00019173922191839665), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0024769625160843134), (' FOOD', -0.003191612893715501)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0004634975048247725), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.014171794056892395), ('ĠFOOD', -0.002714403672143817), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07905520498752594)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxitriptan,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB02959 ', [])"

2236,"('Trigonellinamide', 'N(1)-methylnicotinamide', 'Trigonellamide', 'Pyridinium, 3-carbamoyl-1-methyl-', 'N(sup 1)-methylnicotinamide')","Endogenous, Medical","1-Methylnicotinamide (1-MNA, trigonellamide) is a prototypic organic cation. 1-Methylnicotinamide is the methylated amide of Nicotinamide (niacinamide, vitamin B3). 1-Methylnicotinamide is an endogenic substance that is produced in the liver when Nicotinamide is metabolized. It is a typical substance secreted in the kidney. It participates in the nicotinamide salvage pathway within the NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) metabolic pathway, thereby contributing to optimizing NAD+ levels. == Occurrence == To date, the highest natural concentration of 1-methylnicotinamide has been found in the alga Undaria pinnatifida (3.2 mg/100 g of dried algae) and green tea leaves (3 mg/100 g of product). Other products with notable 1-MNA content include celery (1.6 mg/100 g of product), Chinese black mushrooms (shiitake, 1.3 mg/100 g), and fermented soybeans (natto, 1.0 mg/100 g). == Biosynthesis == 1-Methylnicotinamide can be produced in the liver by nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). The reaction takes place during the metabolism of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). NNMT is also present in brain tissue, adipose tissue, muscle tissue, kidneys, and skin. NNMT (nicotinamide N-methyltransferase) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the NNMT gene. NNMT catalyzes the methylation of nicotinamide and similar compounds using the methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e) to produce S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) and 1-methylnicotinamide. NNMT is highly expressed in the human liver. == Role in the body == Scientific research highlights numerous therapeutic and health-promoting properties of 1-MNA, including vascular protective, anticoagulant, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and endurance-enhancing effects. === Vascular Protective Effects === 1-MNA exerts beneficial effects on blood vessels through its action on the vascular endothelium. It improves the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), which is crucial for vasodilation, and regulates the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), the enzyme responsible for NO synthesis. These effects have been demonstrated in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Oral administration of 1-MNA has been shown to increase the diameter of the brachial artery (as measured by flow-mediated dilation, FMD) and stimulate NO release from human endothelial cells in both healthy individuals and those with hypercholesterolemia increased. Additionally, in cases of vascular dysfunction (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia or diabetes), 1-MNA restored normal NO-dependent vasodilation. By increasing NO bioavailability, 1-MNA may counteract endothelial dysfunction, support endothelial regeneration, and improve vascular function, particularly in the context of cardiovascular risk. === Anticoagulant Effects === 1-Methylnicotinamide is an endogenous activator of prostacyclin synthesis and can therefore regulate thrombolytic and inflammatory processes in the cardiovascular system. It inhibits platelet-dependent thrombosis through a mechanism involving cyclooxygenase-2 and prostacyclin (PGI2) and increases nitric oxide bioavailability in the endothelium. Endogenous prostacyclin (PGI2) plays a critical role in preventing platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. A deficiency in PGI2 can lead to increased platelet aggregation and arterial thrombi. === Anti-atherosclerotic and Anti-inflammatory Effects === 1-MNA exhibits anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory properties by improving the prostacyclin- and NO-dependent secretory function of the vascular endothelium, inhibiting platelet activation, reducing inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques, and lowering systemic inflammation and TNF-α levels. The anti-inflammatory effects of 1-MNA are linked to its ability to stimulate endogenous PGI2 secretion and reduce IL-4 and TNF-α levels. These effects are mediated by endothelial mechanisms rather than a direct impact on immune cell function, ensuring that the body’s immune response is not weakened. === NAD+ Optimization === 1-MNA is an inhibitor of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT). By inhibiting NNMT activity, it regulates NAD+ biosynthesis via the nicotinamide salvage pathway, the primary route for NAD+ synthesis in mammals. By participating in this pathway, 1-MNA optimizes NAD+ levels. === Impact on SIRT1 === Research published in Nature Medicine indicates that 1-MNA enhances SIRT1 expression and stability. SIRT1 is an enzyme associated with longevity. Studies using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that 1-MNA supplementation may extend lifespan. These studies also link 1-MNA to SIRT1. === Neuroprotective Effects === Animal experiments with diabetic rats have shown that 1-methylnicotinamide positively effects degenerative changes in the brain, allowing cognitive performance to be maintained longer. It also prevents depressive behavior with efficacy comparable to the common antidepressant fluoxetine. This effect is attributed to the reduction of neuroinflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), and increased expression of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a protein supporting neuron survival and growth. The neuroprotective effects of 1-MNA involve shielding against neurotoxins, amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, neuroinflammatory responses, and neuronal apoptosis. It has been shown to improve memory deficits and cognitive functions, suggesting potential for treating neurodegenerative disorders. === Enhancement of Physical Performance === 1-MNA acts as a myokine, supporting the utilization of amino acids for gluconeogenesis in the liver and stimulating lipolysis in adipose tissue, thereby providing energy for muscles. Studies indicate that 1-MNA supplementation improves exercise tolerance and reduces fatigue. After one month of supplementation with 58 mg of 1-MNA, post-COVID-19 patients reported improved distances in a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), with 92% of participants experiencing better outcomes compared to controls. Additional studies highlight 1-MNA’s ability to enhance physical performance by stimulating PGI2 release, protecting microcirculation, and ensuring adequate blood flow to muscle tissues. This mechanism may reduce cardiovascular risks associated with physical exertion, particularly in individuals with impaired endothelial response. == Commercialization == 1-MNA has been approved for use in food products in the form of 1-MNA chloride. The approval process in the European Union was successfully completed by PHARMENA SA. In 2017, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) confirmed the safety of 1-MNA chloride in food supplements, leading to its authorization in 2018 under EU Regulation 2018/1123. 1-MNA chloride is currently used in dietary supplements. Other chemical forms of 1-MNA are not currently allowed on the market as food. == Safety == The safety of 1-MNA chloride has been thoroughly evaluated by EFSA, confirming its safe use.

The name crotonic acid was given because it was erroneously thought to be a saponification product of croton oil. It crystallizes as colorless needles from hot water. With a cis-alkene, Isocrotonic acid is an isomer of crotonic acid. Crotonic acid is soluble in water and many organic solvents. Its odor is similar to that of butyric acid. == Production == Crotonic acid produced industrially by oxidation of crotonaldehyde:: 230 CH3CH=CHCHO + 1/2 O2 → CH3CH=CHCO2H A number of other methods exist, including the Knoevenagel condensation of acetaldehyde with malonic acid in pyridine:: 229 The alkaline hydrolysis of allyl cyanide followed by the intramolecular rearrangement of the double bond: Furthermore, it is formed during the distillation of 3-hydroxybutyric acid: == Properties == Crotonic acid crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system in the space group P21/a (space group 14, position 3) with the lattice parameters a = 971 pm, b = 690 pm, c = 775 pm and β = 104.0°. The unit cell contains four formula units. == Reactions == Crotonic acid converts into butyric acid by hydrogenation or by reduction with zinc and sulfuric acid. Upon treatment with chlorine or bromine, crotonic acid converts to 2,3-dihalobutyric acids: Crotonic acid adds hydrogen bromide to form 3-bromobutyric acid. The reaction with alkaline potassium permanganate solution affords 2,3-dihydroxybutyric acid. Upon heating with acetic anhydride, crotonic acid converts to the acid anhydride: Esterification of crotonic acid using sulfuric acid as a catalyst provides the corresponding crotonate esters: Crotonic acid reacts with hypochlorous acid to 2-chloro-3-hydroxybutyric acid. This can either be reduced with sodium amalgam to butyric acid, can form with sulfuric acid 2-chlorobutenoic acid, react with hydrogen chloride to 2,3-dichlorobutenoic acid or with potassium ethoxide to 3-methyloxirane-2-carboxylic acid. Crotonic acid reacts with ammonia at the alpha position in the presence of mercury(II) acetate. This reaction provides DL-threonine. == Use == Crotonic acid is mainly used as a comonomer with vinyl acetate. The resulting copolymers are used in paints and adhesives. Crotonyl chloride reacts with N-ethyl-2-methylaniline (N-ethyl-o-toluidine) to provide crotamiton, which is used as an agent against scabies. == Safety == Its LD50 is 1 g/kg (oral, rats).

2238,"('Minaprine (dihydrochloride)', 'Minaprine', 'Cantor', 'Minaprinum', 'Minaprina')",Medical,"A cantor or chanter is a person who leads people in singing or sometimes in prayer. Cantor as a profession generally refers to those leading a Jewish congregation, although it also applies to the lead singer or choir director in Christian contexts. In formal Jewish worship, a cantor is a person who sings solo verses or passages to which the choir or congregation responds. == Overview == The term itself is derived from the Latin for ""singer"", though it is frequently used to translate a range of equivalent terms in other languages, such as for the leader of singing on a traditional chundan vallam or snake boat of Kerala. == Role of the cantor == === Judaism === In Judaism, a cantor sings and leads congregants in prayer in religious services. They are also sometimes called a huzzan, which is the Hebrew term for the role. They often come from a long line of cantors in their family; born with a natural gift of singing with extensive vocal range. The role of professional cantor is especially central in Reform and Conservative Judaism, where they serve as clergy in their congregations. Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism ordain cantors from seminaries. A cantor goes through years of extensive religious education, similar to that of a rabbi, in order to become officially recognized as such. Orthodox Judaism only allows men to be cantors, though professional cantors are less common in Orthodox Judaism. Members of the congregation are usually given the honour of leading the congregation in prayer, without any formal training. Professional cantors are usually seen only in particularly large congregations or on special occasions, such as the High Holy Days. Cantors in Sephardic communities are often called paytan, and they are increasingly hired for their role within Sephardi synagogues, rather than being a member of the community who takes on the role. === Islam === In Islam, the role of cantor is fulfilled by an ordained muezzin, who calls the adhan in Islam for prayer, that serves as clergy in their congregations and perform all ministerial rites as imams. === Christianity === A cantor in Christianity is an ecclesiastical officer that leads liturgical music. In some branches of Christianity, the lead cantor is called the precentor, and is assisted by a succentor. In the Lutheran Church, the Kantor is the chief musician in a particular parish or city, one notable example being Johann Sebastian Bach. In the Greek Orthodox Church, the Protopsaltis is the cantor of the right choir, and the Lampadarios is the cantor of the left choir.

2240,"('Bupivacaine (hydrochloride)', 'Bupivacaine', 'Marcaine', 'Bupivacaina', 'Anekain')",Medical,"Bupivacaine, marketed under the brand name Marcaine among others, is a medication used to decrease sensation in a specific small area. In nerve blocks, it is injected around a nerve that supplies the area, or into the spinal canal's epidural space. It is available mixed with a small amount of epinephrine to increase the duration of its action. It typically begins working within 15 minutes and lasts for 2 to 8 hours. Possible side effects include sleepiness, muscle twitching, ringing in the ears, changes in vision, low blood pressure, and an irregular heart rate. Concerns exist that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. Concentrated bupivacaine is not recommended for epidural freezing. Epidural freezing may also increase the length of labor. It is a local anaesthetic of the amide group. Bupivacaine was discovered in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Bupivacaine is available as a generic medication. An implantable formulation of bupivacaine (Xaracoll) was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020. == Medical uses == Bupivacaine is indicated for local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, sympathetic nerve block, and epidural and caudal blocks. It is sometimes used in combination with epinephrine to prevent systemic absorption and extend the duration of action. The 0.75% (most concentrated) formulation is used in retrobulbar block. It is the most commonly used local anesthetic in epidural anesthesia during labor, as well as in postoperative pain management. Liposomal formulations of bupivacaine (brand name EXPAREL) have not shown clinical benefit compared to plain bupivacaine when used in traditional perineural injections, although some industry-funded studies have suggested benefits when used in local infiltration. The fixed-dose combination of bupivacaine with Type I collagen (brand name Xaracoll) is indicated for acute postsurgical analgesia (pain relief) for up to 24 hours in adults following open inguinal hernia repair. Bupivacaine (Posimir) is indicated in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post-surgical analgesia for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression. == Contraindications == Bupivacaine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to bupivacaine or amino-amide anesthetics. It is also contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical blocks and intravenous regional anaesthesia (Bier block) because of potential risk of tourniquet failure and systemic absorption of the drug and subsequent cardiac arrest. The 0.75% formulation is contraindicated in epidural anesthesia during labor because of the association with refractory cardiac arrest. == Adverse effects == Compared to other local anaesthetics, bupivacaine is markedly cardiotoxic. However, adverse drug reactions are rare when it is administered correctly. Most reactions are caused by accelerated absorption from the injection site, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation. However, allergic reactions can rarely occur. Clinically significant adverse events result from systemic absorption of bupivacaine and primarily involve the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Effects on the central nervous system typically occur at lower blood plasma concentrations. Initially, cortical inhibitory pathways are selectively inhibited, causing symptoms of neuronal excitation. At higher plasma concentrations, both inhibitory and excitatory pathways are inhibited, causing central nervous system depression and potentially coma. Higher plasma concentrations also lead to cardiovascular effects, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. Adverse effects on the central nervous system may indicate impending cardiotoxicity and should be carefully monitored. Central nervous system: circumoral numbness, facial tingling, vertigo, tinnitus, restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, seizure, coma Cardiovascular: hypotension, arrhythmia, bradycardia, heart block, cardiac arrest Toxicity can also occur in the setting of subarachnoid injection during high spinal anesthesia. These effects include: paresthesia, paralysis, apnea, hypoventilation, fecal incontinence, and urinary incontinence. Additionally, bupivacaine can cause chondrolysis after continuous infusion into a joint space. Bupivacaine has caused several deaths when the epidural anaesthetic has been administered intravenously accidentally. === Treatment of overdose === Animal evidence indicates intralipid, a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion, can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anaesthetic overdose, and human case reports of successful use in this way. Plans to publicize this treatment more widely have been published. === Pregnancy and lactation === Bupivacaine crosses the placenta and is a pregnancy category C drug. However, it is approved for use at term in obstetrical anesthesia. Bupivacaine is excreted in breast milk. Risks of stopping breast feeding versus stopping bupivacaine should be discussed with the patient. === Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis === Bupivacaine is toxic to cartilage and its intra-articular infusions may lead to postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of voltage-gated sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization. Without depolarization, no initiation or conduction of a pain signal can occur. === Pharmacokinetics === The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine and other local anesthetics is dependent upon the dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the preparation. Onset of action (route and dose-dependent): 1–17 min Duration of action (route and dose-dependent): 2–9 hr Half life: neonates, 8.1 hr, adults: 2.7 hr Time to peak plasma concentration (for peripheral, epidural, or caudal block): 30–45 min Protein binding: about 95% Metabolism: hepatic Excretion: renal (6% unchanged) == Chemical structure == Like lidocaine, bupivacaine is an amino-amide anesthetic; the aromatic head and the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an amide bond rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics. As a result, the amino-amide anesthetics are more stable and less likely to cause allergic reactions. Unlike lidocaine, the terminal amino portion of bupivacaine (as well as mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine) is contained within a piperidine ring; these agents are known as pipecholyl xylidines. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 17 September 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Exparel, intended for the treatment of post-operative pain. The applicant for this medicinal product is Pacira Ireland Limited. Exparel liposomal was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2020. === Economics === Bupivacaine is available as a generic medication. == Research == Levobupivacaine is the (S)-(–)-enantiomer of bupivacaine, with a longer duration of action, producing less vasodilation. Durect Corporation is developing a biodegradable, controlled-release drug delivery system for after surgery. As of 2010, it has completed a phase-III clinical trial. == See also == Bupivacaine/meloxicam == References ==",Anekain,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010950337309623137), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.10370534658432007), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008903210051357746)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs-about.com](https://drugs-about.com/drugs-a/anekain.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Anekain (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride) Pliva', type='url_citation', url='https://drugs-about.com/drugs-a/anekain.html?utm_source=openai')])"
2241,"('Levobupivacaine (hydrochloride)', '(s)-bupivacaine monohydrochloride', 'Levobupivacaine', '(s)-bupivacaine', 'Lbupivacaine')",Medical,"Levobupivacaine (rINN) is a local anaesthetic drug indicated for minor and major surgical anaesthesia and pain management. It is a long-acting amide-type local anaesthetic that blocks nerve impulses by inhibiting sodium ion influx into the nerve cells. Levobupivacaine is the S-enantiomer of racemic bupivacaine and therefore similar in pharmacological effects. The drug typically starts taking effect within 15 minutes and can last up to 16 hours depending on factors such as site of administration and dosage. Levobupivacaine was designed, in the late 1970s, to be a safer and more effective alternative to bupivacaine, which had been associated with a higher risk of cardiotoxicity. Compared to bupivacaine, levobupivacaine is associated with less vasodilation and has a longer duration of action. It is approximately 13 per cent less potent (by molarity) than racemic bupivacaine and has a longer motor block onset time. Ropivacaine is, next to levobupivacaine, another less cardiotoxic alternative to bupivacaine. Levobupivacaine hydrochloride is commonly marketed by AbbVie under the trade name Chirocaine. In Europe, Chirocaine is available – prescription only – in concentrations ranging from 0.625 mg/mL to 7.5 mg/mL. == Clinical use == === Indications === Levobupivacaine, the S(-)-enantiomer of bupivacaine has been developed as an alternative to the racemic mixture, as it has been shown to have a lower cardiotoxicity than bupivacaine. Under European Union advice, it can be applied for minor and major surgical anaesthesia, as well as (post-operative) pain management. Particularly, it has been found suitable for multiple procedures, such as epidural block. It is effective for human patients who receive elective Caesarean section or lower body surgery, as it does not diverge dramatically in terms of sensory and/or motor block duration in comparison to bupivacaine. Deserving of consideration is the fact that its enhanced motor blocking can be a downside for patients receiving an epidural injection during childbirth, as a certain level of movement may still be required. Other than childbirth, possible applications of levobupivacaine include upper and lower limb surgery, as well as eye surgery, where it blocks the extraocular muscle, highly efficient and convenient for patients undergoing vitreoretinal anterior segment or cataract surgery. Levobupivacaine can be combined with other analgesics, including opioids, for postoperative pain management. === Contraindications === Using 0.75% (7.5 mg/mL) of levobupivacaine, similar to bupivacaine, is contraindicated in obstetric patients. Use in paracervical blocks in obstetrics is also contraindicated. Levobupivacaine is furthermore contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to levobupivacaine or other amide-type local anaesthetics, in patients with severe hypotension (e.g. cardiac or hypovolemic shock) and for use in intravenous regional anaesthesia (Bier’s block). === Adverse effects === Possible adverse effects in the central nervous system caused by levobupivacaine usage are light-headedness, tinnitus, tongue numbness and convulsions, which may be due to the blockade of sodium, potassium and calcium channels in tissues that were not intended as targets. Cardiotoxicity may be a result of indirect effects of the drug, such as the blockade of myocardial sympathetic nerves, thus leading to contractile delay, or by direct effects, such as the blockade of potassium channels. Effects of this nature lead to lowered contractile function and arrhythmogenic effects, which can potentially cause cardiovascular collapse and death. It is to note that the drug also has vasoconstrictive activity, thereby increasing the duration of sensory blockage with a relatively low risk of central nervous system toxicity on one hand, and on the other, it can have the same effect on uteroplacental blood flow, which can harm the foetus. Ultimately, levobupivacaine has been shown to have a lower risk of cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity compared to bupivacaine in animal studies, not at the expense of potency and efficacy, and should be therefore considered as an alternative. === Toxicity === Levobupivacaine has become a more favourable alternative for regional anaesthesia than bupivacaine due to its reduced toxicity. A plethora of non-human studies have established levobupivacaine’s lower risk of cardiac and neurotoxic adverse effects. Most animal studies show that the lethal dose (LD50) of levobupivacaine is approximately 50% higher than that of bupivacaine. In general, laevorotatory isomers tend to cause significantly fewer adverse effects and are thus a safer pharmacological alternative. Levobupivacaine has a 97% protein binding rate which is 2% higher than what is observed in bupivacaine. The faster protein binding rate contributes to its reduced toxicity level. In human volunteer studies, levobupivacaine consistently proved to have a safety advantage over bupivacaine. Risk factors for local anaesthetic toxicity depend on the administration of levobupivacaine to myocardial and cerebral tissue, as well as the predisposition of these tissues to levobupivacaine’s negative effects. Age is a relevant factor in vulnerability to levobupivacaine toxicity. Elderly patients are more likely to have pre-existing conditions impacting the cardiac, renal and hepatic systems, which contribute to the slower absorption rate and plasma concentrations below the toxic level compared to younger patients. On the other hand, homeostatic disbalance can exacerbate toxic effects. It is important to adjust the dosage of levobupivacaine in paediatric patients due to their underdeveloped metabolic processing to prevent reaching toxic levels. The dosage of local anaesthetics is calculated based on the patient’s weight and body mass index, however, the association power is stronger in children than in adults. Moreover, symptoms of systemic toxicity like paraesthesia are harder to notice in children. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Levobupivacaine is a drug that has analgesic, motor blocking, and sensory blocking effects on the human body, whose properties are dictated by its chemical characteristics, such as pKa, which has a value of 8.1. The pKa of a drug can be informative information that indicates its ionisation under physiological conditions. For example, drugs with a high pKa, such as that of levobupivacaine, tend to be their ionised form under physiological state, meaning that they would not easily cross the hydrophobic plasma membrane of cells. This, however, is counteracted by the high lipid solubility of levobupivacaine, which increases the ease with which it can diffuse through the phospholipid bilayer. Additionally, high-protein binding quality (97%) is characteristic of levobupivacaine, which strengthens its binding to cell surface proteins, thereby lengthening the binding, and thus action time. The S(-)-enantiomer of levobupivacaine is a high-potency, long-acting anaesthetic with a relatively slow onset of action. Indeed, it has been found in certain studies that, as a surgical anaesthetic, it has a sensory ad motor blocking activity for over 90% of adult patients who received appropriate doses for their bodily composition, and duration of the surgery, with an onset time of 15 minutes. More specifically, levobupivacaine achieves its effects by acting on the neuronal voltage-sensitive sodium channels, where it prevents the transmission of nerve impulses. The normal function of these sodium channels is halted temporarily, as the drug interferes with their opening, thereby inhibiting the conduction of action potentials in nerves involved in sympathetic, sensory, and motor activity. This interruption results in decreased muscle control, and overall analgesic effects which allow for levobupivacaine to act as a local anaesthetic. Levobupivacaine varies slightly in its effects depending on the characteristics of the neuron in question. For example, in myelinated neurons, the nodes of Ranvier are targeted and more easily blocked than unmyelinated neurons, and small nerves are more easily blocked than large nerves. When compared to the racemic bupivacaine mixture, levobupivacaine generally has been shown to have similar effects. As an anaesthetic, it is similar in nerve-blocking potency compared to its R(+)-enantiomer and racemic mixture, although its effects are affected by the route of administration and the concentration, however, they were ultimately similar among the three. Some animal studies indicate that among the three, levobupivacaine shows an increased duration of anaesthesia and/or greater potency, and there is evidence that in humans it is as potent as bupivacaine. === Pharmacokinetics === The plasma concentration of levobupivacaine is influenced by both the dosage and the method of administration. Additionally, absorption depends on the vascularity of the tissue. Maximum plasma concentration of 1.2 μg/mL is reached approximately 30 minutes post epidural injection. Levobupivacaine undergoes biotransformation in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme, specifically CYP1A2 and CYP3A isoforms as part of phase one biotransformation, thereby producing inactive metabolites. The major metabolite produced is 3-hydroxy-levobupivacaine and the minor one is desbutyl-levobupivacaine. Subsequently, levobupivacaine metabolites are further converted into glucuronic acid and sulphate ester conjugates as a part of phase two. Metabolic inversion of levobupivacaine is not observed. The extensive metabolism of levobupivacaine by the liver ensures that no unchanged drug is excreted via urine. As a result, in patients with renal dysfunction, only the inactive metabolites accumulate instead of the drug itself. Research tracing radiolabelled levobupivacaine showed that 71% was recovered in urine and 24% was recovered in faecesl After the intravenous administration of 40 mg of levobupivacaine, the half-life was approximately 80 minutes and the rate of clearance was 651 ± 221.5 mL/min. == Chemistry == === Structure === Levobupivacaine is an amino-amide anaesthetic that is similar in structure to bupivacaine, namely the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine. A lipophilic aromatic ring is linked to a hydrocarbon chain by an amide bond. The lipophilic components of levobupivacaine allow it to cross cell membraness and exert its local anaesthetic effect by causing a reversible blockade of open neuronal sodium channels. === Synthesis === A 5-step process to synthesise levobupivacaine from Nα-CBZ (S)-lysine, published in 1996, is depicted in Scheme 1. The key steps in this process include oxidative de-animation and stereospecific ring closure to form the pipecolamide core structure. This method is claimed to be efficient, but showed to be dangerous for mass production due to the high risk of explosion of the diazonium salt intermediates. A more recent patent from 2008, consists of a 3-step process (see Scheme 2) to synthesise levobupivacaine hydrochloride of an optical purity of at least 99%. (S)-2,6-pipecocholxylide (I) is reacted with 1-bromobutane and a base (a), such as potassium carbonate, to obtain a solution of (S)-bupivacaine (II) and its enantiomers. Recrystallisation of this solution with a solvent (b), preferably cyclohexane, can lead to an optical purity of at least 98% levobupivacaine. Lastly, the addition of hydrochloride (c) is possible. == References ==",Levobupivacaine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.775113539944869e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00026913834153674543)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levobupivacaine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Levobupivacaine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levobupivacaine?utm_source=openai')])"
2242,"('Uric acid', 'Urate', 'Lithic acid', 'Purine-2,6,8(1h,3h,9h)-trione', 'Trioxopurine')","Endogenous, Medical","Uric acid is a heterocyclic compound of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen with the formula C5H4N4O3. It forms ions and salts known as urates and acid urates, such as ammonium acid urate. Uric acid is a product of the metabolic breakdown of purine nucleotides, and it is a normal component of urine. High blood concentrations of uric acid can lead to gout and are associated with other medical conditions, including diabetes and the formation of ammonium acid urate kidney stones. == Chemistry == Uric acid was first isolated from kidney stones in 1776 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. In 1882, the Ukrainian chemist Ivan Horbaczewski first synthesized uric acid by melting urea with glycine. Uric acid displays lactam–lactim tautomerism. Uric acid crystallizes in the lactam form, with computational chemistry also indicating that tautomer to be the most stable. Uric acid is a diprotic acid with pKa1 = 5.4 and pKa2 = 10.3. At physiological pH, urate predominates in solution. == Biochemistry == The enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO) catalyzes the formation of uric acid from xanthine and hypoxanthine. XO, which is found in mammals, functions primarily as a dehydrogenase and rarely as an oxidase, despite its name. Xanthine in turn is produced from other purines. Xanthine oxidase is a large enzyme whose active site consists of the metal molybdenum bound to sulfur and oxygen. Uric acid is released in hypoxic conditions (low oxygen saturation). === Water solubility === In general, the water solubility of uric acid and its alkali metal and alkaline earth salts is rather low. All these salts exhibit greater solubility in hot water than cold, allowing for easy recrystallization. This low solubility is significant for the etiology of gout. The solubility of the acid and its salts in ethanol is very low or negligible. In ethanol/water mixtures, the solubilities are somewhere between the end values for pure ethanol and pure water. The figures given indicate what mass of water is required to dissolve a unit mass of compound indicated. The lower the number, the more soluble the substance in the said solvent. == Genetic and physiological diversity == === Primates === In humans uric acid (actually hydrogen urate ion) is the final oxidation (breakdown) product of purine metabolism and is excreted in urine, whereas in most other mammals, the enzyme uricase further oxidizes uric acid to allantoin. The loss of uricase in higher primates parallels the similar loss of the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid, leading to the suggestion that urate may partially substitute for ascorbate in such species. Both uric acid and ascorbic acid are strong reducing agents (electron donors) and potent antioxidants. In humans, over half the antioxidant capacity of blood plasma comes from hydrogen urate ion. ==== Humans ==== The normal concentration range of uric acid (or hydrogen urate ion) in human blood is 25 to 80 mg/L for men and 15 to 60 mg/L for women (but see below for slightly different values). An individual can have serum values as high as 96 mg/L and not have gout. In humans, about 70% of daily uric acid disposal occurs via the kidneys, and in 5–25% of humans, impaired renal (kidney) excretion leads to hyperuricemia. Normal excretion of uric acid in the urine is 270 to 360 mg per day (concentration of 270 to 360 mg/L if one litre of urine is produced per day – higher than the solubility of uric acid because it is in the form of dissolved acid urates), roughly 1% as much as the daily excretion of urea. === Dogs === The Dalmatian has a genetic defect in uric acid uptake by the liver and kidneys, resulting in decreased conversion to allantoin, so this breed excretes uric acid, and not allantoin, in the urine. === Birds, reptiles and desert-dwelling mammals === In birds and reptiles, and in some desert-dwelling mammals (such as the kangaroo rat), uric acid also is the end product of purine metabolism, but it is excreted in feces as a dry mass. This involves a complex metabolic pathway that is energetically costly in comparison to processing of other nitrogenous wastes such as urea (from the urea cycle) or ammonia, but has the advantages of reducing water loss and preventing dehydration. === Invertebrates === Platynereis dumerilii, a marine polychaete worm, uses uric acid as a sexual pheromone. The female of the species releases uric acid into the water during mating, which induces males to release sperm. === Bacteria === Uric acid metabolism is done in the human gut by ~1/5 of bacteria species that come from 4 of 6 major phyla. Such metabolism is anaerobic involving uncharacterized ammonia lyase, peptidase, carbamoyl transferase, and oxidoreductase enzymes. The result is that uric acid is converted into xanthine or lactate and the short chain fatty acids such as acetate and butyrate. Radioisotope studies suggest about 1/3 of uric acid is removed in healthy people in their gut with this being roughly 2/3 in those with kidney disease. In mouse models, such bacteria compensate for the loss of uricase leading researchers to raise the possibility ""that antibiotics targeting anaerobic bacteria, which would ablate gut bacteria, increase the risk for developing gout in humans"". == Genetics == Although foods such as meat and seafood can elevate serum urate levels, genetic variation is a much greater contributor to high serum urate. A proportion of people have mutations in the urate transport proteins responsible for the excretion of uric acid by the kidneys. Variants of a number of genes, linked to serum urate, have so far been identified: SLC2A9; ABCG2; SLC17A1; SLC22A11; SLC22A12; SLC16A9; GCKR; LRRC16A; and PDZK1. GLUT9, encoded by the SLC2A9 gene, is known to transport both uric acid and fructose. Myogenic hyperuricemia, as a result of the purine nucleotide cycle running when ATP reservoirs in muscle cells are low, is a common pathophysiologic feature of glycogenoses, such as GSD-III, which is a metabolic myopathy impairing the ability of ATP (energy) production for muscle cells. In these metabolic myopathies, myogenic hyperuricemia is exercise-induced; inosine, hypoxanthine and uric acid increase in plasma after exercise and decrease over hours with rest. Excess AMP (adenosine monophosphate) is converted into uric acid. AMP → IMP → Inosine → Hypoxanthine → Xanthine → Uric Acid == Clinical significance and research == In human blood plasma, the reference range of uric acid is typically 3.4–7.2 mg per 100 mL(200–430 μmol/L) for men, and 2.4–6.1 mg per 100 mL for women (140–360 μmol/L). Uric acid concentrations in blood plasma above and below the normal range are known as, respectively, hyperuricemia and hypouricemia. Likewise, uric acid concentrations in urine above and below normal are known as hyperuricosuria and hypouricosuria. Uric acid levels in saliva may be associated with blood uric acid levels. === High uric acid === Hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid), which induces gout, has various potential origins: Diet may be a factor. High intake of dietary purine, high-fructose corn syrup, and sucrose can increase levels of uric acid. Serum uric acid can be elevated by reduced excretion via the kidneys. Fasting or rapid weight loss can temporarily elevate uric acid levels. Certain drugs, such as thiazide diuretics, can increase blood uric acid levels by interfering with renal clearance. Tumor lysis syndrome, a metabolic complication of certain cancers or chemotherapy, due to nucleobase and potassium release into the plasma. Pseudohypoxia (disrupted NADH/NAD+ ratio) caused by diabetic hyperglycemia and excessive alcohol consumption. ==== Gout ==== A 2011 survey in the United States indicated that 3.9% of the population had gout, whereas 21.4% had hyperuricemia without having symptoms. Excess blood uric acid (serum urate) can induce gout, a painful condition resulting from needle-like crystals of uric acid termed monosodium urate crystals precipitating in joints, capillaries, skin, and other tissues. Gout can occur where serum uric acid levels are as low as 6 mg per 100 mL (357 μmol/L), but an individual can have serum values as high as 9.6 mg per 100 mL (565 μmol/L) and not have gout. In humans, purines are metabolized into uric acid, which is then excreted in the urine. Consumption of large amounts of some types of purine-rich foods, particularly meat and seafood, increases gout risk. Purine-rich foods include liver, kidney, and sweetbreads, and certain types of seafood, including anchovies, herring, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout, haddock, mackerel, and tuna. Moderate intake of purine-rich vegetables, however, is not associated with an increased risk of gout. One treatment for gout in the 19th century was administration of lithium salts; lithium urate is more soluble. Today, inflammation during attacks is more commonly treated with NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids, and urate levels are managed with allopurinol. Allopurinol, which weakly inhibits xanthine oxidase, is an analog of hypoxanthine that is hydroxylated by xanthine oxidoreductase at the 2-position to give oxipurinol. ==== Tumor lysis syndrome ==== Tumor lysis syndrome, an emergency condition that may result from blood cancers, produces high uric acid levels in blood when tumor cells release their contents into the blood, either spontaneously or following chemotherapy. Tumor lysis syndrome may lead to acute kidney injury when uric acid crystals are deposited in the kidneys. Treatment includes hyperhydration to dilute and excrete uric acid via urine, rasburicase to reduce levels of poorly soluble uric acid in blood, or allopurinol to inhibit purine catabolism from adding to uric acid levels. ==== Lesch–Nyhan syndrome ==== Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, a rare inherited disorder, is also associated with high serum uric acid levels. Spasticity, involuntary movement, and cognitive retardation as well as manifestations of gout are seen in this syndrome. ==== Cardiovascular disease ==== Hyperuricemia is associated with an increase in risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It is also possible that high levels of uric acid may have a causal role in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but this is controversial and the data are conflicting. ==== Uric acid stone formation ==== Kidney stones can form through deposits of sodium urate microcrystals. Saturation levels of uric acid in blood may result in one form of kidney stones when the urate crystallizes in the kidney. These uric acid stones are radiolucent, so do not appear on an abdominal plain X-ray. Uric acid crystals can also promote the formation of calcium oxalate stones, acting as ""seed crystals"". ==== Diabetes ==== Hyperuricemia is associated with components of metabolic syndrome, including in children. === Low uric acid === Low uric acid (hypouricemia) can have numerous causes. Low dietary zinc intakes cause lower uric acid levels. This effect can be even more pronounced in women taking oral contraceptive medication. Sevelamer, a drug indicated for prevention of hyperphosphataemia in people with chronic kidney failure, can significantly reduce serum uric acid. ==== Multiple sclerosis ==== Meta-analysis of 10 case-control studies found that the serum uric acid levels of patients with multiple sclerosis were significantly lower compared to those of healthy controls, possibly indicating a diagnostic biomarker for multiple sclerosis. ==== Normalizing low uric acid ==== Correcting low or deficient zinc levels can help elevate serum uric acid. == See also == Theacrine or 1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid, a purine alkaloid found in some teas Uracil – purine nucleobase named by Robert Behrend who was attempting to synthesize derivatives of uric acid Metabolic myopathy Purine nucleotide cycle == References == == External links == Uric acid blood test – MedlinePlus",Urate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.00011975488450843841), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -0.00012356207298580557), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.005621576681733131), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -7.986990567587782e-06), ('OUS', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -0.25216519832611084), ('ĠMED', -0.14018860459327698), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10028530657291412)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; https://www.britannica.com/science/urate,https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB015350 ', [])"
2243,"('Nitroprusside (disodium dihydrate)', 'Sodium nitroprusside dihydrate', 'Sodium nitroferricyanide(iii) dihydrate', 'Hydrogen cyanide', 'Hydrocyanic acid')",Medical,"Hydrogen cyanide (formerly known as prussic acid) is a chemical compound with the formula HCN and structural formula H−C≡N. It is a highly toxic and flammable liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at 25.6 °C (78.1 °F). HCN is produced on an industrial scale and is a highly valued precursor to many chemical compounds ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals. Large-scale applications are for the production of potassium cyanide and adiponitrile, used in mining and plastics, respectively. It is more toxic than solid cyanide compounds due to its volatile nature. A solution of hydrogen cyanide in water, represented as HCN(aq), is called hydrocyanic acid. The salts of the cyanide anion are known as cyanides. Whether hydrogen cyanide is an organic compound or not is a topic of debate among chemists, and opinions vary from author to author. Traditionally, it is considered inorganic by a significant number of authors. Contrary to this view, it is considered organic by other authors, because hydrogen cyanide belongs to the class of organic compounds known as nitriles which have the formula R−C≡N, where R is typically organyl group (e.g., alkyl or aryl) or hydrogen. In the case of hydrogen cyanide, the R group is hydrogen H, so the other names of hydrogen cyanide are methanenitrile and formonitrile. == Structure and general properties == Hydrogen cyanide is a linear molecule, with a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen. The tautomer of HCN is HNC, hydrogen isocyanide. === Smell === Much literature has historically claimed that hydrogen cyanide smells of almonds or bitter almonds. However, there has been considerable confusion and disagreement over this, because the smell of household almond essence is due to benzaldehyde, which is released along with hydrogen cyanide from the breakdown of amygdalin present in some plant seeds, and thus is often mistaken for it. About half of people are unable to detect the smell of hydrogen cyanide owing to a recessive genetic trait. The volatile compound has been used as inhalation rodenticide and human poison, as well as for killing whales. Cyanide ions interfere with iron-containing respiratory enzymes. == Chemical properties == Hydrogen cyanide is weakly acidic with a pKa of 9.2. It partially ionizes in water to give the cyanide anion, CN−. HCN forms hydrogen bonds with its conjugate base, species such as (CN−)(HCN)n. Hydrogen cyanide reacts with alkenes to give nitriles. The conversion, which is called hydrocyanation, employs nickel complexes as catalysts. RCH=CH2 + HCN → RCH2−CH2CN Four molecules of HCN will tetramerize into diaminomaleonitrile. Metal cyanides are typically prepared by salt metathesis from alkali metal cyanide salts, but mercuric cyanide is formed from aqueous hydrogen cyanide: HgO + 2 HCN → Hg(CN)2 + H2O == History of discovery and naming == Hydrogen cyanide was first isolated in 1752 by French chemist Pierre Macquer who converted Prussian blue to an iron oxide plus a volatile component and found that these could be used to reconstitute it. The new component was what is now known as hydrogen cyanide. It was subsequently prepared from Prussian blue by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1782, and was eventually given the German name Blausäure (lit. ""Blue acid"") because of its acidic nature in water and its derivation from Prussian blue. In English, it became known popularly as prussic acid. In 1787, the French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet showed that prussic acid did not contain oxygen, an important contribution to acid theory, which had hitherto postulated that acids must contain oxygen (hence the name of oxygen itself, which is derived from Greek elements that mean ""acid-former"" and are likewise calqued into German as Sauerstoff). In 1811, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac prepared pure, liquified hydrogen cyanide, and in 1815 he deduced Prussic acid's chemical formula. === Etymology === The word cyanide for the radical in hydrogen cyanide was derived from its French equivalent, cyanure, which Gay-Lussac constructed from the Ancient Greek word κύανος for dark blue enamel or lapis lazuli, again owing to the chemical’s derivation from Prussian blue. Incidentally, the Greek word is also the root of the English color name cyan. == Production and synthesis == The most important process is the Andrussow oxidation invented by Leonid Andrussow at IG Farben in which methane and ammonia react in the presence of oxygen at about 1,200 °C (2,190 °F) over a platinum catalyst: 2 CH4 + 2 NH3 + 3 O2 → 2 HCN + 6 H2O In 2006, between 500 million and 1 billion pounds (between 230,000 and 450,000 t) were produced in the US. Hydrogen cyanide is produced in large quantities by several processes and is a recovered waste product from the manufacture of acrylonitrile. Of lesser importance is the Degussa process (BMA process) in which no oxygen is added and the energy must be transferred indirectly through the reactor wall: CH4 + NH3 → HCN + 3H2 This reaction is akin to steam reforming, the reaction of methane and water to give carbon monoxide and hydrogen. In the Shawinigan Process, hydrocarbons, e.g. propane, are reacted with ammonia. In the laboratory, small amounts of HCN are produced by the addition of acids to cyanide salts of alkali metals: H+ + CN− → HCN This reaction is sometimes the basis of accidental poisonings because the acid converts a nonvolatile cyanide salt into the gaseous HCN. Hydrogen cyanide could be obtained from potassium ferricyanide and acid: 6 H+ + [Fe(CN)6]−3 → 6 HCN + Fe+3 === Historical methods of production === The large demand for cyanides for mining operations in the 1890s was met by George Thomas Beilby, who patented a method to produce hydrogen cyanide by passing ammonia over glowing coal in 1892. This method was used until Hamilton Castner in 1894 developed a synthesis starting from coal, ammonia, and sodium yielding sodium cyanide, which reacts with acid to form gaseous HCN. == Applications == HCN is the precursor to sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide, which are used mainly in gold and silver mining and for the electroplating of those metals. Via the intermediacy of cyanohydrins, a variety of useful organic compounds are prepared from HCN including the monomer methyl methacrylate, from acetone, the amino acid methionine, via the Strecker synthesis, and the chelating agents EDTA and NTA. Via the hydrocyanation process, HCN is added to butadiene to give adiponitrile, a precursor to Nylon-6,6. HCN is used globally as a fumigant against many species of pest insects that infest food production facilities. Both its efficacy and method of application lead to very small amounts of the fumigant being used compared to other toxic substances used for the same purpose. Using HCN as a fumigant also has less environmental impact, compared to some other fumigants such as sulfuryl fluoride, and methyl bromide. == Occurrence == HCN is obtainable from fruits that have a pit, such as cherries, apricots, apples, and nuts such as bitter almonds, from which almond oil and extract is made. Many of these pits contain small amounts of cyanohydrins such as mandelonitrile and amygdalin, which slowly release hydrogen cyanide. One hundred grams of crushed apple seeds can yield about 70 mg of HCN. The roots of cassava plants contain cyanogenic glycosides such as linamarin, which decompose into HCN in yields of up to 370 mg per kilogram of fresh root. Some millipedes, such as Harpaphe haydeniana, Desmoxytes purpurosea, and Apheloria release hydrogen cyanide as a defense mechanism, as do certain insects, such as burnet moths and the larvae of Paropsisterna eucalyptus. Hydrogen cyanide is contained in the exhaust of vehicles, and in smoke from burning nitrogen-containing plastics. === On Titan === HCN has been measured in Titan's atmosphere by four instruments on the Cassini space probe, one instrument on Voyager, and one instrument on Earth. One of these measurements was in situ, where the Cassini spacecraft dipped between 1,000 and 1,100 km (620 and 680 mi) above Titan's surface to collect atmospheric gas for mass spectrometry analysis. HCN initially forms in Titan's atmosphere through the reaction of photochemically produced methane and nitrogen radicals which proceed through the H2CN intermediate, e.g., (CH3 + N → H2CN + H → HCN + H2). Ultraviolet radiation breaks HCN up into CN + H; however, CN is efficiently recycled back into HCN via the reaction CN + CH4 → HCN + CH3. === On the young Earth === It has been postulated that carbon from a cascade of asteroids (known as the Late Heavy Bombardment), resulting from interaction of Jupiter and Saturn, blasted the surface of young Earth and reacted with nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere to form HCN. === In mammals === Some authors have shown that neurons can produce hydrogen cyanide upon activation of their opioid receptors by endogenous or exogenous opioids. They have also shown that neuronal production of HCN activates NMDA receptors and plays a role in signal transduction between neuronal cells (neurotransmission). Moreover, increased endogenous neuronal HCN production under opioids was seemingly needed for adequate opioid analgesia, as analgesic action of opioids was attenuated by HCN scavengers. They considered endogenous HCN to be a neuromodulator. It has also been shown that, while stimulating muscarinic cholinergic receptors in cultured pheochromocytoma cells increases HCN production, in a living organism (in vivo) muscarinic cholinergic stimulation actually decreases HCN production. Leukocytes generate HCN during phagocytosis, and can kill bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens by generating several different toxic chemicals, one of which is hydrogen cyanide. The vasodilatation caused by sodium nitroprusside has been shown to be mediated not only by NO generation, but also by endogenous cyanide generation, which adds not only toxicity, but also some additional antihypertensive efficacy compared to nitroglycerine and other non-cyanogenic nitrates which do not cause blood cyanide levels to rise. HCN is a constituent of tobacco smoke. === HCN and the origin of life === Hydrogen cyanide has been discussed as a precursor to amino acids and nucleic acids, and is proposed to have played a part in the origin of life. Although the relationship of these chemical reactions to the origin of life theory remains speculative, studies in this area have led to discoveries of new pathways to organic compounds derived from the condensation of HCN (e.g. Adenine). Because amino acids are critical for life as we know it, and that hydrogen cyanide is a precursor for these molecules, astronomers who search for life on planets beyond Earth use spectroscopy to detect molecules like hydrogen cyanide after confirming suitable temperatures and the presence of water. === In space === HCN has been detected in the interstellar medium and in the atmospheres of carbon stars. Since then, extensive studies have probed formation and destruction pathways of HCN in various environments and examined its use as a tracer for a variety of astronomical species and processes. HCN can be observed from ground-based telescopes through a number of atmospheric windows. The J=1→0, J=3→2, J= 4→3, and J=10→9 pure rotational transitions have all been observed. HCN is formed in interstellar clouds through one of two major pathways: via a neutral-neutral reaction (CH2 + N → HCN + H) and via dissociative recombination (HCNH+ + e− → HCN + H). The dissociative recombination pathway is dominant by 30%; however, the HCNH+ must be in its linear form. Dissociative recombination with its structural isomer, H2NC+, exclusively produces hydrogen isocyanide (HNC). HCN is destroyed in interstellar clouds through a number of mechanisms depending on the location in the cloud. In photon-dominated regions (PDRs), photodissociation dominates, producing CN (HCN + ν → CN + H). At further depths, photodissociation by cosmic rays dominate, producing CN (HCN + cr → CN + H). In the dark core, two competing mechanisms destroy it, forming HCN+ and HCNH+ (HCN + H+ → HCN+ + H; HCN + HCO+ → HCNH+ + CO). The reaction with HCO+ dominates by a factor of ~3.5. HCN has been used to analyze a variety of species and processes in the interstellar medium. It has been suggested as a tracer for dense molecular gas and as a tracer of stellar inflow in high-mass star-forming regions. Further, the HNC/HCN ratio has been shown to be an excellent method for distinguishing between PDRs and X-ray-dominated regions (XDRs). On 11 August 2014, astronomers released studies, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) for the first time, that detailed the distribution of HCN, HNC, H2CO, and dust inside the comae of comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON). In February 2016, it was announced that traces of hydrogen cyanide were found in the atmosphere of the hot Super-Earth 55 Cancri e with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. On 14 December 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in the plumes of Enceladus, moon of the planet Saturn, of hydrogen cyanide, a possible chemical essential for life as we know it, as well as other organic molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, ""these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extant microbial communities or drive complex organic synthesis leading to the origin of life."" == As a poison and chemical weapon == In World War I, hydrogen cyanide was used by the French from 1916 as a chemical weapon against the Central Powers, and by the United States and Italy in 1918. It was not found to be effective enough due to weather conditions. The gas is lighter than air and rapidly disperses up into the atmosphere. Rapid dilution made its use in the field impractical. In contrast, denser agents such as phosgene or chlorine tended to remain at ground level and sank into the trenches of the Western Front's battlefields. Compared to such agents, hydrogen cyanide had to be present in higher concentrations in order to be fatal. A hydrogen cyanide concentration of 100–200 ppm in breathing air will kill a human within 10 to 60 minutes. A hydrogen cyanide concentration of 2000 ppm (about 2380 mg/m3) will kill a human in about one minute. The toxic effect is caused by the action of the cyanide ion, which halts cellular respiration. It acts as a non-competitive inhibitor for an enzyme in mitochondria called cytochrome c oxidase. As such, hydrogen cyanide is commonly listed among chemical weapons as a blood agent. The Chemical Weapons Convention lists it under Schedule 3 as a potential weapon which has large-scale industrial uses. Signatory countries must declare manufacturing plants that produce more than 30 metric tons per year, and allow inspection by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Perhaps its most infamous use is Zyklon B (German: Cyclone B, with the B standing for Blausäure – prussic acid; also, to distinguish it from an earlier product later known as Zyklon A), used in the Nazi German extermination camps of Majdanek and Auschwitz-Birkenau during World War II to kill Jews and other persecuted minorities en masse as part of their Final Solution genocide program. Hydrogen cyanide was also used in the camps for delousing clothing in attempts to eradicate diseases carried by lice and other parasites. One of the original Czech producers continued making Zyklon B under the trademark ""Uragan D2"" until around 2015. During World War II, the US considered using it, along with cyanogen chloride, as part of Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan, but President Harry Truman decided against it, instead using the atomic bombs developed by the secret Manhattan Project. Hydrogen cyanide was also the agent employed in judicial execution in some U.S. states, where it was produced during the execution by the action of sulfuric acid on sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide. Under the name prussic acid, HCN has been used as a killing agent in whaling harpoons, although it proved quite dangerous to the crew deploying it, and it was quickly abandoned. From the middle of the 18th century it was used in a number of poisoning murders and suicides. Hydrogen cyanide gas in air is explosive at concentrations above 5.6%. == References == == External links == Institut national de recherche et de sécurité (1997).

2245,"('Thiocolchicoside', 'Coltramyl', 'Thiocolchicine 2-glucoside analog', 'Musco-ril', 'Colchicoside, 10-thio-')",Medical,"Thiocolchicoside (Muscoril, Myoril, Neoflax) is a muscle relaxant with anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Its mechanism of action is unknown, but it is believed to act via antagonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs). However, it also appears to be a competitive antagonist of GABAA and glycine receptors. As such, it has powerful convulsant activity and should not be used in seizure-prone individuals. == Medical uses == === Low back pain === In low back pain, thiocolchicoside is efficacious in reducing pain intensity, improving physical flexibility as seen in decreasing the distance from the hands to the floor when leaning forward without bending the knees (finger-floor distance), and reducing the total consumption of paracetamol. Thiocolchicoside administration also leads to a reduction in muscle spasm during palpation, an improvement in the overall assessment of patients with low back pain, and an enhancement in their ability to perform daily activities. When thiocolchicoside is added to standard nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy in lower back pain, such therapy reduces pain intensity and improves functional status according to the average estimates of visual analogue scale (VAS) and life disorders questionnaires. The use of thiocolchicoside in combination with NSAIDs results in a more pronounced decrease in pain when assessed by VAS, as well as an increase in functional activity based on an estimate of the distance from the fingertips to the floor by the 7th day of therapy (but not by the 3rd) compared with the use of NSAIDs alone. Several medicines, including tolperisone, aceclofenac plus tizanidine, and pregabalin, are effective in reducing pain intensity. Another comparative study found that eperisone with diclofenac was more effective in terms of finger-floor distance and improvement in Lasegue's sign (straight leg raise angle laying on back), VAS score, and global assessment scale than thiocolchicoside with diclofenac. == Side effects == Side effects of thiocolchicoside can include nausea, allergy and vasovagal reactions. Liver injury, pancreatitis, seizures, blood cell disorders, severe cutaneous disorders, rhabdomyolysis, and reproductive disorders have all been recorded in the French and European pharmacovigilance databases and in the periodic updates that the companies concerned submit to regulatory agencies. These data do not specify the frequency of the disorders nor do they identify the most susceptible patient populations. Thiocolchicoside is teratogenic in experimental animals and also damages chromosomes. Human data are limited to a follow-up of about 30 pregnant women (no major malformations) and reports of altered spermatogenesis, including cases of azoospermia. In practice, there is no justification for exposing patients to the adverse effects of thiocolchicoside. It is better to use an effective, well-known analgesic for patients complaining of muscle pain, starting with paracetamol. Although muscle relaxants may have the major side effect of sedation, thiocolchicoside is free from sedation effects, likely due to its lack of potentiation of GABAA receptors. == Pharmacokinetics == Thiocolchicoside is broken down in the body to a metabolite called 3-demethylthiocolchicine (also known as SL59.0955 or M2) that could damage dividing cells therefore inducing toxicity in the embryo, neoplastic changes and fertility reduction in males. Therefore, recommended oral dose should not exceed 7 days and intramuscular dose duration should not exceed 5 days. Local skin preparations are less toxic. == References ==",Thiocolchicoside,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.194758028257638e-05), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005641775787808001)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiocolchicoside,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/european-medicines-agency-recommends-restricting-use-thiocolchicoside-mouth-or-injection,https://www.1mg.com/generics/thiocolchicoside-210810 ', [])"
2246,"('Tiotropium (bromide)', 'Tiotropium', 'Spiriva', 'Ba 679 br', '[3h]tiotropium')",Medical,"Tiotropium bromide, sold under the brand name Spiriva among others, is a long-acting bronchodilator (LAMA: long acting muscarinic antagonist) used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Specifically it is used during periods of breathing difficulty to prevent them from getting worse, rather than to prevent them from happening. It is used by inhalation through the mouth. Onset typically begins within half an hour and lasts for 24 hours. Common side effects include a dry mouth, runny nose, upper respiratory tract infection, shortness of breath and headache. Severe side effects may include angioedema, worsening bronchospasm, and QT prolongation. Tentative evidence has not found harm during pregnancy, however, such use has not been well studied. It is an anticholinergic medication and works by blocking acetylcholine action on smooth muscle. Tiotropium was patented in 1989, and approved for medical use in 2002. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 154th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Tiotropium is used as maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It may also be used as an add-on therapy in people with moderate-to-severe asthma on medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). It is not however approved for acute exacerbations of COPD or acute worsening of asthma. Tiotropium is also used in a combination inhaler with olodaterol, a long-acting beta-agonist, for the treatment of COPD, under the brand names Stiolto and Spiolto among others. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are mainly related to its antimuscarinic effects. Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of people) include: dry mouth and/or throat irritation. Rarely (<0.1% of patients) treatment is associated with: urinary retention, constipation, acute angle closure glaucoma, palpitations (notably supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) and allergy (rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis). A 2006 review found the increase in bronchospasm was small and did not reach statistical significance. Data regarding some serious side effects is mixed as of 2020. In September 2008 a review found that tiotropium and another member of its class ipratropium may be linked to increased risk of heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular death. The US FDA reviewed the concern and concluded in 2010 that this association was not supported. A 2011 review of the tiotropium mist inhaler (Respimat), however, still found it associated with an increase in all cause mortality in people with COPD. == Mechanism of action == Tiotropium is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, often referred to as an antimuscarinic or anticholinergic agent. Although it does not display selectivity for specific muscarinic receptors, when topically applied it acts mainly on M3 muscarinic receptors located on smooth muscle cells and submucosal glands. This leads to a reduction in smooth muscle contraction and mucus secretion and thus produces a bronchodilatory effect. == Society and culture == Tiotroprium is available in two inhaler formats: a soft mist inhaler (Respimat) and a dry powder inhaler (HandiHaler). The safety and efficacy profiles of both devices are comparable and people's preference should play a role in determining inhaler choice. There is no significant difference in all-cause mortality between tiotropium soft mist inhalers compared to dry powder inhalers, however caution needs to be taken in people with severe heart or kidney problems. == References ==",Spiriva,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.537788011773955e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005619138828478754)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/spiriva?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Spiriva: Dosage, Side Effects, How to Use, and More', type='url_citation', url='https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/spiriva?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a white solid that is poorly soluble in water. As a residue in proteins, cystine serves two functions: a site of redox reactions and a mechanical linkage that allows proteins to retain their three-dimensional structure. == Formation and reactions == === Structure === Cystine is the disulfide derived from the amino acid cysteine. The conversion can be viewed as an oxidation: 2 HO2CCH(NH2)CH2SH + 0.5 O2 → (HO2CCH(NH2)CH2S)2 + H2O Cystine contains a disulfide bond, two amine groups, and two carboxylic acid groups. As for other amino acids, the amine and carboxylic acid groups exist in rapid equilibrium with the ammonium-carboxylate tautomer. The great majority of the literature concerns the l,l-cystine, derived from l-cysteine. Other isomers include d,d-cystine and the meso isomer d,l-cystine, neither of which is biologically significant. === Occurrence === Cystine is common in many foods such as eggs, meat, dairy products, and whole grains as well as skin, horns and hair. It was not recognized as being derived of proteins until it was isolated from the horn of a cow in 1899. Human hair and skin contain approximately 10–14% cystine by mass. === History === Cystine was discovered in 1810 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston, who called it ""cystic oxide"". In 1833, the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius named the amino acid ""cystine"". The Norwegian chemist Christian J. Thaulow determined, in 1838, the empirical formula of cystine. In 1884, the German chemist Eugen Baumann found that when cystine was treated with a reducing agent, cystine revealed itself to be a dimer of a monomer which he named ""cysteïne"". In 1899, cystine was first isolated from protein (horn tissue) by the Swedish chemist Karl A. H. Mörner (1855-1917). The chemical structure of cystine was determined by synthesis in 1903 by the German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer. The history of cystine and cysteine is complicated by the dimer-monomer relationship of the two. The cysteine monomer was proposed as the actual unit by Embden in 1901. The sulfur within the structure of cysteine and cystine has been subject of historical interest. In 1902, Osborne partially succeeded in analysing cystine content via lead compounds. An improved colorimetric method was developed in 1922 by Folin and Looney. An iodometric analysis method was developed by Okuda in 1925. === Redox === It is formed from the oxidation of two cysteine molecules, which results in the formation of a disulfide bond. In cell biology, cystine residues (found in proteins) only exist in non-reductive (oxidative) organelles, such as the secretory pathway (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vesicles) and extracellular spaces (e.g., extracellular matrix). Under reductive conditions (in the cytoplasm, nucleus, etc.) cysteine is predominant. The disulfide link is readily reduced to give the corresponding thiol cysteine. Typical thiols for this reaction are mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol: (SCH2CH(NH2)CO2H)2 + 2 RSH → 2 HSCH2CH(NH2)CO2H + RSSR Because of the facility of the thiol-disulfide exchange, the nutritional benefits and sources of cystine are identical to those for the more-common cysteine. Disulfide bonds cleave more rapidly at higher temperatures. === Cystine-based disorders === The presence of cystine in urine is often indicative of amino acid reabsorption defects. Cystinuria has been reported to occur in dogs. In humans the excretion of high levels of cystine crystals can be indicative of cystinosis, a rare genetic disease. Cystine stones account for about 1-2% of kidney stone disease in adults. == Biological transport == Cystine serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter. This transport system, which is highly specific for cystine and glutamate, increases the concentration of cystine inside the cell. In this system, the anionic form of cystine is transported in exchange for glutamate. Cystine is quickly reduced to cysteine. Cysteine prodrugs, e.g. acetylcysteine, induce release of glutamate into the extracellular space. == Nutritional supplements == Cysteine supplements are sometimes marketed as anti-aging products with claims of improved skin elasticity. Cysteine is more easily absorbed by the body than cystine, so most supplements contain cysteine rather than cystine. N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) is better absorbed than other cysteine or cystine supplements. == See also == Lanthionine, similar with mono-sulfide link Protein tertiary structure Sullivan reaction Cystinosis == References == == External links == Media related to Cystine at Wikimedia Commons",Cystine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.005468420684337616), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -0.00023071514442563057), ('US', 0.0), (',', -3.547789674485102e-05), (' FOOD', -3.650518920039758e-06)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.30755457282066345), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0009152276325039566), ('ĠEND', -0.0037817880511283875), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02976071462035179)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -2.339278580620885e-06), (' FOOD', -2.7610454708337784e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.altmeyers.org/en/cosmetology/cystine-inci-145903,https://cosmeticanalysis.com/cosmetic-ingredients/cystine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine ', [])"

Bakuchiol isolated from P. corylifolia has shown activity against numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral pathogens. It was able to inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans under a range of sucrose concentrations, pH values and in the presence of organic acids in a temperature-dependent manner and also inhibited the growth of cells adhered to a glass surface. Despite having no structural resemblance to retinol, Bakuchiol was found to have retinol functionality through retinol-like regulation of gene expression. In 2018, a randomized, double-blind, 12-week clinical study with 44 volunteers demonstrated that Bakuchiol is comparable with retinol in its ability to improve photoaging (wrinkles, hyperpigmentation) but has a better skin tolerance. Bakuchiol has been found to possess antiandrogenic activity in prostate cancer cells, which inhibited cell proliferation. == See also == Drupanol == References == == External links == bakuchiol what bacuchiol is and how effective it is",Bakuchiol,WIKIPEDIA,"('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('PERSON', -0.03951851651072502), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.25200265645980835), (' FOOD', -0.2755082845687866)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.13248008489608765), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.00021395778458099812), ('ĠPERSON', -0.1416044384241104), ('AL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('ĠCARE', -1.0609570381348021e-05), (',', -0.1002139151096344), ('ĠFOOD', -0.023260004818439484), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12695220112800598)])","('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('PERSON', -0.0001234428636962548), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.0015023599844425917), (' FOOD', -4.842555426876061e-06)])","('PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuchiol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=15, title='Bakuchiol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuchiol?utm_source=openai')])"
2249,"('Osalmid', 'Oxaphenamide', 'Osalmide', 'Oxaphenamid', 'Salmidochol')",Medical," Esophageal cancer (EC) is an aggressive malignancy and is often resistant to currently available therapies. Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase small subunit M2 (RRM2) in tumors is speculated to mediate chemosensitization. Previous studies have reported that Osalmid could act as an RRM2 inhibitor. We explored whether RRM2 was involved in radioresistance and the antitumor effects of Osalmid in EC. RRM2 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in EC tissues. The effects of Osalmid on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle were assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphhenyl tetrazolium, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays. DNA damage, cell apoptosis, and senescence induced by Osalmid or ionizing radiation (IR) alone, or both, were detected with immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, Western blot, and β-galactosidase staining. A xenograft mouse model of EC was used to investigate the potential synergistic effects of Osalmid and IR in vivo. The expression of RRM2 in treatment-resistant EC tissues is much higher than in treatment-sensitive EC, and strong staining of RRM2 was correlated with shorter overall survival. We observed direct cytotoxicity of Osalmid in EC cells. Osalmid also produced inhibition of the ERK1/2 signal transduction pathway and substantially enhanced IR-induced DNA damage, apoptosis, and senescence. Furthermore, treatment with Osalmid and IR significantly suppressed tumor growth in xenograft EC models without additional toxicity to the hematologic system and internal organs. Our study revealed that RRM2 played a vital role in radioresistance in EC, and Osalmid synergized with IR to exert its antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. Despite significant improvement in the prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM), the disease remains incurable; thus, more effective therapies are required. Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) is significantly associated with drug resistance, rapid relapse, and poor prognosis. Previously, we found that 4-hydroxysalicylanilide (osalmid), a specific inhibitor of RRM2, exhibits anti-MM activity in vitro, in vivo, and in human patients; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Osalmid inhibits the translocation of RRM2 to the nucleus and stimulates autophagosome synthesis but inhibits subsequent autophagosome-lysosome fusion. We confirm that RRM2 binds to receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and reduces RIPK3, inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Interestingly, the combination of osalmid and bafilomycin A1 (an autophagy inhibitor) depletes RIPK3 and aggravates p62 and autophagosome accumulation, leading to autophagic cell death. Combination therapy demonstrates synergistic cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose that combining osalmid and bafilomycin A1(BafA1) may have clinical benefits against MM. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common and lethal urinary malignancy characterized by its resistance to apoptosis. Despite the emerging treatment options available for ccRCC, only a small proportion of patients achieve long-term survival benefits. Previous studies have demonstrated that inducing tumor cell senescence, followed by treatment using senolytics, represents a potential strategy for triggering tumor cell apoptosis. However, it remains unclear whether this strategy is suitable for the treatment of ccRCC. Using the whole-genome CRISPR screening database Dependency Map portal (DepMap), we identified ribonucleotide reductase family member 2 (RRM2), which catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), as an essential targetable gene for ccRCC. Herein, we report that the combination of the choleretic drug osalmid targeting RRM2 and the senolytic compound navitoclax targeting BCL-XL represents a novel therapeutic approach for ccRCC. Furthermore, we have validated this approach across a panel of human ccRCC cells with different genetic backgrounds and multiple preclinical models, including cell line-derived xenografts (CDX), patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and patient-derived organoids (PDO). Mechanistically, osalmid-mediated inhibition of dNTPs generation induces cellular senescence in ccRCC, concomitant with STAT3 activation and upregulation of BCL-XL, thus rendering these cells vulnerable to navitoclax, which targets the BCL-2 protein family.",Osalmid,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.13388703338569e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005444223526865244), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03807136416435242)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([synapse.patsnap.com](https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/55490eba935342f689f9db11e0d322c0?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=117, start_index=9, title='Osalmid - Drug Targets, Indications, Patents - Synapse', type='url_citation', url='https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/55490eba935342f689f9db11e0d322c0?utm_source=openai')])"

2251,"('Crystal violet', 'Basic violet 3', 'Gentian violet', 'Methyl violet 10b', 'Crystal violet ion(1)')",Medical,"Crystal violet or gentian violet, also known as methyl violet 10B or hexamethyl pararosaniline chloride, is a triarylmethane dye used as a histological stain and in Gram's method of classifying bacteria. Crystal violet has antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic (vermicide) properties and was formerly important as a topical antiseptic. The medical use of the dye has been largely superseded by more modern drugs, although it is still listed by the World Health Organization. The name gentian violet was originally used for a mixture of methyl pararosaniline dyes (methyl violet), but is now often considered a synonym for crystal violet. The name refers to its colour, being like that of the petals of certain gentian flowers; it is not made from gentians or violets. == Production == A number of possible routes can be used to prepare crystal violet. The original procedure developed by the German chemists Kern and Caro involved the reaction of dimethylaniline with phosgene to give 4,4′-bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone (Michler's ketone) as an intermediate. This was then reacted with additional dimethylaniline in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride and hydrochloric acid. The dye can also be prepared by the condensation of formaldehyde and dimethylaniline to give a leuco dye: CH2O + 3 C6H5N(CH3)2 → CH(C6H4N(CH3)2)3 + H2O Second, this colourless compound is oxidized to the coloured cationic form (hereafter with oxygen, but a typical oxidizing agent is manganese dioxide, MnO2): CH(C6H4N(CH3)2)3 + HCl + 1⁄2 O2 → [C(C6H4N(CH3)2)3]Cl + H2O == Dye colour == When dissolved in water, the dye has a blue-violet colour with an absorbance maximum at 590 nm and an extinction coefficient of 87,000 M−1 cm−1. The colour of the dye depends on the acidity of the solution. At a pH of +1.0, the dye is green with absorption maxima at 420 nm and 620 nm, while in a strongly acidic solution (pH −1.0), the dye is yellow with an absorption maximum at 420 nm. The different colours are a result of the different charged states of the dye molecule. In the yellow form, all three nitrogen atoms carry a positive charge, of which two are protonated, while the green colour corresponds to a form of the dye with two of the nitrogen atoms positively charged. At neutral pH, both extra protons are lost to the solution, leaving only one of the nitrogen atoms positive charged. The pKa for the loss of the two protons are approximately 1.15 and 1.8. In alkaline solutions, nucleophilic hydroxyl ions attack the electrophilic central carbon to produce the colourless triphenylmethanol or carbinol form of the dye. Some triphenylmethanol is also formed under very acidic conditions when the positive charges on the nitrogen atoms lead to an enhancement of the electrophilic character of the central carbon, which allows the nucleophilic attack by water molecules. This effect produces a slight fading of the yellow colour. == Applications == === Industry === Crystal violet is used as a textile and paper dye, and is a component of navy blue and black inks for printing, ball-point pens, and inkjet printers. Historically, it was the most common dye used in early duplication machines, such as the mimeograph and the ditto machine. It is sometimes used to colourize diverse products such as fertilizer, antifreeze, detergent, and leather. Marking blue, used to mark out pieces in metalworking, is composed of methylated spirits, shellac, and gentian violet. === Science === When conducting DNA gel electrophoresis, crystal violet can be used as a nontoxic DNA stain as an alternative to fluorescent, intercalating dyes such as ethidium bromide. Used in this manner, it may be either incorporated into the agarose gel or applied after the electrophoresis process is finished. Used at a 10 ppm concentration and allowed to stain a gel after electrophoresis for 30 minutes, it can detect as little as 16 ng of DNA. Through use of a methyl orange counterstain and a more complex staining method, sensitivity can be improved further to 8 ng of DNA. When crystal violet is used as an alternative to fluorescent stains, it is not necessary to use ultraviolet illumination; this has made crystal violet popular as a means of avoiding UV-induced DNA destruction when performing DNA cloning in vitro. Crystal violet can be used as an alternative to Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) in staining of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, reportedly showing a 5x improved sensitivity vs CBB. The dye is used as a histological stain, particularly in Gram staining for classifying bacteria. In biomedical research, crystal violet can be used to stain the nuclei of adherent cells. In this application, crystal violet works as an intercalating dye and allows the quantification of DNA which is proportional to the number of cells. Crystal violet is also used as a tissue stain in the preparation of light microscopy sections. In laboratory, solutions containing crystal violet and formalin are often used to simultaneously fix and stain cells grown in tissue culture to preserve them and make them easily visible, since most cells are colourless. It is also sometimes used as a cheap way to put identification markings on laboratory mice; since many strains of lab mice are albino, the purple colour stays on their fur for several weeks. In forensics, crystal violet was used to develop fingerprints. It is able to develop fingerprint marks from live human skin. === Medical === Gentian violet has antibacterial, antifungal, antihelminthic, antitrypanosomal, antiangiogenic, and antitumor properties. It is used medically for these properties, in particular for dentistry, and is also known as ""pyoctanin"" (or ""pyoctanine""). It is commonly used for: Marking the skin for surgery preparation and allergy testing; Treating Candida albicans and related fungal infections, such as thrush, yeast infections, various types of tinea (ringworm, athlete's foot, jock itch); Treating impetigo; it was used primarily before the advent of antibiotics, but still useful to persons who may be allergic to penicillin. In resource-limited settings, gentian violet is used to manage burn wounds, inflammation of the umbilical cord stump (omphalitis) in the neonatal period, oral candidiasis in HIV-infected patients and mouth ulcers in children with measles. In body piercing, gentian violet is commonly used to mark the location for placing piercings, including surface piercings. === Veterinary === Because of its antimicrobial activity, it is used to treat ich in fish. However, it usually is illegal to use in fish intended for human consumption. == History == === Synthesis === Crystal violet is one of the components of methyl violet, a dye first synthesized by Charles Lauth in 1861. From 1866, methyl violet was manufactured by the Saint-Denis-based firm of Poirrier et Chappat and marketed under the name ""Violet de Paris"". It was a mixture of the tetra-, penta- and hexamethylated pararosanilines. Crystal violet itself was first synthesized in 1883 by Alfred Kern (1850–1893) working in Basel at the firm of Bindschedler & Busch. To optimize the difficult synthesis which used the highly toxic phosgene, Kern entered into a collaboration with the German chemist Heinrich Caro at BASF. Kern also found that by starting with diethylaniline rather than dimethylaniline, he could synthesize the closely related violet dye now known as C.I. 42600 or C.I. Basic violet 4. === Gentian violet === The name ""gentian violet"" (or Gentianaviolett in German) is thought to have been introduced by the German pharmacist Georg Grübler, who in 1880 started a company in Leipzig that specialized in the sale of staining reagents for histology. The gentian violet stain marketed by Grübler probably contained a mixture of methylated pararosaniline dyes. The stain proved popular and in 1884 was used by Hans Christian Gram to stain bacteria. He credited Paul Ehrlich for the aniline-gentian violet mixture. Grübler's gentian violet was probably very similar, if not identical, to Lauth's methyl violet, which had been used as a stain by Victor André Cornil in 1875. Although the name gentian violet continued to be used for the histological stain, the name was not used in the dye and textile industries. The composition of the stain was not defined and different suppliers used different mixtures. In 1922, the Biological Stain Commission appointed a committee chaired by Harold Conn to look into the suitability of the different commercial products. In his book Biological Stains, Conn describes gentian violet as a ""poorly defined mixture of violet rosanilins"". The German ophthalmologist Jakob Stilling is credited with discovering the antiseptic properties of gentian violet. He published a monograph in 1890 on the bactericidal effects of a solution that he christened ""pyoctanin"", which was probably a mixture of aniline dyes similar to gentian violet. He set up a collaboration with E. Merck & Co. to market ""Pyoktanin caeruleum"" as an antiseptic. In 1902, Drigalski and Conradi found that although crystal violet inhibited the growth of many bacteria, it has little effect on Bacillus coli (Escherichia coli) and Bacillus typhi (Salmonella typhi), which are both gram-negative bacteria. A much more detailed study of the effects of Grübler's gentian violet on different strains of bacteria was published by John Churchman in 1912. He found that most gram-positive bacteria (tainted) were sensitive to the dye, while most gram-negative bacteria (not tainted) were not, and observed that the dye tended to act as a bacteriostatic agent rather than a bactericide. ==== Precautions ==== One study in mice demonstrated dose-related carcinogenic potential at several different organ sites. The Food and Drug Administration in the US (FDA) has determined that gentian violet has not been shown by adequate scientific data to be safe for use in animal feed. Use of gentian violet in animal feed causes the feed to be adulterated and is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the US. On June 28, 2007, the FDA issued an ""import alert"" on farm-raised seafood from China because unapproved antimicrobials, including gentian violet, had been consistently found in the products. The FDA report states: Like MG (malachite green), CV (crystal violet) is readily absorbed into fish tissue from water exposure and is reduced metabolically by fish to the leuco moiety, leucocrystal violet (LCV). Several studies by the National Toxicology Program reported the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of crystal violet in rodents. The leuco form induces renal, hepatic and lung tumor in mice."" In 2019, Health Canada (HC) completed safety reviews on gentian violet and found it to be carcinogenic when in direct contact with the body. As a result, HC has worked with human and animal drug makers to discontinue and recall all drugs containing gentian violet, and recommended customers stop using and safely discard any remaining drug products that contain gentian violet. HC found the all medical devices containing gentian violet on the Canadian market to be safe over the short term, as these polyurethane foam dressings are very unlikely to cause contact with skin. HC recommends most people to limit the use of these dressings to 6 months, and pregnant and nursing people to avoid using it altogether, as there's not enough evidence to prove that prolonged use or use by pregnant/nursing people is safe. This caused Canadian engineering schools to revisit the usage of this dye during orientation, in which students ""purple"" themselves by dunking into a tub containing a dilute solution of the dye. == See also == == References == == Further reading == ""Methylrosanilinium chloride (gentian violet)"", WHO model prescribing information: drugs used in skin diseases, Geneva: World Health Organization, 1997, p. 70, ISBN 92-4-140106-0. == External links ==",Gentian violet,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.06256571412086487), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -5.512236498361744e-07), (' INDUSTR', -0.09075825661420822), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.6933054327964783), (' PERSONAL', -0.0021936828270554543), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.20494934916496277), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -7.73638384998776e-05), ('ĠINDU', -0.0004990047891624272), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -1.1324817933200393e-05), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2520686686038971)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0005530327325686812), (' INDUSTR', -0.0002767094410955906), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_violet,https://dermnetnz.org/topics/gentian-violet,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gentian-violet-topical-route/description/drg-20064064 ', [])"
2252,"('Guaiacol', 'O-methoxyphenol', 'Phenol, 2-methoxy-', 'Guaiastil', 'Pyroguaiac acid')","Food, Medical","Guaiacol () is an organic compound with the formula C6H4(OH)(OCH3). It is a phenolic compound containing a methoxy functional group. Guaiacol appears as a viscous colorless oil, although aged or impure samples are often yellowish. It occurs widely in nature and is a common product of the pyrolysis of wood. == Occurrence == Guaiacol is usually derived from guaiacum or wood creosote. It is produced by a variety of plants. It is also found in essential oils from celery seeds, tobacco leaves, orange leaves, and lemon peels. The pure substance is colorless, but samples become yellow upon exposure to air and light. The compound is present in wood smoke, resulting from the pyrolysis of lignin. The compound contributes to the flavor of many substances such as whiskey and roasted coffee. == Preparation == The compound was first isolated by Otto Unverdorben in 1826. Guaiacol is produced by methylation of o-catechol, for example using potash and dimethyl sulfate: C6H4(OH)2 + (CH3O)2SO2 → C6H4(OH)(OCH3) + HO(CH3O)SO2 === Laboratory methods === Guaiacol can be prepared by diverse routes in the laboratory. o-Anisidine, derived in two steps from anisole, can be hydrolyzed via its diazonium derivative. Guaiacol can be synthesized by the dimethylation of catechol followed by selective mono-demethylation. C6H4(OCH3)2 + C2H5SNa → C6H4(OCH3)(ONa) + C2H5SCH3 == Uses and chemical reactions == === Syringyl/guaiacyl ratio === Lignin, comprising a major fraction of biomass, is sometimes classified according to the guaiacyl component. Pyrolysis of lignin from gymnosperms gives more guaiacol, resulting from removal of the propenyl group of coniferyl alcohol. These lignins are said to have a high guaiacyl (or G) content. In contrast, lignins derived from sinapyl alcohol affords syringol. A high syringyl (or S) content is indicative of lignin from angiosperms. Sugarcane bagasse is one useful source of guaiacol; pyrolysis of the bagasse lignins yields compounds including guaiacol, 4-methylguaiacol and 4-vinylguaiacol. === Chemical intermediate === Guaiacol is a useful precursor for the synthesis of other compounds. Being derived from biomass, it is a potential component or precursor to ""green fuels"". Guaiacol is also a useful reagent for the quantification of peroxidases, as in the presence of hydrogen peroxide these enzymes will catalyse with it the formation of tetraguaiacol, a coloured compound that can be quantified by its absorbance at 420–470 nm, following the equation: 4 guaiacol (colorless) + 2 H2O2 → tetraguaiacol (colored) + 8 H2O. === Medicinal and food === Guaiacol is a precursor to various flavorants, such as eugenol. An estimated 85% of the world's supply of vanillin comes from guaiacol. Because consumers tend to prefer natural vanillin to synthetic vanillin, methods such as microbial fermentation have been adopted. The route entails the condensation reaction of glyoxylic acid with guaiacol to give mandelic acid, which is oxidized to produce phenylglyoxylic acid. This acid undergoes a decarboxylation to afford vanillin. The crude vanillin product can then be purified with vacuum distillation and recrystallization. Guaiacol is also used medicinally as an expectorant, antiseptic, and local anesthetic. Guaiacol is produced in the gut of desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, by the breakdown of plant material. This process is undertaken by the gut bacterium Pantoea agglomerans (Enterobacter). It is one of the main components of the pheromones that cause locust swarming. == Safety == Methoxyphenols are potential biomarkers of biomass smoke exposure, such as from inhalation of woodsmoke. Dietary sources of methoxyphenols overwhelm the contribution from inhalational exposures to woodsmoke. == See also == Creosote Guaifenesin == References ==",Guaiacol,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.10655643790960312), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -0.009552428498864174), ('ICAL', -1.6240566083070007e-06), (',', -0.20195810496807098), (' INDUSTR', -0.05642309784889221), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.11843280494213104), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00040165462996810675), ('ĠMED', -0.7009806632995605), ('ICAL', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5760267972946167)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0002615742268972099), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -5.512236498361744e-07), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/g/guaiacol.html,https://www.chemicalbook.com/Article/The-uses-of-Guaiacol.htm,https://www.syensqo.com/en/product/guaiacol ', [])"

Targeted cancer therapy has also become one of the remarkable treatment modalities. Therefore, the aim of the study to investigate its cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on liver cancer cell lines by combining the classical chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) and a targeted agent, the new generation HSP90 inhibitor XL-888. The molecular docking method was used to predict the binding conformation of XL-888 on the human Hsp90. The single and combined cytotoxic effects of DOX and XL-888 on liver cancer cell lines HepG2 and HUH-7 were determined by MTT assay. The effect of the combined use of two drugs was evaluated using Chou and Talalay method. The levels of apoptotic genes and heat shock proteins gene and protein expression levels were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. Molecular docking results showed that XL-888 selectively binds to the ATP binding pocket of HSP90 with an estimated free binding energy of - 7.8 kcal/mol. DOX and XL-888 and their combination showed dose-dependent cytotoxic effect. The combination of drugs showed a synergistic effect on both cell lines. The results revealed that the combination of DOX and XL-888 potently induced apoptosis in liver cancer cell lines rather than using drugs alone. The combined treatment of DOX and XL-888 demonstrated synergistic cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on liver cancer cell lines, presenting a promising approach for combination therapy in liver cancer. Neuroblastoma is a common nervous system tumor in childhood, and current treatments are not adequate. HSP90 is a molecular chaperone protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of cancer-related proteins. HSP90 inhibition may exert anticancer effects by targeting cancer-related processes such as tumor growth, cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis. Therefore, HSP90 inhibition is a promising strategy in the treatment of various types of cancer, and the development of next-generation inhibitors could potentially lead to more effective and safer treatments. XL-888 and Debio0932 is a next-generation HSP90 inhibitor and can inhibit the correct folding and stabilization of client proteins that cancer-associated HSP90 helps to fold correctly. In this study, we aimed to investigate the comprehensive molecular pathways of the anticancer activity of XL-888 and Debio0932 in human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y. The cytotoxic effects of XL-888 and Debio0932 on the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y cells were evaluated by MTT assay. Then, the effect of these HSP90 inhibitors on the expression of important genes in cancer was revealed by Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) method. The qRT-PCR data were evaluated using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) biological process tools. Finally, the effect of HSP90 inhibitors on HSP27, HSP70 and HSP90 protein expression was investigated by Western blotting analysis. The results revealed that XL-888 and Debio0932 had a role in regulating many cancer-related pathways such as migration, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, it shows that HSP90 inhibitors can be considered as a promising candidate in the treatment of neuroblastoma and resistance to chemotherapy.",Xl-888,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019286326132714748), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02996666543185711), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018171852454543114)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0040785204619169235)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22877636/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='Discovery of XL888: a novel tropane-derived small molecule inhibitor of HSP90', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22877636/?utm_source=openai')])"

It binds to the HCV nonstructural protein 3 active site. It was initially developed by Schering-Plough, then by Merck after it acquired Schering in 2009. It was approved by the FDA in May 2011. In January 2015, Merck announced that they would be voluntarily withdrawing Victrelis from the market due to the overwhelming superiority of newer direct-acting antiviral agents, such as ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. == Clinical trials == === SPRINT-1 trial === The SPRINT-1 trial was a phase-II trial of boceprevir in difficult-to-treat patients with HCV genotype 1. Study results were announced at the 44th annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver in Copenhagen in April, 2009. When used in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, boceprevir resulted in significantly higher sustained viral response (SVR) rates in the most difficult-to-treat patients with genotype 1. The phase-II trial compared three different regimens: four weeks of peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 micrograms/kg once weekly) plus ribavirin (800 to 1400 mg daily based on patient weight) followed by boceprevir (800 mg three times a day in addition to peginterferon and ribavirin) for 24 weeks or 44 weeks; boceprevir in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin as above for 28 or 48 weeks (triple therapy); and peginterferon alfa-2b plus low-dose ribavirin (400 to 1000 mg/day) and boceprevir for 48 weeks. The patients enrolled in the SPRINT-1 study were among the most difficult to treat, and were exclusively those with genotype 1. (The patients were all treatment naive.) Additionally, many of the patients had other difficult-to-treat indices, including cirrhosis (6–9%), high viral load (90%), and African-American ancestry (14–17%). An SVR after 24 weeks off therapy of 75% was achieved in the group treated for 48 weeks with four weeks of lead-in therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin followed by the addition of boceprevir. This represents a near doubling of the rate of SVR compared to standard therapy without boceprevir in this group. Anemia was the most common adverse event. It occurred in half of the patients who received boceprevir and by about a third of the patients taking peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin at the standard dose. The lead investigator of the study was Dr. Paul Kwo, associate professor of medicine at the School of Medicine, Indiana University, in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. === SPRINT-2 trial === The SPRINT-2 trial was a double-blind study which randomly assigned adults with untreated hepatitis C virus, genotype 1, to one of three groups. Each group received a month of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin before being randomized to one of three arms. The first arm received placebo plus peginterferon-ribavirin for 44 weeks, the second arm received boceprevir plus peginterferon-ribavirin for 24 weeks, and those with a detectable HCV RNA level between weeks 8 and 24 received placebo plus peginterferon-ribavirin for an additional 20 weeks, and the third arm received boceprevir plus peginterferon-ribavirin for 44 weeks. Black patients and nonblack patients were enrolled and analyzed separately, since black patients have been shown to respond less well to antiviral therapy with peginterferon plus ribavirin than nonblacks. In all, 938 nonblack and 159 black patients were enrolled in the study. At 44 weeks, among the nonblack cohort, a 40% sustained virologic response (125 of 311 patients) occurred in the placebo group, a 67% response (211 of 316 patients) in the response-guided boceprevir group, and a 68% response (214 of 311 patients) in the fixed-duration therapy group. Important side effects included anemia and dysgeusia (distortion of the sense of taste). === RESPOND-2 trial === The RESPOND-2 trial studied patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 who did not have a sustained response to therapy with peginterferon-ribavirin therapy. All patients received a month of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin before being randomized to one of three arms. The first arm received placebo plus peginterferon-ribavirin for 44 weeks. The second group received boceprevir plus peginterferon-ribavirin for 32 weeks, and those with a detectable HCV RNA level at week 8 received peginterferon-ribavirin and placebo for another 12 weeks. The third group received boceprevir and peginterferon-ribavirin for 44 weeks. Four hundred and three people were treated in the trial. At 44 weeks, the control group had a lower sustained virologic response rate (21%) than either of the groups treated with boceprevir—59% sustained viral response for the group with response-guided therapy and 66% response for the group with fixed-duration therapy. == See also == Paxlovid, a structurally related drug developed for the treatment of COVID-19 Telaprevir, a similar agent for the treatment of hepatitis C == References ==",Victrelis,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.65590606938349e-06), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00020930961181875318)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boceprevir,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/victrelis,https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/victrelis-boceprevir-information ', [])"
2255,"('Pictilisib', 'Pictrelisib', 'Pictilisib (gdc-0941)', 'Pictilisib [usan:inn]', 'Pictilisib (usan)')",Medical,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors (PI3K inhibitors) are a class of medical drugs that are mainly used to treat advanced cancers. They function by inhibiting one or more of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) enzymes, which are part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This signal pathway regulates cellular functions such as growth and survival. It is strictly regulated in healthy cells, but is always active in many cancer cells, allowing the cancer cells to better survive and multiply. PI3K inhibitors block the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and thus slow down cancer growth. They are examples of a targeted therapy. While PI3K inhibitors are an effective treatment, they can have very severe side effects and are therefore only used if other treatments have failed or are not suitable. After PI3K inhibitors had been under investigation as anti-cancer drugs for several years, the first one to be approved for treatment in clinical practice was idelalisib in 2014. Several others followed, and even more are still under development (see below). There are different classes and isoforms of PI3Ks. Class 1 PI3Ks have a catalytic subunit known as p110, with four types (isoforms) – p110 alpha (PIK3CA), p110 beta (PIK3CB), p110 gamma (PIK3CG) and p110 delta (PIK3CD). All PI3K inhibitors that are currently approved inhibit one or more p110 isoforms of the class I PI3Ks. Inhibiting different p110 isoforms can have different effects, e.g. PTEN-negative tumors may be more sensitive to PIK3CB inhibitors. PI3K inhibitors are also under investigation as treatments for inflammatory respiratory disease, and are used to investigate the role of the PI3K pathway in aging. == Approved for treatment == Idelalisib (trade name Zydelig; codenamed CAL-101, GS-1101; PIK3CD inhibitor): FDA-approved in July 2014 for treatment of three types of blood cancers: treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in combination with rituximab, treatment of relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma after at least two prior systemic therapies, and treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapies. Copanlisib (trade name Aliqopa; codenamed BAY 80-6946; predominantly a PIK3CA and PIK3CD inhibitor): FDA-approved in September 2017 for treatment of relapsed follicular lymphoma after at least two prior systemic therapies. Duvelisib (trade name Copiktra; codenamed INK1197, IPI-145; PIK3CD and PIK3CG inhibitor): FDA-approved on 24 September 2018 for treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) after at least two prior therapies, and treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after at least two prior systemic therapies. Alpelisib (trade names Piqray and Pivikto; codenamed BYL719; PIK3CA inhibitor): FDA-approved in May 2019 for treatment of HR-positive and HER2/neu-negative breast cancer in combination with the endocrine therapy fulvestrant. Umbralisib (trade name Ukoniq; codenamed TGR-1202, Rp-5264; PIK3CD and casein kinase CSNK1E inhibitor): FDA-approved in February 2021 for treatment of relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) after at least one prior anti-CD20-based regimen, and treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after at least three prior lines of systemic therapy. As of May 31, 2022, umbralisib was withdrawn from the US market due to the decrement in overall survival and increased serious adverse events when using umbralisib. Leniolisib (codenamed CDZ173; PIK3CD inhibitor, trade name Joenja) was tested as a potential treatment for activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS) / PASLI disease in a placebo-controlled phase II/III trial (NCT02435173). The trial was completed in August 2021 and results have become available in March 2022. Another phase II/III trial for APDS/PASLI that serves as an extension study (NCT02859727) is still ongoing and results are expected for October 2026. The FDA has approved leniolisib on March 24, 2023. == Under clinical development == === Late stage === In phase III clinical trials: Buparlisib (codenamed BKM120, NVP-BKM120; pan-class I PI3K inhibitor): The phase III trial BURAN compares buparlisib + paclitaxel to paclitaxel alone in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Results are expected for December 2022. The phase III trials BELLE-2 and BELLE-3 comparing buparlisib + fulvestrant with fulvestrant alone in patients with breast cancer both showed excessive side effects. The phase II/III trial BELLE-4 comparing buparlisib + paclitaxel with paclitaxel alone in patients with breast cancer did not improve progression-free survival and was stopped for futility at the end of phase II. These results led the sponsor, Novartis, to cancel their breast cancer study program with buparlisib. Copanlisib (codenamed BAY 80-6946; predominantly a PIK3CA and PIK3CD inhibitor) ist currently undergoing three phase III trials, all of which are testing it in patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL): The trial CHRONOS-2 was planned as a placebo-controlled randomized phase III trial with about 190 patients. However, recruitment was stopped after 25 patients were included and the trial continues as a non-randomized single-arm trial. Results are expected for November 2022. The phase III trial CHRONOS-3 compares copanlisib + rituximab with placebo + rituximab in patients with relapsed iNHL. Study completion is expected for January 2023. Preliminary results show a strong and significant improvement of progression-free survival under copanlisib treatment, but also considerably more severe and serious side effects. The phase III trial CHRONOS-4 compares copanlisib + immunochemotherapy (R-CHOP regimen) with placebo + immunochemotherapy in patients with relapsed iNHL who have received 1–3 previous lines of therapy. Results are expected for February 2023. Dactolisib (codenamed BEZ235, NVP-BEZ235; dual pan-class I PI3K and mTOR inhibitor) was tested in the placebo-controlled phase III trial PROTECTOR 1 (RTB-101-204) to prevent clinically symptomatic respiratory illness in generally healthy elderly people. However, the trial did not meet this endpoint. Consequently, the related phase III trial PROTECTOR 2 (RTB-101-205) was terminated by the sponsor. Dactolisib has also undergone several phase II trials as a potential treatment for solid tumours as well as for respiratory diseases, most of which have been terminated as of 2022. Duvelisib (codenamed INK1197, IPI-145; PIK3CD and PIK3CG inhibitor): The results of the completed pivotal phase III trial DUO comparing duvelisib monotherapy with ofatumumab led to its approval for CLL/SLL An extension trial to DUO was completed in 2020, but its results have not yet been published. The phase III trial BRAVURA comparing duvelisib + rituximab + bendamustine with rituximab + bendamustine in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma was withdrawn by the sponsor when it was no longer expected to lead to approval. Similarly, the phase III trial DYNAMO + R comparing duvelisib + rituximab with rituximab alone in patients with follicular lymphoma was terminated by the sponsor when it was no longer expected to lead to approval. Idelalisib has undergone eleven phase III clinical trials as of March 2022. These include the pivotal trial GS-US-312-0116 that lead to approval of idelalisib by FDA and EMA for treatment of patients with CLL. All other phase III trials testing idelalisib-based therapy as an experimental treatment, e.g. in first-line CLL and second-line NHL, had been terminated by end of 2016, mainly due to increased toxicity and mortality. Two trials comparing new experimental treatments to idelalisib as a comparator and a dose optimization study in FL are still ongoing. Parsaclisib (codenamed INCB050465, INCB 50465; PIK3CD inhibitor) will be tested as a potential treatment for different diseases in five phase III trials: Follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) in the phase III trial CITADEL-302 Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the phase III trial CITADEL-310 Myelofibrosis in the phase III trials LIMBER-304 and LIMBER-313 Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA) in the phase III trial PATHWAY Paxalisib (codenamed GDC-0084; pan-class I PI3K and mTOR inhibitor) was tested as a potential treatment for newly diagnosed, unmethylated as well as recurrent glioblastoma in the phase II/III trial GBM AGILE. Kazia reported positive study results for the newly diagnosed, unmethylated population in the concurrent analysis which compares patients treated with paxalisib between January 2021 and March 2022 with those treated with temozolomide during the same time. The results showed a clinically meaningful increase in medium overall survival of 3.8 months, representing an increase of 33% vs. the temozolomide arm which is currently the standard of care. Kazia PR July 2024 Taselisib (codenamed GDC-0032, RG7604; PIK3CA inhibitor): Development was discontinued due to strong side effects and only a minor survival benefit in the phase III trial SANDPIPER in patients with breast cancer. Zandelisib (codenamed ME-401; PIK3CD inhibitor) will be tested as a potential treatment for iNHL in the phase III trial COASTAL.

2256,"('Biopterin',)","Endogenous, Medical","Biopterins are pterin derivatives which function as endogenous enzyme cofactors in many species of animals and in some bacteria and fungi. The prototypical compound of the class is biopterin (6-(1,2-dihydroxypropyl)-pterin), as shown in the infobox. Biopterins act as cofactors for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (AAAH), which are involved in synthesizing a number of neurotransmitters including dopamine, norepinephrine, epinepherine, and serotonin, along with several trace amines. Nitric oxide synthesis also uses biopterin derivatives as cofactors. In humans, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is the endogenous cofactor for AAAH enzymes. As with pterins in general, biopterins exhibit tautomerism. In other words, there are a number of forms that readily interconvert, differing by the placement of hydrogen atoms. Depictions of the chemical structure may therefore vary among sources. == Compounds == Biopterin compounds found in the animal body include BH4, the free radical BH3•, and the semi-oxidized form BH2. The fully oxidized form, i.e. ""biopterin"" proper, has little biological significance. Bacteria produce several unique glycosides of biopterin (and of other pterins as well), using a specific BPt glucosyltransferase. They may have a function in UV protection. == Biosynthesis == BH4 is the principal active cofactor. BH4 synthesis occurs through two principal pathways; the de novo pathway involves three enzymatic steps and proceeds from GTP, while the salvage pathway converts sepiapterin to BH4 using dihydrofolate reductase. In addition, BH2 is recycled to BH4 by dihydrobiopterin reductase. In the de novo pathway, GTP is converted to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate by GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH-1, FolE), which expands the imidazole ring in GTP by one carbon. The intermediate is converted to 6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin by 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase, which removes the phosphate and produces the diketone (pyruvoyl) substituent. The final stage is mediated by sepiapterin reductase. == Biopterin disorders == A number of disorders of biopterin regulation exist. Single-gene defects affecting the gene GCH1 block the first step in biopterin synthesis, and lead to dopamine-responsive dystonia, also known as Segawa's syndrome. This is due to the role of BH4 in synthesising neurotransmitters, including Dopamine, and is treated with supplementation with levodopa, which does not require BH4 for conversion to dopamine. GCH1 defects are autosomal dominant, meaning that only one defective gene copy is required for the condition to occur. Mouse gene knockout models that block biopterin synthesis completely die shortly after birth due to their inability to produce catecholamines and neurotransmitters. Biopterin synthesis disorders are also a cause of hyperphenylalaninemia; phenylalanine metabolism requires BH4 as a cofactor. In psychiatry, imbalances of biopterin concentrations have been hypothesized to be linked to mood disorders, particularly depression. == References == == External links == Neurological aspects of biopterin metabolism WiseGeek.

It is activated by autophosphorylation of a conserved aspartate residue within its regulatory domain. Its primary phospho-donor is its cognate histidine kinase PhoR; however, it also becomes phosphorylated when incubated with acetylphosphate. To further characterize its activation, PhoB was considered to be an acetylphosphatase whose enzymatic mechanism involves a phospho-enzyme intermediate. The kinetic constants for autophosphorylation were determined using 32P-and fluorescence-based assays and indicated that PhoB has a K(m) for acetylphosphate of between 7 and 8 mM. These constants are not consistent with an in vivo role for acetylphosphate in the normal control of the Pho regulon. In addition, when PhoB was phosphorylated by acetylphosphate it eluted from a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) size-exclusion column in two peaks. The larger form of PhoB eluted from the column in a similar manner to a chemically cross-linked dimer of PhoB. The smaller form of PhoB is a monomer. Phosphorylated PhoB bound pho-box DNA approximately 10 times tighter than PhoB. These observations show that PhoB forms a dimer when phosphorylated and suggest that the characteristics of activated PhoB result from its dimerization. In microbial cell factory, CO Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were preloaded with either 45Ca2+ or unlabeled Ca2+. 45Ca2+ efflux and influx were determined in the presence and absence of acetylphosphate. Phosphorylation of the membrane-bound (Ca2+,Mg2+)-ATPase by [32P]acetylphosphate was also determined. The rate of efflux with acetylphosphate was considerably higher than that without acetylphosphate. When the acetylphosphate concentration was greatly reduced by diluting the reaction mixture after the start of the reaction, the rate of the efflux decreased markedly. These results demonstrate the acceleration of 45Ca2+ efflux by acetylphosphate. This acetylphosphate-induced efflux required external Ca2+. The external Ca2+ concentration giving half-maximum activation of efflux was 3.8 microM. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of the efflux coincided with that of phosphorylation. When the acetylphosphate concentration was varied, the rate of acetylphosphate-induced efflux changed approximately in proportion to the phosphoenzyme concentration. These and other findings show that acetylphosphate-induced 45Ca2+ efflux represents Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange (between the external medium and the internal medium) mediated by the phosphoenzyme and further demonstrate the direct dissociation of Ca2+ from the Ca2+-bound phosphoenzyme to the external medium in Ca2+-Ca2+ exchange.",Acetylphosphate,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -3.547789674485102e-05)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.1270654797554016), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0022802562452852726)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.004078401252627373)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ([hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0001494?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=12, title='Human Metabolome Database: Showing metabocard for Acetylphosphate (HMDB0001494)', type='url_citation', url='https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0001494?utm_source=openai')])"
2260,"('Etoposide phosphate', 'Etopofos', 'Etopophos', 'Etopophos preservative free', 'Etoposide phosphate [usan]')",Medical,"Etoposide, sold under the brand name Vepesid among others, is a chemotherapy medication used for the treatments of a number of types of cancer including testicular cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and ovarian cancer. It is also used for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. It is used by mouth or injection into a vein. Side effects are very common. They can include low blood cell counts, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, hair loss, and fever. Other severe side effects include allergic reactions and low blood pressure. Use during pregnancy will likely harm the fetus. Etoposide is in the topoisomerase inhibitor family of medication. It is believed to work by damaging DNA. Etoposide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1983. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Etoposide is used as a form of chemotherapy for cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lung cancer, testicular cancer, lymphoma, nonlymphocytic leukemia, and glioblastoma multiforme. It is often given in combination with other drugs (such as bleomycin in treating testicular cancer). It is also sometimes used in a conditioning regimen prior to a bone marrow or blood stem cell transplant. === Administration === It is given intravenously (IV) or orally in capsule or tablet form. If the drug is given IV, it must be done slowly over a 30- to 60-minute period because it can lower blood pressure as it is being administered. Blood pressure is checked often during infusing, with the speed of administration adjusted accordingly. == Side effects == Common are: infusion site reactions low blood pressure hair loss pain and or burning at the IV site constipation or diarrhea metallic food taste bone marrow suppression, leading to: decreased white blood cell counts (leading to increased susceptibility to infections) low red blood cell counts (anemia) low platelet counts (leading to easy bruising and bleeding) Less common are: nausea and vomiting allergic-type reactions rash fever, often occurring shortly after IV administration and not due to infection mouth sores acute myeloid leukemia (which can be treated with etoposide itself) When given with warfarin, it may cause bleeding. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Etoposide forms a ternary complex with DNA and the topoisomerase II enzyme, which is an enzyme that aids in relaxing negative or positive supercoils in DNA. Topoisomerase II normally will form a double-stranded break in one DNA double-strand, allow another to pass through, and re-ligate the broken strands. Etoposide's binding prevents topoisomerase II from re-ligating the broken DNA strands, which causes the DNA breaks made by topoisomerase II to stay broken, and also prevents the topoisomerase II molecule from leaving the site and relieving tension elsewhere. This results in a double-strand break in the DNA that can have various deleterious effects on the cell, and depletion of topoisomerase II available to relieve further tension. Cancer cells rely on this enzyme more than healthy cells, since they divide more rapidly. Therefore, this causes errors in DNA synthesis and promotes apoptosis of the cancer cell. == Chemistry == Etoposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin from the rhizome of the mayapple (or ""American mandrake"", Podophyllum peltatum). More specifically, it is a glycoside of podophyllotoxin with a D-glucose derivative. It is chemically similar to the anti-cancer drug teniposide, being distinguished only by a methyl group where teniposide has a thienyl. Both these compounds have been developed with the aim of creating less toxic derivatives of podophyllotoxin. The substance is a white to yellow-brown, crystalline powder. It is soluble in organic solvents. It is used in form of its salt etoposide phosphate. == History == Etoposide was first synthesized in 1966 and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval was granted in 1983. The nickname VP-16 likely comes from a compounding of the last name of one of the chemists who performed early work on the drug (von Wartburg) and podophyllotoxin. Another scientist who was integral in the development of podophyllotoxin-based chemotherapeutics was the medical pharmacologist Hartmann F.

2263,"('Oxfenicine', 'P-hydroxyphenylglycine', 'Uk 25842', 'H-phg(4-oh)-oh', '(s)-2-amino-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetic acid')",Medical," Oxfenicine is a carnitine-palmitoyl transferase 1b (CPT-1b)-specific inhibitor that has been shown to improve whole body insulin sensitivity while suppressing fatty acid (FA) oxidation and increasing circulating FA. Because the white adipose tissue (WAT) is an organ that stores and releases FAs, this study investigated whether oxfenicine-induced inhibition of FA oxidation affected adiposity and WAT metabolism in rats fed either low (LF) or high-fat (HF) diets. Following 8 wk of dietary intervention, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a daily intraperitoneal injection of oxfenicine (150 mg/kg body wt) or vehicle (PBS) for 3 wk. Oxfenicine treatment reduced whole body fat oxidation, body weight, and adiposity, and improved insulin sensitivity in HF-fed rats. All of these effects occurred without alterations in food intake, energy expenditure, and ambulatory activity. In vivo oxfenicine treatment reduced FA oxidation and lipolysis in subcutaneous inguinal (SC Ing) adipocytes, whereas glucose incorporation into lipids (lipogenesis) was significantly reduced in both SC Ing and epididymal (Epid) adipocytes. In summary, our results show that oxfenicine-induced inhibition of CPT-1b markedly affects WAT metabolism, leading to reduced adiposity through a mechanism that involves reduced lipogenesis in the SC Ing and Epid fat depots of rats. We compared the haemodynamic and metabolic effects of acetyl-L-carnitine (one of the carnitine derivatives) and of oxfenicine (a carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 inhibitor) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in male Wistar rats. Diabetes was induced by a single tail vein injection of 55mgkg(-1) streptozotocin. The diabetic animals daily treated with either acetyl-L-carnitine (150mgkg(-1) in drinking water) or oxfenicine (150mgkg(-1) by oral gavage) for 8weeks,were compared with the untreated age-matched diabetic controls. Arterial wave reflection was derived using the impulse response function of the filtered aortic input impedance spectra. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) measurement was used to estimate malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Oxfenicine, but not acetyl-L-carnitine, increased total peripheral resistance in diabetes, which paralleled its elevation in plasma levels of free fatty acids. By contrast, acetyl-L-carnitine, but not oxfenicine, resulted in a significant increase in wave transit time and a decrease in wave reflection factor, suggesting that acetyl-L-carnitine may attenuate the diabetes-induced deterioration in systolic loading condition for the left ventricle. This was in parallel with its lowering of MDA/TBARS content in plasma and aortic walls in diabetes. Acetyl-L-carnitine therapy also prevented the diabetes-related cardiac hypertrophy, as evidenced by the reduction in ratio of the left ventricular weight to body weight.  Acetyl-L-carnitine, but not oxfenicine, attenuates aortic stiffening and cardiac hypertrophy, possibly through its decrease of lipid oxidation-derived MDA/TBARS in the rats with insulin deficiency. In the treatment of patients with diabetes, one objective is an improvement of cardiac metabolism to alleviate the left ventricular (LV) function. For this study, we compared the effects of acetyl-l-carnitine (one of the carnitine derivatives) and of oxfenicine (a carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 inhibitor) on cardiac pumping mechanics in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in male Wistar rats, with a particular focus on the pressure-flow-volume relationship. Diabetes was induced by a single tail vein injection of 55 mg kg(-1) streptozotocin. The diabetic animals were treated on a daily basis with either acetyl-L-carnitine (1 g L(-1) in drinking water) or oxfenicine (150 mg kg(-1) by oral gavage) for 8 wk. They were also compared with untreated age-matched diabetic controls. LV pressure and ascending aortic flow signals were recorded to calculate the maximal systolic elastance (E max) and the theoretical maximum flow (Q max). Physically, E max reflects the contractility of the myocardium as an intact heart, whereas Q max has an inverse relationship with the LV internal resistance. When comparing the diabetic rats with their age-matched controls, the cardiodynamic condition was characterized by a decline in E max associated with the unaltered Q max. Acetyl-l-carnitine (but not oxfenicine) had reduced cardiac levels of malondialdehyde in these insulin-deficient animals. However, treating with acetyl-l-carnitine or oxfenicine resulted in an increase in E max, which suggests that these 2 drugs may protect the contractile status from deteriorating in the diabetic heart. By contrast, Q max showed a significant fall after administration of oxfenicine, but not with acetyl-L-carnitine. The decrease in Q max corresponded to an increase in total vascular resistance when treated with oxfenicine.

It is used to treat community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity. After significant safety concerns, the US Food and Drug Administration sharply curtailed the approved uses of the drug in early 2007. Telithromycin is a semi-synthetic erythromycin derivative. It is created by substituting a ketogroup for the cladinose sugar and adding a carbamate ring in the lactone ring. An alkyl-aryl moiety is attached to this carbamate ring. Furthermore, the oxygen at the 6 position is methylated, as is the case with clarithromycin, to achieve better acid-stability. It was patented in 1994 and approved for medical use in 2001. == Adverse effects == Most common side-effects are gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Headache and disturbances in taste also occur. Less common side-effects include palpitations, blurred vision, and rashes. Prolonged QTc intervals may also be caused by telithromycin. Rare but severe side-effects were initially reported in March 2006, involving damage to the liver. Three different incidents were reported: one case of temporary drug-induced hepatitis, one ending in a liver transplant, and one ending in death. In the United States, the FDA's Office of Epidemiology and Surveillance identified 12 cases of acute liver failure, resulting in four deaths, and an additional 23 cases of acute, serious liver injury, among 5.2 million patients taking telithromycin through April 2006. In 2010, a published report described the likely mechanism of action underlying not only the cases of liver failure but also cases of visual disturbances and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis. The study showed that a pyridine moiety that is part of the telithromycin molecule acts as an antagonist on cholinergic receptors located in the neuromuscular junction, the ciliary ganglion of the eye and the vagus nerve innervating the liver. Other macrolides, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin and the fluoroketolide, solithromycin, do not contain the pyridine moiety and do not antagonize these cholinergic receptors significantly. == Mechanism of action == Telithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. Telithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, and blocks the progression of the growing polypeptide chain. Telithromycin has over 10 times higher affinity to the subunit 50S than erythromycin. In addition, telithromycin strongly bind simultaneously to two domains of 23S RNA of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, where older macrolides bind strongly only to one domain and weakly to the second domain. Like many other protein synthesis inhibitors, telithromycin can also inhibit the formation of ribosomal subunits 50S and 30S. == Pharmacokinetics == Unlike erythromycin, telithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally while being protected from gastric acids. It is fairly rapidly absorbed, and diffused into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, telithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of telithromycin is released. The concentration of telithromycin in the tissues is much higher than in plasma. Telithromycin fulfills a role that has arisen due to the rise of microbial resistance to existing macrolides and appears to be effective against macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The defining differentiating characteristic of the ketolides as opposed to other macrolides is the removal of the neutral sugar, L-cladinose from the 3 position of the macrolide ring and the subsequent oxidation of the 3-hydroxyl to a 3-keto functional group. == Metabolism == Telithromycin is metabolized mainly in the liver, the main elimination route being the bile, a small portion is also excreted into the urine. About one third is excreted unchanged in bile and urine, the biliary route being favoured. Telithromycin's half-life is approximately ten hours. == History == French pharmaceutical company Hoechst Marion Roussel (later Sanofi-Aventis) began phase II/III clinical trials of telithromycin (HMR-3647) in 1998. Telithromycin was approved by the European Commission in July 2001 and subsequently went on sale in October 2001. In the US, telithromycin received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval on April 1, 2004. === Safety controversies and fraud === FDA staffers publicly complained that safety problems and some data integrity issues were ignored prior to approval, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held hearings to examine these complaints. One doctor went to prison because she falsified data in her portion of the clinical trials (about 400 patients out of 24,000). Further, Ketek seemed to cause liver problems, including ""liver failure"", to a greater extent than would be expected of a common-use antibiotic. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held hearings. Study 3014 was a key clinical trial of approximately 24,000 patients which Sanofi-Aventis submitted to the FDA to seek approval for Ketek. The doctor who treated the most patients in Study 3014 (about 400), Maria ""Anne"" Kirkman Campbell, served a 57-month sentence in federal prison after pleading guilty to mail fraud, by defrauding Aventis and others. The indictment states that Campbell fabricated data she sent to the company. Documents, including internal Sanofi-Aventis emails show that Aventis was worried about Campbell early in study 3014 but didn't tell the FDA until the agency's own inspectors discovered the problem independently. In January 2006, an article in the March issue of Annals of Internal Medicine was published, citing three recent drug-induced liver injury cases likely due to telithromycin, one resulting in a liver transplant and one in death. In July 2006, according to the New York Times, unpublished e-mails from FDA safety official David Graham argued telithromycin had not been proven safe, that safer drugs were available for the same indications, and that the approval was a mistake and should be immediately withdrawn. Between the start of telithromycin's marketing in mid-2004 and September 2006, there were 13 cases of liver failure, including at least four deaths, vision problems, blackouts, syncope, and potentially fatal cases of myasthenia gravis. The Times said that the FDA was embroiled in a ""fierce battle"" over the approval, fueled by exposure in the press. Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa, chairman, Senate Finance Committee), Representatives Edward J. Markey (D-Mass) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif) held hearings. === FDA Warning === On February 12, 2007, after an advisory committee discussion and vote in December 2006, the FDA announced a revision to the labeling of Ketek. The changes included the removal of two of the three previously approved indications: acute bacterial sinusitis and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The agency determined that the balance of benefits and risks no longer supported approval of the drug for these indications. Ketek remained on the market for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia of mild to moderate severity (acquired outside of hospitals or long-term care facilities). In addition, the FDA worked with the manufacturer to update the product labeling with a ""black box warning,"" their strongest form of warning. Ketek's warning states that it should not be used in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease that causes muscle weakness. Following this decision, Sanofi-Aventis withdrew the drug from active sales in the United States. == Available forms == Telithromycin is administered as tablets. The standard dosing is two 400 mg tablets to be taken together daily, with or without food. == References == == External links == FDA Public Health Advisory for Telithromycin (marketed as Ketek) Article in Annals of Internal Medicine regarding cases of hepatotoxicity induced by telithromycin New York Times article.

2268,"('Amikacin (disulfate)', 'Amikacin', 'Amikin', 'Amicacin', 'Amikacinum')",Medical,"Amikacin is an antibiotic medication used for a number of bacterial infections. This includes joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, meningitis, pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections. It is also used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It is used by injection into a vein using an IV or into a muscle. Amikacin, like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, can cause hearing loss, balance problems, and kidney problems. Other side effects include paralysis, resulting in the inability to breathe. If used during pregnancy it may cause permanent deafness in the baby. Amikacin works by blocking the function of the bacteria's 30S ribosomal subunit, making it unable to produce proteins. Amikacin was patented in 1971, and came into commercial use in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is derived from kanamycin. == Medical uses == Amikacin is most often used for treating severe infections with multidrug-resistant, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, and Serratia. The only Gram-positive bacteria that amikacin strongly affects are Staphylococcus and Nocardia. Amikacin can also be used to treat non-tubercular mycobacterial infections and tuberculosis (if caused by sensitive strains) when first-line drugs fail to control the infection. It is rarely used alone. It is often used in the following situations: Bronchiectasis Bone and joint infections Granulocytopenia, when combined with ticarcillin, in people with cancer Intra-abdominal infections (such as peritonitis) as an adjunct to other medicines, like clindamycin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, or ampicillin/sulbactam Meningitis: for meningitis by E. coli, as an adjunct to imipenem for meningitis caused by Pseudomonas, as an adjunct to meropenem for meningitis caused by Acinetobacter, as an adjunct to imipenem or colistin for neonatal meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae or Listeria monocytogenes, as an adjunct to ampicillin for neonatal meningitis caused by Gram negative bacteria such as E. coli, as adjunct to a 3rd-generation cephalosporin Mycobacterial infections, including as a second-line agent for active tuberculosis. It is also used for infections by Mycobacterium avium, M. abcessus, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum. Rhodococcus equi, which causes an infection resembling tuberculosis Respiratory tract infections, including as an adjunct to beta-lactams or carbapenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia Sepsis, including that in neonates, as an adjunct to beta-lactams or carbapenem Skin and suture-site infections Urinary tract infections that are caused by bacteria resistant to less toxic drugs (often by Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa) Amikacin may be combined with a beta-lactam antibiotic for empiric therapy for people with neutropenia and fever. === Available forms === A liposome inhalation suspension is also available and approved to treat Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in the United States, and in the European Union. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is the first drug approved under the US limited population pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs (LPAD pathway). It also was approved under the accelerated approval pathway. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for amikacin liposome inhalation suspension fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review, and qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) designations. The FDA granted approval of Arikayce to Insmed, Inc. The safety and efficacy of amikacin liposome inhalation suspension, an inhaled treatment taken through a nebulizer, was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial where patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group of patients received amikacin liposome inhalation suspension plus a background multi-drug antibacterial regimen, while the other treatment group received a background multi-drug antibacterial regimen alone. By the sixth month of treatment, 29 percent of patients treated with amikacin liposome inhalation suspension had no growth of mycobacteria in their sputum cultures for three consecutive months compared to 9 percent of patients who were not treated with amikacin liposome inhalation suspension. === Special populations === Amikacin should be used in smaller doses in the elderly, who often have age-related decreases in kidney function, and children, whose kidneys are not fully developed yet. It is considered pregnancy category D in both the United States and Australia, meaning they have a probability of harming the fetus. Around 16% of amikacin crosses the placenta; while the half-life of amikacin in the mother is 2 hours, it is 3.7 hours in the fetus. A pregnant woman taking amikacin with another aminoglycoside has a possibility of causing congenital deafness in her child. While it is known to cross the placenta, amikacin is only partially secreted in breast milk. In general, amikacin should be avoided in infants. Infants also tend to have a larger volume of distribution due to their higher concentration of extracellular fluid, where aminoglycosides reside. The elderly tend to have amikacin stay longer in their system; while the average clearance of amikacin in a 20-year-old is 6 L/hr, it is 3 L/hr in an 80-year-old. Clearance is even higher in people with cystic fibrosis. In people with muscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease, amikacin's paralytic effect on neuromuscular junctions can worsen muscle weakness. == Adverse effects == Side-effects of amikacin are similar to those of other aminoglycosides. Kidney damage and ototoxicity (which can lead to hearing loss) are the most important effects, occurring in 1–10% of users. The nephro- and ototoxicity are thought to be due to aminoglycosides' tendency to accumulate in the kidneys and inner ear. Amikacin can cause neurotoxicity if used at a higher dose or for longer than recommended. The resulting effects of neurotoxicity include vertigo, numbness, tingling of the skin (paresthesia), muscle twitching, and seizures. Its toxic effect on the 8th cranial nerve causes ototoxicity, resulting in loss of balance and, more commonly, hearing loss. Damage to the cochlea, caused by the forced apoptosis of the hair cells, leads to the loss of high-frequency hearing and happens before any clinical hearing loss can be detected. Damage to the ear vestibules, most likely by creating excessive oxidative free radicals. It does so in a time-dependent rather than dose-dependent manner, meaning that risk can be minimized by reducing the duration of use. Amikacin causes nephrotoxicity (damage to the kidneys), by acting on the proximal renal tubules. It easily ionizes to a cation and binds to the anionic sites of the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule as part of receptor-mediated pinocytosis. The concentration of amikacin in the renal cortex becomes ten times that of amikacin in the plasma; it then most likely interferes with the metabolism of phospholipids in the lysosomes, which causes lytic enzymes to leak into the cytoplasm. Nephrotoxicity results in increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, red blood cells, and white blood cells, as well as albuminuria (increased output of albumin in the urine), glycosuria (excretion of glucose into the urine), decreased urine specific gravity, and oliguria (decrease in overall urine output). It can also cause urinary casts to appear. The changes in renal tubular function also change the electrolyte levels and acid-base balance in the body, which can lead to hypokalemia and acidosis or alkalosis. Nephrotoxicity is more common in those with pre-existing hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, acidosis, low glomerular filtration rate, diabetes mellitus, dehydration, fever, and sepsis, as well as those taking antiprostaglandins. The toxicity usually reverts once the antibiotic course has been completed, and can be avoided altogether by less frequent dosing (such as once every 24 hours rather than once every 8 hours). Amikacin can cause neuromuscular blockade (including acute muscular paralysis) and respiratory paralysis (including apnea). Rare side effects (occurring in fewer than 1% of users) include allergic reactions, skin rash, fever, headaches, tremor, nausea and vomiting, eosinophilia, arthralgia, anemia, hypotension, and hypomagnesemia. In intravitreous injections (where amikacin is injected into the eye), macular infarction can cause permanent vision loss. The amikacin liposome inhalation suspension prescribing information includes a boxed warning regarding the increased risk of respiratory conditions including hypersensitivity pneumonitis (inflamed lungs), bronchospasm (tightening of the airway), exacerbation of underlying lung disease and hemoptysis (spitting up blood) that have led to hospitalizations in some cases. Other common side effects in patients taking amikacin liposome inhalation suspension are dysphonia (difficulty speaking), cough, ototoxicity (damaged hearing), upper airway irritation, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, diarrhea and nausea. == Contraindications == Amikacin should be avoided in those who are sensitive to any aminoglycoside, as they are cross-allergenic (that is, an allergy to one aminoglycoside also confers hypersensitivity to other aminoglycosides). It should also be avoided in those sensitive to sulfite (seen more among people with asthma), since most amikacin usually comes with sodium metabisulfite, which can cause an allergic reaction. In general, amikacin should not be used with or just before/after another drug that can cause neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, or nephrotoxicity. Such drugs include other aminoglycosides; the antiviral acyclovir; the antifungal amphotericin B; the antibiotics bacitracin, capreomycin, colistin, polymyxin B, and vancomycin; and cisplatin, which is used in chemotherapy. Amikacin should not be used with neuromuscular blocking agents, as they can increase muscle weakness and paralysis. == Interactions == Amikacin can be inactivated by other beta-lactams, though not to the extent as other aminoglycosides, and is still often used with penicillins (a type of beta-lactam) to create an additive effect against certain bacteria, and carbapenems, which can have a synergistic effect against some Gram-positive bacteria. Another group of beta-lactams, the cephalosporins, can increase the nephrotoxicity of aminoglycoside as well as randomly elevating creatinine levels. The antibiotics chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and tetracycline have been known to inactivate aminoglycosides in general by pharmacological antagonism. The effect of amikacin is increased when used with drugs derived from the botulinum toxin, anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking agents, or large doses of blood that contains citrate as an anticoagulant. Potent diuretics not only cause ototoxicity themselves, but they can also increase the concentration of amikacin in the serum and tissue, making the ototoxicity even more likely. Quinidine also increases levels of amikacin in the body. The NSAID indomethacin can increase serum aminoglycoside levels in premature infants. Contrast mediums such as ioversol increases the nephrotoxicity and otoxicity caused by amikacin. Amikacin can decrease the effect certain vaccines, such as the live BCG vaccine (used for tuberculosis), the cholera vaccine, and the live typhoid vaccine by acting as a pharmacological antagonist. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Amikacin irreversibly binds to 16S rRNA and the RNA-binding S12 protein of the 30S subunit of prokaryotic ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis by changing the ribosome's shape so that it cannot read the mRNA codons correctly. It also interferes with the region that interacts with the wobble base of the tRNA anticodon. It works in a concentration-dependent manner, and has better action in an alkaline environment. At normal doses, amikacin-sensitive bacteria respond within 24–48 hours. ==== Resistance ==== Amikacin evades attacks by all antibiotic-inactivating enzymes that are responsible for antibiotic resistance in bacteria, except for aminoacetyltransferase and nucleotidyltransferase. This is accomplished by the L-hydroxyaminobuteroyl amide (L-HABA) moiety attached to N-1 (compare to kanamycin, which simply has a hydrogen), which blocks the access and decreases the affinity of aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes. Amikacin ends up with only one site where these enzymes can attack, while gentamicin and tobramycin have six. Bacteria that are resistant to streptomycin and capreomycin are still susceptible to amikacin; bacteria that are resistant to kanamycin have varying susceptibility to amikacin. Resistance to amikacin also confers resistance to kanamycin and capreomycin. Resistance to amikacin and kanamycin in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is due to a mutation in the rrs gene, which codes for the 16S rRNA. Mutations such as these reduce the binding affinity of amikacin to the bacteria's ribosome. Variations of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase (AAD) also confer resistance: resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is caused by AAC(6')-IV, which also confers resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, and resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis is caused by AAD(4',4), which also confers resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, and apramycin. Some strains of S. aureus can also inactivate amikacin by phosphorylating it. === Pharmacokinetics === Amikacin is not absorbed orally and thus must be administered parenterally. It reaches peak serum concentrations in 0.5–2 hours when administered intramuscularly. Less than 11% of the amikacin actually binds to plasma proteins. It is distributed into the heart, gallbladder, lungs, and bones, as well as in bile, sputum, interstitial fluid, pleural fluid, and synovial fluids. It is usually found at low concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, except when administered intraventricularly. In infants, amikacin is normally found at 10–20% of plasma levels in the spinal fluid, but the amount reaches 50% in cases of meningitis. It does not easily cross the blood–brain barrier or enter ocular tissue. While the half-life of amikacin is normally two hours, it is 50 hours in those with end-stage renal disease. The majority (95%) of amikacin from an intramuscular or intravenous dose is secreted unchanged via glomerular filtration and into the urine within 24 hours. Factors that cause amikacin to be excreted via urine include its relatively low molecular weight, high water solubility, and unmetabolized state. == Chemistry == Amikacin is derived from kanamycin A: == Veterinary uses == While amikacin is only FDA-approved for use in dogs and for intrauterine infection in horses, it is one of the most common aminoglycosides used in veterinary medicine, and has been used in dogs, cats, guinea pigs, chinchillas, hamsters, rats, mice, prairie dogs, cattle, birds, snakes, turtles and tortoises, crocodilians, bullfrogs, and fish. It is often used for respiratory infections in snakes, bacterial shell disease in turtles, and sinusitis in macaws. It is generally contraindicated in rabbits and hares (though it has still been used) because it harms the balance of intestinal microflora. In dogs and cats, amikacin is commonly used as a topical antibiotic for ear infections and for corneal ulcers, especially those that are caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ears are often cleaned before administering the medication, since pus and cellular debris lessen the activity of amikacin. Amikacin is administered to the eye when prepared as an ophthalmic ointment or solution, or when injected subconjunctivally. Amikacin in the eye can be accompanied by cephazolin. Despite its use there amikacin (and all aminoglycosides) are toxic to intraocular structures. In horses, amikacin is FDA-approved for uterine infections (such as endometriosis and pyometra) when caused by susceptible bacteria. It is also used in topical medication for the eyes and arthroscopic lavage; when combined with a cephalosporin, is used to treat subcutaneous infections that are caused by Staphylococcus. For infections in the limbs or joints, it is often administered with a cephalosporin via limb perfusion directly into the limb or injected into the joint. Amikacin is also injected into the joints with the anti-arthritic medication Adequan in order to prevent infection. Side effects in animals include nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and allergic reactions at IM injection sites. Cats tend to be more sensitive to the vestibular damage caused by ototoxicity. Less frequent side effects include neuromuscular blockade, facial edema, and peripheral neuropathy. The half-life in most animals is one to two hours. Treating overdoses of amikacin requires kidney dialysis or peritoneal dialysis, which reduce serum concentrations of amikacin, and/or penicillins, some of which can form complexes with amikacin that deactivate it. == References ==",Amicacin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.6702524337451905e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009305914281867445)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amikacin ', [])"
2269,"('Fructose', 'Beta-d-fructopyranose', '(2r,3s,4r,5r)-2-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol', 'Frutabs', 'Fructopyranose, beta-d-')","Food, Medical","Fructose (), or fruit sugar, is a ketonic simple sugar found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed by the gut directly into the blood of the portal vein during digestion. The liver then converts most fructose and galactose into glucose for distribution in the bloodstream or deposition into glycogen. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name ""fructose"" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Allen Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid, and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables. Commercially, fructose is derived from sugar cane, sugar beets, and maize. High-fructose corn syrup is a mixture of glucose and fructose as monosaccharides. Sucrose is a compound with one molecule of glucose covalently linked to one molecule of fructose. All forms of fructose, including those found in fruits and juices, are commonly added to foods and drinks for palatability and taste enhancement, and for browning of some foods, such as baked goods. As of 2004, about 240,000 tonnes of crystalline fructose were being produced annually. Excessive consumption of sugars, including fructose, (especially from sugar-sweetened beverages) may contribute to insulin resistance, obesity, elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, leading to metabolic syndrome. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stated in 2011 that fructose may be preferable over sucrose and glucose in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages because of its lower effect on postprandial blood sugar levels, while also noting the potential downside that ""high intakes of fructose may lead to metabolic complications such as dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and increased visceral adiposity"". The UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in 2015 disputed the claims of fructose causing metabolic disorders, stating that ""there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that fructose intake, at levels consumed in the normal UK diet, leads to adverse health outcomes independent of any effects related to its presence as a component of total and free sugars."" == Etymology == The word ""fructose"" was coined in 1857 from the Latin for fructus (fruit) and the generic chemical suffix for sugars, -ose. It is also called fruit sugar and levulose or laevulose, due to its ability to rotate plane polarised light in a laevorotary fashion (anti-clockwise/to the left) when a beam is shone through it in solution. Likewise, dextrose (an isomer of glucose) is given its name due to its ability to rotate plane polarised light in a dextrorotary fashion (clockwise/to the right). == Chemical properties == Fructose is a 6-carbon polyhydroxyketone. Crystalline fructose adopts a cyclic six-membered structure, called β-d-fructopyranose, owing to the stability of its hemiketal and internal hydrogen-bonding. In solution, fructose exists as an equilibrium mixture of the tautomers β-d-fructopyranose, β-d-fructofuranose, α-d-fructofuranose, α-d-fructopyranose and keto-d-fructose (the non-cyclic form). The distribution of d-fructose tautomers in solution is related to several variables, such as solvent and temperature. d-Fructopyranose and d-fructofuranose distributions in water have been identified multiple times as roughly 70% fructopyranose and 22% fructofuranose. === Reactions === ==== Fructose and fermentation ==== Fructose may be anaerobically fermented by yeast and bacteria. Yeast enzymes convert sugar (sucrose, glucose, and fructose, but not lactose) to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Some of the carbon dioxide produced during fermentation will remain dissolved in water, where it will reach equilibrium with carbonic acid. The dissolved carbon dioxide and carbonic acid produce the carbonation in some fermented beverages, such as champagne. ==== Fructose and Maillard reaction ==== Fructose undergoes the Maillard reaction, non-enzymatic browning, with amino acids. Because fructose exists to a greater extent in the open-chain form than does glucose, the initial stages of the Maillard reaction occur more rapidly than with glucose. Therefore, fructose has potential to contribute to changes in food palatability, as well as other nutritional effects, such as excessive browning, volume and tenderness reduction during cake preparation, and formation of mutagenic compounds. ==== Dehydration ==== Fructose readily dehydrates to give hydroxymethylfurfural (""HMF"", C6H6O3), which can be processed into liquid dimethylfuran (C6H8O). This process, in the future, may become part of a low-cost, carbon-neutral system to produce replacements for petrol and diesel from plants. == Physical and functional properties == === Sweetness of fructose === The primary reason that fructose is used commercially in foods and beverages, besides its low cost, is its high relative sweetness. It is the sweetest of all naturally occurring carbohydrates. The relative sweetness of fructose has been reported in the range of 1.2–1.8 times that of sucrose. However, it is the 6-membered ring form of fructose that is sweeter; the 5-membered ring form tastes about the same as usual table sugar. Warming fructose leads to formation of the 5-membered ring form. Therefore, the relative sweetness decreases with increasing temperature. However, it has been observed that the absolute sweetness of fructose is identical at 5 °C as 50 °C and thus the relative sweetness to sucrose is not due to anomeric distribution but a decrease in the absolute sweetness of sucrose at higher temperatures. The sweetness of fructose is perceived earlier than that of sucrose or glucose, and the taste sensation reaches a peak (higher than that of sucrose), and diminishes more quickly than that of sucrose. Fructose can also enhance other flavors in the system. Fructose exhibits a sweetness synergy effect when used in combination with other sweeteners. The relative sweetness of fructose blended with sucrose, aspartame, or saccharin is perceived to be greater than the sweetness calculated from individual components. === Fructose solubility and crystallization === Fructose has higher water solubility than other sugars, as well as other sugar alcohols. Fructose is, therefore, difficult to crystallize from an aqueous solution. Sugar mixes containing fructose, such as candies, are softer than those containing other sugars because of the greater solubility of fructose. === Fructose hygroscopicity and humectancy === Fructose is quicker to absorb moisture and slower to release it to the environment than sucrose, glucose, or other nutritive sweeteners. Fructose is an excellent humectant and retains moisture for a long period of time even at low relative humidity (RH). Therefore, fructose can contribute a more palatable texture, and longer shelf life to the food products in which it is used. === Freezing point === Fructose has a greater effect on freezing point depression than disaccharides or oligosaccharides, which may protect the integrity of cell walls of fruit by reducing ice crystal formation. However, this characteristic may be undesirable in soft-serve or hard-frozen dairy desserts. === Fructose and starch functionality in food systems === Fructose increases starch viscosity more rapidly and achieves a higher final viscosity than sucrose because fructose lowers the temperature required during gelatinizing of starch, causing a greater final viscosity. Although some artificial sweeteners are not suitable for home baking, many traditional recipes use fructose. == Food sources == Natural sources of fructose include fruits, vegetables (including sugar cane), and honey. Fructose is often further concentrated from these sources. The highest dietary sources of fructose, besides pure crystalline fructose, are foods containing white sugar (sucrose), high-fructose corn syrup, agave nectar, honey, molasses, maple syrup, fruit and fruit juices, as these have the highest percentages of fructose (including fructose in sucrose) per serving compared to other common foods and ingredients. Fructose exists in foods either as a free monosaccharide or bound to glucose as sucrose, a disaccharide. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose may all be present in food; however, different foods will have varying levels of each of these three sugars. The sugar contents of common fruits and vegetables are presented in Table 1. In general, in foods that contain free fructose, the ratio of fructose to glucose is approximately 1:1; that is, foods with fructose usually contain about an equal amount of free glucose. A value that is above 1 indicates a higher proportion of fructose to glucose and below 1 a lower proportion. Some fruits have larger proportions of fructose to glucose compared to others. For example, apples and pears contain more than twice as much free fructose as glucose, while for apricots the proportion is less than half as much fructose as glucose. Apple and pear juices are of particular interest to pediatricians because the high concentrations of free fructose in these juices can cause diarrhea in children. The cells (enterocytes) that line children's small intestines have less affinity for fructose absorption than for glucose and sucrose. Unabsorbed fructose creates higher osmolarity in the small intestine, which draws water into the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in osmotic diarrhea. This phenomenon is discussed in greater detail in the Health Effects section. Table 1 also shows the amount of sucrose found in common fruits and vegetables. Sugarcane and sugar beet have a high concentration of sucrose, and are used for commercial preparation of pure sucrose. Extracted cane or beet juice is clarified, removing impurities; and concentrated by removing excess water. The end product is 99.9%-pure sucrose. Sucrose-containing sugars include common white sugar and powdered sugar, as well as brown sugar. ^A The carbohydrate figure is calculated in FoodData Central and does not always correspond to the sum of the sugars, the starch, and the ""dietary fiber"". All data with a unit of g (gram) are based on 100 g of a food item. The fructose/glucose ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of free fructose plus half sucrose by the sum of free glucose plus half sucrose. Fructose is also found in the manufactured sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is produced by treating corn syrup with enzymes, converting glucose into fructose. The common designations for fructose content, HFCS-42 and HFCS-55, indicate the percentage of fructose present in HFCS. HFCS-55 is commonly used as a sweetener for soft drinks, whereas HFCS-42 is used to sweeten processed foods, breakfast cereals, bakery foods, and some soft drinks. === Carbohydrate content of commercial sweeteners (percent on dry basis) === for HFCS, and USDA for fruits and vegetables and the other refined sugars. Cane and beet sugars have been used as the major sweetener in food manufacturing for centuries. However, with the development of HFCS, a significant shift occurred in the type of sweetener consumption in certain countries, particularly the United States. Contrary to the popular belief, however, with the increase of HFCS consumption, the total fructose intake relative to the total glucose intake has not dramatically changed. Granulated sugar is 99.9%-pure sucrose, which means that it has equal ratio of fructose to glucose. The most commonly used forms of HFCS, HFCS-42, and HFCS-55, have a roughly equal ratio of fructose to glucose, with minor differences. HFCS has simply replaced sucrose as a sweetener. Therefore, despite the changes in the sweetener consumption, the ratio of glucose to fructose intake has remained relatively constant. === Nutritional information === Providing 368 kcal per 100 grams of dry powder (table), fructose has 95% the caloric value of sucrose by weight. Fructose powder is 100% carbohydrates and supplies no other nutrients in significant amount (table). == Fructose digestion and absorption in humans == Fructose exists in foods either as a monosaccharide (free fructose) or as a unit of a disaccharide (sucrose). Free fructose is a ketonic simple sugar and one of the three dietary monosaccharides absorbed directly by the intestine. When fructose is consumed in the form of sucrose, it is digested (broken down) and then absorbed as free fructose. As sucrose comes into contact with the membrane of the small intestine, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the cleavage of sucrose to yield one glucose unit and one fructose unit, which are then each absorbed. After absorption, it enters the hepatic portal vein and is directed toward the liver. The mechanism of fructose absorption in the small intestine is not completely understood. Some evidence suggests active transport, because fructose uptake has been shown to occur against a concentration gradient. However, the majority of research supports the claim that fructose absorption occurs on the mucosal membrane via facilitated transport involving GLUT5 transport proteins. Since the concentration of fructose is higher in the lumen, fructose is able to flow down a concentration gradient into the enterocytes, assisted by transport proteins. Fructose may be transported out of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane by either GLUT2 or GLUT5, although the GLUT2 transporter has a greater capacity for transporting fructose, and, therefore, the majority of fructose is transported out of the enterocyte through GLUT2. === Capacity and rate of absorption === The absorption capacity for fructose in monosaccharide form ranges from less than 5 g to 50 g (per individual serving) and adapts with changes in dietary fructose intake. Studies show the greatest absorption rate occurs when glucose and fructose are administered in equal quantities. When fructose is ingested as part of the disaccharide sucrose, absorption capacity is much higher because fructose exists in a 1:1 ratio with glucose. It appears that the GLUT5 transfer rate may be saturated at low levels, and absorption is increased through joint absorption with glucose. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is a glucose-dependent cotransport of fructose. In addition, fructose transfer activity increases with dietary fructose intake. The presence of fructose in the lumen causes increased mRNA transcription of GLUT5, leading to increased transport proteins. High-fructose diets (>2.4 g/kg body wt) increase the transport proteins within three days of intake. === Malabsorption === Several studies have measured the intestinal absorption of fructose using the hydrogen breath test. These studies indicate that fructose is not completely absorbed in the small intestine. When fructose is not absorbed in the small intestine, it is transported into the large intestine, where it is fermented by the colonic flora. Hydrogen is produced during the fermentation process and dissolves into the blood of the portal vein. This hydrogen is transported to the lungs, where it is exchanged across the lungs and is measurable by the hydrogen breath test. The colonic flora also produces carbon dioxide, short-chain fatty acids, organic acids, and trace gases in the presence of unabsorbed fructose. The presence of gases and organic acids in the large intestine causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and gastrointestinal pain. Exercise immediately after consumption can exacerbate these symptoms by decreasing transit time in the small intestine, resulting in a greater amount of fructose emptied into the large intestine. == Fructose metabolism == All three dietary monosaccharides are transported into the liver by the GLUT2 transporter. Fructose and galactose are phosphorylated in the liver by fructokinase (Km= 0.5 mM) and galactokinase (Km = 0.8 mM), respectively. By contrast, glucose tends to pass through the liver (Km of hepatic glucokinase = 10 mM) and can be metabolised anywhere in the body. Uptake of fructose by the liver is not regulated by insulin. However, insulin is capable of increasing the abundance and functional activity of GLUT5, fructose transporter, in skeletal muscle cells. === Fructolysis === The initial catabolism of fructose is sometimes referred to as fructolysis, in analogy with glycolysis, the catabolism of glucose. In fructolysis, the enzyme fructokinase initially produces fructose 1-phosphate, which is split by aldolase B to produce the trioses dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde. Unlike glycolysis, in fructolysis the triose glyceraldehyde lacks a phosphate group. A third enzyme, triokinase, is therefore required to phosphorylate glyceraldehyde, producing glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The resulting trioses are identical to those obtained in glycolysis and can enter the gluconeogenic pathway for glucose or glycogen synthesis, or be further catabolized through the lower glycolytic pathway to pyruvate. === Metabolism of fructose to DHAP and glyceraldehyde === The first step in the metabolism of fructose is the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose 1-phosphate by fructokinase, thus trapping fructose for metabolism in the liver. Fructose 1-phosphate then undergoes hydrolysis by aldolase B to form DHAP and glyceraldehydes; DHAP can either be isomerized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by triosephosphate isomerase or undergo reduction to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The glyceraldehyde produced may also be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by glyceraldehyde kinase or further converted to glycerol 3-phosphate by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The metabolism of fructose at this point yields intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway leading to glycogen synthesis as well as fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. === Synthesis of glycogen from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate === The resultant glyceraldehyde formed by aldolase B then undergoes phosphorylation to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Increased concentrations of DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the liver drive the gluconeogenic pathway toward glucose and subsequent glycogen synthesis. It appears that fructose is a better substrate for glycogen synthesis than glucose and that glycogen replenishment takes precedence over triglyceride formation. Once liver glycogen is replenished, the intermediates of fructose metabolism are primarily directed toward triglyceride synthesis. === Synthesis of triglyceride from DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate === Carbons from dietary fructose are found in both the free fatty acid and glycerol moieties of plasma triglycerides. High fructose consumption can lead to excess pyruvate production, causing a buildup of Krebs cycle intermediates. Accumulated citrate can be transported from the mitochondria into the cytosol of hepatocytes, converted to acetyl CoA by citrate lyase and directed toward fatty acid synthesis. In addition, DHAP can be converted to glycerol 3-phosphate, providing the glycerol backbone for the triglyceride molecule. Triglycerides are incorporated into very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are released from the liver destined toward peripheral tissues for storage in both fat and muscle cells. == Potential health effects == In 2022, the European Food Safety Authority stated that there is research evidence that fructose and other added free sugars may be associated with increased risk of several chronic diseases: the risk is moderate for obesity and dyslipidemia (more than 50%), and low for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes (from 15% to 50%) and hypertension. EFSA further stated that clinical research did ""not support a positive relationship between the intake of dietary sugars, in isocaloric exchange with other macronutrients, and any of the chronic metabolic diseases or pregnancy-related endpoints assessed"" but advised ""the intake of added and free sugars should be as low as possible in the context of a nutritionally adequate diet."" === Cardiometabolic diseases === When fructose is consumed in excess as a sweetening agent in foods or beverages, it may be associated with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders that are part of metabolic syndrome. === Compared with sucrose === Fructose was found to increase triglycerides in type-2 but not type-1 diabetes and moderate use of it has previously been considered acceptable as a sweetener for diabetics, possibly because it does not trigger the production of insulin by pancreatic β cells. For a 50 gram reference amount, fructose has a glycemic index of 23, compared with 100 for glucose and 60 for sucrose. Fructose is also 73% sweeter than sucrose at room temperature, allowing diabetics to use less of it per serving. Fructose consumed before a meal may reduce the glycemic response of the meal. Fructose-sweetened food and beverage products cause less of a rise in blood glucose levels than do those manufactured with either sucrose or glucose. == See also == Hereditary fructose intolerance Inverted sugar syrup == References == == External links == Media related to Fructose at Wikimedia Commons",Fructose,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.00021343429398257285), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.0002127659390680492), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.4741014838218689), ('ĠEND', -0.020948931574821472), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009346407605335116)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0002613358374219388), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL; ([foodinsight.org](https://foodinsight.org/what-is-fructose/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31166222/?utm_source=openai), [cosmeticsinfo.org](https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/fructose/?utm_source=openai), [fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/cpg-sec-400335-fructose-containing-drugs?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=445, start_index=42, title='What is Fructose? – Food Insight', type='url_citation', url='https://foodinsight.org/what-is-fructose/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=445, start_index=42, title='Endogenous fructose production: what do we know and how relevant is it?', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31166222/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=445, start_index=42, title='Fructose - Cosmetics Info', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/fructose/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=445, start_index=42, title='CPG Sec. 400.335 Fructose-Containing Drugs | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/cpg-sec-400335-fructose-containing-drugs?utm_source=openai')])"

This study evaluated the efficacy of balicatib (AAE581), a novel inhibitor of human cathepsin K, on bone mass and dynamic histomorphometric endpoints in ovariectomized monkeys. Eighty adult female Macaca fascicularis underwent bilateral ovariectomies and were dosed twice daily by oral gavage with balicatib at 0, 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg for 18 months (groups O, L, M, H, respectively). Approximately 1 month after treatment initiation, the 50 mg/kg dose was decreased to 30 mg/kg. Twenty animals underwent sham-ovariectomies (group S). Bone mass was measured at 3-6 month intervals. At 18 months, vertebra and femur were collected for histomorphometry. In both spine and femur, group O animals lost bone mineral density (BMD), and all other groups gained BMD between 0 and 18 months. In balicatib-treated animals, BMD change in the spine was intermediate between group S and O, with groups L and M significantly different from group O. In femur, all three doses of balicatib significantly increased BMD gain relative to group O, and group mean values were also higher than group S. Most histomorphometric indices of bone turnover in vertebra and femoral neck were significantly lower than group O with balicatib treatment, except that periosteal bone formation rates (Ps.BFR) were significantly higher. Ps.BFR in mid-femur was also significantly increased by treatment. Balicatib partially prevented ovariectomy-induced changes in bone mass, inhibited bone turnover at most sites, and had an unexpected stimulatory effect on periosteal bone formation. Drug-induced scleroderma has been rarely reported, mostly with the features of diffuse scleroderma or acrosclerosis, and exceptionally with the characteristics of morphea. We report the case of an adult white woman, enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentric trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the cathepsin K inhibitor balicatib for osteoporosis. Typical morphea lesions developed on the patient's trunk 9 months after the beginning of therapy. Lesions completely resolved after drug withdrawal and a single brief course of systemic steroids. No recurrence occurred in a 2-year follow-up. Fifteen cases of drug-induced morphea could be retrieved from the literature. Drug withdrawal determined complete remission in only a few patients.

2272,"('Oglufanide', 'H-glu-trp-oh', 'Glutamyl-l-tryptophan', 'Glu-trp', 'Thymogen')",Medical," Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a growth factor composed of 53 amino acids (6.2 kDa) and is secreted by ectodermic cells, monocytes, kidneys, and duodenal glands (1). EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF and at least seven other growth factors and their transmembrane receptor kinases play important roles in cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors: EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4) (2). HER1, HER3, and HER4 comprise three major functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. No ligand has been clearly identified for HER2; however, HER2 can be activated as a result of ligand binding to other HER receptors with the formation of receptor homodimers and/or heterodimers (3). HER1 and HER2 are overexpressed on many solid tumor cells such as breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (4-6). The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with poor patient prognosis because high levels are related to increased proliferation (7-10). Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG The management of chronic skin wounds represents a major therapeutic challenge. The synthesized dipeptide (Glu-Trp-ONa) and its acylated analogue (R-Glu-Trp-ONa) were assessed in the model of nonhealing dermal wounds in rabbits in relation to their healing properties in wound closure. Following wound modeling, the rabbits received a course of intraperitoneal injections of Glu-Trp-ONa or R-Glu-Trp-ONa. Phosphate-buffered saline and Solcoseryl® were applied as negative and positive control agents, respectively. An injection of Glu-Trp-ONa and R-Glu-Trp-ONa decreased the period of wound healing in animals in comparison to the control and Solcoseryl-treated groups. Acylation of Glu-Trp-ONa proved to be beneficial as related to the healing properties of the dipeptide. Subsequent zymography analyses showed that the applied peptides decreased the proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9, MMP-8, and MMP-2 in the early inflammatory phase and reversely increased the activity of MMP-9, MMP-8, and MMP-1 in the remodeling phase. Histological analyses of the wound sections (hematoxylin-eosin, Mallory's staining) confirmed the enhanced formation of granulation tissue and re-epithelialization in the experimental groups. By administering the peptides, wound closures increased significantly through the modulation of the MMPs' activity, indicating their role in wound healing.

It is a pale yellow, water soluble salt. == Preparation == Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate typically crystallizes from water as the trihydrate (CH3CH2)2NCS2Na·3H2O. The anhydrous salt and the trihydrate are often used interchangeably. Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate is obtained by treating carbon disulfide with diethylamine in the presence of sodium hydroxide: CS2 + HN(C2H5)2 + NaOH → NaS2CN(C2H5)2 + H2O Other dithiocarbamates can be prepared similarly from secondary amines and carbon disulfide. They are used as chelating agents for transition metal ions and as precursors to herbicides and vulcanization reagents. == Reactions == Oxidation of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate gives the disulfide, also called a thiuram disulfide (Et = ethyl): 2 NaS2CNEt2 + I2 → (S2CNEt2)2 + 2 NaI Dithiocarbamates are nucleophiles and thus can be alkylated. Even dichloromethane suffices: 2 NaS2CNEt2 + CH2Cl2 → CH2(S2CNEt2)2 + 2 NaCl Diethyldithiocarbamate reacts with many metal salts to give transition metal dithiocarbamate complexes. The ligands coordinate via the two sulfur atoms. Other more complicated bonding modes are known including binding as unidentate ligand and a bridging ligand using one or both sulfur atoms. == Laboratory and practical use == By the technique of spin trapping, complexes of dithiocarbamates with iron provide one of the very few methods to study the formation of nitric oxide (NO) radicals in biological materials. Although the lifetime of NO in tissues is too short to allow detection of this radical itself, NO readily binds to iron-dithiocarbamate complexes. The resulting mono-nitrosyl-iron complex (MNIC) is stable, and may be detected with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The zinc chelation of diethyldithiocarbamate inhibits metalloproteinases, which in turn prevents the degradation of extracellular matrix, an initial step in cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. Diethyldithiocarbamate inhibits superoxide dismutase, which can both have antioxidant and oxidant effects on cells, depending on the time of administration. == References == == Further reading == Cvek B, Dvorak Z (2007).

2276,"('Azathioprine', 'Bw 57-322', 'Imuran', 'Azothioprine', 'Azathioprin')",Medical,"Azathioprine, sold under the brand name Imuran, among others, is an immunosuppressive medication. It is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, and in kidney transplants to prevent rejection. It is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 human carcinogen. It is taken by mouth or injected into a vein. Common side effects include bone-marrow suppression and vomiting. Bone-marrow suppression is especially common in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase. Other serious risk factors include an increased risk of certain cancers. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Azathioprine belongs to the purine analogues subclass of antimetabolites family of medications. It works via 6-thioguanine to disrupt the making of RNA and DNA by cells. Azathioprine was first made in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2018, it was the 358th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Azathioprine is used alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection following organ transplantation, and to treat an array of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet's disease, and other forms of vasculitis, autoimmune hepatitis, atopic dermatitis, myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease), restrictive lung disease, and others. It is also an important therapy and steroid-sparing agent for inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and for multiple sclerosis. In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in kidney transplantation from human donors, and for rheumatoid arthritis. === Transplantation === Azathioprine is used to prevent rejections of kidney or liver allografts, usually in conjunction with other therapies, including corticosteroids, other immunosuppressants, and local radiation therapy. The administration protocol starts either at the time of transplantation or within the following two days. === Rheumatoid arthritis === Being a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), azathioprine has been used for the management of the signs and symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids may be combined or continued (if they were already in use) with azathioprine, but the combination with other DMARDs is not recommended. === Inflammatory bowel disease === Azathioprine has been used in the management of moderate to severe chronically active Crohn's disease, to maintain clinical remission (absence of disease activity) in corticosteroid-dependent patients, and to provide benefit in people with fistulizing Crohn's disease. The onset of action is slow, and several months may be required to achieve a clinical response. Azathioprine treatment is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, but whether this is due to the drug or a predisposition related to Crohn's disease is unclear. Lower doses of azathioprine are used as a therapy in children with refractory or corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease, without causing many side effects. It may also be used to prevent flares in those with ulcerative colitis. === Others === Azathioprine is sometimes used in systemic lupus erythematosus, requiring a maintenance dose of 15 mg or higher of prednisone in those who experience recurrent flares. It is used as an add-on therapy when steroid therapy is given by mouth for pemphigus and myasthenia gravis, as a ""steroid-sparing"" agent. Azathioprine is also used to maintain remission in people who have granulomatosis with polyangiitis. It can be very effective in eczema and atopic dermatitis, though it is not commonly used. The British National Eczema Society lists it as a third-line treatment for severe to moderate cases of these skin diseases. It was widely used to treat multiple sclerosis until the first half of the 1990s. Concerns about increased risk of malignancy have led to a decreased use, yet it is still used in maintenance treatment for people who frequently relapse. A 2007 Cochrane review found that azathioprine reduced the number of relapses in the first year of treatment and disease progression in the first two to three years and did not find an increase in cancer, and noted the need for direct comparison of azathioprine and interferon beta, conflicting conclusions regarding cancer, and the potential for long-term risks. A widely used therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was azathioprine in combination with prednisone and N-acetylcysteine. A 2012 study showed that this combination produced worse outcomes than a placebo. == Adverse effects == Nausea and vomiting are common adverse effects, especially at the beginning of treatment. Such cases are met with taking azathioprine after meals or transient intravenous administration. Side effects that are probably hypersensitivity reactions include dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, and rashes. Hair loss is often seen in transplant patients receiving the drug but rarely occurs under other indications. Because azathioprine suppresses the bone marrow, patients can develop anaemia and be more susceptible to infection; regular monitoring of the blood count is recommended during treatment. Acute pancreatitis can also occur, especially in patients with Crohn's disease. Treatment is discontinued in up to 30% of patients due these effects, but therapeutic drug monitoring of the biologically active metabolites, i.e. thiopurine nucleotides, can help to optimize the efficacy and safety. Clinically, most hospitals resort to ion-exchange LC-MS (liquid chromotography – mass spectrometry), but the newly developed approach of porous graphitic carbon-based chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry appears superior with respect to patient care in this respect. It is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to humans). === Pharmacogenetics === The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine's mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that azathioprine undergoes in the body is the conversion to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP; see Pharmacokinetics), which is itself an immunosuppressant prodrug. The TPMT enzyme is responsible, in part, for the methylation of 6-MP into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine – this methylation prevents 6-MP from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and an increased risk of severe bone-marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving azathioprine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT enzyme activity, allowing for the adjustment of azathioprine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for azathioprine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for myelotoxicity. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care. Missense SNP in NUDT15 (e.g., rs116855232, inducing R139C)) has been identified to be a causal factor for AZA-induced leukopenia through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in East Asians. === Cancers === Azathioprine is listed as a human carcinogen in the 12th Report on Carcinogens by the National Toxicology Program of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, asserting that it is ""known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans."" Since August 2009, the U.S. FDA has required warnings to be placed on packaging with respect to increased risks of certain cancers. The risks involved seem to be related both to the duration and the dosage used. People who have previously been treated with an alkylating agent may have an excessive risk of cancers if treated with azathioprine. Epidemiological studies by International Agency for Research on Cancer have provided ""sufficient"" evidence of azathioprine carcinogenicity in humans (group 1), although the methodology of past studies and the possible underlying mechanisms are questioned. The various diseases requiring transplantation may in themselves increase the risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, hepatobiliary carcinomas, and mesenchymal tumours to which azathioprine may add additional risks. Those receiving azathioprine for rheumatoid arthritis may have a lower risk than those undergoing transplantation. Cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma – a rare type of lymphoma – have been reported in patients treated with azathioprine. The majority occurred in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Adolescents and young adult males were the majority of cases. They presented with a very aggressive disease course, and with one exception, died of the lymphoma. The FDA has required changes to the labeling to inform users and clinicians of the issue. ==== Skin cancers ==== In transplant patients, skin cancer is 50 to 250 times more common than in the general population, and between 60 and 90% of patients are affected 20 years after transplantation. The use of immunosuppressive medication including azathioprine in organ transplantation has been linked to increased rates of developing skin cancer. Azathioprine causes the accumulation of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) in patients' DNA, which might trigger cancer when the patient is later exposed to ultraviolet light. Patients taking azathioprine were found to be abnormally sensitive to UVA light. == Overdose == Large, single doses are generally well tolerated; a patient who took 7.5 g azathioprine (150 tablets) at once showed no relevant symptoms apart from vomiting, slightly decreased white blood cell count, and marginal changes in liver function parameters. The main symptoms of long-term overdosing are infections of unclear origin, mouth ulcers, and spontaneous bleeding, all of which are consequences of its bone-marrow suppression. == Interactions == Other purine analogues, such as allopurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that breaks down azathioprine, thus increasing the toxicity of azathioprine. Low doses of allopurinol, though, have been shown to safely enhance the efficacy of azathioprine, especially in inflammatory bowel disease nonresponders. This may still lead to lower lymphocyte counts and higher rates of infection, so the combination requires careful monitoring. Azathioprine decreases the effects of the anticoagulant warfarin and of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, but increases the effect of depolarizing muscle relaxants. It can also interfere with niacin (vitamin B3), resulting in at least one case to pellagra and fatal medullary aplasia. == Pregnancy and breastfeeding == Azathioprine can cause birth defects. A 2003 population-based study in Denmark showed that the use of azathioprine and related mercaptopurine resulted in a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities, as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. Birth defects in a child whose father was taking azathioprine have also been reported. Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have taken place in humans, when given to animals in doses equivalent to human dosages, teratogenesis was observed. Transplant patients already on this drug should not discontinue on becoming pregnant. This contrasts with the later-developed drugs tacrolimus and mycophenolate, which are contraindicated during pregnancy. Traditionally, as for all cytotoxic drugs, the manufacturer advises not to breastfeed whilst taking azathioprine, but the ""lactation risk category"" reported by Thomas Hale in his book Medications and Mothers' Milk lists azathioprine as ""L3"", termed ""moderately safe"". == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === Azathioprine is absorbed from the gut to about 88%. Bioavailability varies greatly between individual patients, between 30 and 90%, because the drug is partly inactivated in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations, counting not only the drug itself, but also its metabolites, are reached after 1–2 hours, and the average plasma half-life is 26 to 80 minutes for azathioprine and 3–5 hours for drug plus metabolites; 20 to 30% are bound to plasma proteins while circulating in the bloodstream. Azathioprine is a prodrug, a substance that is not an active drug itself but is activated in the body. This happens in several steps; at first, it is slowly and almost completely converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) by reductive cleavage of the thioether (–S–). This is mediated by glutathione and similar compounds in the intestinal wall, the liver, and on red blood cells, without the aid of enzymes. 6-MP is metabolized analogously to natural purines, giving thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP) and thiodeoxyguanosine triphosphate (TdGTP) via thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP) and several further intermediates. On a second path, the sulfur atom of 6-MP and TIMP is methylated. The end products of azathioprine metabolism are thiouric acid (38%) and various methylated and hydroxylated purines, which are excreted via the urine. === Mechanism of action === Azathioprine inhibits purine synthesis. Purines are needed to produce DNA and RNA. By inhibiting purine synthesis, less DNA and RNA are produced for the synthesis of white blood cells, thus causing immunosuppression. Azathioprine is converted within tissues to 6-MP, some of which is converted, in turn, to 6-thioguanine by the addition of an amino group. Both 6-MP and 6-thioguanine are conjugated with ribose and then phosphorylated to form the nucleotides thioinosinic acid and thioguanylic acid, respectively. These nucleotides masquerade, respectively, as inosinic acid and guanylic acid; the former is the starting point for purine nucleotide biosynthesis, while the latter is one of the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The nucleotides are incorporated into newly synthesized (but nonfunctional) DNA, halting replication. The nucleotides act to inhibit glutamine-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (GPAT), one of the enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis, one of the earlier steps in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. They achieve GPAT inhibition through a form of negative feedback called product inhibition. Because actively replicating cells (such as cancer cells and the T cells and B cells of the immune system) are most active in synthesizing purine, making new DNA, these cells are most strongly affected. A portion of the nucleotides is additionally phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms. These bind to GTP-binding protein Rac1, blocking synthesis of the protein Bcl-xL, thus sending activated T cells and mononuclear cells into apoptosis (programmed cell death). Increased apoptosis of mononuclear cells is seen in inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with azathioprine. == Chemistry == Azathioprine is a thiopurine linked to a second heterocycle (an imidazole derivative) via a thioether. It is a pale yellow solid with a slightly bitter taste and a melting point of 238–245 °C. It is practically insoluble in water and only slightly soluble in lipophilic solvents such as chloroform, ethanol, and diethyl ether. It dissolves in alkaline aqueous solutions, where it hydrolyzes to 6-MP. Azathioprine is synthesized from 5-chloro-1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole and 6-mercaptopurine in dimethyl sulfoxide. The synthesis of the former starts with an amide from methylamine and diethyl oxalate, which is then cyclized and chlorinated with phosphorus pentachloride; the nitro group is introduced with nitric and sulfuric acid. == History == Azathioprine was synthesized by George Herbert Hitchings and Gertrude Elion in 1957 (named BW 57-322) to produce 6-MP in a metabolically active, but masked form, and at first used as a chemotherapy drug. Robert Schwartz investigated the effect of 6-MP on the immune response in 1958 and discovered that it profoundly suppresses the formation of antibodies when given to rabbits together with antigens. Following the work done by Sir Peter Medawar and Gertrude Elion in discovering the immunological basis of rejection of transplanted tissues and organs, and Schwartz's researches on 6-MP, Sir Roy Calne, the British pioneer in transplantation, introduced 6-MP as an experimental immunosuppressant for kidney and heart transplants. When Calne asked Elion for related compounds to investigate, she suggested azathioprine, which was subsequently found out to be superior (as effective and less toxic to the bone marrow) by Calne. In April 1962, with regimens consisting of azathioprine and prednisone, the transplantation of kidneys to unrelated recipients (allotransplantation) was successful for the first time. For many years, this kind of dual therapy with azathioprine and glucocorticoids was the standard antirejection regimen, until cyclosporin was introduced into clinical practice (by Calne as well) in 1978. Cyclosporin has now replaced some of the azathioprine use due to a longer survival time, especially in heart-related transplantations. Moreover, despite being considerably more expensive, mycophenolate mofetil is also increasingly being used in place of azathioprine in organ transplantation, as it is associated with less bone-marrow suppression, fewer opportunistic infections, and a lower incidence of acute rejection. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2012).

Topoisomerase I is an enzyme that mediates reversible single-strand breaks in DNA during DNA replication. == References ==",Camtobell,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006404255982488394), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004119601100683212)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
