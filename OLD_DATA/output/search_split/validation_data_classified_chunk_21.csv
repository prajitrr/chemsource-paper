This derivative of the sugar glucose was formerly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. == History == Throughout history, gold was used to cure diseases, although the efficacy was not established. In 1935, gold drugs were reported to be effective for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Although many patients reacted positively to the drug, gold thioglucose was not uniformly effective. Only one gold drug remains in active clinical use for this purpose in the United States: auranofin although sodium aurothiomalate (gold sodium thiomalate) and aurothioglucose were still used until recently. In the United Kingdom, only sodium aurothiomalate and auranofin were used recently. In 2001, aurothioglucose was withdrawn from the Dutch market, where it had been the only injectable gold preparation available since 1943, forcing hospitals to change medication for a large number of patients to aurothiomalate. The drug had been in use for more than 70 years, and four years later the reasons for its sudden disappearance remained unclear. It was recently discontinued from the US market along with sodium aurothiomalate leaving only Auranofin as the only gold salt on the US market == Medicinal chemistry == Gold thioglucose features gold in the oxidation state of +I, like other gold thiolates. It is a water-soluble, non-ionic species that is assumed to exist as a polymer. Under physiological conditions, an oxidation-reduction reaction leads to the formation of metallic gold and sulfinic acid derivative of thioglucose. 2 AuSTg → 2 Au + TgSSTg TgSSTg + H2O → TgSOH + TgSH 2 TgSOH → TgSO2H + TgSH Overall: 2 H2O + 4 AuSTg → 4 Au + TgSO2H + 3 TgSH (where AuSTg = gold thioglucose, TgSSTg = thioglucose disulfide, TgSO2H = sulfinic acid derivative of thioglucose) == Preparation == Gold thioglucose can be prepared by treating gold bromide with thioglucose solution saturated with sulfur dioxide. Gold thioglucose is precipitated with methanol and recrystallized with water and methanol. == Miscellaneous observations == In recent research, it was found that injection of gold thioglucose induces obesity in mice. Aurothioglucose has an interaction with the antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine. == See also == Auranofin == References == == External links == Media related to Aurothioglucose at Wikimedia Commons",Gold thioglucose,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.14268682897090912), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.007733642123639584), ('ICAL', -1.3232143828645349e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.474115788936615)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.38687241077423096), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurothioglucose,https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/gold%20thioglucose,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gold-compound-oral-route-parenteral-route/description/drg-20069410 ', [])"
2083,"('Hydroxytyrosol', 'Beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyl alcohol', 'Dihydroxyphenylethanol', 'Dopaol', 'Ba2774')","Food, Medical","Hydroxytyrosol is an organic compound with the formula (HO)2C6H3CH2CH2OH. It is a phenylethanoid, i.e. a relative of phenethyl alcohol. Its derivatives are found in a variety of natural sources, notably olive oils and wines. Hydroxytyrosol is a colorless solid, although samples often turn beige during storage. It is a derivative, formally speaking, of catechol. Hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives occur in olives and in wines. == Occurrence == === Olives === The olives, leaves, and olive pulp contain large amounts of hydroxytyrosol derivative oleuropein, more so than olive oil. Unprocessed, green (unripe) olives contain between 4.3 and 116 mg of hydroxytyrosol per 100 g of olives, while unprocessed, black (ripe) olives contain up to 413.3 mg per 100 g. The ripening of an olive substantially increases the amount of hydroxytyrosol. Processed olives, such as the common canned variety containing iron(II) gluconate, contain little hydroxytyrosol, as iron salts are catalysts for its oxidation. === Food safety === Hydroxytyrosol is considered safe as a novel food for human consumption, with a no-observed-adverse-effect level of 50 mg/kg body weight per day, as evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In the United States, hydroxytyrosol is considered to be a safe ingredient (GRAS) in processed foods at levels of 5 mg per serving. === Function and production === In nature, hydroxytyrosol is generated by the hydrolysis of oleuropein that occurs during olive ripening. Oleuropein accumulates in olive leaves and fruit as a defense mechanism against pathogens and herbivores. During olive ripening or when the olive tissue is damaged by pathogens, herbivores, or mechanical damage, the enzyme β-glucosidase catalyzes hydroxytyrosol synthesis via hydrolysis from oleuropein. === Metabolism === Shortly after olive oil consumption, 98% of hydroxytyrosol in plasma and urine appears in conjugated forms (65% glucuronoconjugates), suggesting extensive first-past metabolism and a half-life of 2.43 hours. == Mediterranean diet == Mediterranean diets, characterized by regular intake of olive oil, have been shown to positively affect human health, including reduced rates of cardiovascular diseases. Research on consumption of olive oil and its components includes hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein, which may inhibit oxidation of LDL cholesterol – a risk factor for atherosclerosis, heart attack or stroke. The daily intake of hydroxytyrosol within the Mediterranean diet is estimated to be between 0.15 and 30 mg. == Regulation == === Europe === The EFSA has issued a scientific opinion on health claims in relation to dietary consumption of hydroxytyrosol and related polyphenol compounds from olive fruit and oil, and protection of blood lipids from potential oxidative damage. EFSA concluded that a cause-and-effect relationship existed between the consumption of hydroxytyrosol and related compounds from olives and olive oil and protection of blood lipids from oxidative damage, providing a health claim for consumption of olive oil polyphenols containing at least 5 mg of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives (oleuropein complex and tyrosol) per 20 g of olive oil. == See also == Echinacoside, a hydroxytyrosol-containing glycoside Tyrosol Verbascoside, another hydroxytyrosol-containing glycoside Resveratrol == References ==",Dihydroxyphenylethanol,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -3.333223139634356e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.008163419552147388), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.029776105657219887), ('ĠEND', -0.08663083612918854), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10031797736883163)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.31326285004615784), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([chembk.com](https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/3%2C4-Dihydroxyphenylethanol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=114, start_index=21, title='3,4-Dihydroxyphenylethanol', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/3%2C4-Dihydroxyphenylethanol?utm_source=openai')])"
2084,"('Rotenone', 'Dactinol', 'Paraderil', 'Barbasco', 'Tubatoxin')",Medical,"Rotenone is an odorless, colorless, crystalline isoflavone. It occurs naturally in the seeds and stems of several plants, such as the jicama vine, and in the roots of several other members of the Fabaceae. It was the first-described member of the family of chemical compounds known as rotenoids. Rotenone is approved for use as a piscicide to remove alien fish species, see Uses. It has also been used as a broad-spectrum insecticide, but its use as an insecticide has been banned in many countries. == Discovery == The earliest written record of the now-known rotenone-containing plants used for killing leaf-eating caterpillars was in 1848; for centuries, these same plants had been used to poison fish. The active chemical component was first isolated in 1895 by a French botanist, Emmanuel Geoffroy, who called it nicouline, from a specimen of Robinia nicou, now called Deguelia utilis, while traveling in French Guiana. He wrote about this research in his thesis, published in 1895 after his death from a parasitic disease. In 1902 Kazuo Nagai, Japanese chemical engineer of the Government-General of Taiwan, isolated a pure crystalline compound from Derris elliptica which he called rotenone, after the Taiwanese name of the plant 蘆藤 (Min Nan Chinese: lôo-tîn) translated into Japanese rōten (ローテン). By 1930, nicouline and rotenone were established to be chemically the same. == Uses == === Use as piscicide in fisheries management === When absorbed through the gills, rotenone disrupts cellular respiration in fish, and may lead to their death, depending on the concentration used. Due to this, it has become a key tool in managing ecosystems affected by invasive or unwanted fish species, and as of 2024 there are no viable options that can replace its versatile value in fish removal actions. Its value in ecosystem restoration is appreciated due to its rapid degradation, when exposed to light and warm temperatures, making it a temporary measure with minimal long-term environmental effects, see Rotenone and Ecosystem Impact. Rotenone is used as a nonselective piscicide (fish killer). Rotenone has historically been used by indigenous peoples to catch fish. Typically, rotenone-containing plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, are crushed and introduced into a body of water, and as rotenone interferes with cellular respiration, the affected fish rise to the surface, where they are more easily caught. In modern times it is frequently used as a tool to remove alien fish species, as it has a relatively short half-life (days) and is gone from rivers in the course of days and from lakes within a few months, depending on (seasonal) stirring, organic content, availability of sunlight and temperature. Rotenone has been used by government agencies to kill fish in rivers and lakes in the United States since 1952, and in Canada and Norway since the 1980s. It is less frequently used in EU countries, due to strict regulations, but has seen some use in selected countries such as the UK (Topmouth gudgeon), Sweden (pike and pumpkinseed), Spain (Topmouth gudgeon, Gambusia) and Hungary (Prussian carp). Rotenone has also seen some use in other field studies in the marine environment needing only small quantities. Small-scale sampling with rotenone is used by fish researchers studying the biodiversity of marine fishes to collect cryptic, or hidden, fishes, which represent an important component of shoreline fish communities, since it has only minor, local and transient environmental side effects. ==== Rotenone degradation and ecosystem impact ==== Rotenone primarily affects gilled organisms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates. Terrestrial animals such as birds, mammals, and amphibians (except tadpoles/larvae) are much less affected by rotenone. When applied in freshwater systems, the treatment dose kills the target fish and usually other gilled species like tadpoles and zooplankton are affected, depending on dosage. However, timing treatments in the fall or winter, when many species are less active, can reduce these impacts. Some taxa may also recover through natural life cycles, such as resting eggs. Its use is more benign for the environment (as compared to drying ponds, or using other piscicides), and studies show that most ecosystems naturally recover within one or two years after rotenone application- with aquatic invertebrates repopulating affected areas, thus restoring initial local biodiversity to its status prior to the introduction of the invasive species. Rotenone decays through metabolites and its final product is reduced to water and carbon dioxide. It oxidizes to rotenolone, which is about an order of magnitude less toxic than rotenone. In water, the rate of decomposition depends upon several factors, including temperature, pH, water hardness and sunlight. The half-life of rotenone in a pond of 1.1 mean depth ranged from half a day at 24 °C to 3.5 days at 0 °C, but in deeper oligotrophic systems (thus less degradation due to sunlight and organic content) the half-life may be considerably longer. ==== Notable administrations as piscicide ==== Norwegian authorities have been using rotenone since the mid-1980s to eradicate the salmon fluke Gyrodactylus salaris, and as of 2024 48 out of 54 affected river catchments have been treated. Additionally, many lakes and ponds have been rotenone treated in an effort to remove national or regional invasive species, such as Northern pike, roach, minnow, crucian carp, Tench and perch. In 1992, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) officials used rotenone to eradicate an established population of invasive jaguar cichlids from a small pond in Miami-Dade County. Officials were successful in killing every jaguar cichlid (along with every other fish) in the pond, but unsuccessful in eradicating them from Florida; the cichlids had already spread throughout the Miami Canal and its connected waterways, and by 1994, jaguar cichlids had successfully established themselves throughout Southern and Central Florida. In September 2010, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife officials used rotenone to kill an established population of invasive goldfish present in eastern Oregon's Mann Lake, with the intention of not disrupting the lake's native Lahontan cutthroat trout population. Rotenone successfully achieved these aims, killing between 179,000–197,000 goldfish and fathead minnows, and only three trout. Beginning May 1, 2006, Panguitch Lake, a reservoir in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Utah, was treated with rotenone, to potentially eradicate and control the invasive population of Utah chub, which were probably introduced accidentally by anglers who used them as live bait. The lake was restocked with 20,000 rainbow trout in 2006; as of 2016, the lake's fish population has recovered. In 2012, rotenone was used to kill all remaining fish in Stormy Lake (Alaska) due to invasive pike destroying native species, which were reintroduced once the treatment was concluded. In 2014, rotenone was used to kill all remaining fish in San Francisco's Mountain Lake, which is located in Mountain Lake Park, in order to rid it of invasive species introduced since the migration of European settlers to the region. ==== Deactivation ==== Rotenone can be deactivated in water with the use of potassium permanganate to lower toxicity to acceptable levels. === Use as insecticide === Rotenone was commercialized as cubé, tuba, or derris, in single preparation or in synergistic combination with other insecticides. It has high acute toxicity to mammals, and all insecticidal uses were banned in the United States and Canada, in the EU, in the UK, and in Switzerland. It remains legal as a pesticide in a number of other countries, including Australia and New Zealand; the status and effective date of ban in select countries is provided in the table below. Rotenone was used in powdered form to treat scabies and head lice on humans, and parasitic mites on chickens, livestock, and pet animals. In agriculture it was unselective in action and killed potato beetles, cucumber beetles, flea beetles, cabbage worms, raspberry beetles, and asparagus beetles, as well as most other arthropods. It biodegrades rapidly in soil, with 90% degraded after 1–3 months at 20 °C (68 °F) and three times faster at 30 °C (86 °F). The compound decomposes when exposed to sunlight and usually has an activity of six days in the environment. == Mechanism of action == Rotenone works by interfering with the electron transport chain within complex I in mitochondria, which places it in IRAC MoA class 21 (by itself in 21B). It inhibits the transfer of electrons from iron-sulfur centers in complex I to ubiquinone. This interferes with NADH during the creation of usable cellular energy (ATP). Complex I is unable to pass off its electron to CoQ, creating a back-up of electrons within the mitochondrial matrix. Cellular oxygen is reduced to the radical, creating reactive oxygen species, which can damage DNA and other components of the mitochondria. Rotenone is used in biomedical research to study the oxygen consumption rate of cells, usually in combination with antimycin A (an electron transport chain Complex III inhibitor), oligomycin (an ATP synthase inhibitor) and FCCP (a mitochondrial uncoupler). Rotenone also inhibits microtubule assembly. == Presence in plants == Rotenone is produced by extraction from the roots and stems of several tropical and subtropical plant species, especially those belonging to the genera Lonchocarpus and Derris. Some of the plants containing rotenone: Hoary pea or goat's rue (Tephrosia virginiana) – North America Jícama (Pachyrhizus erosus) – North America Cubé plant or lancepod (Lonchocarpus utilis) – South America The root extract is referred to as cubé resin Barbasco (Lonchocarpus urucu) – South America The root extract is referred to as cubé resin Tuba plant (Derris elliptica) – southeast Asia and southwest Pacific islands The root extract is referred to as derris or derris root Jewel vine (Derris involuta) – southeast Asia and southwest Pacific islands The root extract is referred to as derris or derris root Common Mullein (Verbascum thapsus L.) Cork-bush (Mundulea sericea) – southern Africa Florida fishpoison tree (Piscidia piscipula) – southern Florida, Caribbean Several species of Millettia and Tephrosia in South-east Asian regions == Mammalian toxicity == Rotenone is classified by the World Health Organization as moderately hazardous. It is mildly toxic to humans and other mammals, but extremely toxic to insects and aquatic life, including fish. This higher toxicity in fish and insects is because the lipophilic rotenone is easily taken up through the gills or trachea, but not as easily through the skin or the gastrointestinal tract. Rotenone is toxic to erythrocytes in vitro. The lowest lethal dose for a child is not known, but death occurred in a 3.5-year-old child who had ingested 40 mg/kg rotenone solution. Human deaths from rotenone poisoning are rare because its irritating action causes vomiting. Deliberate ingestion of rotenone can be fatal. A 2018 study, which examined the effects of rotenone administration on cell cultures that mimicked properties of developing brains, found that rotenone may be a developmental neurotoxicant; that is, that rotenone exposure in the developing fetus may impede proper human brain development, with potentially profound consequences later in life. The study found that rotenone was particularly damaging to dopaminergic neurons, consistent with prior findings. === Parkinson's disease === In 2000, injecting rotenone into rats was reported to cause the development of symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease (PD). Rotenone was continuously applied over a period of five weeks, mixed with DMSO and PEG to enhance tissue penetration, and injected into the jugular vein. The study does not directly suggest rotenone exposure is responsible for PD in humans, but is consistent with the belief that chronic exposure to environmental toxins increases the likelihood of the disease. In 2011, a US National Institutes of Health study showed a link between rotenone use and Parkinson's disease in farm workers, suggesting a link between neural damage and pulmonary uptake by not using protective gear. Exposure to the chemical in the field can be avoided by wearing a gas mask with filter, which is standard HSE procedure in modern application of the chemical. Studies with primary cultures of rat neurons and microglia have shown low doses of rotenone (below 10 nM) induce oxidative damage and death of dopaminergic neurons, and it is these neurons in the substantia nigra that die in Parkinson's disease. Another study has also described toxic action of rotenone at low concentrations (5 nM) in dopaminergic neurons from acute rat brain slices. This toxicity was exacerbated by an additional cell stressor – elevated intracellular calcium concentration – adding support to the 'multiple hit hypothesis' of dopaminergic neuron death. The neurotoxin MPTP had been known earlier to cause PD-like symptoms (in humans and other primates, though not in rats) by interfering with complex I in the electron transport chain and killing dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Further studies involving MPTP have failed to show development of Lewy bodies, a key component to PD pathology. However at least one study recently has found evidence of protein aggregation of the same chemical makeup as that which makes up Lewy bodies with similar pathology to Parkinson's disease in aged rhesus monkeys from MPTP. Therefore, the mechanism behind MPTP as it relates to Parkinson's disease is not fully understood. Because of these developments, rotenone was investigated as a possible Parkinson-causing agent. Both MPTP and rotenone are lipophilic and can cross the blood–brain barrier. In 2010, a study was published detailing the progression of Parkinson's-like symptoms in mice following chronic intragastric ingestion of low doses of rotenone. The concentrations in the central nervous system were below detectable limits, yet still induced PD pathology. == See also == Fenpropathrin NADH dehydrogenase == References == == External links == Rotenone, Molecule of the Month at chm.bris.ac.uk Cornell University.

In contrast, KIV was ineffective in altering the phosphorylating system associated with IF proteins at all ages examined. A similar effect on IF phosphorylation was achieved by incubating cortical slices with gamma-aminobutiric acid (GABA). Furthermore, by using specific GABA antagonists, we verified that KMV induced a stimulatory effect on IF phosphorylation of tissue slices from 12-day-old rats mediated by GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors. In conclusion, our results indicate the involvement of the GABAergic system in the alterations of IF phosphorylation caused by KMV, one of the branched-chain keto acids accumulating in MSUD.

2087,"('Lactic acid', '(r)-2-hydroxypropionic acid', '(r)-lactic acid', '(r)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid', '(2r)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Lactic acid is an organic acid. It has the molecular formula C3H6O3. It is white in the solid state and it is miscible with water. When in the dissolved state, it forms a colorless solution. Production includes both artificial synthesis as well as natural sources. Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) due to the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group. It is used as a synthetic intermediate in many organic synthesis industries and in various biochemical industries. The conjugate base of lactic acid is called lactate (or the lactate anion). The name of the derived acyl group is lactoyl. In solution, it can ionize by a loss of a proton to produce the lactate ion CH3CH(OH)CO−2. Compared to acetic acid, its pKa is 1 unit less, meaning lactic acid is ten times more acidic than acetic acid. This higher acidity is the consequence of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the α-hydroxyl and the carboxylate group. Lactic acid is chiral, consisting of two enantiomers. One is known as L-lactic acid, (S)-lactic acid, or (+)-lactic acid, and the other, its mirror image, is D-lactic acid, (R)-lactic acid, or (−)-lactic acid. A mixture of the two in equal amounts is called DL-lactic acid, or racemic lactic acid. Lactic acid is hygroscopic. DL-Lactic acid is miscible with water and with ethanol above its melting point, which is about 16 to 18 °C (61 to 64 °F). D-Lactic acid and L-lactic acid have a higher melting point. Lactic acid produced by fermentation of milk is often racemic, although certain species of bacteria produce solely D-lactic acid. On the other hand, lactic acid produced by fermentation in animal muscles has the (L) enantiomer and is sometimes called ""sarcolactic"" acid, from the Greek sarx, meaning ""flesh"". In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal, which is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, concentration and isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1–2 mMTooltip millimolar at rest, but can rise to over 20 mM during intense exertion and as high as 25 mM afterward. In addition to other biological roles, L-lactic acid is the primary endogenous agonist of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCA1), which is a Gi/o-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In industry, lactic acid fermentation is performed by lactic acid bacteria, which convert simple carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, or galactose to lactic acid. These bacteria can also grow in the mouth; the acid they produce is responsible for the tooth decay known as cavities. In medicine, lactate is one of the main components of lactated Ringer's solution and Hartmann's solution. These intravenous fluids consist of sodium and potassium cations along with lactate and chloride anions in solution with distilled water, generally in concentrations isotonic with human blood. It is most commonly used for fluid resuscitation after blood loss due to trauma, surgery, or burns. Lactic acid is produced in human tissues when the demand for oxygen is limited by the supply. This occurs during tissue ischemia when the flow of blood is limited as in sepsis or hemorrhagic shock. It may also occur when demand for oxygen is high such as with intense exercise. The process of lactic acidosis produces lactic acid which results in an oxygen debt which can be resolved or repaid when tissue oxygenation improves. == History == Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first person to isolate lactic acid in 1780 from sour milk. The name reflects the lact- combining form derived from the Latin word lac, meaning ""milk"". In 1808, Jöns Jacob Berzelius discovered that lactic acid (actually L-lactate) is also produced in muscles during exertion. Its structure was established by Johannes Wislicenus in 1873. In 1856, the role of Lactobacillus in the synthesis of lactic acid was discovered by Louis Pasteur. This pathway was used commercially by the German pharmacy Boehringer Ingelheim in 1895. In 2006, global production of lactic acid reached 275,000 tonnes with an average annual growth of 10%. == Production == Lactic acid is produced industrially by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates, or by chemical synthesis from acetaldehyde. As of 2009, lactic acid was produced predominantly (70–90%) by fermentation. Production of racemic lactic acid consisting of a 1:1 mixture of D and L stereoisomers, or of mixtures with up to 99.9% L-lactic acid, is possible by microbial fermentation. Industrial scale production of D-lactic acid by fermentation is possible, but much more challenging. === Fermentative production === Fermented milk products are obtained industrially by fermentation of milk or whey by Lactobacillus bacteria: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei (Lactobacillus casei), Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lactobacillus bulgaricus), Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis , Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (Streptococcus thermophilus). As a starting material for industrial production of lactic acid, almost any carbohydrate source containing C5 (Pentose sugar) and C6 (Hexose sugar) can be used. Pure sucrose, glucose from starch, raw sugar, and beet juice are frequently used. Lactic acid producing bacteria can be divided in two classes: homofermentative bacteria like Lactobacillus casei and Lactococcus lactis, producing two moles of lactate from one mole of glucose, and heterofermentative species producing one mole of lactate from one mole of glucose as well as carbon dioxide and acetic acid/ethanol. === Chemical production === Racemic lactic acid is synthesized industrially by reacting acetaldehyde with hydrogen cyanide and hydrolysing the resultant lactonitrile. When hydrolysis is performed by hydrochloric acid, ammonium chloride forms as a by-product; the Japanese company Musashino is one of the last big manufacturers of lactic acid by this route. Synthesis of both racemic and enantiopure lactic acids is also possible from other starting materials (vinyl acetate, glycerol, etc.) by application of catalytic procedures. == Biology == === Molecular biology === L-Lactic acid is the primary endogenous agonist of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCA1), a Gi/o-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). === Metabolism and exercise === During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate, and lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise. The production of lactate is beneficial for NAD+ regeneration (pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD+), which is used up in oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during production of pyruvate from glucose, and this ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. During intense exercise, the respiratory chain cannot keep up with the amount of hydrogen ions that join to form NADH, and cannot regenerate NAD+ quickly enough, so pyruvate is converted to lactate to allow energy production by glycolysis to continue. The resulting lactate can be used in two ways: Oxidation back to pyruvate by well-oxygenated muscle cells, heart cells, and brain cells Pyruvate is then directly used to fuel the Krebs cycle Conversion to glucose via gluconeogenesis in the liver and release back into circulation by means of the Cori cycle If blood glucose concentrations are high, the glucose can be used to build up the liver's glycogen stores. Lactate is continually formed at rest and during all exercise intensities. Lactate serves as a metabolic fuel being produced and oxidatively disposed in resting and exercising muscle and other tissues. Some sources of excess lactate production are metabolism in red blood cells, which lack mitochondria that perform aerobic respiration, and limitations in the rates of enzyme activity in muscle fibers during intense exertion. Lactic acidosis is a physiological condition characterized by accumulation of lactate (especially L-lactate), with formation of an excessively high proton concentration [H+] and correspondingly low pH in the tissues, a form of metabolic acidosis. The first stage in metabolizing glucose is glycolysis, the conversion of glucose to pyruvate− and H+: C6H12O6 + 2 NAD+ + 2 ADP3− + 2 HPO2−4 → 2 CH3COCO−2 + 2 H+ + 2 NADH + 2 ATP4− + 2 H2O When sufficient oxygen is present for aerobic respiration, the pyruvate is oxidized to CO2 and water by the Krebs cycle, in which oxidative phosphorylation generates ATP for use in powering the cell. When insufficient oxygen is present, or when there is insufficient capacity for pyruvate oxidation to keep up with rapid pyruvate production during intense exertion, the pyruvate is converted to lactate− by lactate dehydrogenase), a process that absorbs these protons: 2 CH3COCO−2 + 2 H+ + 2 NADH → 2 CH3CH(OH)CO−2 + 2 NAD+ The combined effect is: C6H12O6 + 2 ADP3− + 2HPO2−4 → 2 CH3CH(OH)CO−2 + 2 ATP4− + 2 H2O The production of lactate from glucose (glucose → 2 lactate− + 2 H+), when viewed in isolation, releases two H+. The H+ are absorbed in the production of ATP, but H+ is subsequently released during hydrolysis of ATP: ATP4− + H2O → ADP3− + HPO2−4 + H+ Once the production and use of ATP is included, the overall reaction is C6H12O6 → 2 CH3CH(OH)CO−2 + 2 H+ The resulting increase in acidity persists until the excess lactate and protons are converted back to pyruvate, and then to glucose for later use, or to CO2 and water for the production of ATP. === Neural tissue energy source === Although glucose is usually assumed to be the main energy source for living tissues, there is evidence that lactate, in preference to glucose, is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brains of several mammalian species that include mice, rats, and humans. According to the lactate-shuttle hypothesis, glial cells are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. Because of this local metabolic activity of glial cells, the extracellular fluid immediately surrounding neurons strongly differs in composition from the blood or cerebrospinal fluid, being much richer with lactate, as was found in microdialysis studies. === Brain development metabolism === Some evidence suggests that lactate is important at early stages of development for brain metabolism in prenatal and early postnatal subjects, with lactate at these stages having higher concentrations in body liquids, and being utilized by the brain preferentially over glucose. It was also hypothesized that lactate may exert a strong action over GABAergic networks in the developing brain, making them more inhibitory than it was previously assumed, acting either through better support of metabolites, or alterations in base intracellular pH levels, or both. Studies of brain slices of mice show that β-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, and pyruvate act as oxidative energy substrates, causing an increase in the NAD(P)H oxidation phase, that glucose was insufficient as an energy carrier during intense synaptic activity and, finally, that lactate can be an efficient energy substrate capable of sustaining and enhancing brain aerobic energy metabolism in vitro. The study ""provides novel data on biphasic NAD(P)H fluorescence transients, an important physiological response to neural activation that has been reproduced in many studies and that is believed to originate predominantly from activity-induced concentration changes to the cellular NADH pools."" Lactate can also serve as an important source of energy for other organs, including the heart and liver. During physical activity, up to 60% of the heart muscle's energy turnover rate derives from lactate oxidation. == Blood testing == Blood tests for lactate are performed to determine the status of the acid base homeostasis in the body. Blood sampling for this purpose is often arterial (even if it is more difficult than venipuncture), because lactate levels differ substantially between arterial and venous, and the arterial level is more representative for this purpose. During childbirth, lactate levels in the fetus can be quantified by fetal scalp blood testing. == Uses == === Polymer precursor === Two molecules of lactic acid can be dehydrated to the lactone lactide. In the presence of catalysts lactide polymerize to either atactic or syndiotactic polylactide (PLA), which are biodegradable polyesters. PLA is an example of a plastic that is not derived from petrochemicals. === Pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications === Lactic acid is also employed in pharmaceutical technology to produce water-soluble lactates from otherwise-insoluble active ingredients. It finds further use in topical preparations and cosmetics to adjust acidity and for its disinfectant and keratolytic properties. Lactic acid containing bacteria have shown promise in reducing oxaluria with its descaling properties on calcium compounds. === Foods === ==== Fermented food ==== Lactic acid is found in many fermented foods. Sour milk products, such as kumis, laban, yogurt, kefir, and some cottage cheeses, derive their flavor from lactic acid. The casein in fermented milk is coagulated (curdled) by lactic acid. Lactic acid is also responsible for the sour flavor of sourdough bread. Some beers (sour beer) purposely contain lactic acid, one such type being Belgian lambics. Most commonly, this is produced naturally by various strains of bacteria. These bacteria ferment sugars into acids, unlike the yeast that ferment sugar into ethanol. After cooling the wort, yeast and bacteria are allowed to ""fall"" into the open fermenters. Brewers of more common beer styles would ensure that no such bacteria are allowed to enter the fermenter. Other sour styles of beer include Berliner weisse, Flanders red and American wild ale. In winemaking, a bacterial process, natural or controlled, is often used to convert the naturally present malic acid to lactic acid, to reduce the sharpness and for other flavor-related reasons. This malolactic fermentation is undertaken by lactic acid bacteria. Pickling vegetables in brine creates a sour flavor as bacteria convert sugars into lactic acid. Fermented sausages In lists of nutritional information lactic acid might be included under the term ""carbohydrate"" (or ""carbohydrate by difference"") because this often includes everything other than water, protein, fat, ash, and ethanol. If this is the case then the calculated food energy may use the standard 4 kilocalories (17 kJ) per gram that is often used for all carbohydrates. But in some cases lactic acid is ignored in the calculation. The actual energy density of lactic acid is 3.62 kilocalories (15.1 kJ) per g. While not normally found in significant quantities in fruit, lactic acid is the primary organic acid in akebia fruit, making up 2.12% of the juice. ==== Separately added ==== As a food additive it is approved for use in the EU, United States and Australia and New Zealand; it is listed by its INS number 270 or as E number E270. Lactic acid is used as a food preservative, curing agent, and flavoring agent. It is an ingredient in processed foods and is used as a decontaminant during meat processing. Lactic acid is produced commercially by fermentation of carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, or lactose, or by chemical synthesis. Carbohydrate sources include corn, beets, and cane sugar. === Forgery === Lactic acid has historically been used to assist with the erasure of inks from official papers to be modified during forgery. === Cleaning products === Lactic acid is used in some liquid cleaners as a descaling agent for removing hard water deposits such as calcium carbonate. == See also == Category: Salts of lactic acid Category:Lactate esters Acids in wine Alanine cycle Biodegradable plastic Dental caries MCT1, a lactate transporter Thiolactic acid Methacrylic acid == References == == External links == Corn Plastic to the Rescue Archived 21 November 2013 at the Wayback Machine Lactic Acid: Information and Resources Lactic Acid Is Not Muscles' Foe, It's Fuel Fitzgerald M (26 January 2010).

2088,"('Lobaplatin', 'Lactic acid', 'Lactate', 'Milk acid', 'Tonsillosan')",Medical,"Lactic acid is an organic acid. It has the molecular formula C3H6O3. It is white in the solid state and it is miscible with water. When in the dissolved state, it forms a colorless solution. Production includes both artificial synthesis as well as natural sources. Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) due to the presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group. It is used as a synthetic intermediate in many organic synthesis industries and in various biochemical industries. The conjugate base of lactic acid is called lactate (or the lactate anion). The name of the derived acyl group is lactoyl. In solution, it can ionize by a loss of a proton to produce the lactate ion CH3CH(OH)CO−2. Compared to acetic acid, its pKa is 1 unit less, meaning lactic acid is ten times more acidic than acetic acid. This higher acidity is the consequence of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the α-hydroxyl and the carboxylate group. Lactic acid is chiral, consisting of two enantiomers. One is known as L-lactic acid, (S)-lactic acid, or (+)-lactic acid, and the other, its mirror image, is D-lactic acid, (R)-lactic acid, or (−)-lactic acid. A mixture of the two in equal amounts is called DL-lactic acid, or racemic lactic acid. Lactic acid is hygroscopic. DL-Lactic acid is miscible with water and with ethanol above its melting point, which is about 16 to 18 °C (61 to 64 °F). D-Lactic acid and L-lactic acid have a higher melting point. Lactic acid produced by fermentation of milk is often racemic, although certain species of bacteria produce solely D-lactic acid. On the other hand, lactic acid produced by fermentation in animal muscles has the (L) enantiomer and is sometimes called ""sarcolactic"" acid, from the Greek sarx, meaning ""flesh"". In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal, which is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters, concentration and isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 1–2 mMTooltip millimolar at rest, but can rise to over 20 mM during intense exertion and as high as 25 mM afterward. In addition to other biological roles, L-lactic acid is the primary endogenous agonist of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCA1), which is a Gi/o-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In industry, lactic acid fermentation is performed by lactic acid bacteria, which convert simple carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, or galactose to lactic acid. These bacteria can also grow in the mouth; the acid they produce is responsible for the tooth decay known as cavities. In medicine, lactate is one of the main components of lactated Ringer's solution and Hartmann's solution. These intravenous fluids consist of sodium and potassium cations along with lactate and chloride anions in solution with distilled water, generally in concentrations isotonic with human blood. It is most commonly used for fluid resuscitation after blood loss due to trauma, surgery, or burns. Lactic acid is produced in human tissues when the demand for oxygen is limited by the supply. This occurs during tissue ischemia when the flow of blood is limited as in sepsis or hemorrhagic shock. It may also occur when demand for oxygen is high such as with intense exercise.

In oxacephems such as latamoxef, the sulfur atom of the cephalosporin core is replaced with an oxygen atom. Latamoxef has been associated with prolonged bleeding time, and several cases of coagulopathy, some fatal, were reported during the 1980s. Latamoxef is no longer available in the United States. As with other cephalosporins with a methylthiotetrazole side chain, latamoxef causes a disulfiram reaction when mixed with alcohol. Additionally, the methylthiotetrazole side chain inhibits γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid; this can interfere with the actions of vitamin K. It has been described as a third-generation cephalosporin. == Synthesis == Oxa-substituted third generation cephalosporin antibiotic (oxacephalosporin). The benzhydrol ester of 6-Aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) is S-chlorinated and treated with base whereupon the intermediate sulfenyl chloride fragments (to 2). Next, displacement with propargyl alcohol in the presence of zinc chloride gives predominanntly the stereochemistry represented by diastereoisomer 3. The side chain is protected as the phenylacetylamide; the triple bond is partially reduced with a 5% Pd-CaCO3 (Lindlar catalyst) and then epoxidized with mCPBA to give 4. The epoxide is opened at the least hindered end with 1-methyl-1H-tetrazole-5-thiol to put in place the future C-3 side chain and give intermediate 5. Jones oxidation followed in turn by ozonolysis (reductive work-up with zinc-AcOH) and reaction with SOCl2 and pyridine give halide 6. The stage is now wet for intramolecular Wittig reaction. Displacement with PPh3 and Wittig olefination gives 1-oxacephem 7. Next a sequence is undertaken of side chain exchange and introduction of a 7-methoxyl group analogous to that which is present in cephamycins and gives them the enhanced beta-lactamase stability. First 7 is converted to the imino chloride with PCl5 and then to the imino methyl ether (with methanol) and next hydrolyzed to the free amine (8). Imine formation with 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is next carried out leading to 9. Oxidation with nickel(III) oxide gives iminoquinone methide 10, to which methanol is added in a conjugate sense and in the sterechemistry represented by formula 11. The imine is exchanged with Girard's reagent T to give 12, and this is acylated by a suitable protected arylmalonate, as the hemiester hemiacid chloride so as to give 11.

It can be used as an antidote for strychnine poisoning. Mephenesin however presents with the major drawbacks of having a short duration of action and a much greater effect on the spinal cord than the brain, resulting in pronounced respiratory depression at clinical doses and therefore a very low therapeutic index. It is especially dangerous and potentially fatal in combination with alcohol and other depressants. Mephenesin was the inspiration for the synthesis of a derivative of 1,3-propanediol, meprobamate, by Bernard Ludwig and Frank Berger, the first tranquilizer to see widespread clinical use. Mephenesin is no longer available in North America but is used in Italy and a few other countries. Its use has largely been replaced by the related drug methocarbamol, which is better absorbed. Mephenesin may be an NMDA receptor antagonist. Mephenesin was previously used in France as an OTC muscle relaxant called Décontractyl but was taken out of production by Sanofi Aventis and due to a French Health Ministry decree in July 2019.

2091,"('Propafenone (hydrochloride)', 'Propafenone', 'Rythmol', 'Propafenona', 'Propafenonum')",Medical,"Propafenone, sold under the brand name Rythmol among others, is a class 1c anti-arrhythmic medication, which is used to treat illnesses associated with rapid heart beat such as atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. == Mechanism of action == Propafenone works by slowing the influx of sodium ions into the cardiac muscle cells, causing a decrease in excitability of the cells. Propafenone is more selective for cells with a high rate, but also blocks normal cells more than class Ia or Ib anti-arrhythmic medications. Propafenone differs from the prototypical class Ic antiarrhythmic in that it has additional activity as a beta-adrenergic blocker which can cause bradycardia and bronchospasm. == Metabolism == Propafenone is metabolized primarily in the liver. Because of its short half-life, it requires dosing two or three times daily to maintain steady blood levels. The long-term safety of propafenone is unknown. Because it is structurally similar to another anti-arrhythmic medicine, flecainide, similar cautions should be exercised in its use. Flecainide and propafenone, like other antiarrhythmic drugs have been shown to increase the occurrence of arrhythmias (5.3% for propafenone, Teva physician prescribing information), primarily in patients with underlying heart disease. However, their use in structurally normal hearts is considered safe. == Side effects == Side effects attributed to propafenone include hypersensitivity reactions, lupus-like syndrome, agranulocytosis, CNS disturbances such as dizziness, lightheadedness, gastrointestinal upset, a metallic taste and bronchospasm. About 20% of patients discontinued the drug due to side effects. == Initiation of therapy == Propafenone generally needs to be started in a hospital setting to assure ECG monitoring of the patient. There are many different dosages of propafenone, depending on clinical presentation of the arrhythmia. The treatment is generally begun with a relatively high dose (450–900 mg/d), decreasing to near 300 mg/d. In most Western countries, the accepted maximal dose is 900 mg/d. For economic and convenience reasons, some clinicians are starting certain antiarrhythmic agents in an outpatient setting for some patients. No consensus exists regarding the safety of this practice, and information is needed to determine which agents and which patients are appropriate for outpatient initiation of antiarrhythmic therapy. From a clinical point of view, this drug is used primarily in patients with relatively preserved myocardial function. == Contraindications and cautions == Caution should be used in administering propafenone in individuals with hepatic dysfunction, asthma, congestive heart failure, or bradycardia. == History == Propafenone was approved for use in the United States in November 1989. == Stereochemistry == Propafenone contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers.

It acts as an inhibitor of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs). The drug was discovered in the 1950s, and was developed in Japan in 1959. It is used as the hibenzate and citrate salts. The usual dose is 20 mg every 4–6 hours. Possible side effects of tipepidine, especially in overdose, may include drowsiness, vertigo, delirium, disorientation, loss of consciousness, and confusion. Tipepidine has been investigated as a potential psychiatric drug. It is being investigated in depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Through inhibition of GIRK channels, tipepidine increases dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, but without increasing locomotor activity or producing methamphetamine-like behavioral sensitization, and this action appears to be at least partly responsible for its antidepressant-like effects in rodents. == See also == Cough syrup Noscapine Codeine; Pholcodine Dextromethorphan; Dimemorfan Racemorphan; Dextrorphan; Levorphanol Butamirate Pentoxyverine Cloperastine; Levocloperastine Guaifenesin Timepidium bromide == References ==",Tipepidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6331539882230572e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019483646610751748)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipepidine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Tipepidine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipepidine?utm_source=openai')])"
2093,"('Isoprenaline (hydrochloride)', 'Isoproterenol (hydrochloride)', 'Isoproterenol', 'Isoprenaline', 'Novodrin')",Medical,"Isoprenaline, also known as isoproterenol and sold under the brand name Isuprel among others, is a sympathomimetic medication which is used in the treatment of acute bradycardia (slow heart rate), heart block, and rarely for asthma, among other indications. It is used by injection into a vein, muscle, fat, or the heart, by inhalation, and in the past under the tongue or into the rectum. Side effects of isoprenaline include rapid heart beat, heart palpitations, and arrhythmias, among others. Isoprenaline is a selective agonist of the β-adrenergic receptors, including both the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. By activating these receptors, it increases heart rate and the force of heart contractions. Chemically, isoprenaline is a synthetic catecholamine and is the N-isopropyl analogue of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). Isoprenaline was one of the first synthetic sympathomimetic amines and was the first selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist. The medication was discovered in 1940 and was introduced for medical use in 1947. == Medical uses == Isoprenaline is used to treat heart block and episodes of Adams–Stokes syndrome that are not caused by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, in emergencies for cardiac arrest until electric shock can be administered, for bronchospasm occurring during anesthesia, and as an adjunct in the treatment of hypovolemic shock, septic shock, low cardiac output (hypoperfusion) states, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. It is also used to prevent Torsades de Pointes in patients with long QT refractory to magnesium and to treat patients with intermittent Torsades de Pointes refractory to treatment with magnesium. Isoprenaline is used in the acute management of bradycardia, though not in the chronic treatment of bradycardia. Historically, it was used to treat asthma via metered aerosol or nebulizing devices; it was also available in sublingual, oral, intravenous, and intramuscular formulations. The U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel recommends against its use as a nebulizer for acute bronchoconstriction. === Available forms === Many formulations of isoprenaline appear to have been discontinued in the United States and many other countries. In the United States, it remains available only as an injectable solution. It was previously also available in the United States as a solution, metered aerosol, powder, or disc for inhalation and as a tablet for sublingual and rectal administration, but these formulations were discontinued. == Contraindications == It should not be used in people with tachyarrhythmias (except in special circumstances), tachycardia or heart block caused by digitalis poisoning, ventricular arrhythmias which require inotropic therapy, or with angina. == Side effects == Side effects of isoprenaline may include nervousness, headache, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, tachycardia, palpitations, angina, Adams-Stokes attacks, pulmonary edema, hypertension, hypotension, ventricular arrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, difficulty breathing, sweating, mild tremors, weakness, flushing, and pallor. Isoprenaline has been reported to cause insulin resistance leading to diabetic ketoacidosis. == Overdose == Overdose of isoprenaline may produce effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias, palpitations, angina, hypotension, hypertension, and myocardial necrosis. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Isoprenaline is a β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor full agonist and has almost no activity at the α-adrenergic receptors at lower concentrations. It has similar affinity for the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. At higher concentrations, isoprenaline can also evoke responses mediated by α-adrenergic receptors. Its agonist effects at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) additionally provide it with pharmacodynamic effects that resemble those of the endogenous trace amines, like tyramine. Isoprenaline's effects on the cardiovascular system (non-selective) relate to its actions on cardiac β1-adrenergic receptors and β2-adrenergic receptors on smooth muscle within the tunica media of arterioles. Isoprenaline has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart. β2-Adrenergic receptor stimulation in arteriolar smooth muscle induces vasodilation. Its inotropic and chronotropic effects elevate systolic blood pressure, while its vasodilatory effects tend to lower diastolic blood pressure. The overall effect is to decrease mean arterial pressure due to the vasodilation caused by β2-adrenergic receptor activation. The isopropylamine group in isoprenaline makes it selective for β-adrenergic receptors. The adverse effects of isoprenaline are also related to the drug's cardiovascular effects. Isoprenaline can produce tachycardia (an elevated heart rate), which predisposes people who take it to cardiac arrhythmias. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Data on the absorption of isoprenaline are limited. Oral isoprenaline is well-absorbed but is subject to strong first-pass metabolism and is approximately 1,000 times less potent than intravenous administration. Hence, its oral bioavailability is very low. Another study suggested that its oral bioavailability, based on pharmacodynamic activity via different routes, was slightly less than 4%. ==== Distribution ==== Isoprenaline is minimally able to cross the blood–brain barrier and hence is a peripherally selective drug. This is attributed to its high hydrophilicity. Whereas the extraction of isoprenaline in a single passage of the brain circulation following intravenous injection in humans was 3.8%, the extraction of propranolol, which is a more lipophilic compound and is readily able to cross into the brain, was 63.0%. The plasma protein binding of isoprenaline is 68.8 ± 1.2%. It is bound mainly to albumin. ==== Metabolism ==== Isoprenaline is metabolized by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) and conjugation by sulfation. It does not appear to be glucuronidated. There is very large interindividual variability in the sulfation of isoprenaline. The free catechol hydroxyl groups keep it susceptible to enzymatic metabolism. The drug is a poor substrate for monoamine oxidase (MAO) and is not metabolized by this enzyme. This is in contrast to epinephrine and norepinephrine. Isoprenaline is much more strongly metabolized and conjugated with oral administration than with intravenous administration. Its metabolite 3-O-methylisoprenaline, formed by COMT, is active as a weak β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. ==== Elimination ==== Isoprenaline is excreted primarily in the urine, as sulfate conjugates. It is excreted 59 to 107% in urine and 12 to 27% in feces. A majority of isoprenaline is excreted in urine in conjugated form, whereas 6.5 to 16.2% is excreted as unchanged isoprenaline and 2.6 to 11.4% is excreted as 3-O-methylisoprenaline and conjugates. The elimination half-life of isoprenaline by intravenous administration is approximately 2.5 to 5 minutes. Its half-life with oral administration is approximately 40 minutes. == Chemistry == Isoprenaline, also known as N-isopropyl-3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine or as N-isopropylnorepinephrine, is a substituted phenethylamine and synthetic catecholamine derivative. It is the N-isopropyl analogue of norepinephrine (3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine) and epinephrine (3,4,β-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine). Isoprenaline is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C11H17NO3 and a molecular weight of 211.26 g/mol. It is a hydrophilic compound with a predicted log P of -0.6 to 0.25. For comparison, the experimental log P values of epinephrine and norepinephrine are -1.37 and -1.24, respectively. Isoprenaline is used pharmaceutically as the hydrochloride and sulfate salts. It is also used to a much lesser extent as the free base. Isoprenaline is a racemic mixture of levorotatory and dextrorotatory enantiomers. The levorotatory or (R)-enantiomer of isoprenaline is known as levisoprenaline (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name) but was never marketed. Synthetic analogues closely related to isoprenaline include arbutamine, dichloroisoprenaline (dichloroisoproterenol), hexoprenaline, isoetharine (α-ethylisoprenaline), orciprenaline (metaproterenol; a positional isomer of isoprenaline), prenalterol, and soterenol (3-methanesulfonamidylisoprenaline), among others. == History == Isoprenaline was discovered in 1940 and was developed in the 1940s. It was first approved for medical use in 1947 in the United States. Isoprenaline was one of the first synthetic sympathomimetic amines, was the first selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist, and was the first major sympathomimetic agent devoid of pressor effects. Between 1963 and 1968 in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand there was an increase in deaths among people using isoprenaline to treat asthma. This was attributed to unintentional overdose: the inhalers produced in that area were dispensing five times the dosage dispensed by inhalers produced in the United States and Canada, where the deaths were not observed. The short duration of action and poor oral activity of isoprenaline led to the development of the much longer-acting and orally active orciprenaline (metaproterenol). == Society and culture == === Names === Isoprenaline is the major generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. Isoprenalina is its Italian generic name and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. Isoprenaline hydrochloride and isoprenaline sulfate are its BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride and sulfate salts, respectively. Isoproterenol is another important synonym of the drug. Isoproterenol hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt and isoproterenol sulfate is its USAN and JAN in the case of the sulfate salt. Other synonyms of the drug include isopropylnorepinephrine, isopropylnoradrenaline, and isopropydine. It is additionally known by the former developmental code name WIN-5162. Isoprenaline has been marketed under many brand names worldwide. These include Aleudrina, Asthpul, Iludrin, Iprenol, Isomenyl, Isuprel, Isoprenaline, Isoprenalina, Isoproterenol, Neo-Epinine, Neodrenal, Proternol, and Saventrine, among others. It is also marketed as a combination drug with cromoglicic acid as Frenal Compositum, in combination with pronase as Isopal P, and in combination with atropine as Stmerin D. == References ==",Novodrin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002105759223923087), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004197003319859505)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6931471824645996)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Betazole hydrochloride is known as gastramine and histalog. It has been used as a gastric stimulant to test for maximal production of gastric secretion activity. The test can be used in diagnosis of diseases such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome where there is excess acid production, in this case driven by over production of gastrin. The volume of acid secretion is measured following administration of betazole, diagnosis being secretion greater than 60% of the maximal acid secretion following betazole stimulation. This procedure can lead to complications and should be avoided in subjects with coronary artery disease. It is also used in diagnosis of gastritis in association with a test for secretin activity. Betazole is used as a stimulant in preference to histamine because of its specificity for the H2 receptor and its advantage of not generating the undesirable side effects that histamine would induce. It therefore does not require concomitant use of antihistaminic compounds to block the actions of histamine at other histamine receptor types. It is used to test the effectiveness of H2 receptor blocking drugs such as nizatidine. == References ==",Betazole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00038556772051379085), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008638394996523857)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betazole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Betazole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betazole?utm_source=openai')])"
2095,"('Isatin', 'Indoline-2,3-dione', 'Isatine', 'Pseudoisatin', 'Isatic acid lactam')",Medical,"Isatin, also known as tribulin, is an organic compound derived from indole with formula C8H5NO2. The compound was first obtained by Otto Linné Erdman and Auguste Laurent in 1840 as a product from the oxidation of indigo dye by nitric acid and chromic acids. Isatin is a well-known natural product which can be found in plants of the genus Isatis, in Couroupita guianensis, and also in humans, as a metabolic derivative of adrenaline. It looks like a red-orange powder, and it is usually employed as building block for the synthesis of a wide variety of biologically active compounds including antitumorals, antivirals, anti-HIVs, and antituberculars. The isatin core is also responsible for the color of “Maya blue” and “Maya yellow” dyes. == Synthesis == === Sandmeyer methodology === The Sandmeyer methodology is the oldest and straightforward way for the synthesis of isatin. The method involves the condensation between chloral hydrate and a primary arylamine (e.g. aniline), in the presence of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, in aqueous sodium sulfate to form an α‐isonitrosoacetanilide. Isolation of this intermediate and subsequent electrophilic cyclization promoted by strong acids (e.g. sulfuric acid) furnishes isatin in >75% yield. === Stolle methodology === The Stolle procedure is considered the best alternative to Sandmeyer methodology for the synthesis of both substituted and unsubstituted isatins. In this case primary or secondary arylamines are condensed with oxalyl chloride to form a chlorooxalylanilide intermediate which can then cyclize in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g. aluminium trichloride, titanium tetrachloride, boron trifluoride, etc.). === Other procedures === More recent approaches to the synthesis of N-substituted isatins involves the direct oxidation of commercially available, substituted indoles or oxindoles with different oxidizing agents such as TBHP, IBX-SO3K, tBuONO etc. == Reactivity == The presence of an aromatic ring, a ketone and a γ-lactam moiety, gives to isatin the rare potential to be used as both an electrophile and a nucleophile: indeed, it undergoes an enormous number of reactions, such as N-substitutions, electrophilic aromatic substitution at positions C-5 and C-7 of the phenyl ring, nucleophilic additions onto the C-3 carbonyl group, chemoselective reductions, oxidations, ring-expansions and spiro-annulations. Because of this unique reactivity, isatin is considered one of the most valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. === N-Substitution === The N-functionalization of the isatin core can be readily obtained by the deprotonation of the amino moiety, forming the corresponding sodium or potassium salt, and subsequent addition of an electrophile (e.g. alkyl or acyl halides). On the other hand, N-arylation is usually achieved by cross-coupling reactions with aryl halides using copper or palladium catalysts. === Ring expansion === In the field of organic synthesis, ring expansions are considered valuable reactions since they allow the obtainment medium-size ring (7-9 atoms) which are difficult to synthesize through ""classical"" methods. To date, only few articles concerning the ring expansion of isatin derivatives has been reported. The first one is an acid-catalyzed one-pot multicomponent reaction involving isatins, aminouracils, and isooxazolones to form isoxazoquinolines, important scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. In another one-pot multicomponent reaction, a unique two-carbon expansion has been achieved by reacting isatin with indene-1,3-dione and N-substituted pyridinium bromide to form dibenzo[b,d]azepin-6-ones. === C-2/C-3 nucleophilic addition === Isatin suffers nucleophilic addition on carbonyls at C-2 and C-3 positions. The regioselectivity of the process strongly depends both on the substrate (properties of the substituents on the isatin core, especially those bonded to the nitrogen atom) and the reaction conditions (solvent, temperature etc.). In some cases the nucleophilic addition could be followed by secondary reactions (e.g. cyclization, ring expansion, ring opening etc.) === Oxidation === The oxidation of isatin using hydrogen peroxide (Baeyer–Villiger oxidation) or chromic anhydride yields isatoic anhydride, a compound widely used either in herbicide products and in medicinal chemistry. The use of peroxydisulfuric acid gives rise to 1,4‑benzoxazine compounds. === Dimerization === Dimerization of isatin with KBH4 in methanol yield Indirubin. This represent the indigo pigment's red component and a highly effective cytotoxic compound. === Reduction === Reduction of the non-amide carbonyl group obviously occurs to give oxindole, respectively. == See also == Pfitzinger reaction == References == == Reviews == Popp, Prank D.

2096,"('Vinblastine (sulfate)', 'Vincaleukoblastine sulfate salt', 'Vinblastine', 'Vincaleucoblastin', 'Vincaleukoblastine')",Medical,"Vinblastine, sold under the brand name Velban among others, is a chemotherapy medication, typically used with other medications, to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, brain cancer, melanoma, and testicular cancer. It is given by injection into a vein. Most people experience some side effects. Commonly it causes a change in sensation, constipation, weakness, loss of appetite, and headaches. Severe side effects include low blood cell counts and shortness of breath. It should not be given to people who have a current bacterial infection. Use during pregnancy will likely harm the baby. Vinblastine works by blocking cell division. Vinblastine was isolated in 1958. An example of a natural herbal remedy that has since been developed into a conventional medicine, vinblastine was originally obtained from the Madagascar periwinkle. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Vinblastine is a component of a number of chemotherapy regimens, including ABVD for Hodgkin lymphoma, and along with methotrexate in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). It is also used to treat histiocytosis according to the established protocols of the Histiocytosis Association. == Side effects == Adverse effects of vinblastine include hair loss, loss of white blood cells and blood platelets, gastrointestinal problems, high blood pressure, excessive sweating, depression, muscle cramps, vertigo and headaches. As a vesicant, vinblastine can cause extensive tissue damage and blistering if it escapes from the vein from improper administration. == Pharmacology == Vinblastine is a vinca alkaloid and a chemical analogue of vincristine. It binds tubulin, thereby inhibiting the assembly of microtubules. Vinblastine treatment causes M phase specific cell cycle arrest by disrupting microtubule assembly and proper formation of the mitotic spindle and the kinetochore, each of which are necessary for the separation of chromosomes during anaphase of mitosis. Toxicities include bone marrow suppression (which is dose-limiting), gastrointestinal toxicity, potent vesicant (blister-forming) activity, and extravasation injury (forms deep ulcers). Vinblastine paracrystals may be composed of tightly packed unpolymerized tubulin or microtubules. Vinblastine is reported to be an effective component of certain chemotherapy regimens, particularly when used with bleomycin and methotrexate in VBM chemotherapy for Stage IA or IIA Hodgkin lymphomas. The inclusion of vinblastine allows for lower doses of bleomycin and reduced overall toxicity with larger resting periods between chemotherapy cycles. === Mechanism of action === Microtubule-disruptive drugs like vinblastine, colcemid, and nocodazole have been reported to act by two mechanisms. At very low concentrations they suppress microtubule dynamics and at higher concentrations they reduce microtubule polymer mass. Recent findings indicate that they also produce microtubule fragments by stimulating microtubule minus-end detachment from their organizing centers. Dose-response studies further indicate that enhanced microtubule detachment from spindle poles correlate best with cytotoxicity. But research into the mechanism is still ongoing as recent studies also show vinblastine inducing apoptosis that is phase-independent in certain leukemias. === Pharmacokinetics === Vinblastine appears to be a peripherally selective drug due to limited brain uptake caused by binding to P-glycoprotein. == Isolation and synthesis == Vinblastine may be isolated from the Madagascar Periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus), its only known biological producer, along with several of its precursors, catharanthine and vindoline. Extraction is costly and yields of vinblastine and its precursors are low, although procedures for rapid isolation with improved yields avoiding auto-oxidation have been developed. Enantioselective synthesis has been of considerable interest in recent years, as the natural mixture of isomers is not an economical source for the required C16'S, C14'R stereochemistry of biologically active vinblastine. Initially, the approach depends upon an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation, which sets the stereochemistry at C20. The desired configuration around C16 and C14 can then be fixed during the ensuing steps. In this pathway, vinblastine is constructed by a series of cyclization and coupling reactions which create the required stereochemistry. The overall yield may be as great as 22%, which makes this synthetic approach more attractive than extraction from natural sources, whose overall yield is about 10%. Stereochemistry is controlled through a mixture of chiral agents (Sharpless catalysts), and reaction conditions (temperature, and selected enantiopure starting materials). Due to difficulty of stereochemical restraints in total synthetic processes, other semi-synthetic methods from precursors, catharanthine and vindoline, continue to be developed. == History == Vinblastine was first isolated by Robert Noble and Charles Thomas Beer at the University of Western Ontario from the Madagascar periwinkle plant. Vinblastine's utility as a chemotherapeutic agent was first suggested by its effect on the body when an extract of the plant was injected in rabbits to study the plant's supposed anti-diabetic effect. (A tea made from the plant was a folk-remedy for diabetes.) The rabbits died from a bacterial infection, due to a decreased number of white blood cells, so it was hypothesized that vinblastine might be effective against cancers of the white blood cells such as lymphoma. It was approved by FDA in 1965. == References ==",Vincaleukoblastine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.333651541965082e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023288540542125702)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682848.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Vinblastine: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682848.html?utm_source=openai')])"

The discovery and development of small molecule drugs targeting MTs has always been an important direction of anti-cancer research. Nowadays 4-Aryl-4H-chromenes have emerged as potent microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) for various cancers. Crolibulin, a derivative of 4-Aryl-4H-chromenes, which has been progressed to Phase I/II clinical testing's for anaplastic thyroid cancer with the National Cancer Institute. However, the design and development of 4-Aryl-4H-chromenes family drugs have been hindered for a long time by the lack of structural information of the tubulin-agent complex. Here we report a 2.5 Å crystal structure of tubulin complexed with crolibulin. This complex structure reveals the interactions between crolibulin and tubulin, helps explain the results of the structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies and provides a solid structural basis for the design and development of new 4-Aryl-4H-chromenes derivatives as MTAs. A series of novel 4,6-diphenyl-2-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)nicotinonitrile analogues of crolibulin and combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) were discovered using a 2-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)pyridine ring as link-bridge to retain the cis-orientations of A-ring and B-ring.

The research for plants used for long time in traditional medicine in the treatment of wound has become a promising strategy to obtain drugs therapeutically useful in the acute and chronic wound management. In this context,  Methamphetamine (METH) is a commonly abused drug that may result in neurotoxic effects. Recent studies have suggested that involvement of neuroinflammatory processes in brain dysfunction is induced by misuse of this drug. However, the mechanism underlying METH-induced inflammation and neurotoxicity in neurons is still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether asiatic acid (AA) effected METH-mediated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity in dopaminergic neuronal cells. And we further determined whether the effect involved in the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. We used the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line, murine microglial BV2 cell line, and primary culture of rat embryo mesencephalic neurons. Pro-inflammatory cytokine production was monitored by ELISA and RT/real-time PCR. The cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial membrane integrity was analyzed by flow cytometry. We used immunoblotting, DNA-binding activity, and immunofluorescence staining to analyze the effect of AA on activation of the NF-κB, STAT3, MAPK-ERK, and apoptosis signaling pathways. METH induced TNF receptor (TNFR) expression and led to morphological changes of cells. Additionally, this drug increased pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFα and IL-6) expression. AA significantly suppressed METH-induced TNFR expression in concentration dependent. Increased secretion of TNFα and IL-6 was inhibited in METH-stimulated neuronal cells by AA administration. AA showed significant protection against METH-induced translocation of NF-κB/STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation. AA inhibited METH-induced proteolytic fragmentation of caspase-3 and PARP. The pro-apoptotic protein Bax was significantly decreased, while the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL was increased by AA treatment in METH-stimulated cells. A similar protective effect of AA on mitochondrial membrane integrity was also confirmed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Based on the literatures and our findings, AA is a promising candidate for an anti-neurotoxic agent, and it can potentially be used for the prevention and treatment of various neurological disorders. Asiatic acid (AA) is the most crucial component of Asiaticoside in many edible and medicinal plants. It has diverse biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-infective, and anti-tumor. Additionally, AA has been intensively studied in the last decades. It has shown great potential in the treatment of various neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral ischemia, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury (TBI), neural tumors, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD).

2099,"('Hydrocortisone', 'Cortisol', 'Acticort', 'Cetacort', 'Hydrasson')","Endogenous, Medical","Cortisol is a steroid hormone in the glucocorticoid class of hormones and a stress hormone. When used as medication, it is known as hydrocortisone. It is produced in many animals, mainly by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex in an adrenal gland. In other tissues, it is produced in lower quantities. By a diurnal cycle, cortisol is released and increases in response to stress and a low blood-glucose concentration. It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, suppress the immune system, and aid in the metabolism of calories. It also decreases bone formation. These stated functions are carried out by cortisol binding to glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors inside a cell, which then bind to DNA to affect gene expression. == Health effects == === Metabolic response === ==== Metabolism of glucose ==== Cortisol plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism and promotes gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis) and glycogenesis (glycogen synthesis) in the liver and glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen) in skeletal muscle. It also increases blood glucose levels by reducing glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue, decreasing protein synthesis, and increasing the breakdown of fats into fatty acids (lipolysis). All of these metabolic steps have the net effect of increasing blood glucose levels, which fuel the brain and other tissues during the fight-or-flight response. Cortisol is also responsible for releasing amino acids from muscle, providing a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Its impact is complex and diverse. In general, cortisol stimulates gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of 'new' glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, which occurs mainly in the liver, but also in the kidneys and small intestine under certain circumstances). The net effect is an increase in the concentration of glucose in the blood, further complemented by a decrease in the sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin, thus preventing this tissue from taking the glucose from the blood. Cortisol has a permissive effect on the actions of hormones that increase glucose production, such as glucagon and adrenaline. Cortisol also plays an important, but indirect, role in liver and muscle glycogenolysis (the breaking down of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose) which occurs as a result of the action of glucagon and adrenaline. Additionally, cortisol facilitates the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, which is necessary for adrenaline to have an effect on glycogenolysis. It is paradoxical that cortisol promotes not only gluconeogenesis (biosynthesis of glucose molecules) in the liver, but also glycogenesis (polymerization of glucose molecules into glycogen): cortisol is thus better thought of as stimulating glucose/glycogen turnover in the liver. This is in contrast to cortisol's effect in the skeletal muscle where glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen into glucose molecules) is promoted indirectly through catecholamines. In this way, cortisol and catecholamines work synergistically to promote the breakdown of muscle glycogen into glucose for use in the muscle tissue. ==== Metabolism of proteins and lipids ==== Elevated levels of cortisol, if prolonged, can lead to proteolysis (breakdown of proteins) and muscle wasting. The reason for proteolysis is to provide the relevant tissue with a feedstock for gluconeogenesis; see glucogenic amino acids. The effects of cortisol on lipid metabolism are more complicated since lipogenesis is observed in patients with chronic, raised circulating glucocorticoid (i.e. cortisol) levels, although an acute increase in circulating cortisol promotes lipolysis. The usual explanation to account for this apparent discrepancy is that the raised blood glucose concentration (through the action of cortisol) will stimulate insulin release. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis, so this is an indirect consequence of the raised cortisol concentration in the blood but it will only occur over a longer time scale. === Immune response === Cortisol prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. It is used to treat conditions resulting from overactivity of the B-cell-mediated antibody response. Examples include inflammatory and rheumatoid diseases, as well as allergies. Low-dose topical hydrocortisone, available as a nonprescription medicine in some countries, is used to treat skin problems such as rashes and eczema. Cortisol inhibits production of interleukin 12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IFN-alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper cells (Th1 cells), but upregulates interleukin 4, interleukin 10, and interleukin 13 by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response. Cortisol can weaken the activity of the immune system. It prevents proliferation of T-cells by rendering the interleukin-2 producer T-cells unresponsive to interleukin-1, and unable to produce the T-cell growth factor IL-2. Cortisol downregulates the expression of the IL2 receptor IL-2R on the surface of the helper T-cell which is necessary to induce a Th1 'cellular' immune response, thus favoring a shift towards Th2 dominance and the release of the cytokines listed above which results in Th2 dominance and favors the 'humoral' B-cell mediated antibody immune response. Cortisol also has a negative-feedback effect on IL-1. The way this negative feedback works is that an immune stressor causes peripheral immune cells to release IL-1 and other cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. These cytokines stimulate the hypothalamus, causing it to release corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH in turn stimulates the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) among other things in the adrenal gland, which (among other things) increases production of cortisol. Cortisol then closes the loop as it inhibits TNF-alpha production in immune cells and makes them less responsive to IL-1. Through this system, as long as an immune stressor is small, the response will be regulated to the correct level. Like a thermostat controlling a heater, the hypothalamus uses cortisol to turn off the heat once the production of cortisol matches the stress induced on the immune system. But in a severe infection or in a situation where the immune system is overly sensitized to an antigen (such as in allergic reactions) or there is a massive flood of antigens (as can happen with endotoxic bacteria) the correct set point might never be reached. Also because of downregulation of Th1 immunity by cortisol and other signaling molecules, certain types of infection, (notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis) can trick the body into getting locked in the wrong mode of attack, using an antibody-mediated humoral response when a cellular response is needed. Lymphocytes include the B-cell lymphocytes that are the antibody-producing cells of the body, and are thus the main agents of humoral immunity. A larger number of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and skin means the body is increasing its humoral immune response. B-cell lymphocytes release antibodies into the bloodstream. These antibodies lower infection through three main pathways: neutralization, opsonization, and complement activation. Antibodies neutralize pathogens by binding to surface adhering proteins, keeping pathogens from binding to host cells. In opsonization, antibodies bind to the pathogen and create a target for phagocytic immune cells to find and latch onto, allowing them to destroy the pathogen more easily. Finally antibodies can also activate complement molecules which can combine in various ways to promote opsonization or even act directly to lyse a bacteria. There are many different kinds of antibody and their production is highly complex, involving several types of lymphocyte, but in general lymphocytes and other antibody regulating and producing cells will migrate to the lymph nodes to aid in the release of these antibodies into the bloodstream. Rapid administration of corticosterone (the endogenous type I and type II receptor agonist) or RU28362 (a specific type II receptor agonist) to adrenalectomized animals induced changes in leukocyte distribution. On the other side of things, there are natural killer cells; these cells have the ability to take down larger in size threats like bacteria, parasites, and tumor cells. A separate study found that cortisol effectively disarmed natural killer cells, downregulating the expression of their natural cytotoxicity receptors. Prolactin has the opposite effect. It increases the expression of cytotoxicity receptors on natural killer cells, increasing their firepower. Cortisol stimulates many copper enzymes (often to 50% of their total potential), including lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that cross-links collagen and elastin. Especially valuable for immune response is cortisol's stimulation of the superoxide dismutase, since this copper enzyme is almost certainly used by the body to permit superoxides to poison bacteria. Some viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, are known to suppress the secretion of stress hormones to avoid the organism's immune response, thus avoiding the immune protection of the organism. These viruses suppress cortisol by producing a protein that mimics the human ACTH hormone but is incomplete and does not have hormonal activity. ACTH is a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol and other steroid hormones. However, the organism makes antibodies against this viral protein, and those antibodies also kill the human ACTH hormone, which leads to the suppression of adrenal gland function. Such adrenal suppression is a way for a virus to evade immune detection and elimination. This viral strategy can have severe consequences for the host (human that is infected by the virus), as cortisol is essential for regulating various physiological processes, such as metabolism, blood pressure, inflammation, and immune response. A lack of cortisol can result in a condition called adrenal insufficiency, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Adrenal insufficiency can also impair the ability of the host to cope with stress and infections, as cortisol helps to mobilize energy sources, increase heart rate, and downregulate non-essential metabolic processes during stress. Therefore, by suppressing cortisol production, some viruses can escape the immune system and weaken the host's overall health and resilience. == Other effects == === Metabolism === ==== Glucose ==== Cortisol counteracts insulin, contributes to hyperglycemia by stimulating gluconeogenesis and inhibits the peripheral use of glucose (insulin resistance) by decreasing the translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT4) to the cell membrane. Cortisol also increases glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) in the liver, storing glucose in easily accessible form. ==== Bone and collagen ==== Cortisol reduces bone formation, favoring long-term development of osteoporosis (progressive bone disease). The mechanism behind this is two-fold: cortisol stimulates the production of RANKL by osteoblasts which stimulates, through binding to RANK receptors, the activity of osteoclasts – cells responsible for calcium resorption from bone – and also inhibits the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG) which acts as a decoy receptor and captures some RANKL before it can activate the osteoclasts through RANK. In other words, when RANKL binds to OPG, no response occurs as opposed to the binding to RANK which leads to the activation of osteoclasts. It transports potassium out of cells in exchange for an equal number of sodium ions (see above). This can trigger the hyperkalemia of metabolic shock from surgery. Cortisol also reduces calcium absorption in the intestine. Cortisol down-regulates the synthesis of collagen. ==== Amino acid ==== Cortisol raises the free amino acids in the serum by inhibiting collagen formation, decreasing amino acid uptake by muscle, and inhibiting protein synthesis. Cortisol (as opticortinol) may inversely inhibit IgA precursor cells in the intestines of calves. Cortisol also inhibits IgA in serum, as it does IgM; however, it is not shown to inhibit IgE. === Electrolyte balance === Cortisol increases glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow from the kidneys thus increasing phosphate excretion, as well as increasing sodium and water retention and potassium excretion by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors. It also increases sodium and water absorption and potassium excretion in the intestines. ==== Sodium ==== Cortisol promotes sodium absorption through the small intestine of mammals. Sodium depletion, however, does not affect cortisol levels so cortisol cannot be used to regulate serum sodium. Cortisol's original purpose may have been sodium transport. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that freshwater fish use cortisol to stimulate sodium inward, while saltwater fish have a cortisol-based system for expelling excess sodium. ==== Potassium ==== A sodium load augments the intense potassium excretion by cortisol. Corticosterone is comparable to cortisol in this case. For potassium to move out of the cell, cortisol moves an equal number of sodium ions into the cell. This should make pH regulation much easier (unlike the normal potassium-deficiency situation, in which two sodium ions move in for each three potassium ions that move out—closer to the deoxycorticosterone effect). === Stomach and kidneys === Cortisol stimulates gastric-acid secretion. Cortisol's only direct effect on the hydrogen-ion excretion of the kidneys is to stimulate the excretion of ammonium ions by deactivating the renal glutaminase enzyme. === Memory === Cortisol works with adrenaline (epinephrine) to create memories of short-term emotional events; this is the proposed mechanism for storage of flash bulb memories, and may originate as a means to remember what to avoid in the future. However, long-term exposure to cortisol damages cells in the hippocampus; this damage results in impaired learning. === Diurnal cycles === Diurnal cycles of cortisol levels are found in humans. === Stress === Sustained stress can lead to high levels of circulating cortisol (regarded as one of the more important of the several ""stress hormones""). === Effects during pregnancy === During human pregnancy, increased fetal production of cortisol between weeks 30 and 32 initiates production of fetal lung pulmonary surfactant to promote maturation of the lungs. In fetal lambs, glucocorticoids (principally cortisol) increase after about day 130, with lung surfactant increasing greatly, in response, by about day 135, and although lamb fetal cortisol is mostly of maternal origin during the first 122 days, 88% or more is of fetal origin by day 136 of gestation. Although the timing of fetal cortisol concentration elevation in sheep may vary somewhat, it averages about 11.8 days before the onset of labor. In several livestock species (e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs), the surge of fetal cortisol late in gestation triggers the onset of parturition by removing the progesterone block of cervical dilation and myometrial contraction. The mechanisms yielding this effect on progesterone differ among species. In the sheep, where progesterone sufficient for maintaining pregnancy is produced by the placenta after about day 70 of gestation, the prepartum fetal cortisol surge induces placental enzymatic conversion of progesterone to estrogen. (The elevated level of estrogen stimulates prostaglandin secretion and oxytocin receptor development.) Exposure of fetuses to cortisol during gestation can have a variety of developmental outcomes, including alterations in prenatal and postnatal growth patterns. In marmosets, a species of New World primates, pregnant females have varying levels of cortisol during gestation, both within and between females. Infants born to mothers with high gestational cortisol during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower rates of growth in body mass indices than infants born to mothers with low gestational cortisol (about 20% lower). However, postnatal growth rates in these high-cortisol infants were more rapid than low-cortisol infants later in postnatal periods, and complete catch-up in growth had occurred by 540 days of age. These results suggest that gestational exposure to cortisol in fetuses has important potential fetal programming effects on both pre and postnatal growth in primates. === Cortisol face === Increased cortisol levels may lead to facial swelling and bloating, creating a round and puffy appearance, referred to as ""cortisol face."" == Synthesis and release == Cortisol is produced in the human body by the adrenal gland's zona fasciculata, the second of three layers comprising the adrenal cortex. This cortex forms the outer ""bark"" of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus of a brain. Secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus triggers cells in its neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the vascular system, through which blood carries it to the adrenal cortex. ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol and other glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. == Testing of individuals == Normal values indicated in the following tables pertain to humans (normal levels vary among species). Measured cortisol levels, and therefore reference ranges, depend on the sample type, analytical method used, and factors such as age and sex. Test results should, therefore, always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that produced the result. An individual's cortisol levels can be detected in blood, serum, urine, saliva, and sweat. Using the molecular weight of 362.460 g/mole, the conversion factor from μg/dL to nmol/L is approximately 27.6; thus, 10 μg/dL is about 276 nmol/L. Cortisol follows a circadian rhythm, and to accurately measure cortisol levels is best to test four times per day through saliva. An individual may have normal total cortisol but have a lower than normal level during a certain period of the day and a higher than normal level during a different period. Therefore, some scholars question the clinical utility of cortisol measurement. Cortisol is lipophilic, and is transported bound to transcortin (also known as corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)) and albumin, while only a small part of the total serum cortisol is unbound and has biological activity. This binding of cortisol to transcortin is accomplished through hydrophobic interactions in which cortisol binds in a 1:1 ratio. Serum cortisol assays measures total cortisol, and its results may be misleading for patients with altered serum protein concentrations. The salivary cortisol test avoids this problem because only free cortisol can pass through the blood-saliva barrier. Transcortin particles are too large to pass through this barrier, that consists of epithelial cell layers of the oral mucosa and salivary glands. Cortisol may be incorporated into hair from blood, sweat, and sebum. A 3 centimeter segment of scalp hair can represent 3 months of hair growth, although growth rates can vary in different regions of the scalp. Cortisol in hair is a reliable indicator of chronic cortisol exposure. Automated immunoassays lack specificity and show significant cross-reactivity due to interactions with structural analogs of cortisol, and show differences between assays. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can improve specificity and sensitivity. == Disorders of cortisol production == Some medical disorders are related to abnormal cortisol production, such as: Primary hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome): excessive levels of cortisol Secondary hypercortisolism (pituitary tumor resulting in Cushing's disease, pseudo-Cushing's syndrome) Primary hypocortisolism (Addison's disease, Nelson's syndrome): insufficient levels of cortisol Secondary hypocortisolism (pituitary tumor, Sheehan's syndrome) == Regulation == The primary control of cortisol is the pituitary gland peptide, ACTH, which probably controls cortisol by controlling the movement of calcium into the cortisol-secreting target cells. ACTH is in turn controlled by the hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is under nervous control. CRH acts synergistically with arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, and epinephrine. (In swine, which do not produce arginine vasopressin, lysine vasopressin acts synergistically with CRH.) When activated macrophages start to secrete IL-1, which synergistically with CRH increases ACTH, T-cells also secrete glucosteroid response modifying factor (GRMF), as well as IL-1; both increase the amount of cortisol required to inhibit almost all the immune cells. Immune cells then assume their own regulation, but at a higher cortisol setpoint. The increase in cortisol in diarrheic calves is minimal over healthy calves, however, and falls over time. The cells do not lose all their fight-or-flight override because of interleukin-1's synergism with CRH. Cortisol even has a negative feedback effect on interleukin-1—especially useful to treat diseases that force the hypothalamus to secrete too much CRH, such as those caused by endotoxic bacteria. The suppressor immune cells are not affected by GRMF, so the immune cells' effective setpoint may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes. GRMF affects primarily the liver (rather than the kidneys) for some physiological processes. High-potassium media (which stimulates aldosterone secretion in vitro) also stimulate cortisol secretion from the fasciculata zone of canine adrenals — unlike corticosterone, upon which potassium has no effect. Potassium loading also increases ACTH and cortisol in humans. This is probably the reason why potassium deficiency causes cortisol to decline (as mentioned) and causes a decrease in conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. This may also have a role in rheumatoid-arthritis pain; cell potassium is always low in RA. Ascorbic acid presence, particularly in high doses has also been shown to mediate response to psychological stress and speed the decrease of the levels of circulating cortisol in the body post-stress. This can be evidenced through a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and decreased salivary cortisol levels after treatment with ascorbic acid. === Factors increasing cortisol levels === Viral infections increase cortisol levels through activation of the HPA axis by cytokines. Intense (high VO2 max) or prolonged aerobic exercise transiently increases cortisol levels to increase gluconeogenesis and maintain blood glucose; however, cortisol declines to normal levels after eating (i.e., restoring a neutral energy balance). Severe trauma or stressful events can elevate cortisol levels in the blood for prolonged periods. Low-carbohydrate diets cause a short-term increase in resting cortisol (≈3 weeks), and increase the cortisol response to aerobic exercise in the short- and long-term. Increase in the concentration of ghrelin, the hunger stimulating hormone, increases levels of cortisol. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === Cortisol is synthesized from cholesterol. Synthesis takes place in the zona fasciculata of an adrenal cortex. The name ""cortisol"" is derived from the word 'cortex'. Cortex means ""the outer layer""—a reference to the adrenal cortex, the part of the adrenal gland where cortisol is produced. While the adrenal cortex in humans also produces aldosterone in the zona glomerulosa and some sex hormones in the zona reticularis, cortisol is its main secretion in humans and several other species. In cattle, corticosterone levels may approach or exceed cortisol levels. In humans, the medulla of the adrenal gland lies under its cortex, mainly secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) under sympathetic stimulation. Synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland is stimulated by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland with ACTH; ACTH production is, in turn, stimulated by CRH, which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and catalyzed by Cytochrome P450SCC (side-chain cleavage enzyme). === Metabolism === ==== 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases ==== Cortisol is metabolized reversibly to cortisone by the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system (11-beta HSD), which consists of two enzymes: 11-beta HSD1 and 11-beta HSD2. The metabolism of cortisol to cortisone involves oxidation of the hydroxyl group at the 11-beta position. ==== A-ring reductases (5alpha- and 5beta-reductases) ==== Cortisol is also metabolized irreversibly into 5-alpha tetrahydrocortisol (5-alpha THF) and 5-beta tetrahydrocortisol (5-beta THF), reactions for which 5-alpha reductase and 5-beta-reductase are the rate-limiting factors, respectively. 5-Beta reductase is also the rate-limiting factor in the conversion of cortisone to tetrahydrocortisone. ==== Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A monooxygenases ==== Cortisol is also metabolized irreversibly into 6β-hydroxycortisol by cytochrome p450-3A monooxygenases, mainly, CYP3A4. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 may accelerate cortisol clearance. == Chemistry == Cortisol is a naturally occurring pregnane corticosteroid and is also known as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. == Animals == In animals, cortisol is often used as an indicator of stress and can be measured in blood, saliva, urine, hair, and faeces. == See also == Cortisone, a hormone Cortisol awakening response List of corticosteroids Membrane glucocorticoid receptor == References == == External links == Cortisol MS Spectrum Cortisol: analyte monograph – The Association for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine",Hydrasson,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.33338290452957153), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -2.5776860184123507e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.014177384786307812), (' MED', -0.009833889082074165), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6049798130989075), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03228414058685303)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS; https://www.catalog.md/drugs/hydrasson-.html,https://www.fishersci.ca/shop/products/hydrocortisone-98-thermo-scientific/p-7023165 ', [])"
2100,"('Inulin', 'Agave inulin', 'Inulin powder', 'Inulin - liquid', 'Liquid agave inulin')","Food, Medical","Inulins are a group of naturally occurring polysaccharides produced by many types of plants, industrially most often extracted from chicory. The inulins belong to a class of dietary fibers known as fructans. Inulin is used by some plants as a means of storing energy and is typically found in roots or rhizomes. Most plants that synthesize and store inulin do not store other forms of carbohydrate such as starch. In 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved inulin as a dietary fiber ingredient used to improve the nutritional value of manufactured food products. Using inulin to measure kidney function is the ""gold standard"" for comparison with other means of estimating glomerular filtration rate. == Origin and history == Inulin is a natural storage carbohydrate present in more than 36,000 species of plants, including agave, wheat, onion, bananas, garlic, asparagus, Jerusalem artichoke, and chicory. For these plants, inulin is used as an energy reserve and for regulating cold resistance. Because it is soluble in water, it is osmotically active. Certain plants can change the osmotic potential of their cells by changing the degree of polymerization of inulin molecules by hydrolysis. By changing osmotic potential without changing the total amount of carbohydrate, plants can withstand cold and drought during winter periods. Inulin was discovered in 1804 by German scientist Valentin Rose. He found ""a peculiar substance"" from Inula helenium roots by boiling-water extraction. In the 1920s, J. Irvine used chemical methods such as methylation to study the molecular structure of inulin, and he designed the isolation method for this new anhydrofructose. During studies of renal tubules in the 1930s, researchers searched for a substance that could serve as a biomarker that is not reabsorbed or secreted after introduction into tubules. A. N. Richards introduced inulin because of its high molecular weight and its resistance to enzymes. Inulin is used to determine glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys. == Chemical structure and properties == Inulin is a heterogeneous collection of fructose polymers. It consists of chain-terminating glucosyl moieties and a repetitive fructosyl moiety, which are linked by β(2,1) bonds. The degree of polymerization (DP) of standard inulin ranges from 2 to 60. After removing the fractions with DP lower than 10 during manufacturing process, the remaining product is high-performance inulin. Some articles considered the fractions with DP lower than 10 as short-chained fructo-oligosaccharides, and only called the longer-chained molecules inulin. Because of the β(2,1) linkages, inulin is not digested by enzymes in the human alimentary system, contributing to its functional properties: reduced calorie value, dietary fiber, and prebiotic effects. Without color and odor, it has little impact on sensory characteristics of food products. Oligofructose has 35% of the sweetness of sucrose, and its sweetening profile is similar to sugar. Standard inulin is slightly sweet, while high-performance inulin is not. Its solubility is higher than the classical fibers. When thoroughly mixed with liquid, inulin forms a gel and a white creamy structure, which is similar to fat. Its three-dimensional gel network, consisting of insoluble submicron crystalline inulin particles, immobilizes a large amount of water, assuring its physical stability. It can also improve the stability of foams and emulsions. == Uses == === Harvesting and extraction === Chicory root is the main source of extraction for commercial production of inulin. The extraction process for inulin is similar to obtaining sugar from sugar beets. After harvest, the chicory roots are sliced and washed, then soaked in a solvent (hot water or ethanol); the inulin is then isolated, purified, and spray dried. Inulin may also be synthesized from sucrose. === Processed foods === Inulin received no-objection status as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including long-chain inulin as GRAS. In the early 21st century, the use of inulin in processed foods was due in part to its adaptable characteristics for manufacturing. It is approved by the FDA as an ingredient to enhance the dietary fiber value of manufactured foods. Its flavor ranges from bland to subtly sweet (about 10% of the sweetness of sugar/sucrose). It can be used to replace sugar, fat, and flour. This is advantageous because inulin contains 25–35% of the food energy of carbohydrates (starch, sugar). In addition to being a versatile ingredient, inulin provides nutritional advantages by increasing calcium absorption and possibly magnesium absorption, while promoting the growth of intestinal bacteria. Chicory inulin is reported to increase absorption of calcium in young women with lower calcium absorption and in young men. In terms of nutrition, it is considered a form of soluble fiber and is sometimes categorized as a prebiotic. It is also considered a FODMAP, a class of carbohydrates which are rapidly fermented in the colon producing gas. Although FODMAPs may cause certain digestive discomfort in some people, they produce potentially favorable alterations in the intestinal flora that contribute to maintaining health of the colon. Due to the body's limited ability to process fructans, inulin has minimal increasing impact on blood sugar, and may potentially have use in managing blood sugar-related illnesses, such as metabolic syndrome. === Medical === Inulin and its analog sinistrin are used to help measure kidney function by determining the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal (kidney) glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per unit time. While inulin is the gold standard for measuring the GFR, it is rarely used in practice due to the expense and difficulty in conducting the test; it requires intravenous (IV) access for the infusion of inulin as well as up to twelve blood samples taken from the patient over the course of four hours. To determine the glomerular filtration rate in humans, a large initial dose of inulin is injected, which is followed by a constant infusion of inulin at a rate which compensates for its loss in the urine, thus maintaining a reasonably constant level in the plasma.: 228 In the United States, creatinine clearance is more widely used to estimate GFR. A 2017 systematic review of low-to-moderate quality clinical trial research showed that dietary supplementation with inulin-type fructans reduced blood levels of low-density cholesterol, a biomarker of cardiovascular disease. === Possible side effects === In doses of 15–50 grams per day, dietary inulin increases the frequency of defecation. Possible side effects of regularly using inulin in the diet include gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and stomach inflammation in people with allergies to inulin. === Industrial use === Nonhydrolyzed inulin can also be directly converted to ethanol in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process, which may have potential for converting crops high in inulin into ethanol for fuel. == Biochemistry == Inulins are polymers composed mainly of fructose units (fructans), and typically have a terminal glucose. The fructose units in inulins are joined by a β(2→1) glycosidic bond. The molecule is almost exclusively linear, with only a few percent branching.: 58 In general, plant inulins contain between 2 and 70 fructose units: 58 or sometimes as high as 200,: 17 but molecules with less than 10 units are called fructo-oligosaccharides, the simplest being 1-kestose, which has two fructose units and one glucose unit. Bacterial inulin is more highly branched (more than 15% branching) and contains on the order of tens or hundreds of subunits.: 17 Inulins are named in the following manner, where n is the number of fructose residues and py is the abbreviation for pyranosyl: Inulins with a terminal glucose are known as alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-[beta-D-fructofuranosyl](n-1)-D-fructofuranosides, abbreviated as GpyFn. Inulins without glucose are beta-D-fructopyranosyl-[D-fructofuranosyl](n-1)-D-fructofuranosides, abbreviated as FpyFn. Hydrolysis of inulins may yield fructo-oligosaccharides, which are oligomers with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 10 or less. == Calculation of glomerular filtration rate == Inulin is uniquely treated by nephrons in that it is completely filtered at the glomerulus but neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the tubules. This property of inulin allows the clearance of inulin to be used clinically as a highly accurate measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) — the rate of plasma from the afferent arteriole that is filtered into Bowman's capsule measured in ml/min. It is informative to contrast the properties of inulin with those of para-aminohippuric acid (PAH). PAH is partially filtered from plasma at the glomerulus and not reabsorbed by the tubules, in a manner identical to inulin. PAH is different from inulin in that the fraction of PAH that bypasses the glomerulus and enters the nephron's tubular cells (via the peritubular capillaries) is completely secreted. Renal clearance of PAH is thus useful in calculation of renal plasma flow (RPF), which empirically is (1-hematocrit) times renal blood flow. Of note, the clearance of PAH is reflective only of RPF to portions of the kidney that deal with urine formation, and, thus, underestimates the actual RPF by about 10%. The measurement of GFR by inulin or sinistrin is still considered the gold standard. However, it has now been largely replaced by other, simpler measures that are approximations of GFR. These measures, which involve clearance of such substrates as EDTA, iohexol, cystatin C, 125I-iothalamate (sodium radioiothalamate), the chromium radioisotope 51Cr (chelated with EDTA), and creatinine, have had their utility confirmed in large cohorts of patients with chronic kidney disease. For both inulin and creatinine, the calculations involve concentrations in the urine and in the serum. However, unlike creatinine, inulin is not naturally present in the body. This is an advantage of inulin (because the amount infused will be known) and a disadvantage (because an infusion is necessary). == Metabolism in vivo == Inulin is indigestible by the human enzymes ptyalin and amylase which are adapted to digest starch and as a result, it passes through much of the digestive system intact. Only in the colon do bacteria metabolise inulin with the release of significant quantities of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and/or methane. Inulin-containing foods can be rather gassy, especially for those unaccustomed to inulin and these foods should be consumed in moderation at first. Inulin is a soluble fiber, one of three types of dietary fiber including soluble, insoluble and resistant starch. Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gelatinous material. Some soluble fibers may help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels. Because normal digestion does not break inulin down into monosaccharides, it does not elevate blood sugar levels and may therefore be helpful in the management of diabetes. Inulin also stimulates the growth of bacteria in the gut. Inulin passes through the stomach and duodenum undigested and is highly available to the gut bacterial flora. This makes it similar to resistant starches and other fermentable carbohydrates. Some traditional diets contain over 20g per day of inulin or fructo-oligosaccharides. The diet of the prehistoric hunter-forager in the Chihuahuan Desert has been estimated to include 135 g per day of inulin-type fructans. Many foods naturally high in inulin or fructo-oligosaccharides such as chicory, garlic, and leek have been seen as ""stimulants of good health"" for centuries. As of 2013, no regulatory authority had permitted health claims in the marketing of prebiotics as a class. Inulin's health effects had been studied in small clinical trials which showed that it causes gastrointestinal adverse effects such as bloating and flatulence and it does not affect triglyceride levels or development of fatty liver. It may also help to prevent travelers' diarrhea and may help increase calcium absorption in adolescents. == Natural sources == Plants that contain high concentrations of inulin include: Agave (Agave spp.) Banana and plantain (Musaceae) Burdock (Arctium lappa) Camas (Camassia spp.) Chicory (Cichorium intybus) Coneflower (Echinacea spp.) Costus (Saussurea lappa) Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) Elecampane (Inula helenium) Garlic (Allium sativum) Globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus, Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus) Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) Jicama (Pachyrhizus erosus) Leopard's bane (Arnica montana) Mugwort root (Artemisia vulgaris) Onion (Allium cepa) Wild yam (Dioscorea spp.) Yacón (Smallanthus sonchifolius) == References ==",Inulin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.16094432771205902), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -1.0445127372804563e-05), (' MED', -0.1291741281747818), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00862887967377901), (' INDUSTR', -0.0005610156804323196), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.003826915519312024), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0002563863235991448), ('ĠMED', -0.04460553079843521), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20146839320659637)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin ', [])"

2102,"('Gadobutrol', 'Zk 135079')",Medical,"Gadobutrol (INN) (Gd-DO3A-butrol) is a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent (GBCA). It received marketing approval in Canada and the United States. As of 2007, it was the only GBCA approved at 1.0 molar concentrations. Gadobutrol is marketed by Bayer AG as Gadovist, by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals as Gadavist, and by GE HealthCare as PixxoScan. In India, it is also marketed by Vivere Imaging as Viv-butrol. == Medical uses == Gadobutrol is a medicinal product used in diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in adults and children. It provides contrast enhancement during cranial, spinal, breast, or other investigations. In the central nervous system, Gadobutrol works by highlighting any areas with disrupted blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity. In breast tissue, Gadobutrol exposes the presence and extent of malignant breast disease. Similarly, gadobutrol is also used in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) for the diagnosis of stroke, detection of tumor perfusion, and presence of focal cerebral ischemia. Gadobutrol should be administered intravenously by medical professionals only. Sterile techniques must always be used when preparing and administering the injection. When compared to other GBCAs, Gadobutrol is available in a more concentrated form (1 mmol/mL) to alleviate a high volume of administration. The recommended dose is 0.1 mL/kg body weight. == Adverse effects == The safety of gadobutrol was assessed throughout clinical trials and post-marketing, for multiple applications, in diverse populations and at multiple doses. The most severe reaction to gadobutrol is nephrogenic system fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drug. The risk is highest among patients with chronic, impaired kidney function and those with acute kidney injury. NSF may result in death or severe impairment of the skin, muscle, and internal organs. Patients who have experienced a previous adverse reaction to another contrast agent, have bronchial asthma, and/or allergic disorders have an increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to gadobutrol. Hypersensitivity reactions can include anaphylactoid and anaphylactic reactions ranging from mild to severe. These reactions are uncommon, however, monitoring of the patient for signs and symptoms during and after administration of gadobutrol is necessary. Other, more mild adverse reactions have been observed in a small fraction of patients after administration. These reactions can include but are not limited to the following: Headache Nausea and/or vomiting Injection site reactions (cold feeling, warmth, pain, or burning) Dysgeusia (unpleasant taste in mouth) Feeling hot Dizziness Rash Erythema (reddening of the skin) Dyspnea (difficulty breathing) Paresthesia (burning feeling) == Use in specific populations == === Pregnancy === The FDA has labeled gadobutrol as pregnancy category C. Sufficient studies of gadobutrol in pregnant human females have not been conducted. However, other GBCAs have been shown to cross the placenta in humans and result in fetal exposure, but do not show adverse effects to the fetus. Animal studies have been conducted in which pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to 12 and 8 times the human equivalent dose based on body surface area respectively. These exposures often resulted in retardation of the embryo development and embryo death. Embryo retardation did not occur in monkeys administered up to 8 times the recommended human dose but did result in embryo death. The animals were administered multiple doses repeatedly over days, therefore, their exposure levels were much higher than those experienced in humans. Gadobutrol should only be administered in pregnant females if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. === Breast-feeding === It is unknown the amount of Gadobutrol transferred to milk in humans. Limited data exists on the excretion of other GBCAs in human breast milk, but suggest a transfer rate of 0.01% to 0.04% of the administered material to breast milk. Non-clinical data for Gadrobutrol suggests that less than 0.01% is excreted into breast milk upon intravenous administration of the recommended dose. Further data suggests that absorption via the GI tract is very poor (approximately 5%). For the highest level of safety, breastfeeding should be discontinued for 24 hours upon administration of gadobutrol and any milk properly disposed of. === Pediatrics === The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics have been well established in children ages 2–17 years. It was found that no adjustment of the recommended 0.1 mL/kg body weight dose was necessary. The safety and efficacy data for children under the age of 2 years is limited but has demonstrated that use of the 0.1 mL/kg body weight dose may be used in this population. However, it is recommended that the lowest possible dose be utilized and that a period of at least 7 days in between doses be allowed for elimination of the agent from the body. === Geriatrics === Clinical data has shown that there is no difference in the safety or efficacy of gadobutrol in subjects of 65 years and older when compared with those under the age of 65 years. There are no required special precautions and/or dose adjustment for those without renal impairment. === Renally impaired population === It is recommended that renal impairment be assessed for all patients prior to administration of gadobutrol. It is not necessary to adjust the dose in these populations, however, gadobutrol will need to be removed from the body using hemodialysis. == Interactions == There are no known drug interactions with gadobutrol. However, it should not be mixed with other drugs. == Mechanism of action == Gadobutrol is a paramagnetic macrocyclic contrast agent administered intravenously for use in magnetic resonance imaging. The contrast-enhancing effect is a result of the neutral complex of gadolinium and dihydroxy-hydroxymethylpropyl- tetraazacyclododecane-triacetic acid (butrol), which works to decrease differences in longitudinal relaxation times (T1) and differences in spin-spin or transverse relaxation times (T2). These relaxation times, coupled with differences in proton density, are responsible for the variation in intensity of radio frequency signals which contribute to an MRI's tissue visualization capabilities. Greater signal enhancement, and therefore, greater tissue visualization, is achieved with increased shortening of T1 and T2. == History == === Commercialization === Gadobutrol was first approved in Switzerland in 1998 for use in contrast-enhanced MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord. Since then, it has been approved and marketed in 65 other countries including all European Union countries, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Korea, Russia, and Brazil, for a multitude of uses. Gadobutrol was first approved for use in MRIs of the central nervous system in the United States in 2011. It is currently manufactured by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc. and marketed under the brand name Gadavist. In 2015, Gadavist was approved by the FDA as the first contrast agent safe for use in children under the age of 2 years old. Most recently, in early 2016, Gadavist was approved in the United States for use in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography. === Research and clinical trials === Gadavist was approved in the United States in 2011 after presenting findings from 43 clinical studies that had primarily taken place in Asia and the European Union, in addition to one phase 2 and two phase 3 clinical trials conducted in the United States. The multi-center, randomized, double-blind phase 3 clinical trials (one completed without the active comparator arm) enrolled 402 patients referred for a contrast-enhanced MRI of the CNS, both male and female, over the age of 18. Each patient received a single dose of gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) via intravenous injection, followed by a single dose of gadoteridol (ProHance) at the approved dose (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) via intravenous injection, or vice versa. The study evaluated safety and efficacy of gadobutrol. From these phase 3 clinical trials, the following conclusions were made: Combined gadobutrol-enhanced plus unenhanced images compared to unenhanced images are: Superior in diagnostic performance Superior for the lesion visualization variables contrast enhancement, border delineation and internal morphology Non-inferior for the number of lesions detected Gadobutrol was shown to be non-inferior to ProHance with respect to the visualization variables contrast enhancement, border delineation and internal morphology, as well as number of lesions detected Gadobutrol showed higher sensitivity than ProHance for the determination of lesion malignancy Gadobutrol-enhanced images were consistently favored over ProHance-enhanced images by all 3 blinded readers Prior to approval for use in children under the age of 2 years old in 2015, a phase 1 clinical trial was conducted. Pediatric patients, scheduled for a routine contrast-enhanced MRI examination of any body region, both male and female, under the age of 2 years old could be enrolled in the study. The open-label, multi-center, pharmacokinetic and safety test studied the way gadobutrol was taken into, moved around, and was eliminated from the body of the infants. The study also evaluated safety, tolerability and efficacy of the standard dose of gadobutrol, 0.1 mmol/kg (0.1 mL/kg) of body weight. The clinical trial was sponsored by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc. Prior to approval for use in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in early 2006, a phase 3 clinical trial was conducted. Patients referred for a routine magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), both male and female, over the age of 18 years old could be enrolled in the study. The open-label, multi-center, blinded reading safety and efficacy study compared diagnostic results of gadobutrol enhanced MRA images with no-contrast MRA images. Patients received a single intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol prior to scanning. The MRA image results were then blindly read by qualified personnel. The clinical trial was sponsored by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc. === Regulatory === The only US patent for Gadobutrol is US5980864A, granted in November 1999, to Schering AG. The patent is for the process using 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane butyltriols to produce the gadolinium (III) complex of 10-(1-hydroxymethyl-2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-1,4,7-triscarboxymethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (gadobutrol). The patent defends the use of this metal complex as a superior diagnostic medium. In 2006, Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc. absorbed Schering AG, and in November 2007, the patent was transferred to Bayer Schering Pharma. After FDA approval in 2011, the patent was granted an extension of 1,470 days and the trade name Gadavist became associated with the patent. In February 2016, the patent was granted a second term extension, but expired in November 2016. === Packaging and purchasing === Gadobutrol contrast media is a clear, colorless-to-pale yellow solution of 1 mmol/mL formulation, available in single dose vials (2 mL, 7.5 mL, 10mL, and 15 mL), single dose pre-filled injections (7.5 mL, 10 mL, 15 mL), and pharmacy bulk packages (30 mL and 65 mL) containing multiple vials. Gadobutrol is currently marketed in the United States under the name Gadavist, and in most other countries under the name Gadovist or Gadovist 1.0. Gadobutrol is not available for prescription and can only be administered by trained personnel. In 2016 Bayer-UK published prices for the product. == References ==",Gadobutrol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7165990357170813e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00043811736395582557)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gadobutrol-intravenous-route/description/drg-20074828,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadobutrol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30006819/ ', [])"

2104,"('Pindolol', 'Visken', 'Betapindol', 'Prinodolol', 'Carvisken')",Medical,"Pindolol, sold under the brand name Visken among others, is a nonselective beta blocker which is used in the treatment of hypertension. It is also an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, preferentially blocking inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors, and has been researched as an add-on therapy to various antidepressants, such as clomipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), in the treatment of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. == Medical uses == Pindolol is used for hypertension in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and also for angina pectoris outside the United States. When used alone for hypertension, pindolol can significantly lower blood pressure and heart rate, but the evidence base for its use is weak as the number of subjects in published studies is small. In some countries, pindolol is also used for arrhythmias and prophylaxis of acute stress reactions. == Contraindications == Similar to propranolol with an extra contraindication for hyperthyroidism. In patients with thyrotoxicosis, possible deleterious effects from long-term use of pindolol have not been adequately appraised. Beta-blockade may mask the clinical signs of continuing hyperthyroidism or complications, and give a false impression of improvement. Therefore, abrupt withdrawal of pindolol may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including thyroid storm. Pindolol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and is therefore used with caution in angina pectoris. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Pindolol is a first generation, non-selective beta blocker in the class of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists. On the receptor level it is a competitive partial agonist. It possesses intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, meaning it has some degree of agonist effects in the absence of competing ligands. Pindolol shows membrane-stabilizing effects like quinidine, possibly accounting for its antiarrhythmic effects. It also acts as a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist (intrinsic activity = 20–25%) or functional antagonist. === Pharmacokinetics === Pindolol is rapidly and well absorbed from the GI tract. It undergoes some first-pass-metabolization leading to an oral bioavailability of 50-95%. Patients with uremia may have a reduced bioavailability. Food does not alter the bioavailability, but may increase the resorption. Following an oral single dose of 20 mg peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1–2 hours. The effect of pindolol on pulse rate (lowering) is evident after 3 hours. Despite the rather short halflife of 3–4 hours, hemodynamic effects persist for 24 hours after administration. Plasma halflives are increased to 3–11.5 hours in patients with renal impairment, to 7–15 hours in elderly patients, and from 2.5 to 30 hours in patients with liver cirrhosis. Approximately 2/3 of pindolol is metabolized in the liver giving hydroxylates, which are found in the urine as gluconurides and ethereal sulfates. The remaining 1/3 of pindolol is excreted in urine in unchanged form. == History == Pindolol was patented by Sandoz in 1969 and was launched in the US in 1977. Towards end of February 2020 FDA added this product to their ""DRUG SHORTAGE"" list stating this is due to ""Shortage of an active ingredient"" and this is likely to be related to Coronavirus outbreak and related supply chain impacts. == Research == === Depression === Pindolol has been investigated as an add-on drug to antidepressant therapy with SSRIs like fluoxetine in the treatment of depression since 1994. The rationale behind this strategy has its basis in the fact that pindolol is an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. Presynaptic and somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors act as inhibitory autoreceptors, inhibit serotonin release, and are pro-depressive in their action. This is in contrast to postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which mediate antidepressant effects. By blocking 5-HT1A autoreceptors at doses that are selective for them over postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, pindolol may be able to disinhibit serotonin release and thereby improve the antidepressant effects of SSRIs and clomipramine. The results of augmentation therapy with pindolol have been encouraging in early studies of low quality. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found no overall significant benefit at 2.5 mg although, with regard to patients with SSRI-resistant depression, ""once-daily high-dose pindolol (7.5 mg qd) appears to show a promising benefit in these patients"". On the other hand, a 2017 systematic review indicated that pindolol's efficacy has been demonstrated in high evidence studies. Initiating pharmacotherapy with an SSRI plus pindolol might accelerate the SSRI's therapeutic impact. Pindolol's antidepressive efficacy may predominantly result from its ability to desensitize 5-HT1A autoreceptors. === Others === Pindolol is a potent scavenger of nitric oxide. This effect is potentiated by sodium bicarbonate. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis has an anxiolytic effect in animals. == See also == Bopindolol == References ==",Visken,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.5205356804654e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002661589242052287)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindolol,https://www.rxlist.com/visken-drug.htm,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/visken ', [])"
2105,"('Thiamine (hydrochloride)', 'Thiamine chloride (hydrochloride)', 'Vitamin b1 (hydrochloride)', 'Thiamine', 'Thiamin')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Thiamine, also known as thiamin and vitamin B1, is a vitamin – an essential micronutrient for humans and animals. It is found in food and commercially synthesized to be a dietary supplement or medication. Phosphorylated forms of thiamine are required for some metabolic reactions, including the breakdown of glucose and amino acids. Food sources of thiamine include whole grains, legumes, and some meats and fish. Grain processing removes much of the vitamin content, so in many countries cereals and flours are enriched with thiamine. Supplements and medications are available to treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and the disorders that result from it such as beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy. They are also used to treat maple syrup urine disease and Leigh syndrome. Supplements and medications are typically taken by mouth, but may also be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection. Thiamine supplements are generally well tolerated. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur when repeated doses are given by injection. Thiamine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication, and in some countries as a non-prescription dietary supplement. In 2022, it was the 288th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 500,000 prescriptions. == Definition == Thiamine is one of the B vitamins and is also known as vitamin B1. It is a cation that is usually supplied as a chloride salt. It is soluble in water, methanol and glycerol, but practically insoluble in less polar organic solvents. In the body, thiamine can form derivatives; the most well-characterized of which is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids. The chemical structure consists of an aminopyrimidine and a thiazolium ring linked by a methylene bridge. The thiazole is substituted with methyl and hydroxyethyl side chains. Thiamine is stable at acidic pH, but it is unstable in alkaline solutions and from exposure to heat. It reacts strongly in Maillard-type reactions. Oxidation yields the fluorescent derivative thiochrome, which can be used to determine the amount of the vitamin present in biological samples. == Deficiency == Well-known disorders caused by thiamine deficiency include beriberi, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, optic neuropathy, Leigh's disease, African seasonal ataxia (or Nigerian seasonal ataxia), and central pontine myelinolysis. Symptoms include malaise, weight loss, irritability and confusion. In Western countries, chronic alcoholism is a risk factor for deficiency. Also at risk are older adults, persons with HIV/AIDS or diabetes, and those who have had bariatric surgery. Varying degrees of thiamine insufficiency have been associated with the long-term use of diuretics. == Biological functions == Five natural thiamine phosphate derivatives are known: thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), adenosine thiamine diphosphate (AThDP) and adenosine thiamine triphosphate (AThTP). They are involved in many cellular processes. The best-characterized form is TPP, a coenzyme in the catabolism of sugars and amino acids. While its role is well-known, the non-coenzyme action of thiamine and derivatives may be realized through binding to proteins which do not use that mechanism. No physiological role is known for the monophosphate except as an intermediate in cellular conversion of thiamine to the di- and triphosphates. === Thiamine pyrophosphate === Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), also called thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), participates as a coenzyme in metabolic reactions, including those in which polarity inversion takes place. Its synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme thiamine diphosphokinase according to the reaction thiamine + ATP → TPP + AMP (EC 2.7.6.2). However, recent findings reveal that uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP), rather than ATP, is the preferred substrate for TPP synthesis in cells, with TPK1 showing a ~10-fold higher affinity for UTP. TPP is a coenzyme for several enzymes that catalyze the transfer of two-carbon units and in particular the dehydrogenation (decarboxylation and subsequent conjugation with coenzyme A) of 2-oxoacids (alpha-keto acids). The mechanism of action of TPP as a coenzyme relies on its ability to form an ylide. Examples include: Present in most species pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (also called α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase transketolase Present in some species: pyruvate decarboxylase (in yeast) several additional bacterial enzymes The enzymes transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) are important in carbohydrate metabolism. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. OGDH catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) to succinyl-CoA and CO2 during the citric acid cycle. The reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the citric acid cycle. The cytosolic enzyme transketolase is central to the pentose phosphate pathway, a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose sugars deoxyribose and ribose. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main energy transfer molecule for the cell. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the synthesis of myelin and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. === Thiamine triphosphate === ThTP is implicated in chloride channel activation in the neurons of mammals and other animals, although its role is not well understood. ThTP has been found in bacteria, fungi and plants, suggesting that it has other cellular roles. In Escherichia coli, it is implicated in the response to amino acid starvation. === Adenosine derivatives === AThDP exists in small amounts in vertebrate liver, but its role remains unknown. AThTP is present in E. coli, where it accumulates as a result of carbon starvation. In this bacterium, AThTP may account for up to 20% of total thiamine. It also exists in lesser amounts in yeast, roots of higher plants and animal tissue. == Medical uses == During pregnancy, thiamine is sent to the fetus via the placenta. Pregnant women have a greater requirement for the vitamin than other adults, especially during the third trimester. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum are at an increased risk of thiamine deficiency due to losses when vomiting. In lactating women, thiamine is delivered in breast milk even if it results in thiamine deficiency in the mother. Thiamine is important not only for mitochondrial membrane development, but also for synaptic membrane function. It has also been suggested that a deficiency hinders brain development in infants and may be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome. == Dietary recommendations == The US National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for thiamine in 1998. The EARs for thiamine for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg/day and 1.1 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.2 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy and for lactating females is 1.4 mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.2–0.3 mg/day and for children aged 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intakes (PRIs) instead of RDAs, and Average Requirements instead of EARs. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 0.1 mg thiamine per megajoule (MJ) of energy in their diet. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 239 kcal, an adult consuming 2390 kilocalories ought to be consuming 1.0 mg thiamine. This is slightly lower than the US RDA. Neither the National Academy of Medicine nor EFSA have set an upper intake level for thiamine, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. === Safety === Thiamine is generally well tolerated and non-toxic when administered orally. There are rare reports of adverse side effects when thiamine is given intravenously, including allergic reactions, nausea, lethargy, and impaired coordination. === Labeling === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value. Since 27 May 2016, the Daily Value has been 1.2 mg, in line with the RDA. == Sources == Thiamine is found in a wide variety of processed and whole foods, including lentils, peas, whole grains, pork, and nuts. A typical daily prenatal vitamin product contains around 1.5 mg of thiamine. === Food fortification === Some countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods such as wheat, rice or maize (corn) because processing lowers vitamin content. As of February 2022, 59 countries, mostly in North and Sub-Saharan Africa, require food fortification of wheat, rice or maize with thiamine or thiamine mononitrate. The amounts stipulated range from 2.0 to 10.0 mg/kg. An additional 18 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 3.5 mg/kg for ""maida"" (white) and ""atta"" (whole wheat) flour. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi. The thiazole and pyrimidine moieties are biosynthesized separately and are then combined to form ThMP by the action of thiamine-phosphate synthase. The pyrimidine ring system is formed in a reaction catalysed by phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase (ThiC), an enzyme in the radical SAM superfamily of iron–sulfur proteins, which use S-adenosyl methionine as a cofactor. The starting material is 5-aminoimidazole ribotide, which undergoes a rearrangement reaction via radical intermediates which incorporate the blue, green and red fragments shown into the product. The thiazole ring is formed in a reaction catalysed by thiazole synthase (EC 2.8.1.10). The ultimate precursors are 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, 2-iminoacetate and a sulfur carrier protein called ThiS. An additional protein, ThiG, is also required to bring together all the components of the ring at the enzyme active site. The final step to form ThMP involves decarboxylation of the thiazole intermediate, which reacts with the pyrophosphate derivative of phosphomethylpyrimidine, itself a product of a kinase, phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase. The biosynthetic pathways differ among organisms. In E. coli and other enterobacteriaceae, ThMP is phosphorylated to the cofactor TPP by a thiamine-phosphate kinase (ThMP + ATP → TPP + ADP). In most bacteria and in eukaryotes, ThMP is hydrolyzed to thiamine and then pyrophosphorylated to TPP by thiamine diphosphokinase (thiamine + ATP → TPP + AMP). The biosynthetic pathways are regulated by riboswitches. If there is sufficient thiamine present in the cell then the thiamine binds to the mRNAs for the enzymes that are required in the pathway and prevents their translation. If there is no thiamine present then there is no inhibition, and the enzymes required for the biosynthesis are produced. The specific riboswitch, the TPP riboswitch, is the only known riboswitch found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. === Laboratory synthesis === In the first total synthesis in 1936, ethyl 3-ethoxypropanoate was treated with ethyl formate to give an intermediate dicarbonyl compound which when reacted with acetamidine formed a substituted pyrimidine. Conversion of its hydroxyl group to an amino group was carried out by nucleophilic aromatic substitution, first to the chloride derivative using phosphorus oxychloride, followed by treatment with ammonia. The ethoxy group was then converted to a bromo derivative using hydrobromic acid. In the final stage, thiamine (as its dibromide salt) was formed in an alkylation reaction using 4-methyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiazole.: 7 === Industrial synthesis === Merck & Co. adapted the 1936 laboratory-scale synthesis, allowing them to manufacture thiamine in Rahway in 1937. However, an alternative route using the intermediate Grewe diamine (5-(aminomethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinamine), first published in 1937, was investigated by Hoffman La Roche and competitive manufacturing processes followed. Efficient routes to the diamine have continued to be of interest. In the European Economic Area, thiamine is registered under REACH regulation and between 100 and 1,000 tonnes per annum are manufactured or imported there. === Synthetic analogues === Many vitamin B1 analogues, such as Benfotiamine, fursultiamine, and sulbutiamine, are synthetic derivatives of thiamine. Most were developed in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s as forms that were intended to improve absorption compared to thiamine. Some are approved for use in some countries as a drug or non-prescription dietary supplement for treatment of diabetic neuropathy or other health conditions. == Absorption, metabolism and excretion == In the upper small intestine, thiamine phosphate esters present in food are hydrolyzed by alkaline phosphatase enzymes. At low concentrations (<2 μmol l−1), the absorption process is carrier-mediated. At higher concentrations, absorption also occurs via passive diffusion. Active transport can be inhibited by alcohol consumption or by folate deficiency. The majority of thiamine in serum is circulating bound to albumin, with over (90%) in erythrocytes (red blood cells), and is delivered to cells with high metabolic needs—particularly those in the brain, liver, pancreas, heart, and skeletal and smooth muscles, including cardiac muscle cells. A specific binding protein called thiamine-binding protein has been identified in rat serum and is believed to be a hormone-regulated carrier protein important for tissue distribution of thiamine. Uptake of thiamine by cells of the blood and other tissues occurs via active transport and passive diffusion. Two members of the family of transporter proteins encoded by the genes SLC19A2 and SLC19A3 are capable of thiamine transport. In some tissues, thiamine uptake and secretion appear to be mediated by a Na+-dependent transporter and a transcellular proton gradient. Human storage of thiamine is about 25 to 50 mg, with the greatest concentrations in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and kidneys. ThMP and free (unphosphorylated) thiamine are present in plasma, milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and, it is presumed, all extracellular fluid. Unlike the highly phosphorylated forms of thiamine, ThMP and free thiamine are capable of crossing cell membranes. Calcium and magnesium have been shown to affect the distribution of thiamine in the body and magnesium deficiency has been shown to aggravate thiamine deficiency. Thiamine contents in human tissues are less than those of other species. The half-life of thiamine content stored in tissues of human body is about 9-18 days, while after intake in high doses, the half-life of thiamine in circulating blood is about one to 12 hours. Additionally, thiamine pyrophosphate derived from pyrimidines supports lipid synthesis and adipogenesis, highlighting its role in energy storage and cellular differentiation. Thiamine and its metabolites (2-methyl-4-amino-5-pyrimidine carboxylic acid, 4-methyl-thiazole-5-acetic acid, and others) are excreted principally in the urine. === Interference === The bioavailability of thiamine in foods can be interfered with in a variety of ways. Sulfites, added to foods as a preservative, will attack thiamine at the methylene bridge, cleaving the pyrimidine ring from the thiazole ring. The rate of this reaction is increased under acidic conditions. Thiamine is degraded by thermolabile thiaminases present in some species of fish, shellfish and other foods. The pupae of an African silk worm, Anaphe venata, is a traditional food in Nigeria. Consumption leads to thiamine deficiency. Older literature reported that in Thailand, consumption of fermented, uncooked fish caused thiamine deficiency, but either abstaining from eating the fish or heating it first reversed the deficiency. In ruminants, intestinal bacteria synthesize thiamine and thiaminases. The bacterial thiaminases are cell surface enzymes that must dissociate from the cell membrane before being activated; the dissociation can occur in ruminants under acidotic conditions. In dairy cows, over-feeding with grain causes subacute ruminal acidosis and increased ruminal bacteria thiaminase release, resulting in thiamine deficiency. From reports on two small studies conducted in Thailand, chewing slices of areca nut wrapped in betel leaves and chewing tea leaves reduced food thiamine bioavailability by a mechanism that may involve tannins. Bariatric surgery for weight loss is known to interfere with vitamin absorption. A meta-analysis reported that 27% of people who underwent bariatric surgeries experience vitamin B1 deficiency. == History == Thiamine was the first of the water-soluble vitamins to be isolated. The earliest observations in humans and in chickens had shown that diets of primarily polished white rice caused beriberi, but did not attribute it to the absence of a previously unknown essential nutrient. In 1884, Takaki Kanehiro, a surgeon general in the Imperial Japanese Navy, rejected the previous germ theory for beriberi and suggested instead that the disease was due to insufficiencies in the diet. Switching diets on a navy ship, he discovered that replacing a diet of white rice only with one also containing barley, meat, milk, bread, and vegetables, nearly eliminated beriberi on a nine-month sea voyage. However, Takaki had added many foods to the successful diet and he incorrectly attributed the benefit to increased protein intake, as vitamins were unknown at the time. The Navy was not convinced of the need for such an expensive program of dietary improvement, and many men continued to die of beriberi, even during the Russo-Japanese war of 1904–5. Not until 1905, after the anti-beriberi factor had been discovered in rice bran (removed by polishing into white rice) and in barley bran, was Takaki's experiment rewarded. He was made a baron in the Japanese peerage system, after which he was affectionately called ""Barley Baron"". The specific connection to grain was made in 1897 by Christiaan Eijkman, a military doctor in the Dutch East Indies, who discovered that fowl fed on a diet of cooked, polished rice developed paralysis that could be reversed by discontinuing rice polishing. He attributed beriberi to the high levels of starch in rice being toxic. He believed that the toxicity was countered in a compound present in the rice polishings. An associate, Gerrit Grijns, correctly interpreted the connection between excessive consumption of polished rice and beriberi in 1901: He concluded that rice contains an essential nutrient in the outer layers of the grain that is removed by polishing. Eijkman was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1929, because his observations led to the discovery of vitamins. In 1910, a Japanese agricultural chemist of Tokyo Imperial University, Umetaro Suzuki, isolated a water-soluble thiamine compound from rice bran, which he named aberic acid. (He later renamed it Orizanin.) He described the compound as not only an anti-beriberi factor, but also as being essential to human nutrition; however, this finding failed to gain publicity outside of Japan, because a claim that the compound was a new finding was omitted in translation of his publication from Japanese to German. In 1911 a Polish biochemist Casimir Funk isolated the antineuritic substance from rice bran (the modern thiamine) that he called a ""vitamine"" (on account of its containing an amino group). However, Funk did not completely characterize its chemical structure. Dutch chemists, Barend Coenraad Petrus Jansen and his closest collaborator Willem Frederik Donath, went on to isolate and crystallize the active agent in 1926, whose structure was determined by Robert Runnels Williams, in 1934. Thiamine was named by the Williams team as a portmanteau of ""thio"" (meaning sulfur-containing) and ""vitamin"". The term ""vitamin"" coming indirectly, by way of Funk, from the amine group of thiamine itself (although by this time, vitamins were known to not always be amines, for example, vitamin C). Thiamine was also synthesized by the Williams group in 1936. Sir Rudolph Peters, in Oxford, used pigeons to understand how thiamine deficiency results in the pathological-physiological symptoms of beriberi. Pigeons fed exclusively on polished rice developed opisthotonos, a condition characterized by head retraction. If not treated, the animals died after a few days. Administration of thiamine after opisthotonos was observed led to a complete cure within 30 minutes. As no morphological modifications were seen in the brain of the pigeons before and after treatment with thiamine, Peters introduced the concept of a biochemical-induced injury. In 1937, Lohmann and Schuster showed that the diphosphorylated thiamine derivative, TPP, was a cofactor required for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate.

It is marketed by Viatris. A generic version developed by Alchemia is marketed within the US by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories. == Medical uses == Clinically, it is used for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in patients who have had orthopedic surgery as well as for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Fondaparinux is similar to enoxaparin in reducing the risk of ischemic events at nine days, but it substantially reduces major bleeding and improves long-term mortality and morbidity. It has been investigated for use in conjunction with streptokinase. === Comparison to other agents === One potential advantage of fondaparinux over LMWH or unfractionated heparin is that the risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is substantially lower. Furthermore, there have been case reports of fondaparinux being used to anti-coagulate patients with established HIT as it has no affinity for PF4. However, its renal excretion precludes its use in patients with renal dysfunction. Unlike direct factor Xa inhibitors, it mediates its effects indirectly through antithrombin III, but unlike heparin, it is selective for factor Xa. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide factor Xa inhibitor. Fondaparinux binds antithrombin and accelerates its inhibition of factor Xa. Apart from the O-methyl group at the reducing end of the molecule, the identity and sequence of the five monomeric sugar units contained in fondaparinux is identical to a sequence of five monomeric sugar units that can be isolated after either chemical or enzymatic cleavage of the polymeric glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate (HS). Within heparin and heparan sulfate this monomeric sequence is thought to form the high-affinity binding site for the anti-coagulant factor antithrombin (AT). Binding of heparin or HS to AT has been shown to increase the anti-coagulant activity of antithrombin 1000 fold. In contrast to heparin, fondaparinux does not inhibit thrombin. == Chemistry == === Abbreviations === GlcNS6S = 2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-2-(sulfoamino)-α-D-glucopyranoside GlcA = β-D-glucopyranuronoside GlcNS3,6S = 2-deoxy-3,6-di-O-sulfo-2-(sulfoamino)-α-D-glucopyranosyl IdoA2S = 2-O-sulfo-α-L-idopyranuronoside GlcNS6SOMe = methyl-O-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-2-(sulfoamino)-α-D-glucopyranoside Fondaparinux is only accessible by chemical synthesis.

This study aims to explore the mechanism of Cinobufotalin components and predict the target of action of Cinobufotalin on glioma. The active components of Cinobufotalin were screened by the Chinese medicine pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP), PubChem database, etc. The potential molecular components and targets were identified and enrichment analysis was conducted through the construction of related networks and analysis of their characteristics. Relevant targets of glioma were searched through TTD, DRUGBANK, and other databases, and the intersection was found and the key targets were found too. A total of 21 active components and 184 target genes of Cinobufotalin were found. According to the enrichment analysis results, the pharmacological mechanism of Cinobufotalin mainly includes inhibition of the cell cycle, promotion of cell apoptosis, and regulation of immunity. On this basis, RAC1, FOS, and NOS3 can be preliminarily predicted as potential targets of Cinobufotalin in the treatment of glioma. The screening of active ingredients and target prediction based on network pharmacology can provide a new research idea for the multi-target treatment of glioma with Cinobufotalin. Network pharmacology, as a novel way using bioinformatics to explore drug targets and interactions in cancer, broadens our understanding of drug action, thereby facilitating drug discovery. Here, we utilized network pharmacology to explore the role and mechanism by which cinobufotalin functions in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). We found that cinobufotalin represses the growth and proliferation of colon cancer cells, and integrated public databases for targets reported to be associated with COAD, together with those predicted to be targets of cinobufotalin. Targets overlapped between COAD-associated proteins and cinobufotalin target proteins were used to filter candidate targets of cinobufotalin in COAD. The following proteins were thought to occupy a key position in COAD-cinobufotalin target networks: SRC, PIK3R1, MAPK1, PIK3CA, HSP90AA1, CTNNB1, GRB2, RHO1, PTPN11, and EGFR. The networks regulated by cinobufotalin were involved mainly in extracellular signal stimulation and transduction, including MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Besides, transcriptome sequencing results also indicated that cinobufotalin inhibits the response of colon cancer cells to extracellular stimulation and promotes cell apoptosis. Molecular docking results showed that cinobufotalin matches in the pocket of the top candidate cinobufotalin target proteins (SRC, PIK3R1, MAPK1 and PIK3CA). These findings demonstrate cinobufotalin can be developed as potential anti-cancer therapeutics. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cinobufotalin combined with gefitinib in the treatment of lung cancer. A549 cells were treated with gefitinib, cinobufotalin, or cinobufotalin plus gefitinib. MTT assay, annexin-V/PI staining and flow cytometry, TUNEL staining, DCFH-DA staining, Western blot, and real-time RT-PCR were performed to investigate the synergistic inhibitory effect of cinobufotalin combined with gefitinib on the growth of A549 cells. Results showed that cinobufotalin synergized with gefitinib displayed inhibited cell viability and enhanced apoptosis in the combination group. Cinobufotalin combined with gefitinib induced a significant enhancement in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the S phase arrest, characterized by upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cyclin A, cyclin E, and CDK2. Besides, cinobufotalin plus gefitinib downregulated the levels of HGF and c-Met. In summary, cinobufotalin combined with gefitinib impedes viability and facilitates apoptosis of A549 cells, indicating that the combined therapy might be a new promising treatment for lung cancer patients who are resistant to gefitinib.",Cinobufotalin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0206720617134124e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.004134797025471926), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03807675838470459)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.16022412478923798), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/259776?utm_source=openai), [fishersci.dk](https://www.fishersci.dk/shop/products/cinobufotalin-medchemexpress-2/16461568?utm_source=openai), [ncim.nci.nih.gov](https://ncim.nci.nih.gov/ncimbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?code=C2745673&utm_source=openai), [platohealth.ai](https://platohealth.ai/clinical-trial-of-cinobufacini-combined-with-transarterial-chemoembolization-tace-on-primary-liver-cancer/?utm_source=openai), [trial.medpath.com](https://trial.medpath.com/clinical-trial/e11934c50a70b5c8/nct03189992-study-same-tcm-syndrome-different-diseases?utm_source=openai), [medchemexpress.com](https://www.medchemexpress.com/Cinobufotalin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=735, start_index=6, title='Cinobufotalin | C26H34O7 | CID 259776 - PubChem', type='url_citation', url='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/259776?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=735, start_index=6, title='Cinobufotalin, MedChemExpress 5 mg:Chemicals, Quantity: 5 mg | Fisher Scientific', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fishersci.dk/shop/products/cinobufotalin-medchemexpress-2/16461568?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=735, start_index=6, title='NCI Metathesaurus', type='url_citation', url='https://ncim.nci.nih.gov/ncimbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?code=C2745673&utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=735, start_index=6, title='Clinical Trial Of Cinobufacini Combined With Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) On Primary Liver Cancer - PlatoHealth', type='url_citation', url='https://platohealth.ai/clinical-trial-of-cinobufacini-combined-with-transarterial-chemoembolization-tace-on-primary-liver-cancer/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=735, start_index=6, title='Study of TCM Syndrome of Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Colorectal Cancer Based on System Science | MedPath', type='url_citation', url='https://trial.medpath.com/clinical-trial/e11934c50a70b5c8/nct03189992-study-same-tcm-syndrome-different-diseases?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=735, start_index=6, title='Cinobufotalin | Anticancer Agent | MedChemExpress', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medchemexpress.com/Cinobufotalin.html?utm_source=openai')])"

2112,"('Emedastine', 'Emadine', 'Emedastina', 'Emedastinum', 'Emedastinum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Emedastine (trade name Emadine) is a second generation antihistamine used in eye drops to alleviate the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. It acts as a H1 receptor antagonist. It works by blocking the action of histamine that causes allergic symptoms. It is used in form of the difumarate. The emedastine difumarate is a white, crystalline, water-soluble fine powder. Emedastine eye drops is usually applied twice a day to the affected eye. When the patients with allergic conjunctivitis were treated with 0.05% emedastine difumarate ophthalmic solution for six weeks, the signs and symptoms such as redness, itching and swelling of the eyes were relieved. Emedastine appears to be devoid of effects on adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin receptors. This drug was developed by Alcon, which is global medical company specializing in eye care products. == Pharmacodynamics == Emedastine is significantly selective to H1 histamine receptors (Ki = 1.3 nM), whereas its affinities for other histamine receptors were low (H2: Ki = 49067 nM and H3: Ki = 12430 nM) ub in vitro study. Topical ocular administration of emedastine inhibits histamine-stimulated vascular permeability in the conjunctiva as a concentration-dependent manner in in vitro study. == Pharmacokinetics == The human oral bioavailability is approximately 50% and maximum plasma concentration was achieved within 1–2 hours after dosing. Emedastine is mainly metabolized by the liver. There are two primary metabolites: 5-hydroxyemedastine and 6-hydroxyemedastine. They are excreted in the urine as both free and conjugated forms. The 5'-oxoanalogs of 5-hydroxyemedastine, 6-hydroxyemedastine and the N-oxide are also formed as minor metabolites. The elimination half-life of oral emedastine in plasma is 3–4 hours, whereas that of topical emedastine is 10 hours. Approximately 44% of the oral dose is recovered in the urine over 24 hours with only 3.6% of the dose excreted as parent drug. == Contraindications == Emedastine should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to emedastine or any other excipients of the preparation. Benzalkonium chloride contained in the bottle of emedastine solution can discolor soft contact lenses, so people who wear contact lenses should be careful using it. == Adverse events == The most common adverse effect was headache (11%). The other minor adverse effects encountered in less than 5% of patients were asthenia, burning or stinging sensation, unpleasant taste, blurred vision, eye dryness and tearing. == References ==",Emadine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.645074735279195e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001192454481497407)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/emadine.html,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/emadine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emedastine ', [])"
2113,"('Phenazine (methylsulfate)',)",Medical," When 5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate and a reductant (ascorbate or NADH) are added together to a suspension of resealed chromaffin-vesicle membranes, the pH gradient (inside acidic) and the membrane potential (inside positive) established by the H(+)-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) are rapidly dissipated. Dissipation of the pH gradient may be observed using either the optical probe acridine orange or the weak base methylamine. Dissipation of the membrane potential may be observed using the potential-dependent dye oxonol VI. A reductant and 5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate added in combination will also abolish a K+ diffusion potential across chromaffin-vesicle membranes but not across liposome membranes. 5-Methylphenazinium methylsulfate oxidizes cytochrome b561 in chromaffin-vesicle ghosts. Ascorbate readily reduces cytochrome b561, but reduction of cytochrome b561 by NADH is greatly enhanced in the presence of 5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate. These results are consistent with a mechanism in which proton gradient dissipation (a net efflux of H+) is caused by an influx of electrons through the membrane-protein cytochrome b561 coupled with an efflux of H carried by the reduced species 5-methyl-10-hydrophenazine. Although 5-methylphenazinium has been thought to accumulate within acidic vesicles as a weak base, this accounts for neither proton gradient dissipation nor for intravesicular accumulation of the compound. 1-Methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methyl sulfate (MPMS) was tested for use as redox mediator in histochemistry of dehydrogenases. Aqueous solutions of MPMS are absolute lightstable. Like PMS or Meldola Blue the succinate dehydrogenase reaction was increased by MPMS.

2114,"('Argipressin', 'Vasopressin', 'Arg8-vasopressin', 'Arginine vasopressin', 'Argipressine')","Endogenous, Medical","Human vasopressin, also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), arginine vasopressin (AVP) or argipressin, is a hormone synthesized from the AVP gene as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and is converted to AVP. It then travels down the axon terminating in the posterior pituitary, and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality). AVP has two primary functions. First, it increases the amount of solute-free water reabsorbed back into the circulation from the filtrate in the kidney tubules of the nephrons. Second, AVP constricts arterioles, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure. A third function is possible. Some AVP may be released directly into the brain from the hypothalamus, and may play an important role in social behavior, sexual motivation and pair bonding, and maternal responses to stress. Vasopressin induces differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes and promotes heart muscle homeostasis. It has a very short half-life, between 16 and 24 minutes. == Physiology == === Function === Vasopressin regulates the tonicity of body fluids. It is released from the posterior pituitary in response to hypertonicity and causes the kidneys to reabsorb solute-free water and return it to the circulation from the tubules of the nephron, thus returning the tonicity of the body fluids toward normal. An incidental consequence of this renal reabsorption of water is concentrated urine and reduced urine volume. AVP released in high concentrations may also raise blood pressure by inducing moderate vasoconstriction. AVP also may have a variety of neurological effects on the brain. It may influence pair-bonding in voles. The high-density distributions of vasopressin receptor AVPr1a in prairie vole ventral forebrain regions have been shown to facilitate and coordinate reward circuits during partner preference formation, critical for pair bond formation. A very similar substance, lysine vasopressin (LVP) or lypressin, has the same function in pigs and its synthetic version was used in human AVP deficiency, although it has been largely replaced by desmopressin. ==== Kidney ==== Vasopressin has three main effects which are: Increasing the water permeability of distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and cortical collecting tubules (CCT), as well as outer and inner medullary collecting duct (OMCD & IMCD) in the kidney, thus allowing water reabsorption and excretion of more concentrated urine, i.e., antidiuresis. This occurs through increased transcription and insertion of water channels (Aquaporin-2) into the apical membrane of collecting tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells. Aquaporins allow water to move down their osmotic gradient and out of the nephron, increasing the amount of water re-absorbed from the filtrate (forming urine) back into the bloodstream. This effect is mediated by V2 receptors. Vasopressin also increases the concentration of calcium in the collecting duct cells, by episodic release from intracellular stores. Vasopressin, acting through cAMP, also increases transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene, thus increasing the total number of aquaporin-2 molecules in collecting duct cells. Increasing permeability of the inner medullary portion of the collecting duct to urea by regulating the cell surface expression of urea transporters, which facilitates its reabsorption into the medullary interstitium as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the connecting tubule, cortical collecting duct, and outer medullary collecting duct. Acute increase of sodium absorption across the ascending loop of Henle. This adds to the countercurrent multiplication which aids in proper water reabsorption later in the distal tubule and collecting duct. The hormone vasopressin also stimulates the activity of NKCC2. Vasopressin stimulates sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the nephron by activating signaling pathways. Vasopressin increases the traffic of NKCC2 to the membrane and phosphorylates some serine and threonine sites on the cytoplasmic N-terminal of the NKCC2 located in the membrane, increasing its activity. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water reabsorption in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate. ==== Central nervous system ==== Vasopressin released within the brain may have several actions: Vasopressin is released into the brain in a circadian rhythm by neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Vasopressin released from posterior pituitary is associated with nausea. Recent evidence suggests that vasopressin may have analgesic effects. The analgesia effects of vasopressin were found to be dependent on both stress and sex. === Regulation === ==== Gene regulation ==== Vasopressin is regulated by AVP gene expression which is managed by major clock controlled genes. In this circadian circuit known as the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL), Per2 protein accumulates and is phosphorylated by CK1E. Per2 subsequently inhibits the transcription factors Clock and BMAL1 in order to reduce Per2 protein levels in the cell. At the same time, Per2 also inhibits the transcription factors for the AVP gene in order to regulate its expression, the expression of vasopressin, and other AVP gene products. Many factors influence the secretion of vasopressin: Ethanol (alcohol) reduces the calcium-dependent secretion of AVP by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels in neurohypophyseal nerve terminals in rats. Angiotensin II stimulates AVP secretion, in keeping with its general pressor and pro-volumic effects on the body. Atrial natriuretic peptide inhibits AVP secretion, in part by inhibiting Angiotensin II-induced stimulation of AVP secretion. Cortisol inhibits secretion of antidiuretic hormone. === Production and secretion === The physiological stimulus for secretion of vasopressin is increased osmolality of the plasma, monitored by the hypothalamus. A decreased arterial blood volume, (such as can occur in cirrhosis, nephrosis, and heart failure), stimulates secretion, even in the face of decreased osmolality of the plasma: it supersedes osmolality, but with a milder effect. In other words, the unloading of arterial baroreceptors when the arterial blood volume is low stimulates vasopressin secretion despite the presence of hypoosmolality (hyponatremia). The AVP that is measured in peripheral blood is almost all derived from secretion from the posterior pituitary gland (except in cases of AVP-secreting tumours). Vasopressin is produced by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). It then travels down the axon through the infundibulum within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood. There are other sources of AVP, beyond the hypothalamic magnocellular neurons. For example, AVP is also synthesized by parvocellular neurosecretory neurons of the PVN, transported and released at the median eminence, from which it travels through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates corticotropic cells synergistically with CRH to produce ACTH (by itself it is a weak secretagogue). === Vasopressin during surgery and anaesthesia === Vasopressin concentration is used to measure surgical stress for evaluation of surgical techniques. Plasma vasopressin concentration is elevated by noxious stimuli, predominantly during abdominal surgery, especially at gut manipulation, traction of viscera, as well as abdominal insufflation with carbon dioxide during laparoscopic surgery. === Receptors === Types of AVP receptors and their actions: === Structure and relation to oxytocin === The vasopressins are peptides consisting of nine amino acids (nonapeptides). The amino acid sequence of arginine vasopressin (argipressin) is Cys-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH2, with the cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond and the C-terminus of the sequence converted to a primary amide. Lysine vasopressin (lypressin) has a lysine in place of the arginine as the eighth amino acid, and is found in pigs and some related animals, whereas arginine vasopressin is found in humans. The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of the vasopressins: It is also a nonapeptide with a disulfide bridge and its amino acid sequence differs at only two positions. The two genes are located on the same chromosome separated by a relatively small distance of less than 15,000 bases in most species. The magnocellular neurons that secrete vasopressin are adjacent to magnocellular neurons that secrete oxytocin, and are similar in many respects. The similarity of the two peptides can cause some cross-reactions: oxytocin has a slight antidiuretic function, and high levels of AVP can cause uterine contractions. Comparison of vasopressin and oxytocin neuropeptide families: == Medical use == Vasopressin is used to manage anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. Vasopressin is used to treat diabetes insipidus related to low levels of antidiuretic hormone. It is available as Pressyn. Vasopressin has off-label uses and is used in the treatment of vasodilatory shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Vasopressin agonists are used therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue desmopressin is used in conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion, as well as for control of bleeding (in some forms of von Willebrand disease and in mild haemophilia A) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. Terlipressin and related analogues are used as vasoconstrictors in certain conditions. Use of vasopressin analogues for esophageal varices commenced in 1970. Vasopressin infusions are also used as second line therapy for septic shock patients not responding to fluid resuscitation or infusions of catecholamines (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine) to increase the blood pressure while sparing the use of catecholamines. These argipressins have much shorter elimination half-life (around 20 minutes) comparing to synthetic non-arginine vasopresines with much longer elimination half-life of many hours. Further, argipressins act on V1a, V1b, and V2 receptors which consequently lead to higher eGFR and lower vascular resistance in the lungs. A number of injectable arginine vasopressins are currently in clinical use in the United States and in Europe. === Pharmacokinetics === Vasopressin is administered through an intravenous device, intramuscular injection or a subcutaneous injection. The duration of action depends on the mode of administration and ranges from thirty minutes to two hours. It has a half life of ten to twenty minutes. It is widely distributed throughout the body and remains in the extracellular fluid. It is degraded by the liver and excreted through the kidneys. Arginin vasopressins for use in septic shock are intended for intravenous use only. === Side effects === The most common side effects during treatment with vasopressin are dizziness, angina, chest pain, abdominal cramps, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, trembling, fever, water intoxication, pounding sensation in the head, diarrhoea, sweating, paleness, and flatulence. The most severe adverse reactions are myocardial infarction and hypersensitivity. === Contraindications === The use of lysine vasopressin is contraindicated in the presence of hypersensitivity to beef or pork proteins, increased BUN and chronic kidney failure. It is recommended that it be cautiously used in instances of perioperative polyuria, sensitivity to the drug, asthma, seizures, heart failure, a comatose state, migraine headaches, and cardiovascular disease. === Interactions === alcohol - may lower the antidiuretic effect carbamazepine, chloropropamide, clofibrate, tricyclic antidepressants and fludrocortisone may raise the antidiuretic effect lithium, demeclocycline, heparin or norepinephrine may lower the antidiuretic effect vasopressor effect may be higher with the concurrent use of ganglionic blocking medications === Deficiency === Decreased AVP release (neurogenic — i.e. due to alcohol intoxication or tumour) or decreased renal sensitivity to AVP (nephrogenic, i.e. by mutation of V2 receptor or AQP) leads to diabetes insipidus, a condition featuring hypernatremia (increased blood sodium concentration), polyuria (excess urine production), and polydipsia (thirst). === Excess === Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH) in turn can be caused by a number of problems. Some forms of cancer can cause SIADH, particularly small cell lung carcinoma but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs have been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, oxytocin (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug vincristine. It has also been associated with fluoroquinolones (including ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation. Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists. == History == Vasopressin was elucidated and synthesized for the first time by Vincent du Vigneaud. == Animal studies == Evidence for an effect of AVP on monogamy vs polygamy comes from experimental studies in several species, which indicate that the precise distribution of vasopressin and vasopressin receptors in the brain is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In particular, there are consistent differences between monogamous species and polygamous species in the distribution of AVP receptors, and sometimes in the distribution of vasopressin-containing axons, even when closely related species are compared. == Human studies == Vasopressin has shown nootropic effects on pain perception and cognitive function. Vasopressin also plays a role in autism, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. == See also == Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) Oxytocin Vasopressin receptor Vasopressin receptor antagonists Copeptin Anterior pituitary Hypothalamus Atrial natriuretic peptide: When the atrium stretches, blood pressure is considered to be increased and sodium is excreted to lower blood pressure. Renin-angiotensin system: When the blood flow through the juxtaglomerular apparatus decreases, blood pressure is considered low, and the adrenal cortex secretes aldosterone to increase sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct, thereby increasing blood pressure. Bainbridge reflex: In response to stretching of the right atrium wall, heart rate increases, lowering venous blood pressure. Baroreflex: When the stretch receptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus increase, the blood pressure is considered to be elevated and the heart rate decreases to lower blood pressure. == References == == Further reading ==",Arginine vasopressin,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.004808060824871063), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.988221684878226e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -9.686778503237292e-05), (' MED', -4.961759259458631e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.3491211235523224), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('OUS', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -4.362964682513848e-05), ('ĠMED', -3.2305197237292305e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -6.210611172718927e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.02326202020049095), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -2.15310683415737e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin_%28medication%29,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin ', [])"

The drug is manufactured by Pharmstandard (Russian: Фармстандарт). It is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment or prevention of influenza. == Medical use == Testing of umifenovir's efficacy has mainly occurred in China and Russia, and it is well known in these two countries. Some of the Russian tests showed the drug to be effective against influenza A and a direct comparison with oseltamivir showed similar efficiency in vitro and in a clinical setting. In 2010 Arbidol was the drug brand with the highest sales volume in Russia. In the first quarter of 2020 it had a 16 percent share in the Russian antiviral market. Umifenovir is used primarily as an antiviral treatment for influenza. The drug has also been investigated as a candidate drug for treatment of hepatitis C. Some preliminary research suggests it could be useful for flavivirus infection like West Nile virus. Some studies also indicate that umifenovir also has in vitro effectiveness at preventing entry of Zaire ebolavirus (Kikwit strain), Tacaribe arenavirus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus in mammalian cell cultures, while confirming umifenovir's suppressive effect in vitro on Hepatitis B and poliovirus infection of mammalian cells when introduced either in advance of viral infection or during infection. == Side effects == Side effects in children include sensitization to the drug. No known overdose cases have been reported and allergic reactions are limited to people with hypersensitivity. The LD50 is more than 4 g/kg. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Umifenovir inhibits membrane fusion of influenza virus in vitro. Fusion between the viral envelope (surrounding the viral capsid) and the cell membrane of the target cell is inhibited. This prevents viral entry to the target cell, and therefore protects it from infection. Some evidence suggests that the drug's actions are more effective at preventing infections from RNA viruses than infections from DNA viruses. As well as specific antiviral action against both influenza A and influenza B viruses, umifenovir exhibits modulatory effects on the immune system. The drug stimulates a humoral immune response, induces interferon-production, and stimulates the phagocytic function of macrophages. === Pharmacokinetics === The maximum concentration of umifenovir in blood plasma when taking a dose of 50 mg is achieved after 1.2 hours, with 100 mg the maximum dose is obtained after 1.5 hours. The bioavailability of the drug is about 40% and does not depend on food intake. The half-life is about 17-21 hours. It is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 but also by several other enzymes. About 40% is excreted unchanged, mainly in bile (38.9%) and in small amounts by the kidneys (0.12%). During the first 24 hours, 90% of the administered dose is eliminated. == Chemistry == Chemically, umifenovir features an indole core, functionalized at all but one positions with different substituents. The molecular groups of umifenovir - hydroxy, amino and carboxy - can form different hydrogen-bonded synthons. Umifenovir is characterized by only one polymorphic form but can exist in the form of a large number of crystal solvates, the production of which depends on the medium and conditions of synthesis. Umifenovir is poorly soluble in water. Crystalline solvates and other solid forms may be determined by the spatial structure and conformational equilibria in the saturated solution. == History and criticism == In 2006 the American company Good Earth Medicine applied to the FDA for an Emergency Use Authorization of Arbidol during the H5N1 bird flu epidemic, but their application was rejected on the grounds that the lab data provided was not strong enough to justify use. In 2007, the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences stated that the effects of Arbidol (umifenovir) are not scientifically proven. In the early 2010s Russian media criticized lobbying attempts by Tatyana Golikova (then-Minister of Healthcare) to promote umifenovir, and the unsubstantiated claim that Arbidol can speed up recovery from flu or cold by 1.3-2.3 days. They also made claims that comparative clinical studies have proven umifenovir to be inefficient. In January 2020, the Russian drug company OTCPharm (Отисифарм) published advertisements stating that the drug is effective against SARS-CoV-2. Shortly afterwards the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service fined the company for violation of its advertising rules. In March 2020 a video promoting the drug for COVID-19 went viral on Facebook and circulated heavily on WhatsApp, and around the same time a shortage of the drug ensued in Russia. == Research for COVID-19 == In early 2020 umifenovir was touted as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in China, where it was sometimes given to patients in combination with other drugs such as the anti-HIV drug Darunavir. A three-arm RCT study published in May 2020 in the Cell Press journal Clinical Advances found that neither Umifenovir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir helped patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. A similar study comparing Umifenovir directly with Lopinavir/Ritonavir found no difference in fever duration between the two groups but found a lower viral load on day 14 in the Umifenovir group. A systemic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies on Umifenovir published in March 2021 concluded that there is ""no significant benefit of using Arbidol compared with non‐antiviral treatment or other therapeutic agents against COVID‐19 disease."" == See also == List of Russian drugs == References == == External links == ""Umifenovir"".

Of these, pirodavir (R 77975) was selected for vaccine potency tests. Although pirodavir turned out to be an effective stabilizer of OPV, the protection induced by pirodavir was not better, nor additive to the effect by MgCl2 1 M, the usual stabilizer. Both stabilizers were effective in preventing damage to the viral proteins, but could not prevent damage of viral RNA. Rhinovirus infections do not only cause common colds, but may also trigger severe exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Even though rhinoviruses have been the focus of extensive drug development efforts in the past, an anti-rhinoviral drug still has to make it to the market. In the past, the viral capsid protein VP1 has been shown to be an important target for the development of antiviral molecules. Furthermore, many different chemical scaffolds appear to possess the properties that are required to inhibit virus replication by this mechanism of action. I-6602, an analogue of the rhinovirus inhibitor pirodavir, was previously identified as a potent inhibitor of rhinovirus infection. Here, we describe the antiviral activity of its analogue ca603, a molecule with a modified linker structure, and corroborate its mechanism of action as a capsid binder. The molecule ca603 shows antiviral activity against a panel of rhino-and enteroviruses. Cross-resistance is observed against viruses with mutations that render them resistant to the inhibitory effect of the capsid binder pleconaril and thermostability assays demonstrate that the compound binds and stabilizes the viral capsid. Binding of the molecule to the VP1 protein is corroborated by in silico modeling. It is confirmed that ca603 inhibits rhinovirus replication by interaction with the VP1 protein and, by this, allows to further expand the chemical diversity of capsid-binding molecules. The Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae is represented by several viral pathogens that are associated with human disease, namely Poliovirus 1, Enterovirus 71 and Rhinoviruses. Enterovirus 71 has been associated with encephalitis, while Rhinoviruses are a major cause of asthma exacerbations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Based on the structure of both pleconaril and pirodavir, we previously synthesized some original compounds as potential inhibitors of Rhinovirus replication. These compounds were explored for in vitro antiviral potential on other human pathogenic Enteroviruses, namely Enterovirus 71 on rhabdo-myosarcoma cells, Coxsackievirus B3 on Vero cells, Poliovirus 1 and Echovirus 11 on BGM cells. Activity was confirmed for compound against Rhinovirus 14. Furthermore, few compounds showed a cell-protective effect on Enterovirus 71, presented a marked improvement as compared to the reference drug pleconaril for inhibitory activity on both Enterovirus 71 and Poliovirus 1. The most striking observation was the clear cell protective effect for the set of analogues in a virus-cell-based assay for Echovirus 11 with an effective concentration (EC50) as low as 0.3 µM (Selectivity index or SI = 483), and selectivity indexes greater than 857 (EC50 = 0.6 µM) and 1524 (EC50 = 0.33 µM). Some of the evaluated compounds showed potent and selective antiviral activity against several enterovirus species, such as Enterovirus 71 (EV-A), Echovirus 11 (EV-B), and Poliovirus 1 (EV-C). This could be used as a starting point for the development of other pleconaril/pirodavir-like enterovirus inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity and improved effects as compared to the reference drugs.",Pirodavir,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.38688042759895325)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.13053226470947266), ('ICAL', -8.34461570775602e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3132941424846649)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1503435/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7726484/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=180, start_index=6, title='Safety and efficacy of intranasal pirodavir (R77975) in experimental rhinovirus infection - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1503435/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=180, start_index=6, title='Intranasal pirodavir (R77,975) treatment of rhinovirus colds - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7726484/?utm_source=openai')])"
2117,"('Tylvalosin (tartrate)', 'Acetylisovaleryltylo\u200bsin (tartrate)', 'Tylvalosin [usan:inn]', 'Tylvalosin (usan/inn)', 'Tylosin acetate isovalerte')",Medical," The aetiological agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, a deadly disease that affects pigs and seriously jeopardises the global swine industry, is a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Tylvalosin tartrate, which is a macrolide antibiotic, is the active ingredient in Aivlosin. In recent years, tylvalosin tartrate has widely been used to control porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in swine herds in China. However, whether tylvalosin tartrate has exerts anti-PRRSV effects remains controversial. In the present study, tylvalosin tartrate exhibited no effect on PRRSV susceptibility but suppressed the replication of PRRSV and the activity of infecting Marc-145 cells. Next, the relationship between the replication cycle of PRRSV and the activity of tylvalosin tartrate was further assessed. Tylvalosin tartrate did not affect the attachment and release stages of PRRSV or act during the internalisation stage of the virus in HuN4; however, contrasting effects were noted for strains CH-1a and SDVD-HN21. Tylvalosin tartrate acted on the replication stage of PRRSV and was not strain-specific in the replication stage of the PRRSV life cycle. The study findings provide an initial clarification of the inhibitory effects of tylvalosin tartrate on PRRSV, providing new insights into the treatment of PRRS. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a devastating disease that affects pigs and is responsible for severe economic losses. The commercial PRRSV-inactivated vaccine (CH-1a strain) in China was recently selected to control PRRS in large populations of PRRS-positive sows and was found to effectively reduce the rate of stillbirth abortion based on clinical observations. However, stress from vaccine inoculation (e.g., fever, anorexia, abortions, and slow body weight gain) usually appears after immunization on many swine farms. In this study, we fed piglets a diet medicated with tylvalosin tartrate during PRRSV-inactivated vaccine immunization. We found that tylvalosin tartrate attenuated the increase in total white blood cells induced by immunization at day one post-immunization (DPI) and induced an increase in monocyte counts after seven DPI. There was also attenuation in the intensity of the inflammatory response induced by vaccination and elevation of serum IFN-γ concentrations at three and seven DPI after immunization. The administration of tylvalosin tartrate could also attenuate the reduction in the percentage of CD8 Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an economically important pathogen, characterized by its genetic and antigenic variation. The PRRSV vaccine is widely used, however, the unsatisfied heterologic protection and the risk of reverse virulence raise the requirement to find some new anti-PRRSV strategies for disease control. Tylvalosin tartrate is used to inhibit PRRSV in the field non-specifically, however, the mechanism is still less known. The antiviral effects of Tylvalosin tartrates from three producers were evaluated in a cell inoculation model. Their safety and efficacy concentrations, and effecting stage during PRRSV infection were analyzed. And, the Tylvalosin tartrates regulated genes and pathways which are potentially related to the anti-viral effect were further explored by using transcriptomics analysis. Last, the transcription level of six anti-virus-related DEGs was selected to confirm by qPCR, and the expression level of HMOX1, a reported anti-PRRSV gene, was proved by western blot. The safety concentrations of Tylvalosin tartrates from three different producers were 40 µg/mL (Tyl A, Tyl B, and Tyl C) in MARC-145 cells and 20 µg/mL (Tyl A) or 40 µg/mL (Tyl B and Tyl C) in primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) respectively. Tylvalosin tartrate can inhibit PRRSV proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, causing more than 90% proliferation reduction at 40 µg/mL. But it shows no virucidal effect, and only achieves the antiviral effect via long-term action on the cells during the PRRSV proliferation. Furthermore, GO terms and KEGG pathway analysis was carried out based on the RNA sequencing and transcriptomic data. It was found that the Tylvalosin tartrates can regulate the signal transduction, proteolysis, and oxidation-reduction process, as well as some pathways such as protein digestion and absorption, PI3K-Akt signaling, FoxO signaling, and Ferroptosis pathways, which might relate to PRRSV proliferation or host innate immune response, but further studies still need to confirm it. Among them, six antivirus-related genes HMOX1, ATF3, FTH1, FTL, NR4A1, and CDKN1A were identified to be regulated by Tylvalosin tartrate, and the increased expression level of HMOX1 was further confirmed by western blot. Tylvalosin tartrate can inhibit PRRSV proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The identified DEGs and pathways in transcriptomic data will provide valuable clues for further exploring the host cell restriction factors or anti-PRRSV target.",Tylvalosin (tartrate),PUBMED,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.3266527056694031), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.010791867971420288), ('ICAL', -7.986990567587782e-06), (',', -0.47411632537841797), ('ĠINDU', -0.018275447189807892), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019610952585935593)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0002546641044318676)])","('INFO; ', [])"

2119,"('Name (hydrochloride)', 'Ng-nitroarginine methyl ester hydrochloride', 'Name', 'Ng-nitroarginine methyl ester', 'N(g)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester')",Medical,"A name is a term used for identification by an external observer. They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. The entity identified by a name is called its referent. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning as well) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called ""common names"" or (obsolete) ""general names"". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name. == Etymology == The word name comes from Old English nama; cognate with Old High German (OHG) namo, Sanskrit नामन् (nāman), Latin nomen, Greek ὄνομα (onoma), and Persian نام (nâm), from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) *h₁nómn̥. Outside Indo-European, it can be connected to Proto-Uralic *nime. == Naming conventions == A naming convention is a set of agreed, stipulated, or generally accepted standards, norms, social norms, or criteria for naming things. Parents may follow a naming convention when selecting names for their children. Some have chosen alphabetical names by birth order. In some East Asian cultures it is common for one syllable in a two-syllable given name to be a generation name which is the same for immediate siblings. In many cultures it is common for the son to be named after the father or a grandfather. In certain African cultures, such as in Cameroon, the eldest son gets the family name for his given name. In other cultures, the name may include the place of residence, or the place of birth. Major naming conventions include: In astronomy, astronomical naming conventions In biology, binomial nomenclature In chemistry, chemical nomenclature In classics, Roman naming conventions In computer programming, identifier naming conventions In computer networking, computer naming schemes In planetary science, planetary nomenclature In sciences generally, systematic names for a variety of things Products may follow a naming convention. Automobiles typically have a binomial name, a ""make"" (manufacturer) and a ""model"", in addition to a model year, such as a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette. Sometimes there is a name for the car's ""decoration level"" or ""trim line"" as well: e.g., Cadillac Escalade EXT Platinum, after the precious metal. Computers often have increasing numbers in their names to signify the next generation. Courses at schools typically follow a naming convention: an abbreviation for the subject area and then a number ordered by increasing level of difficulty. Many numbers (e.g., bank accounts, government IDs, credit cards, etc.) are not random but have an internal structure and convention. Virtually all organizations that assign names or numbers will follow some convention in generating these identifiers. Airline flight numbers, Space Shuttle flight numbers, even phone numbers all have an internal convention. == Personal name == A personal name is an identifying word or words by which an individual is intimately known or designated. In many countries, it is traditional for individuals to have a personal name (also called a given name or first name) and a surname (also called a last name or family name because it is shared by members of the same family). Some people have two surnames, one inherited from each parent. In most of Europe and the Americas, the given name typically comes before the surname, whereas in parts of Asia and Hungary the surname comes before the given name (Eastern name order). In some cultures it is traditional for a woman to take her husband's surname when she gets married. A common practice in many countries is patronym which means that a component of a personal name is based on the given name of one's father. A less common practice in countries is matronym which means that a component of a personal name is based on the given name of one's mother. In some East Asian cultures, it is traditional for given names to include a generation name, a syllable shared between siblings and cousins of the same generation. Middle names are also used by many people as a third identifier, and can be chosen for personal reasons including signifying relationships, preserving pre-marital/maiden names (a popular practice in the United States), and to perpetuate family names. The practice of using middle names dates back to ancient Rome, where it was common for members of the elite to have a praenomen (a personal name), a nomen (a family name, not exactly used the way middle names are used today), and a cognomen (a name representing an individual attribute or the specific branch of a person's family). Middle names eventually fell out of use, but regained popularity in Europe during the nineteenth century. Besides first, middle, and last names, individuals may also have nicknames, aliases, or titles. Nicknames are informal names used by friends or family to refer to a person (""Chris"" may be used as a short form of the personal name ""Christopher""). A person may choose to use an alias, or a fake name, instead of their real name, possibly to protect or obscure their identity. People may also have titles designating their role in an institution or profession (members of royal families may use various terms such as king, Queen, duke, or duchess to signify their positions of authority or their relation to the throne). == Names of names == In onomastic terminology, personal names of men are called andronyms (from Ancient Greek ἀνήρ / man, and ὄνομα / name), while personal names of women are called gynonyms (from Ancient Greek γυνή / woman, and ὄνομα / name). == Brand names == Developing a name for a brand or product is heavily influenced by marketing research and strategy to be appealing and marketable. The brand name is often a neologism or pseudoword, such as Kodak or Sony. == Religious names == In the ancient world, particularly in the ancient near-east (Israel, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia) names were thought to be extremely powerful and act, in some ways, as a separate manifestation of a person or deity. This viewpoint is responsible both for the reluctance to use the proper name of God in Hebrew writing or speech, as well as the common understanding in ancient magic that magical rituals had to be carried out ""in [someone's] name"". By invoking a god or spirit by name, one was thought to be able to summon that spirit's power for some kind of miracle or magic (see Luke 9:49, in which the disciples claim to have seen a man driving out demons using the name of Jesus). This understanding passed into later religious tradition, for example the stipulation in Catholic exorcism that the demon cannot be expelled until the exorcist has forced it to give up its name, at which point the name may be used in a stern command which will drive the demon away. === Biblical names === In the Old Testament, the names of individuals are meaningful, and a change of name indicates a change of status. For example, the patriarch Abram and his wife Sarai were renamed ""Abraham"" and ""Sarah"" at the institution of the Abrahamic covenant (Genesis 17:4, 17:15). Simon was renamed Peter when he was given the Keys to Heaven. This is recounted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter 16, which according to Roman Catholic teaching was when Jesus promised to Saint Peter the power to take binding actions. Proper names are ""saturated with meaning"". Throughout the Bible, characters are given names at birth that reflect something of significance or describe the course of their lives. For example: Solomon meant peace, and the king with that name was the first whose reign was without war. Likewise, Joseph named his firstborn son Manasseh (Hebrew: ""causing to forget"")(Genesis 41:51); when Joseph also said, ""God has made me forget all my troubles and everyone in my father's family."" Biblical Jewish people did not have surnames which were passed from generation to generation. However, they were typically known as the child of their father. For example: דוד בן ישי (David ben Yishay) meaning, David, son of Jesse (1 Samuel 17:12,58). Today, this style of name is still used in Jewish religious rites. === Indian name === Indian names are based on a variety of systems and naming conventions, which vary from region to region. Names are also influenced by religion and caste and may come from epics. India's population speaks a wide variety of languages and nearly every major religion in the world has a following in India. This variety makes for subtle, often confusing, differences in names and naming styles. Due to historical Indian cultural influences, several names across South and Southeast Asia are influenced by or adapted from Indian names or words. For some Indians, their birth name is different from their official name; the birth name starts with a randomly selected name from the person's horoscope (based on the nakshatra or lunar mansion corresponding to the person's birth). Many children are given three names, sometimes as a part of religious teaching. === Quranic names (Arabic names) === We can see many Arabic names in the Quran and in Muslim people, such as Allah, Muhammad, Khwaja, Ismail, Mehboob, Suhelahmed, Shoheb Ameena, Aaisha, Sameena, Rumana, Swaleha, etc. The names Mohammed and Ahmed are the same, for example Suhel Ahmad or Mohammad Suhel are the same. There are many similar names in Islam and Christianity, such as Yosef (Islamic)/Joseph (Christian), Adam/Adam, Dawood/David, Rumana/Romana, Maryam/Mary, Nuh/Noah, etc. == Name use by animals and plants == The use of personal names is not unique to humans. Dolphins and green-rumped parrotlets also use symbolic names to address contact calls to specific individuals. Individual dolphins have distinctive signature whistles, to which they will respond even when there is no other information to clarify which dolphin is being referred to. == Named entities == == See also == == References == == Sources == == Further reading == ""Names"" by Sam Cumming, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), a philosophical dissertation on the syntax and semantics of names Pilcher, Jane (2017).

2120,"('Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (trisodium salt)', 'Trisodium edta', 'Edetic acid', 'Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid', 'Edathamil')","Medical, Industrial","Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), also called EDTA acid, is an aminopolycarboxylic acid with the formula [CH2N(CH2CO2H)2]2. This white, slightly water-soluble solid is widely used to bind to iron (Fe2+/Fe3+) and calcium ions (Ca2+), forming water-soluble complexes even at neutral pH. It is thus used to dissolve Fe- and Ca-containing scale as well as to deliver iron ions under conditions where its oxides are insoluble. EDTA is available as several salts, notably disodium EDTA, sodium calcium edetate, and tetrasodium EDTA, but these all function similarly. == Uses == EDTA is widely used in industry. It also has applications in food preservation, medicine, cosmetics, water softening, in laboratories, and other fields. === Industrial === EDTA is mainly used to sequester (bind or confine) metal ions in aqueous solution. In the textile industry, it prevents metal ion impurities from modifying colours of dyed products. In the pulp and paper industry, EDTA inhibits the ability of metal ions, especially Mn2+, from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide, which is used in chlorine-free bleaching. ==== Gas scrubbing ==== Aqueous [Fe(EDTA)]− is used for removing (""scrubbing"") hydrogen sulfide from gas streams. This conversion is achieved by oxidising the hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur, which is non-volatile: 2 [Fe(EDTA)]− + H2S → 2 [Fe(EDTA)]2− + S + 2 H+ In this application, the iron(III) centre is reduced to its iron(II) derivative, which can then be reoxidised by air. In a similar manner, nitrogen oxides are removed from gas streams using [Fe(EDTA)]2−. === Food === In a similar manner, EDTA is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration, which is catalysed by metal ions. === Water softener === The reduction of water hardness in laundry applications and the dissolution of scale in boilers both rely on EDTA and related complexants to bind Ca2+, Mg2+, as well as other metal ions. Once bound to EDTA, these metal complexes are less likely to form precipitates or to interfere with the action of the soaps and detergents. For similar reasons, cleaning solutions often contain EDTA. In a similar manner EDTA is used in the cement industry for the determination of free lime and free magnesia in cement and clinkers. The solvation of Fe3+ ions at or below near neutral pH can be accomplished using EDTA. This property is useful in agriculture including hydroponics. However, given the pH dependence of ligand formation, EDTA is not helpful for improving iron solubility in above neutral soils. Otherwise, at near-neutral pH and above, iron(III) forms insoluble salts, which are less bioavailable to susceptible plant species. === Ion-exchange chromatography === EDTA was used in separation of the lanthanide metals by ion-exchange chromatography. Perfected by F. H. Spedding et al. in 1954, the method relies on the steady increase in stability constant of the lanthanide EDTA complexes with atomic number. Using sulfonated polystyrene beads and Cu2+ as a retaining ion, EDTA causes the lanthanides to migrate down the column of resin while separating into bands of pure lanthanides. The lanthanides elute in order of decreasing atomic number. Due to the expense of this method, relative to countercurrent solvent extraction, ion exchange is now used only to obtain the highest purities of lanthanides (typically greater than 99.99%). === Medicine === Sodium calcium edetate, an EDTA derivative, is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy, such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning. It is used in a similar manner to remove excess iron from the body. This therapy is used to treat the complication of repeated blood transfusions, as would be applied to treat thalassaemia. ==== In testing ==== In medical diagnosis and organ function tests (here, kidney function test), the chromium(III) complex [Cr(EDTA)]− (as radioactive chromium-51 (51Cr)) is administered intravenously and its filtration into the urine is monitored. This method is useful for evaluating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in nuclear medicine. EDTA is used extensively in the analysis of blood. It is an anticoagulant for blood samples for CBC/FBCs, where the EDTA chelates the calcium present in the blood specimen, arresting the coagulation process and preserving blood cell morphology. Tubes containing EDTA are marked with lavender (purple) or pink tops. EDTA is also in tan top tubes for lead testing and can be used in royal blue top tubes for trace metal testing. EDTA is a slime dispersant, and has been found to be highly effective in reducing bacterial growth during implantation of intraocular lenses (IOLs). ==== Dentistry ==== Dentists and endodontists use EDTA solutions to remove inorganic debris (smear layer) and lubricate the root canals in endodontics. This procedure helps prepare root canals for obturation. Furthermore, EDTA solutions with the addition of a surfactant loosen up calcifications inside a root canal and allow instrumentation (canal shaping) and facilitate apical advancement of a file in a tight or calcified root canal towards the apex. ==== Eyedrops ==== It serves as a preservative (usually to enhance the action of another preservative such as benzalkonium chloride or thiomersal) in ocular preparations and eyedrops. === Alternative medicine === Some alternative practitioners believe EDTA acts as an antioxidant, preventing free radicals from injuring blood vessel walls, therefore reducing atherosclerosis. These ideas are unsupported by scientific studies, and seem to contradict some currently accepted principles. The U.S. FDA has not approved it for the treatment of atherosclerosis. === Cosmetics === In shampoos, cleaners, and other personal care products, EDTA salts are used as a sequestering agent to improve their stability in air. === Laboratory applications === In the laboratory, EDTA is widely used for scavenging metal ions: In biochemistry and molecular biology, ion depletion is commonly used to deactivate metal-dependent enzymes, either as an assay for their reactivity or to suppress damage to DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides. EDTA also acts as a selective inhibitor against dNTP hydrolyzing enzymes (Taq polymerase, dUTPase, MutT), liver arginase and horseradish peroxidase independently of metal ion chelation. These findings urge the rethinking of the utilisation of EDTA as a biochemically inactive metal ion scavenger in enzymatic experiments. In analytical chemistry, EDTA is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses. EDTA finds many specialised uses in the biomedical labs, such as in veterinary ophthalmology as an anticollagenase to prevent the worsening of corneal ulcers in animals. In tissue culture, EDTA is used as a chelating agent that binds to calcium and prevents joining of cadherins between cells, preventing clumping of cells grown in liquid suspension, or detaching adherent cells for passaging. In histopathology, EDTA can be used as a decalcifying agent making it possible to cut sections using a microtome once the tissue sample is demineralised. EDTA is also known to inhibit a range of metallopeptidases, the method of inhibition occurs via the chelation of the metal ion required for catalytic activity. EDTA can also be used to test for bioavailability of heavy metals in sediments. However, it may influence the bioavailability of metals in solution, which may pose concerns regarding its effects in the environment, especially given its widespread uses and applications. === Other === The oxidising properties of [Fe(EDTA)]− are used in photography to solubilise silver particles. EDTA is also used to remove crud (corroded metals) from fuel rods in nuclear reactors. == Side effects == EDTA exhibits low acute toxicity with LD50 (rat) of 2.0 g/kg to 2.2 g/kg. It has been found to be both cytotoxic and weakly genotoxic in laboratory animals. Oral exposures have been noted to cause reproductive and developmental effects. The same study also found that both dermal exposure to EDTA in most cosmetic formulations and inhalation exposure to EDTA in aerosolised cosmetic formulations would produce exposure levels below those seen to be toxic in oral dosing studies. == Synthesis == The compound was first described in 1935 by Ferdinand Münz, who prepared the compound from ethylenediamine and chloroacetic acid. Today, EDTA is mainly synthesised from ethylenediamine (1,2-diaminoethane), formaldehyde, and sodium cyanide. This route yields the tetrasodium EDTA, which is converted in a subsequent step into the acid forms: H2NCH2CH2NH2 + 4 CH2O + 4 NaCN + 4 H2O → (NaO2CCH2)2NCH2CH2N(CH2CO2Na)2 + 4 NH3 (NaO2CCH2)2NCH2CH2N(CH2CO2Na)2 + 4 HCl → (HO2CCH2)2NCH2CH2N(CH2CO2H)2 + 4 NaCl This process is used to produce about 80,000 tonnes of EDTA each year. Impurities cogenerated by this route include glycine and nitrilotriacetic acid; they arise from reactions of the ammonia coproduct. == Nomenclature == To describe EDTA and its various protonated forms, chemists distinguish between EDTA4−, the conjugate base that is the ligand, and H4EDTA, the precursor to that ligand. At very low pH (very acidic conditions) the fully protonated H6EDTA2+ form predominates, whereas at very high pH or very basic condition, the fully deprotonated EDTA4− form is prevalent. In this article, the term EDTA is used to mean H4−xEDTAx−, whereas in its complexes EDTA4− stands for the tetraanion ligand. == Coordination chemistry principles == In coordination chemistry, EDTA4− is a member of the aminopolycarboxylic acid family of ligands. EDTA4− usually binds to a metal cation through its two amines and four carboxylates, i.e., it is a hexadentate (""six-toothed"") chelating agent. Many of the resulting coordination compounds adopt octahedral geometry. Although of little consequence for its applications, these octahedral complexes are chiral. The cobalt(III) anion [Co(EDTA)]− has been resolved into enantiomers. Many complexes of EDTA4− adopt more complex structures due to either the formation of an additional bond to water, i.e. seven-coordinate complexes, or the displacement of one carboxylate arm by water. The iron(III) complex of EDTA is seven-coordinate. Early work on the development of EDTA was undertaken by Gerold Schwarzenbach in the 1940s. EDTA forms especially strong complexes with Mn(II), Cu(II), Fe(III), Pb(II) and Co(III). Several features of EDTA's complexes are relevant to its applications. First, because of its high denticity, this ligand has a high affinity for metal cations: [Fe(H2O)6]3+ + H4EDTA ⇌ [Fe(EDTA)]− + 6 H2O + 4 H+ Keq = 1025.1 Written in this way, the equilibrium quotient shows that metal ions compete with protons for binding to EDTA. Because metal ions are extensively enveloped by EDTA, their catalytic properties are often suppressed. Finally, since complexes of EDTA4− are anionic, they tend to be highly soluble in water. For this reason, EDTA is able to dissolve deposits of metal oxides and carbonates. The pKa values of free EDTA are 0, 1.5, 2, 2.66 (deprotonation of the four carboxyl groups) and 6.16, 10.24 (deprotonation of the two amino groups). == Environmental concerns == === Abiotic degradation === EDTA is in such widespread use that questions have been raised whether it is a persistent organic pollutant. While EDTA serves many positive functions in different industrial, pharmaceutical and other avenues, the longevity of EDTA can pose serious issues in the environment. The degradation of EDTA is slow. It mainly occurs abiotically in the presence of sunlight. The most important process for the elimination of EDTA from surface waters is direct photolysis at wavelengths below 400 nm. Depending on the light conditions, the photolysis half-lives of iron(III) EDTA in surface waters can range as low as 11.3 minutes up to more than 100 hours. Degradation of FeEDTA, but not EDTA itself, produces iron complexes of the triacetate (ED3A), diacetate (EDDA), and monoacetate (EDMA) – 92% of EDDA and EDMA biodegrades in 20 hours while ED3A displays significantly higher resistance. Many environmentally-abundant EDTA species (such as Mg2+ and Ca2+) are more persistent. === Biodegradation === In many industrial wastewater treatment plants, EDTA elimination can be achieved at about 80% using microorganisms. Resulting byproducts are ED3A and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) – suggesting that both the backbone and acetyl groups were attacked. Some microorganisms have even been discovered to form nitrates out of EDTA, but they function optimally at moderately alkaline conditions of pH 9.0–9.5. Several bacterial strains isolated from sewage treatment plants efficiently degrade EDTA. Specific strains include Agrobacterium radiobacter ATCC 55002 and the sub-branches of Pseudomonadota like BNC1, BNC2, and strain DSM 9103. The three strains share similar properties of aerobic respiration and are classified as gram-negative bacteria. Unlike photolysis, the chelated species is not exclusive to iron(III) in order to be degraded. Rather, each strain uniquely consumes varying metal–EDTA complexes through several enzymatic pathways. Agrobacterium radiobacter only degrades Fe(III) EDTA while BNC1 and DSM 9103 are not capable of degrading iron(III) EDTA and are more suited for calcium, barium, magnesium and manganese(II) complexes. EDTA complexes require dissociation before degradation. == Alternatives to EDTA == Interest in environmental safety has raised concerns about biodegradability of aminopolycarboxylates such as EDTA. These concerns incentivize the investigation of alternative aminopolycarboxylates. Candidate chelating agents include nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), iminodisuccinic acid (IDS), polyaspartic acid, S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA), and L-Glutamic acid N,N-diacetic acid, tetrasodium salt (GLDA). === Iminodisuccinic acid (IDS) === Commercially used since 1998, iminodisuccinic acid (IDS) biodegrades by about 80% after only 7 days. IDS binds to calcium exceptionally well and forms stable compounds with other heavy metal ions. In addition to having a lower toxicity after chelation, IDS is degraded by Agrobacterium tumefaciens (BY6), which can be harvested on a large scale. The enzymes involved, IDS epimerase and C−N lyase, do not require any cofactors. === Polyaspartic acid === Polyaspartic acid, like IDS, binds to calcium and other heavy metal ions. It has many practical applications including corrosion inhibitors, wastewater additives, and agricultural polymers. A Polyaspartic acid-based laundry detergent was the first laundry detergent in the world to receive the EU flower ecolabel. Calcium binding ability of polyaspartic acid has been exploited for targeting of drug-loaded nanocarriers to bone. Preparation of hydrogels based on polyaspartic acid, in a variety of physical forms ranging from fiber to particle, can potentially enable facile separation of the chelated ions from a solution. Therefore, despite being weaker than EDTA, polyaspartic acid can still be regarded as a viable alternative due to these features as well as biocompatibility, and biodegradability. === S,S-Ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS) === A structural isomer of EDTA, ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS) is readily biodegradable at high rate in its S,S form. === Methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA) === Trisodium dicarboxymethyl alaninate, also known as methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA), has a high rate of biodegradation at over 68%, but unlike many other chelating agents can degrade without the assistance of adapted bacteria. Additionally, unlike EDDS or IDS, MGDA can withstand higher temperatures while maintaining a high stability as well as the entire pH range. MGDA has been shown to be an effective chelating agent, with a capacity for mobilization comparable with that of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), with application to water for industrial use and for the removal of calcium oxalate from urine from patients with kidney stones. == Methods of detection and analysis == The most sensitive method of detecting and measuring EDTA in biological samples is selected reaction monitoring capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (SRM-CE/MS), which has a detection limit of 7.3 ng/mL in human plasma and a quantitation limit of 15 ng/mL. This method works with sample volumes as small as 7–8 nL. EDTA has also been measured in non-alcoholic beverages using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at a level of 2.0 μg/mL. == In popular culture == In the movie Blade (1998), EDTA is used as a weapon to kill vampires, exploding when in contact with vampire blood. Blood on the sock that was used as evidence against O. J. Simpson, in the killing of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, had high levels of EDTA, according to defense attorneys. == References == == External links == EDTA: Molecule of the Month EDTA Determination of Total Water Hardness Oviedo, Claudia; Rodríguez, Jaime (2003).

2121,"('Purine', 'Purine (6ci,8ci)', 'Isopurine', 'Œ≤-purine', 'Beta-purine')","Endogenous, Medical","Purine is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound that consists of two rings (pyrimidine and imidazole) fused together. It is water-soluble. Purine also gives its name to the wider class of molecules, purines, which include substituted purines and their tautomers. They are the most widely occurring nitrogen-containing heterocycles in nature. == Dietary sources == Purines are found in high concentration in meat and meat products, especially internal organs such as liver and kidney. In general, plant-based diets are low in purines. High-purine plants and algae include some legumes (lentils, soybeans, and black-eyed peas) and spirulina. Examples of high-purine sources include: sweetbreads, anchovies, sardines, liver, beef kidneys, brains, meat extracts (e.g., Oxo, Bovril), herring, mackerel, scallops, game meats, yeast (beer, yeast extract, nutritional yeast) and some gravy. A moderate amount of purine is also contained in beef, pork, poultry, fish and seafood, asparagus, cauliflower, spinach, mushrooms, green peas, lentils, dried peas, beans, oatmeal, wheat bran, wheat germ, and haws. == Biochemistry == Purines and pyrimidines make up the two groups of nitrogenous bases, including the two groups of nucleotide bases. The purine bases are guanine (G) and adenine (A) which form corresponding nucleosides-deoxyribonucleosides (deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine) with deoxyribose moiety and ribonucleosides (guanosine, adenosine) with ribose moiety. These nucleosides with phosphoric acid form corresponding nucleotides (deoxyguanylate, deoxyadenylate and guanylate, adenylate) which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, respectively. Purine bases also play an essential role in many metabolic and signalling processes within the compounds guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). In order to perform these essential cellular processes, both purines and pyrimidines are needed by the cell, and in similar quantities. Both purine and pyrimidine are self-inhibiting and activating. When purines are formed, they inhibit the enzymes required for more purine formation. This self-inhibition occurs as they also activate the enzymes needed for pyrimidine formation. Pyrimidine simultaneously self-inhibits and activates purine in a similar manner. Because of this, there is nearly an equal amount of both substances in the cell at all times. == Properties == Purine is both a very weak acid (pKa 8.93) and an even weaker base (pKa 2.39). If dissolved in pure water, the pH is halfway between these two pKa values. Purine is aromatic, having four tautomers each with a hydrogen bonded to a different one of the four nitrogen atoms. These are identified as 1-H, 3-H, 7-H, and 9-H (see image of numbered ring). The common crystalline form favours the 7-H tautomer, while in polar solvents both the 9-H and 7-H tautomers predominate. Substituents to the rings and interactions with other molecules can shift the equilibrium of these tautomers. == Notable purines == There are many naturally occurring purines. They include the nucleotide bases adenine and guanine. In DNA, these bases form hydrogen bonds with their complementary pyrimidines, thymine and cytosine, respectively. This is called complementary base pairing. In RNA, the complement of adenine is uracil instead of thymine. Other notable purines are hypoxanthine, xanthine, theophylline, theobromine, caffeine, uric acid and isoguanine. == Functions == Aside from the crucial roles of purines (adenine and guanine) in DNA and RNA, purines are also significant components in a number of other important biomolecules, such as ATP, GTP, cyclic AMP, NADH, and coenzyme A. Purine (1) itself, has not been found in nature, but it can be produced by organic synthesis. They may also function directly as neurotransmitters, acting upon purinergic receptors. Adenosine activates adenosine receptors. == History == The word purine (pure urine) was coined by the German chemist Emil Fischer in 1884. He synthesized it for the first time in 1898. The starting material for the reaction sequence was uric acid (8), which had been isolated from kidney stones by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1776. Uric acid was reacted with PCl5 to give 2,6,8-trichloropurine, which was converted with HI and PH4I to give 2,6-diiodopurine. The product was reduced to purine using zinc dust. == Metabolism == Many organisms have metabolic pathways to synthesize and break down purines. Purines are biologically synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). Accumulation of modified purine nucleotides is defective to various cellular processes, especially those involving DNA and RNA. To be viable, organisms possess a number of deoxypurine phosphohydrolases, which hydrolyze these purine derivatives removing them from the active NTP and dNTP pools. Deamination of purine bases can result in accumulation of such nucleotides as ITP, dITP, XTP and dXTP. Defects in enzymes that control purine production and breakdown can severely alter a cell's DNA sequences, which may explain why people who carry certain genetic variants of purine metabolic enzymes have a higher risk for some types of cancer. === Purine biosynthesis in the three domains of life === Organisms in all three domains of life, eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea, are able to carry out de novo biosynthesis of purines. This ability reflects the essentiality of purines for life. The biochemical pathway of synthesis is very similar in eukaryotes and bacterial species, but is more variable among archaeal species. A nearly complete, or complete, set of genes required for purine biosynthesis was determined to be present in 58 of the 65 archaeal species studied. However, also identified were seven archaeal species with entirely, or nearly entirely, absent purine encoding genes. Apparently the archaeal species unable to synthesize purines are able to acquire exogenous purines for growth., and are thus analogous to purine mutants of eukaryotes, e.g. purine mutants of the Ascomycete fungus Neurospora crassa, that also require exogenous purines for growth. === Relationship with gout === Higher levels of meat and seafood consumption are associated with an increased risk of gout, whereas a higher level of consumption of dairy products is associated with a decreased risk. Moderate intake of purine-rich vegetables or protein is not associated with an increased risk of gout. Similar results have been found with the risk of hyperuricemia. == Laboratory synthesis == In addition to in vivo synthesis of purines in purine metabolism, purine can also be synthesized artificially. Purine is obtained in good yield when formamide is heated in an open vessel at 170 °C for 28 hours. This remarkable reaction and others like it have been discussed in the context of the origin of life. Patented August 20, 1968, the current recognized method of industrial-scale production of adenine is a modified form of the formamide method. This method heats up formamide under 120 °C conditions within a sealed flask for 5 hours to form adenine. The reaction is heavily increased in quantity by using a phosphorus oxychloride (phosphoryl chloride) or phosphorus pentachloride as an acid catalyst and sunlight or ultraviolet conditions. After the 5 hours have passed and the formamide-phosphorus oxychloride-adenine solution cools down, water is put into the flask containing the formamide and now-formed adenine. The water-formamide-adenine solution is then poured through a filtering column of activated charcoal. The water and formamide molecules, being small molecules, will pass through the charcoal and into the waste flask; the large adenine molecules, however, will attach or “adsorb” to the charcoal due to the van der waals forces that interact between the adenine and the carbon in the charcoal. Because charcoal has a large surface area, it's able to capture the majority of molecules that pass a certain size (greater than water and formamide) through it. To extract the adenine from the charcoal-adsorbed adenine, ammonia gas dissolved in water (aqua ammonia) is poured onto the activated charcoal-adenine structure to liberate the adenine into the ammonia-water solution. The solution containing water, ammonia, and adenine is then left to air dry, with the adenine losing solubility due to the loss of ammonia gas that previously made the solution basic and capable of dissolving adenine, thus causing it to crystallize into a pure white powder that can be stored. Oro and Kamat (1961) and Orgel co-workers (1966, 1967) have shown that four molecules of HCN tetramerize to form diaminomaleodinitrile (12), which can be converted into almost all naturally occurring purines. For example, five molecules of HCN condense in an exothermic reaction to make adenine, especially in the presence of ammonia. The Traube purine synthesis (1900) is a classic reaction (named after Wilhelm Traube) between an amine-substituted pyrimidine and formic acid. == Prebiotic synthesis of purine ribonucleosides == In order to understand how life arose, knowledge is required of the chemical pathways that permit formation of the key building blocks of life under plausible prebiotic conditions. Nam et al. (2018) demonstrated the direct condensation of purine and pyrimidine nucleobases with ribose to give ribonucleosides in aqueous microdroplets, a key step leading to RNA formation. Also, a plausible prebiotic process for synthesizing purine ribonucleosides was presented by Becker et al. in 2016. == See also == Purinones Pyrimidine Simple aromatic rings Transition Transversion Gout, a disorder of purine metabolism Adenine Guanine == References == == External links == Purine Content in Food",Purine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.06147680804133415), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -3.5597102396423e-05), (' FOOD', -1.981667537620524e-06)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.32124194502830505), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00043418517452664673), ('ĠEND', -0.004123874939978123), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06199786812067032)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -4.60414821645827e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.5491004129871726e-05), (' FOOD', -0.0004306692280806601)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=18, title='Purine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purine?utm_source=openai')])"
2122,"('Alectinib', 'Alecensa', 'Ch 5424802', 'Alectinib (ch5424802)', 'Af 802')",Medical,"Alectinib (INN), sold under the brand name Alecensa, is an anticancer medication that is used to treat non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It blocks the activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). It is taken by mouth. It was developed by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Japan, which is part of the Hoffmann-La Roche group. The most common side effects include constipation, muscle pain and edema (swelling) including of the ankles and feet, the face, the eyelids and the area around the eyes. Alectinib was approved for medical use in Japan in 2014, the United States in 2015, Canada in 2016, Australia in 2017, the European Union in 2017, and the United Kingdom in 2021. == Medical uses == In the European Union, alectinib is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and for the treatment of adults with ALK‑positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. In the United States, it is indicated for the treatment of people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an FDA-approved test. In April 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the indication of alectinib to include adjuvant treatment following tumor resection in people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as detected by an FDA-approved test. == Contraindications == There are no reported contraindications. == Side effects == Apart from unspecific gastrointestinal effects such as constipation (in 34% of patients) and nausea (22%), common adverse effects in studies included oedema (swelling; 34%), myalgia (muscle pain; 31%), anaemia (low red blood cell count), sight disorders, light sensitivity and rashes (all below 20%). Serious side effects occurred in 19% of patients; fatal ones in 2.8%. == Interactions == Alectinib has a low potential for interactions. While it is metabolised by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and blockers of this enzyme accordingly increase its concentrations in the body, they also decrease concentrations of the active metabolite M4, resulting in only a small overall effect. Conversely, CYP3A4 inducers decrease alectinib concentrations and increase M4 concentrations. Interactions via other CYP enzymes and transporter proteins cannot be excluded but are unlikely to be of clinical significance. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The substance potently and selectively blocks two receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes: anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and the RET proto-oncogene. The active metabolite M4 has similar activity against ALK. Inhibition of ALK subsequently blocks cell signalling pathways, including STAT3 and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and induces death (apoptosis) of tumour cells. === Pharmacokinetics === When taken with a meal, the absolute bioavailability of the drug is 37%, and highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after four to six hours. Steady state conditions are reached within seven days. Plasma protein binding of alectinib and M4 is over 99%. The enzyme mainly responsible for alectinib metabolism is CYP3A4; other CYP enzymes and aldehyde dehydrogenases only play a small role. Alectinib and M4 account for 76% of the circulating substance, while the rest are minor metabolites. Plasma half-life of alectinib is 32.5 hours, and that of M4 is 30.7 hours. 98% are excreted via the faeces, of which 84% are unchanged alectinib and 6% are M4. Less than 1% are found in the urine. == Chemistry == Alectinib has a pKa of 7.05. It is used in form of the hydrochloride, which is a white to yellow-white lumpy powder. == History == The approvals were based mainly on two trials: In a Japanese Phase I–II trial, after approximately 2 years, 19.6% of patients had achieved a complete response, and the 2-year progression-free survival rate was 76%. In February 2016 the J-ALEX phase III study comparing alectinib with crizotinib was terminated early because an interim analysis showed that progression-free survival was longer with alectinib. In November 2017, the FDA approved alectinib for the first-line treatment of people with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. This based on the phase 3 ALEX trial comparing it with crizotinib. Efficacy was demonstrated in a global, randomized, open-label trial (ALINA, NCT03456076) in participants with ALK-positive NSCLC who had complete tumor resection. Eligible participants were required to have resectable stage IB (tumors ≥ 4 cm) to IIIA NSCLC (by AJCC 7th edition) with ALK rearrangements identified by a locally performed FDA-approved ALK test or by a centrally performed VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx assay. A total of 257 participants were randomized (1:1) to receive alectinib 600 mg orally twice daily or platinum-based chemotherapy following tumor resection. The application was granted priority review and orphan drug designations. In April 2024, the FDA approved alectinib as an adjuvant treatment for people with ALK-positive early-stage lung cancer. This was based on the Phase III ALINA study [NCT03456076]. In April 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion for the use of alectinib for adjuvant treatment of resected non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In June 2024, the EU approved alectinib as an adjuvant treatment for people in the EU with ALK-positive early-stage lung cancer. This was based on the Phase III ALINA study [NCT03456076]. In October 2024, the UK`s NICE recommended alectinib as an adjuvant treatment for adults for the treatment of stage 1B to 3A ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Alectinib was approved in Japan in July 2014, for the treatment of ALK fusion-gene positive, unresectable, advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alectinib was granted an accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2015, to treat people with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC whose disease worsened after, or who could not tolerate, treatment with crizotinib (Xalkori). It received conditional approval by the European Medicines Agency in February 2017, for the same indication. The approval was upgraded from conditional to full approval in December 2017. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT01588028 for ""A Study of Alectinib (CH5424802/RO5424802) in Participants With Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-Rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT01801111 for ""A Study of Alectinib (RO5424802) in Participants With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) Mutation and Failed Crizotinib Treatment"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02075840 for ""A Study Comparing Alectinib With Crizotinib in Treatment-Naive Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Participants (ALEX)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Alecensa,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2516897186287679e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -4.7444173105759546e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([roche.com](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-04-19?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='FDA approves Roche’s Alecensa as the first adjuvant treatment for people with ALK-positive early-stage lung cancer', type='url_citation', url='https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2024-04-19?utm_source=openai')])"

Lysine contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form when the lysine is dissolved in water at physiological pH), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form when the lysine is dissolved in water at physiological pH), and a side chain (CH2)4NH2 (which is partially protonated when the lysine is dissolved in water at physiological pH), and so it is classified as a basic, charged (in water at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is encoded by the codons AAA and AAG. Like almost all other amino acids, the α-carbon is chiral and lysine may refer to either enantiomer or a racemic mixture of both. For the purpose of this article, lysine will refer to the biologically active enantiomer L-lysine, where the α-carbon is in the S configuration. The human body cannot synthesize lysine. It is essential in humans and must therefore be obtained from the diet. In organisms that synthesise lysine, two main biosynthetic pathways exist, the diaminopimelate and α-aminoadipate pathways, which employ distinct enzymes and substrates and are found in diverse organisms. Lysine catabolism occurs through one of several pathways, the most common of which is the saccharopine pathway. Lysine plays several roles in humans, most importantly proteinogenesis, but also in the crosslinking of collagen polypeptides, uptake of essential mineral nutrients, and in the production of carnitine, which is key in fatty acid metabolism. Lysine is also often involved in histone modifications, and thus, impacts the epigenome. The ε-amino group often participates in hydrogen bonding and as a general base in catalysis. The ε-ammonium group (−NH+3) is attached to the fourth carbon from the α-carbon, which is attached to the carboxyl (−COOH) group. Due to its importance in several biological processes, a lack of lysine can lead to several disease states including defective connective tissues, impaired fatty acid metabolism, anaemia, and systemic protein-energy deficiency. In contrast, an overabundance of lysine, caused by ineffective catabolism, can cause severe neurological disorders. Lysine was first isolated by the German biological chemist Ferdinand Heinrich Edmund Drechsel in 1889 from hydrolysis of the protein casein, and thus named it Lysin, from Greek λύσις (lysis) 'loosening'. In 1902, the German chemists Emil Fischer and Fritz Weigert determined lysine's chemical structure by synthesizing it. The one-letter symbol K was assigned to lysine for being alphabetically nearest, with L being assigned to the structurally simpler leucine, and M to methionine. == Biosynthesis == Two pathways have been identified in nature for the synthesis of lysine. The diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway belongs to the aspartate derived biosynthetic family, which is also involved in the synthesis of threonine, methionine and isoleucine, whereas the α-aminoadipate (AAA) pathway is part of the glutamate biosynthetic family. === DAP pathway === The DAP pathway is found in both prokaryotes and plants and begins with the dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) (E.C 4.3.3.7) catalysed condensation reaction between the aspartate derived, L-aspartate semialdehyde, and pyruvate to form (4S)-4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(2S)-dipicolinic acid (HTPA). The product is then reduced by dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DHDPR) (E.C 1.3.1.26), with NAD(P)H as a proton donor, to yield 2,3,4,5-tetrahydrodipicolinate (THDP). From this point on, four pathway variations have been found, namely the acetylase, aminotransferase, dehydrogenase, and succinylase pathways. Both the acetylase and succinylase variant pathways use four enzyme catalysed steps, the aminotransferase pathway uses two enzymes, and the dehydrogenase pathway uses a single enzyme. These four variant pathways converge at the formation of the penultimate product, meso‑diaminopimelate, which is subsequently enzymatically decarboxylated in an irreversible reaction catalysed by diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC) (E.C 4.1.1.20) to produce L-lysine. The DAP pathway is regulated at multiple levels, including upstream at the enzymes involved in aspartate processing as well as at the initial DHDPS catalysed condensation step. Lysine imparts a strong negative feedback loop on these enzymes and, subsequently, regulates the entire pathway. === AAA pathway === The AAA pathway involves the condensation of α-ketoglutarate and acetyl-CoA via the intermediate AAA for the synthesis of L-lysine. This pathway has been shown to be present in several yeast species, as well as protists and higher fungi. It has also been reported that an alternative variant of the AAA route has been found in Thermus thermophilus and Pyrococcus horikoshii, which could indicate that this pathway is more widely spread in prokaryotes than originally proposed. The first and rate-limiting step in the AAA pathway is the condensation reaction between acetyl-CoA and α‑ketoglutarate catalysed by homocitrate-synthase (HCS) (E.C 2.3.3.14) to give the intermediate homocitryl‑CoA, which is hydrolysed by the same enzyme to produce homocitrate. Homocitrate is enzymatically dehydrated by homoaconitase (HAc) (E.C 4.2.1.36) to yield cis-homoaconitate. HAc then catalyses a second reaction in which cis-homoaconitate undergoes rehydration to produce homoisocitrate. The resulting product undergoes an oxidative decarboxylation by homoisocitrate dehydrogenase (HIDH) (E.C 1.1.1.87) to yield α‑ketoadipate. AAA is then formed via a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase (PLP-AT) (E.C 2.6.1.39), using glutamate as the amino donor. From this point on, the AAA pathway varies with [something is missing here ? -> at the very least, section header! ] on the kingdom. In fungi, AAA is reduced to α‑aminoadipate-semialdehyde via AAA reductase (E.C 1.2.1.95) in a unique process involving both adenylation and reduction that is activated by a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (E.C 2.7.8.7). Once the semialdehyde is formed, saccharopine reductase (E.C 1.5.1.10) catalyses a condensation reaction with glutamate and NAD(P)H, as a proton donor, and the imine is reduced to produce the penultimate product, saccharopine. The final step of the pathway in fungi involves the saccharopine dehydrogenase (SDH) (E.C 1.5.1.8) catalysed oxidative deamination of saccharopine, resulting in L-lysine. In a variant AAA pathway found in some prokaryotes, AAA is first converted to N‑acetyl-α-aminoadipate, which is phosphorylated and then reductively dephosphorylated to the ε-aldehyde. The aldehyde is then transaminated to N‑acetyllysine, which is deacetylated to give L-lysine. However, the enzymes involved in this variant pathway need further validation. == Catabolism == As with all amino acids, catabolism of lysine is initiated from the uptake of dietary lysine or from the breakdown of intracellular protein. Catabolism is also used as a means to control the intracellular concentration of free lysine and maintain a steady-state to prevent the toxic effects of excessive free lysine. There are several pathways involved in lysine catabolism but the most commonly used is the saccharopine pathway, which primarily takes place in the liver (and equivalent organs) in animals, specifically within the mitochondria. This is the reverse of the previously described AAA pathway. In animals and plants, the first two steps of the saccharopine pathway are catalysed by the bifunctional enzyme, α-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), which possess both lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) (E.C 1.5.1.8) and SDH activities, whereas in other organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, both of these enzymes are encoded by separate genes. The first step involves the LKR catalysed reduction of L-lysine in the presence of α-ketoglutarate to produce saccharopine, with NAD(P)H acting as a proton donor. Saccharopine then undergoes a dehydration reaction, catalysed by SDH in the presence of NAD+, to produce AAS and glutamate. AAS dehydrogenase (AASD) (E.C 1.2.1.31) then further dehydrates the molecule into AAA. Subsequently, PLP-AT catalyses the reverse reaction to that of the AAA biosynthesis pathway, resulting in AAA being converted to α-ketoadipate. The product, α‑ketoadipate, is decarboxylated in the presence of NAD+ and coenzyme A to yield glutaryl-CoA, however the enzyme involved in this is yet to be fully elucidated. Some evidence suggests that the 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex (OADHc), which is structurally homologous to the E1 subunit of the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc) (E.C 1.2.4.2), is responsible for the decarboxylation reaction. Finally, glutaryl-CoA is oxidatively decarboxylated to crotonyl-CoA by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (E.C 1.3.8.6), which goes on to be further processed through multiple enzymatic steps to yield acetyl-CoA; an essential carbon metabolite involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). == Nutritional value == Lysine is an essential amino acid in humans. The human daily nutritional requirement varies from ~60 mg/kg in infancy to ~30 mg/kg in adults. This requirement is commonly met in a western society with the intake of lysine from meat and vegetable sources well in excess of the recommended requirement. In vegetarian diets, the intake of lysine is less due to the limited quantity of lysine in cereal crops compared to meat sources. Given the limiting concentration of lysine in cereal crops, it has long been speculated that the content of lysine can be increased through genetic modification practices. Often these practices have involved the intentional dysregulation of the DAP pathway by means of introducing lysine feedback-insensitive orthologues of the DHDPS enzyme. These methods have met limited success likely due to the toxic side effects of increased free lysine and indirect effects on the TCA cycle. Plants accumulate lysine and other amino acids in the form of seed storage proteins, found within the seeds of the plant, and this represents the edible component of cereal crops. This highlights the need to not only increase free lysine, but also direct lysine towards the synthesis of stable seed storage proteins, and subsequently, increase the nutritional value of the consumable component of crops. While genetic modification practices have met limited success, more traditional selective breeding techniques have allowed for the isolation of ""Quality Protein Maize"", which has significantly increased levels of lysine and tryptophan, also an essential amino acid. This increase in lysine content is attributed to an opaque-2 mutation that reduced the transcription of lysine-lacking zein-related seed storage proteins and, as a result, increased the abundance of other proteins that are rich in lysine. Commonly, to overcome the limiting abundance of lysine in livestock feed, industrially produced lysine is added. The industrial process includes the fermentative culturing of Corynebacterium glutamicum and the subsequent purification of lysine. === Dietary sources === Good sources of lysine are high-protein foods such as eggs, meat (specifically red meat, lamb, pork, and poultry), soy, beans and peas, cheese (particularly Parmesan), and certain fish (such as cod and sardines). Lysine is the limiting amino acid (the essential amino acid found in the smallest quantity in the particular foodstuff) in most cereal grains, but is plentiful in most pulses (legumes). Beans contain the lysine that maize lacks, and in the human archeological record beans and maize often appear together, as in the Three Sisters: beans, maize, and squash. A food is considered to have sufficient lysine if it has at least 51 mg of lysine per gram of protein (so that the protein is 5.1% lysine). L-lysine HCl is used as a dietary supplement, providing 80.03% L-lysine. As such, 1 g of L-lysine is contained in 1.25 g of L-lysine HCl. == Biological roles == The most common role for lysine is proteinogenesis. Lysine frequently plays an important role in protein structure. Since its side chain contains a positively charged group on one end and a long hydrophobic carbon tail close to the backbone, lysine is considered somewhat amphipathic. For this reason, lysine can be found buried as well as more commonly in solvent channels and on the exterior of proteins, where it can interact with the aqueous environment. Lysine can also contribute to protein stability as its ε-amino group often participates in hydrogen bonding, salt bridges and covalent interactions to form a Schiff base. A second major role of lysine is in epigenetic regulation by means of histone modification. There are several types of covalent histone modifications, which commonly involve lysine residues found in the protruding tail of histones. Modifications often include the addition or removal of an acetyl (−CH3CO) forming acetyllysine or reverting to lysine, up to three methyl (−CH3), ubiquitin or a sumo protein group. The various modifications have downstream effects on gene regulation, in which genes can be activated or repressed. Lysine has also been implicated to play a key role in other biological processes including; structural proteins of connective tissues, calcium homeostasis, and fatty acid metabolism. Lysine has been shown to be involved in the crosslinking between the three helical polypeptides in collagen, resulting in its stability and tensile strength. This mechanism is akin to the role of lysine in bacterial cell walls, in which lysine (and meso-diaminopimelate) are critical to the formation of crosslinks, and therefore, stability of the cell wall. This concept has previously been explored as a means to circumvent the unwanted release of potentially pathogenic genetically modified bacteria. It was proposed that an auxotrophic strain of Escherichia coli (X1776) could be used for all genetic modification practices, as the strain is unable to survive without the supplementation of DAP, and thus, cannot live outside of a laboratory environment. Lysine has also been proposed to be involved in calcium intestinal absorption and renal retention, and thus, may play a role in calcium homeostasis. Finally, lysine has been shown to be a precursor for carnitine, which transports fatty acids to the mitochondria, where they can be oxidised for the release of energy. Carnitine is synthesised from trimethyllysine, which is a product of the degradation of certain proteins, as such lysine must first be incorporated into proteins and be methylated prior to being converted to carnitine. However, in mammals the primary source of carnitine is through dietary sources, rather than through lysine conversion. In opsins like rhodopsin and the visual opsins (encoded by the genes OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW), retinaldehyde forms a Schiff base with a conserved lysine residue, and interaction of light with the retinylidene group causes signal transduction in color vision (See visual cycle for details). === Disputed roles === There has been a long discussion that lysine, when administered intravenously or orally, can significantly increase the release of growth hormones. This has led to athletes using lysine as a means of promoting muscle growth while training, however, no significant evidence to support this application of lysine has been found to date. Because herpes simplex virus (HSV) proteins are richer in arginine and poorer in lysine than the cells they infect, lysine supplements have been tried as a treatment. Since the two amino acids are taken up in the intestine, reclaimed in the kidney, and moved into cells by the same amino acid transporters, an abundance of lysine would, in theory, limit the amount of arginine available for viral replication. Clinical studies do not provide good evidence for effectiveness as a prophylactic or in the treatment for HSV outbreaks. In response to product claims that lysine could improve immune responses to HSV, a review by the European Food Safety Authority found no evidence of a cause–effect relationship. The same review, published in 2011, found no evidence to support claims that lysine could lower cholesterol, increase appetite, contribute to protein synthesis in any role other than as an ordinary nutrient, or increase calcium absorption or retention. == Roles in disease == Diseases related to lysine are a result of the downstream processing of lysine, i.e. the incorporation into proteins or modification into alternative biomolecules. The role of lysine in collagen has been outlined above, however, a lack of lysine and hydroxylysine involved in the crosslinking of collagen peptides has been linked to a disease state of the connective tissue. As carnitine is a key lysine-derived metabolite involved in fatty acid metabolism, a substandard diet lacking sufficient carnitine and lysine can lead to decreased carnitine levels, which can have significant cascading effects on an individual's health. Lysine has also been shown to play a role in anaemia, as lysine is suspected to have an effect on the uptake of iron and, subsequently, the concentration of ferritin in blood plasma. However, the exact mechanism of action is yet to be elucidated. Most commonly, lysine deficiency is seen in non-western societies and manifests as protein-energy malnutrition, which has profound and systemic effects on the health of the individual. There is also a hereditary genetic disease that involves mutations in the enzymes responsible for lysine catabolism, namely the bifunctional AASS enzyme of the saccharopine pathway. Due to a lack of lysine catabolism, the amino acid accumulates in plasma and patients develop hyperlysinaemia, which can present as asymptomatic to severe neurological disabilities, including epilepsy, ataxia, spasticity, and psychomotor impairment. The clinical significance of hyperlysinemia is the subject of debate in the field with some studies finding no correlation between physical or mental disabilities and hyperlysinemia. In addition to this, mutations in genes related to lysine metabolism have been implicated in several disease states, including pyridoxine-dependent epilepsia (ALDH7A1 gene), α-ketoadipic and α-aminoadipic aciduria (DHTKD1 gene), and glutaric aciduria type 1 (GCDH gene). Hyperlysinuria is marked by high amounts of lysine in the urine. It is often due to a metabolic disease in which a protein involved in the breakdown of lysine is non functional due to a genetic mutation. It may also occur due to a failure of renal tubular transport. == Use of lysine in animal feed == Lysine production for animal feed is a major global industry, reaching in 2009 almost 700,000 tons for a market value of over €1.22 billion. Lysine is an important additive to animal feed because it is a limiting amino acid when optimizing the growth of certain animals such as pigs and chickens for the production of meat. Lysine supplementation allows for the use of lower-cost plant protein (maize, for instance, rather than soy) while maintaining high growth rates, and limiting the pollution from nitrogen excretion. In turn, however, phosphate pollution is a major environmental cost when corn is used as feed for poultry and swine. Lysine is industrially produced by microbial fermentation, from a base mainly of sugar. Genetic engineering research is actively pursuing bacterial strains to improve the efficiency of production and allow lysine to be made from other substrates. The most common bacteria used is Corynebacterium glutamicum specially mutagenized or gene-engineered to produce lysine, but analogous strains of Escherichia coli are also employed. == In popular culture == The 1993 film Jurassic Park, which is based on the 1990 novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, features dinosaurs that were genetically altered so that they could not produce lysine, an example of engineered auxotrophy. This was known as the ""lysine contingency"" and was supposed to prevent the cloned dinosaurs from surviving outside the park, forcing them to depend on lysine supplements provided by the park's veterinary staff. In reality, no animal can produce lysine; it is an essential amino acid. In 1996, lysine became the focus of a price-fixing case, the largest in United States history. The Archer Daniels Midland Company paid a fine of US$100 million, and three of its executives were convicted and served prison time. Also found guilty in the price-fixing case were two Japanese firms (Ajinomoto, Kyowa Hakko) and a South Korean firm (Sewon). Secret video recordings of the conspirators fixing lysine's price can be found online or by requesting the video from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division. This case gave the basis for the book The Informant: A True Story, and the movie The Informant!. In the 2009 episode of the American sitcom, The Big Bang Theory, entitled The Friendship Algorithm, Sheldon is trying to befriend his work nemesis, Barry Kripke, to get time on some equipment he needs for an experiment. He gives his current group of friends a questionnaire so that he may get some insight into why they are friends. One of the questions is, ""What is Sheldon'sfavorite amino acid?"" Raj states that he had lysine, which is Sheldon's favorite, but changed it. == References == This article was adapted from the following source under a CC BY 4.0 license (2018) (reviewer reports): Cody J Hall; Tatiana P.

2125,"('Disodium succinate', 'Succinic acid', 'Butanedioic acid', 'Amber acid', 'Asuccin')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Succinic acid () is a dicarboxylic acid with the chemical formula (CH2)2(CO2H)2. In living organisms, succinic acid takes the form of an anion, succinate, which has multiple biological roles as a metabolic intermediate being converted into fumarate by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in complex 2 of the electron transport chain which is involved in making ATP, and as a signaling molecule reflecting the cellular metabolic state. Succinate is generated in mitochondria via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Succinate can exit the mitochondrial matrix and function in the cytoplasm as well as the extracellular space, changing gene expression patterns, modulating epigenetic landscape or demonstrating hormone-like signaling. As such, succinate links cellular metabolism, especially ATP formation, to the regulation of cellular function. Dysregulation of succinate synthesis, and therefore ATP synthesis, happens in some genetic mitochondrial diseases, such as Leigh syndrome, and Melas syndrome, and degradation can lead to pathological conditions, such as malignant transformation, inflammation and tissue injury. Succinic acid is marketed as food additive E363. The name derives from Latin succinum, meaning amber. == Physical properties == Succinic acid is a white, odorless solid with a highly acidic taste. In an aqueous solution, succinic acid readily ionizes to form its conjugate base, succinate (). As a diprotic acid, succinic acid undergoes two successive deprotonation reactions: (CH2)2(CO2H)2 → (CH2)2(CO2H)(CO2)− + H+ (CH2)2(CO2H)(CO2)− → (CH2)2(CO2)22− + H+ The pKa of these processes are 4.3 and 5.6, respectively. Both anions are colorless and can be isolated as the salts, e.g., Na(CH2)2(CO2H)(CO2) and Na2(CH2)2(CO2)2. In living organisms, primarily succinate, not succinic acid, is found. As a radical group it is called a succinyl () group. Like most simple mono- and dicarboxylic acids, it is not harmful but can be an irritant to skin and eyes. == Commercial production == Historically, succinic acid was obtained from amber by distillation and has thus been known as spirit of amber (Latin: spiritus succini). Common industrial routes include hydrogenation of maleic acid, oxidation of 1,4-butanediol, and carbonylation of ethylene glycol. Succinate is also produced from butane via maleic anhydride. Global production is estimated at 16,000 to 30,000 tons a year, with an annual growth rate of 10%. Genetically engineered Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are proposed for the commercial production via fermentation of glucose. == Chemical reactions == Succinic acid can be dehydrogenated to fumaric acid or be converted to diesters, such as diethylsuccinate (CH2CO2CH2CH3)2. This diethyl ester is a substrate in the Stobbe condensation. Dehydration of succinic acid gives succinic anhydride. Succinate can be used to derive 1,4-butanediol, maleic anhydride, succinimide, 2-pyrrolidinone and tetrahydrofuran. == Applications == In 2004, succinate was placed on the US Department of Energy's list of top 12 platform chemicals from biomass. === Precursor to polymers, resins, and solvents === Succinic acid is a precursor to some polyesters and a component of some alkyd resins. 1,4-Butanediol (BDO) can be synthesized using succinic acid as a precursor. The automotive and electronics industries heavily rely on BDO to produce connectors, insulators, wheel covers, gearshift knobs and reinforcing beams. Succinic acid also serves as the bases of certain biodegradable polymers, which are of interest in tissue engineering applications. Acylation with succinic acid is called succination. Oversuccination occurs when more than one succinate adds to a substrate. === Food and dietary supplement === As a food additive and dietary supplement, succinic acid is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Succinic acid is used primarily as an acidity regulator in the food and beverage industry. It is also available as a flavoring agent, contributing a somewhat sour and astringent component to umami taste. As an excipient in pharmaceutical products, it is also used to control acidity or as a counter ion. Drugs involving succinate include metoprolol succinate, sumatriptan succinate, doxylamine succinate or solifenacin succinate. == Biosynthesis == === Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle === Succinate is a key intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a primary metabolic pathway used to produce chemical energy in the presence of O2. Succinate is generated from succinyl-CoA by the enzyme succinyl-CoA synthetase in a GTP/ATP-producing step:: Section 17.1 Succinyl-CoA + NDP + Pi → Succinate + CoA + NTP Catalyzed by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), succinate is subsequently oxidized to fumarate:: Section 17.1 Succinate + FAD → Fumarate + FADH2 SDH also participates in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, where it is known as respiratory complex II. This enzyme complex is a 4 subunit membrane-bound lipoprotein which couples the oxidation of succinate to the reduction of ubiquinone via the intermediate electron carriers FAD and three 2Fe-2S clusters. Succinate thus serves as a direct electron donor to the electron transport chain, and itself is converted into fumarate. Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. === Reductive branch of the TCA cycle === Succinate can alternatively be formed by reverse activity of SDH. Under anaerobic conditions certain bacteria such as A. succinogenes, A. succiniciproducens and M. succiniciproducens, run the TCA cycle in reverse and convert glucose to succinate through the intermediates of oxaloacetate, malate and fumarate. This pathway is exploited in metabolic engineering to net generate succinate for human use. Additionally, succinic acid produced during the fermentation of sugar provides a combination of saltiness, bitterness and acidity to fermented alcohols. Accumulation of fumarate can drive the reverse activity of SDH, thus enhancing succinate generation. Under pathological and physiological conditions, the malate-aspartate shuttle or the purine nucleotide shuttle can increase mitochondrial fumarate, which is then readily converted to succinate. === Glyoxylate cycle === Succinate is also a product of the glyoxylate cycle, which converts two two-carbon acetyl units into the four-carbon succinate. The glyoxylate cycle is utilized by many bacteria, plants and fungi and allows these organisms to subsist on acetate or acetyl CoA yielding compounds. The pathway avoids the decarboxylation steps of the TCA cycle via the enzyme isocitrate lyase which cleaves isocitrate into succinate and glyoxylate. Generated succinate is then available for either energy production or biosynthesis.: Section 17.4 === GABA shunt === Succinate is the re-entry point for the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt into the TCA cycle, a closed cycle which synthesizes and recycles GABA. The GABA shunt serves as an alternate route to convert alpha-ketoglutarate into succinate, bypassing the TCA cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA and instead producing the intermediate GABA. Transamination and subsequent decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate leads to the formation of GABA. GABA is then metabolized by GABA transaminase to succinic semialdehyde. Finally, succinic semialdehyde is oxidized by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) to form succinate, re-entering the TCA cycle and closing the loop. Enzymes required for the GABA shunt are expressed in neurons, glial cells, macrophages and pancreatic cells. == Cellular metabolism == === Metabolic intermediate === Succinate is produced and concentrated in the mitochondria and its primary biological function is that of a metabolic intermediate.: Section 17.1 All metabolic pathways that are interlinked with the TCA cycle, including the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, fatty acids, cholesterol, and heme, rely on the temporary formation of succinate. The intermediate is made available for biosynthetic processes through multiple pathways, including the reductive branch of the TCA cycle or the glyoxylate cycle, which are able to drive net production of succinate. In rodents, mitochondrial concentrations are approximately ~0.5 mM while plasma concentration are only 2–20 μM. === ROS production === The activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which interconverts succinate into fumarate participates in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by directing electron flow in the electron transport chain. Under conditions of succinate accumulation, rapid oxidation of succinate by SDH can drive reverse electron transport (RET). If mitochondrial respiratory complex III is unable to accommodate excess electrons supplied by succinate oxidation, it forces electrons to flow backwards along the electron transport chain. RET at mitochondrial respiratory complex 1, the complex normally preceding SDH in the electron transport chain, leads to ROS production and creates a pro-oxidant microenvironment. == Additional biologic functions == In addition to its metabolic roles, succinate serves as an intracellular and extracellular signaling molecule. Extra-mitochondrial succinate alters the epigenetic landscape by inhibiting the family of 2-oxogluterate-dependent dioxygenases. Alternative, succinate can be released into the extracellular milieu and the blood stream where it is recognized by target receptors. In general, leakage from the mitochondria requires succinate overproduction or underconsumption and occurs due to reduced, reverse or completely absent activity of SDH or alternative changes in metabolic state. Mutations in SDH, hypoxia or energetic misbalance are all linked to an alteration of flux through the TCA cycle and succinate accumulation. Upon exiting the mitochondria, succinate serves as a signal of metabolic state, communicating to neighboring cells how metabolically active the originating cell population is. As such, succinate links TCA cycle dysfunction or metabolic changes to cell-cell communication and to oxidative stress-related responses. === Transporters === Succinate requires specific transporters to move through both the mitochondrial and plasma membrane. Succinate exits the mitochondrial matrix and passes through the inner mitochondrial membrane via dicarboxylate transporters, primarily SLC25A10, a succinate-fumarate/malate transporter. In the second step of mitochondrial export, succinate readily crosses the outer mitochondrial membrane through porins, nonspecific protein channels that facilitate the diffusion of molecules less than 1.5 kDa. Transport across the plasma membrane is likely tissue specific. A key candidate transporter is INDY (I'm not dead yet), a sodium-independent anion exchanger, which moves both dicarboxylate and citrate into the bloodstream. === Extracellular signaling === Extracellular succinate can act as a signaling molecule with hormone-like functions in stimulating a variety of cells such as those in the blood, adipose tissues, immune tissues, liver, heart, retina and kidney. Extracellular succinate works by binding to and thereby activating the GPR91 (also termed SUCNR1) receptor on the cells that express this receptor. Most studies have reported that the GPR91 protein consists of 330 amino acids although a few studies have detected a 334 amino acid product of GPR91 gene. Arg99, His103, Arg252, and Arg281 near the center of the GPR91 protein generate a positively charged binding site for succinate. GPR91 resides on its target cells' surface membranes with its binding site facing the extracellular space. It is a G protein-coupled receptor sub-type of receptor that, depending on the cell type bearing it, interacts with multiple G proteins subtypes including Gs, Gi and Gq. This enables GPR91 to regulate a multitude of signaling outcomes. Succinate has a high affinity for GPR91, with an EC50 (i.e., concentration that induces a half maximal response) for stimulating GPR91 in the 20–50 μM range. Succinate's activation of the GPR91 receptor simulates a wide range of cell types and physiological responses (see Functions regulated by SUCNR1). ==== Effect on adipocytes ==== In adipocytes, the succinate-activated GPR91 signaling cascade inhibits lipolysis. ==== Effect on the liver and retina ==== Succinate signaling often occurs in response to hypoxic conditions. In the liver, succinate serves as a paracrine signal, released by anoxic hepatocytes, and targets stellate cells via GPR91. This leads to stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis. Thus, succinate is thought to play a role in liver homeostasis. In the retina, succinate accumulates in retinal ganglion cells in response to ischemic conditions. Autocrine succinate signaling promotes retinal neovascularization, triggering the activation of angiogenic factors such as endothelial growth factor (VEGF). ==== Effect on the heart ==== Extracellular succinate regulates cardiomyocyte viability through GPR91 activation; long-term succinate exposure leads to pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Stimulation of GPR91 triggers at least two signaling pathways in the heart: a MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 pathway that activates hypertrophic gene expression and a phospholipase C pathway which changes the pattern of Ca2+ uptake and distribution and triggers CaM-dependent hypertrophic gene activation. ==== Effect on immune cells ==== SUCNR1 is highly expressed on immature dendritic cells, where succinate binding stimulates chemotaxis. Furthermore, SUCNR1 synergizes with toll-like receptors to increase the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha and interleukin-1beta. Succinate may enhance adaptive immunity by triggering the activity of antigen-presenting cells that, in turn, activate T-cells. ==== Effect on platelets ==== SUCNR1 is one of the highest expressed G protein-coupled receptors on human platelets, present at levels similar to P2Y12, though the role of succinate signaling in platelet aggregation is debated. Multiple studies have demonstrated succinate-induced aggregation, but the effect has high inter-individual variability. ==== Effect on the kidneys ==== Succinate serves as a modulator of blood pressure by stimulating renin release in macula densa and juxtaglomerular apparatus cells via GPR91. Therapies targeting succinate to reduce cardiovascular risk and hypertension are currently under investigation. === Intracellular signaling === Accumulation of either fumarate or succinate reduces the activity of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including histone and DNA demethylases, prolyl hydroxylases and collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylases, through competitive inhibition. 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases require an iron cofactor to catalyze hydroxylations, desaturations and ring closures. Simultaneous to substrate oxidation, they convert 2-oxoglutarate, also known as alpha-ketoglutarate, into succinate and CO2. 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases bind substrates in a sequential, ordered manner. First, 2-oxoglutarate coordinates with an Fe(II) ion bound to a conserved 2-histidinyl–1-aspartyl/glutamyl triad of residues present in the enzymatic center. Subsequently, the primary substrate enters the binding pocket and lastly dioxygen binds to the enzyme-substrate complex. Oxidative decarboxylation then generates a ferryl intermediate coordinated to succinate, which serves to oxidize the bound primary substrate. Succinate may interfere with the enzymatic process by attaching to the Fe(II) center first, prohibiting the binding of 2-oxoglutarate. Thus, via enzymatic inhibition, increased succinate load can lead to changes in transcription factor activity and genome-wide alterations in histone and DNA methylation. ==== Epigenetic effects ==== Succinate and fumarate inhibit the TET (ten-eleven translocation) family of 5-methylcytosine DNA modifying enzymes and the JmjC domain-containing histone lysine demethylase (KDM). Pathologically elevated levels of succinate lead to hypermethylation, epigenetic silencing and changes in neuroendocrine differentiation, potentially driving cancer formation. ==== Gene regulation ==== Succinate inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) stabilizes the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1α. PHDs hydroxylate proline in parallel to oxidatively decarboxylating 2-oxyglutarate to succinate and CO2. In humans, three HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases regulate the stability of HIFs. Hydroxylation of two prolyl residues in HIF1α facilitates ubiquitin ligation, thus marking it for proteolytic destruction by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Since PHDs have an absolute requirement for molecular oxygen, this process is suppressed in hypoxia allowing HIF1α to escape destruction. High concentrations of succinate will mimic the hypoxia state by suppressing PHDs, therefore stabilizing HIF1α and inducing the transcription of HIF1-dependent genes even under normal oxygen conditions. HIF1 is known to induce transcription of more than 60 genes, including genes involved in vascularization and angiogenesis, energy metabolism, cell survival, and tumor invasion. == Role in human health == === Inflammation === Metabolic signaling involving succinate can be involved in inflammation via stabilization of HIF1-alpha or GPR91 signaling in innate immune cells. Through these mechanisms, succinate accumulation has been shown to regulate production of inflammatory cytokines. For dendritic cells, succinate functions as a chemoattractant and increases their antigen-presenting function via receptor stimulated cytokine production. In inflammatory macrophages, succinate-induced stability of HIF1 results in increased transcription of HIF1-dependent genes, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. Other inflammatory cytokines produced by activated macrophages such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin 6 are not directly affected by succinate and HIF1. The mechanism by which succinate accumulates in immune cells is not fully understood. Activation of inflammatory macrophages through toll-like receptors induces a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. In spite of a general downregulation of the TCA cycle under these conditions, succinate concentration is increased. However, lipopolysaccharides involved in the activation of macrophages increase glutamine and GABA transporters. Succinate may thus be produced from enhanced glutamine metabolism via alpha-ketoglutarate or the GABA shunt. === Tumorigenesis === Succinate is one of three oncometabolites, metabolic intermediates whose accumulation causes metabolic and non-metabolic dysregulation implicated in tumorigenesis. Loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase, frequently found in hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma, cause pathological increase in succinate. SDH mutations have also been identified in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, renal tumors, thyroid tumors, testicular seminomas and neuroblastomas. The oncogenic mechanism caused by mutated SHD is thought to relate to succinate's ability to inhibit 2-oxogluterate-dependent dioxygenases. Inhibition of KDMs and TET hydroxylases results in epigenetic dysregulation and hypermethylation affecting genes involved in cell differentiation. Additionally, succinate-promoted activation of HIF-1α generates a pseudo-hypoxic state that can promote tumorneogensis by transcriptional activation of genes involved in proliferation, metabolism and angiogenesis. The other two oncometabolites, fumarate and 2-hydroxyglutarate have similar structures to succinate and function through parallel HIF-inducing oncogenic mechanisms. === Ischemia reperfusion injury === Succinate accumulation under hypoxic conditions has been implicated in the reperfusion injury through increased ROS production. During ischemia, succinate accumulates. Upon reperfusion, succinate is rapidly oxidized leading to abrupt and extensive production of ROS. ROS then trigger the cellular apoptotic machinery or induce oxidative damage to proteins, membranes, organelles etc. In animal models, pharmacological inhibition of ischemic succinate accumulation ameliorated ischemia-reperfusion injury. As of 2016 the inhibition of succinate-mediated ROS production was under investigation as a therapeutic drug target. == See also == Flame retardant Oil of amber, procured by heating succinic acid Citric acid cycle Metabolite Oncometabolism == References == == External links == FDA Succinic Acid Calculator: Water and solute activities in aqueous succinic acid PubChem: Compound Summary for Succinic Acid",Butanedioic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.01247798465192318), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.6240566083070007e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' FOOD', -0.012829700484871864), (',', -0.00018065694894175977), (' INDUSTR', -0.14582951366901398), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.16273659467697144), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('OUS', -1.5497195136049413e-06), (',', -5.006777428206988e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.010543005540966988), (',', -0.10022987425327301), ('ĠINDU', -0.1269744634628296), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -2.706014311115723e-05), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.31329789757728577), ('ĠMED', -9.274052717955783e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015211451100185513)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0032260757870972157), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0007100477814674377), (' END', -0.12692862749099731), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.00033546582562848926), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([oxfordreference.com](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095538409?utm_source=openai), [cosmacon.de](https://www.cosmacon.de/en/butanedioic-acid/?utm_source=openai), [atamanchemicals.com](https://www.atamanchemicals.com/1-4-butanedioic-acid_u26944/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=348, start_index=45, title='Butanedioic acid - Oxford Reference', type='url_citation', url='https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095538409?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=348, start_index=45, title='Butanedioic acid - Succinic Acid - CAS 110–15–6 - Cosmacon', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cosmacon.de/en/butanedioic-acid/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=348, start_index=45, title='1,4-BUTANEDIOIC ACID - Ataman Kimya', type='url_citation', url='https://www.atamanchemicals.com/1-4-butanedioic-acid_u26944/?utm_source=openai')])"
2126,"('N-acetylprocainamide', 'Acecainide', 'Acekainid', 'Acecainida', 'Acecainidum')",Medical,"Acecainide (N-acetylprocainamide, NAPA) is an antiarrhythmic drug. Chemically, it is the N-acetylated metabolite of procainamide. It is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent, whereas procainamide is a Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug. It is only partially as active as procainamide; when checking levels, both must be included in the final calculation. == History == In the early 1930s, Claude Beck was undertaking pioneer cardiac surgery at the Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. During and after his surgery he was facing problems with arrhythmias. These problems were investigated by Frederick R. Mautz. In these experiments he used drugs similar to cocaine, because these drugs were readily absorbed from mucous membranes and were also known to have some effect on the myocardium. Mautz tried procaine, but its action was short-lived owing to digestion by esterases. From procaine Mautz synthesized procainamide, which is not a substrate for esterases. Procainamide has the additional advantage of being active by mouth. Procainamide was approved by the US FDA on June 2, 1950 under the brand name Pronestyl. In 1951 Pronestyl was launched by Bristol-Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company in the US. Along with the discovery of procainamide came the discovery of its metabolite acecainide. == Synthesis == Procainamide is metabolized in the liver to acecainide by N-acetyltransferase, an enzyme that is genetically determined. N-Acetyltransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to arylamines and aromatic amines such as procainamide. This reaction is known as an acetylation reaction, that refers to the process of introducing an acetyl group (resulting in an acetoxy group) into a compound, namely the substitution of an acetyl group for an active hydrogen atom. == Activity == Acecainide is the major metabolite of the antiarrhythmic drug, procainamide. Measurements of procainamide in serum may not accurately reflect the drug's complete pharmacologic activity in the body. Monitoring acecainide levels along with the procainamide is recommended during procainamide therapy. Acecainide is considered comparable in activity to its parent compound; however, acecainide levels will vary widely. Serum levels of acecainide increase in patients on chronic procainamide therapy, particularly in those with renal impairment. The average serum concentration ratio of acecainide to procainamide is 0.8 to 1.2, depending on a genetically determined tendency to acetylate procainamide rapidly or slowly. Because the ratio varies from patient to patient, measuring serum acecainide and procainamide together helps to achieve an optimum anti-arrhythmic effect and reduce the risk of toxicity. === Mechanism === Acecainide is a potassium-channel blocker like Class III antiarrhythmic compounds. This compounds can bind to potassium channels and delays phase 3 repolarization. These electrophysiological changes decrease the sensitiveness of cells to electrical stimuli, which leads to an increase in action potential duration and an increase in the effective refractory period. By increasing the effective refractory period NAPA is very useful in suppressing tachyarrhythmias caused by re-entry ventricular arrhythmia. In this way NAPA can increase the Q - T interval of the PQRST heart rhythm. == Medical uses == Acecainide is pharmacologically active as an antiarrhythmic agent. It has electrophysiological effects of a class III antiarrhythmic drug and it is used as a medicine to increase the Q – T interval of the PQRST heart rhythm in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. The equivalent drug procainamide, which is a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, is also used in patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Nevertheless, NAPA does only affect the Q - T interval, while procainamide has also effect on the QRS-interval. Also the electrophysiologic properties of NAPA are a little bit different from those of procainamide and NAPA is not completely effective for suppressing ventricular dysrhythmias, but its antiarrhythmic mechanisms are similar to those of procainamide. == Toxicokinetics == === Absorption and plasma concentrations === The pharmacokinetic properties of acecainide, an active metabolite of procainamide, have been studied in healthy people and patients with cardiomyopathy in elderly and younger patients. In healthy people, mean peak plasma concentrations following oral doses of 900 and 1000 mg of NAPA were 5.9 and 5.3 mg/L, and it attained 2.2 to 2.8 hours after administration. In a few patients with cardiomyopathy the mean peak plasma concentration was 5.6 mg/L 1.6 hours after ingestion. Acecainide has a bioavailability of 85%, with a mean peak plasma occurring between 45 and 90 minutes. === Distribution === The mean apparent volume of distribution range is from 2.61 to 2.9 L/kg in healthy people and patients with cardiomyopathy. At steady state, the volume of distribution is 1.3 to 1.7 L/kg in healthy subjects, 1.3 to 1.58 L/kg in patients with coronary artery disease, and 1.25 L/kg in patients with ventricular arrhythmias receiving acecainide therapy. Acecainide has a volume of distribution of 1.5 L/kg that is less than the Vd of procainamide (2.0 L/kg). Also it binds 10% less to proteins than procainamide. Because of this low volume of distribution, it can be concluded that the medicine is thought to be confined in the plasma or liquid parts of the blood. === Metabolism and elimination === In the body, acecainide is metabolised in several products. Some acecainide can convert to procainamide. The deacetylation clearance of acecainide is 0.39 L/h compare to a total NAPA clearance of 1.38 L/h, indicating that 2.8% of NAPA was converted to procainamide, 0.3% was desethylated, and 10.3% convert to unidentified metabolites, with 86.6% excreted unchanged. Following oral administration, 59 to 87% of a dose of acecainide is excreted unchanged in the urine. Renal clearance of acecainide following short and long term administration ranges from 2.08±0.36 mL/min/kg to 3.28±0.52 mL/min/kg in healthy people. There is a linear relationship between acecainide clearance and creatinine clearance. However, the clearance of acecainide was reduced in a few patients with cardiomyopathyand and ventricular arrhythmias. Also is excretion of procainamide and NAPA is reduced in patients with CKD. A major reaction to procainamide and several other drugs is a syndrome that closely resembles lupus. A reactive metabolite, possibly nitrosoprocainamide is thought to play a role in the lupus reaction. Acecainide, unlike procainamide, appears not to form a reactive metabolite. Mean plasma elimination half-lives in healthy subjects range from 6.8 to 9.6 hours following single or repeated doses when sampling times of 12 to 24 hours are used. A tendency for prolongation of half-lives was noted in patients with cardiomyopathy and in patients with arrhythmias. === Influence on clearance and concentration rate === Steady-state procainamide and acecainide concentrations were used to compute procainamide clearance and acecainide/procainamide (NAPA/PA) concentration ratio. Using stepwise multiple linear regression age, creatinine clearance and congestive heart failure were found to influence procainamide clearance significantly (p less than 0.05). Age and creatinine clearance effected the NAPA/PA concentration ratio (p less than 0.05). Based on this data, age appears to have an independent effect on both procainamide clearance and the NAPA/PA ratio that is separate from the decline in renal function that occurs in elderly patients. == Administration == It can be given either intravenously or orally, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Comparative studies with other antiarrhythmic drugs have not been undertaken apart from a small study in atrial flutter where NAPA was better than quinidine plus digoxin. Although further clinical experience is required before the relative place of acecainide in therapy can be determined, the drug nevertheless appears to offer advantages over procainamide, particularly with respect to the reduced formation of antinuclear antibodies. The dose of acecainide should be adjusted to control the patients’ arrhythmias and with regard to their clinical state including age, renal function and concurrent administration of other drugs. There appears to be an overlap in plasma concentrations required for therapeutic efficacy and those associated with adverse effects. Rapid bolus infusion of acecainide has been associated with serious hypotension and a maximum infusion rate of 50 mg/min has been suggested. === Intravenous administration === Intravenous infusion of 0.45 mg/kg/min for 30 minutes, followed by 0.22 mg/mL/min for 30 minutes and a maintenance infusion, suppressed more than 90% of PVCs. Doses of acecainide 15 to 20 mg/kg were also effective in preventing induced ventricular tachycardia or prolonging ventricular tachycardia cycle length and reducing frequency of PVCs. However, the dosage required to maintain antiarrhythmic effects is still not clear. === Oral administration === In short-term and more prolonged studies, acecainide 1.5 to 2.0 g as a single dose or as three or four divided doses a day appears to be satisfactory in controlling PVCs. In patients who are refractory to other antiarrhythmic agents, the doses required appear to be greater. Moreover, a few studies inferred that tolerance may develop with long-term administration of NAPA, necessitating increased doses. There are no specific dosage recommendations for patients with left ventricular dysfunction, although care should be taken to reduce the dose in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction. The loading dose of this medicine is 15–18 mg/kg administered over 30 to 60 minutes for people without insufficient renal function or decreased cardiac output and 12 mg/kg for people with this disorders. This can also be described by the formula of the loading dose: LD = Vss(l/kg) × IBW(kg) × Cp(mg/L) / ( S x F) The daily empiric oral dose can be calculated by the next formula: Daily dose = (Css)ave × Cl × 1440 / ( S x F ) This those is decreased by 25% in patients with heart and/or liver failures, and it is decreased by 50% by patients with renal failures. == Drug interaction == Research shows that accumulation of acecainide during procainamide therapy can alter both procainamide elimination as well as its electrophysiologic actions. A few healthy people demonstrated that concomitantly administered trimethoprim decreased the renal clearance of procainamide and formed NAPA, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of both drugs and increases in QTc after procainamide. Trimethoprim, procainamide and acecainide are all excreted by active tubular secretion. Also amiodarone, cimetidine and trimethoprim increase the NAPA serum level. Cimetidine and ranitidine possibly increase plasma procainamide and NAPA concentrations and subsequent toxicity. Furthermore, alcohol enhances acetylation of procainamide to NAPA and alcohol consumption may reduce half-life. It also has been shown that coadministration of para-aminobenzoic acid decreases the biotransformation of procainamide to acecainide in a patient with rapid acetylation kinetics. == Toxicity == Measuring the ratio of acecainide and procainamide concentrations together helps to achieve an optimum anti-arrhythmic effect and reduce the risk of toxicity. === Effects on humans === acecainide can cause cardiac toxicity that effects in torsades de pointes. Also acecainide can decrease renal function when it is accumulated during a procainamide therapy. Furthermore, acecainide can lead to a low blood pressure and a serious left ventricle depression when it is present in toxic concentrations. Other common side effects of NAPA are gastrointestinal disturbances, insomnia, dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, numbness and tingling sensation. There has been a large resemblance reported between the concentration range associated with arrhythmic suppression of acecainide and the range of concentrations where intolerable side effects begin to develop. No severe cardiac toxicity has been notified with oral intake despite plasma concentrations as high as 40 micrograms/mL. However, hypotension has been reported in association with a rapid injection of acecainide. === Effects on animals === In animals, acecainide has positive inotropic effects, but it also causes negative chronotropic and hypotensive activity. The cardiovascular pharmacodynamics of procainamide and NAPA have not been well identified in small rodents without the presence of anesthesia or restraint. Researchers are trying to make models of the effects of procainamide and acecainide in animals. == Detoxification == 1-Aminobenzotriazole (ABT) is a nonselective inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes, but recent research confirmed that this inhibitor also inhibit the RLS9-catalyzed N-acetylation of procainamide. In rats oral ABT decreases the clearance of intravenous procainamide for 45%, followed by a decreased acecainide-to-procainamide ratio in urine and plasma. Studies in humans also shows that ABT is an inhibitor of N-acetyltransfersase. These studies claim that ABT is a more potent inhibitor of N-acetyltransferase 2 compared with N-acetyltransferase 1. == References == == External links == PubPK - N-Acetylprocainamide Pharmacokinetics",Acecainide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.0278701160568744e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023251386359333992)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acecainide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Acecainide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acecainide?utm_source=openai')])"

2128,"('Cefuroxime axetil', 'Elobact', 'Zinat', 'Cefuroxime 1-acetoxyethyl ester', 'Ceftin')",Medical,"Cefuroxime, sold under the brand name Zinacef among others, is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat and prevent a number of bacterial infections. These include pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, sepsis, urinary tract infections, and Lyme disease. It is used by mouth or by injection into a vein or muscle. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, allergic reactions, and pain at the site of injection. Serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile infection, anaphylaxis, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is believed to be safe. It is a second-generation cephalosporin and works by interfering with a bacteria's ability to make a cell wall resulting in its death. Cefuroxime was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 283rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Cefuroxime is active against many bacteria including susceptible strains of Staphylococci and Streptococci, as well as a range of gram negative organisms. As with the other cephalosporins, it is susceptible to beta-lactamase, although as a second-generation variety, it is less so. Hence, it may have greater activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Lyme disease. Unlike other second-generation cephalosporins, cefuroxime can cross the blood–brain barrier. A systematic review found high quality evidence that injecting the eye with cefuroxime after cataract surgery will lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis after surgery. == Side effects == Cefuroxime is generally well tolerated, and its side effects are usually transient. If ingested after food, this antibiotic is both better absorbed and less likely to cause its most common side effects of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headaches/migraines, dizziness, and abdominal pain compared to most antibiotics in its class. Although a widely stated cross-allergic risk of about 10% exists between cephalosporins and penicillin, an assessment in 2006 have shown no increased risk for a cross-allergic reaction for cefuroxime and several other second-generation or later cephalosporins. == Related compounds == Cefuroxime axetil is an acetoxyethyl ester prodrug of cefuroxime which is effective when taken by mouth.

The safety, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of single and multiple oral doses of allopurinol riboside, an investigational antiparasitic agent, were evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in 32 healthy male volunteers, at levels up to 25 mg/kg q.i.d. for 13 doses. No significant toxicity was detected. Allopurinol riboside peaks in plasma 1.6 hours after administration, has an elimination half-life of 3 hours, and steady-state concentrations in the therapeutic range. However, in contrast to preclinical studies in dogs (plasma levels proportional to oral doses up to 200 mg/kg), we found that plasma levels were unexpectedly low and did not rise with increasing dose. Furthermore, allopurinol and oxypurinol (unanticipated metabolites) were detected at levels proportional to the dose of allopurinol riboside. We present a model that includes incomplete absorption, metabolism of residual drug by enteric flora, and absorption of bacterial metabolites to explain these findings in humans. Allopurinol riboside is an experimental agent for the treatment of leishmaniasis and American trypanosomiasis. Previous studies showed that after oral administration, unexpectedly low levels of allopurinol riboside in plasma are attributable to incomplete absorption and rapid renal clearance. In this randomized, crossover evaluation in healthy volunteers, probenecid reduces the renal clearance of allopurinol riboside, extends the half-life of allopurinol riboside in plasma, and triples the levels of allopurinol riboside in plasma.

2135,"('Indium(iii) isopropoxide', 'Isopropanol', 'Isopropyl alcohol', 'Propan-2-ol', 'Alkolave')","Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol and also called isopropanol or 2-propanol) is a colorless, flammable, organic compound with a pungent alcoholic odor. Isopropyl alcohol, an organic polar molecule, is miscible in water, ethanol, and chloroform, demonstrating its ability to dissolve a wide range of substances including ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl butyral, oils, alkaloids, and natural resins. Notably, it is not miscible with salt solutions and can be separated by adding sodium chloride in a process known as salting out. It forms an azeotrope with water, resulting in a boiling point of 80.37 °C and is characterized by its slightly bitter taste. Isopropyl alcohol becomes viscous at lower temperatures, freezing at −89.5 °C, and has significant ultraviolet-visible absorbance at 205 nm. Chemically, it can be oxidized to acetone or undergo various reactions to form compounds like isopropoxides or aluminium isopropoxide. As an isopropyl group linked to a hydroxyl group (chemical formula (CH3)2CHOH) it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms. It is a structural isomer of propan-1-ol and ethyl methyl ether. They all have the formula C3H8O. It was first synthesized in 1853 by Alexander William Williamson and later produced for cordite preparation. It is produced through hydration of propene or hydrogenation of acetone, with modern processes achieving anhydrous alcohol through azeotropic distillation. Beyond its production, isopropyl alcohol serves in medical settings as a rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer, and in industrial and household applications as a solvent. It is a common ingredient in products such as antiseptics, disinfectants and detergents. More than a million tonnes are produced worldwide annually. Despite its utility, isopropyl alcohol poses safety risks due to its flammability and potential for peroxide formation. Its ingestion or absorption leads to toxic effects including central nervous system depression and coma, primarily treated through supportive measures. == Properties == Isopropyl alcohol is miscible in water, ethanol, and chloroform, as it is an organic polar molecule. It dissolves ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl butyral, many oils, alkaloids, and natural resins. Unlike ethanol or methanol, isopropyl alcohol is not miscible with salt solutions and can be separated from aqueous solutions by adding a salt such as sodium chloride. The process is colloquially called salting out, and causes concentrated isopropyl alcohol to separate into a distinct layer. Isopropyl alcohol forms an azeotrope with water, which gives a boiling point of 80.37 °C (176.67 °F) and a composition of 87.7% by mass (91% by volume) isopropyl alcohol. It has a slightly bitter taste, and is not safe to drink. Isopropyl alcohol becomes increasingly viscous with decreasing temperature and freezes at −89.5 °C (−129.1 °F). Mixtures with water have higher freezing points: 99% at −89.5 °C (−129.1 °F), 91% (the azeotrope) at −75.5 °C (−103.9 °F), and 70% at −61.7 °C (−79.1 °F). Isopropyl alcohol has a maximal absorbance at 205 nm in an ultraviolet-visible spectrum. == Reactions == Isopropyl alcohol can be oxidized to acetone, which is the corresponding ketone. This can be achieved using oxidizing agents such as chromic acid, or by dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol over a heated copper catalyst: Isopropyl alcohol is often used as both solvent and hydride source in the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction and other transfer hydrogenation reactions. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to 2-bromopropane using phosphorus tribromide, or dehydrated to propene by heating with sulfuric acid. Like most alcohols, isopropyl alcohol reacts with active metals such as potassium to form alkoxides that are called isopropoxides. With titanium tetrachloride, isopropyl alcohol reacts to give titanium isopropoxide: This and similar reactions are often conducted in the presence of base. The reaction with aluminium is initiated by a trace of mercury to give aluminium isopropoxide. == History == Isopropyl alcohol was first synthesized by the chemist Alexander William Williamson in 1853. He achieved this by heating a mixture of propene and sulfuric acid. Standard Oil produced isopropyl alcohol by hydrating propene. Isopropyl alcohol was oxidized to acetone for the preparation of cordite, a smokeless, low explosive propellant. == Production == In 1994, 1.5 million tonnes of isopropyl alcohol were produced in the United States, Europe, and Japan. It is primarily produced by combining water and propene in a hydration reaction or by hydrogenating acetone. There are two routes for the hydration process and both processes require that the isopropyl alcohol be separated from water and other by-products by distillation. Isopropyl alcohol and water form an azeotrope, and simple distillation gives a material that is 87.9% by mass isopropyl alcohol and 12.1% by mass water. Pure (anhydrous) isopropyl alcohol is made by azeotropic distillation of the wet isopropyl alcohol using either diisopropyl ether or cyclohexane as azeotroping agents. === Biological === Small amounts of isopropyl alcohol are produced in the body in diabetic ketoacidosis. === Indirect hydration === Indirect hydration reacts propene with sulfuric acid to form a mixture of sulfate esters. This process can use low-quality propene, and is predominant in the USA. These processes give primarily isopropyl alcohol rather than 1-propanol, because adding water or sulfuric acid to propene follows Markovnikov's rule. Subsequent hydrolysis of these esters by steam produces isopropyl alcohol, by distillation. Diisopropyl ether is a significant by-product of this process; it is recycled back to the process and hydrolyzed to give the desired product. === Direct hydration === Direct hydration reacts propene and water, either in gas or liquid phase, at high pressures in the presence of solid or supported acidic catalysts. This type of process usually requires higher-purity propylene (> 90%). Direct hydration is more commonly used in Europe. === Hydrogenation of acetone === Isopropyl alcohol can be prepared via the hydrogenation of acetone, but this approach involves an extra step compared to the above methods, as acetone is itself normally prepared from propene via the cumene process. IPA cost is primarily driven by raw material cost, and this way is economical when acetone is cheaper than propylene as a byproduct of phenol production (the coexistence of two ways on most markets allows them to balance the prices). A known issue is the formation of MIBK and other self-condensation products. Raney nickel was one of the original industrial catalysts, modern catalysts are often supported bimetallic materials. == Uses == In 1990, 45,000 metric tonnes of isopropyl alcohol were used in the United States, mostly as a solvent for coatings or for industrial processes. In that year, 5400 metric tonnes were used for household purposes and in personal care products. Isopropyl alcohol is popular in particular for pharmaceutical applications, due to its low toxicity. Some isopropyl alcohol is used as a chemical intermediate. Isopropyl alcohol may be converted to acetone, but the cumene process is more significant. === Solvent === Isopropyl alcohol dissolves a wide range of non-polar compounds. It evaporates quickly and the typically available grades tend to not leave behind oil traces when used as a cleaning fluid unlike some other common solvents. It is also relatively non-toxic. Thus, it is used widely as a solvent and as a cleaning fluid, especially where there are oils or oil based residues which are not easily cleaned with water, conveniently evaporating and (depending on water content and other variables) posing less of a risk of corrosion or rusting than plain water. Together with ethanol, n-butanol, and methanol, it belongs to the group of alcohol solvents. Isopropyl alcohol is commonly used for cleaning eyeglasses, electrical contacts, audio or video tape heads, DVD and other optical disc lenses, bongs, and for removing thermal paste from heatsinks on CPUs and other IC packages. === Intermediate === Isopropyl alcohol is esterified to give isopropyl acetate, another solvent. It reacts with carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to give sodium isopropylxanthate, which has use as an herbicide and an ore flotation reagent. Isopropyl alcohol reacts with titanium tetrachloride and aluminium metal to give titanium and aluminium isopropoxides, respectively, the former a catalyst, and the latter a chemical reagent. This compound may serve as a chemical reagent in itself, by acting as a dihydrogen donor in transfer hydrogenation. === Medical === Rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, and disinfecting pads typically contain a 60–70% solution of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol in water. Water is required to open up membrane pores of bacteria, which acts as a gateway for isopropyl alcohol. A 75% v/v solution in water may be used as a hand sanitizer. Isopropyl alcohol is used as a water-drying aid for the prevention of otitis externa, better known as swimmer's ear. Inhaled isopropyl alcohol can be used for treating nausea in some settings by placing a disinfecting pad under the nose. === Early uses as an anesthetic === Although isopropyl alcohol can be used for anesthesia, its many negative attributes or drawbacks prohibit this use. Isopropyl alcohol can also be used similarly to ether as a solvent or as an anesthetic by inhaling the fumes or orally. Early uses included using the solvent as general anesthetic for small mammals and rodents by scientists and some veterinarians. However, it was soon discontinued, as many complications arose, including respiratory irritation, internal bleeding, and visual and hearing problems. In rare cases, respiratory failure leading to death in animals was observed. === Automotive === Isopropyl alcohol is a major ingredient in ""gas dryer"" fuel additives. In significant quantities, water is a problem in fuel tanks, as it separates from gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at low temperatures. Alcohol does not remove water from gasoline, but the alcohol solubilizes water in gasoline. Once soluble, water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water, as it no longer accumulates in the supply lines and freezes but is dissolved within the fuel itself. Isopropyl alcohol is often sold in aerosol cans as a windshield or door lock deicer. Isopropyl alcohol is also used to remove brake fluid traces from hydraulic braking systems, so that the brake fluid (usually DOT 3, DOT 4, or mineral oil) does not contaminate the brake pads and cause poor braking. Mixtures of isopropyl alcohol and water are also commonly used in homemade windshield washer fluid. === Laboratory === As a biological specimen preservative, isopropyl alcohol provides a comparatively non-toxic alternative to formaldehyde and other synthetic preservatives. Isopropyl alcohol solutions of 70–99% are used to preserve specimens. Isopropyl alcohol is often used in DNA extraction. A lab worker adds it to a DNA solution to precipitate the DNA, which then forms a pellet after centrifugation. This is possible because DNA is insoluble in isopropyl alcohol. === Semiconductors === Isopropyl alcohol is used as an additive in alkaline anisotropic etching of monocrystalline silicon, such as with potassium hydroxide or tetramethylammonium hydroxide. This process is used in texturing of silicon solar cells and microfabrication (e.g. in MEMS devices). Isopropyl alcohol increases the anisotropy of the etch by increasing the etch rate of [100] plane relative to higher indexed planes. == Safety == Isopropyl alcohol vapor is denser than air and is flammable, with a flammability range of between 2% and 12.7% in air. It should be kept away from heat, sparks, and open flame. Distillation of isopropyl alcohol over magnesium has been reported to form peroxides, which may explode upon concentration. Isopropyl alcohol can react with air and oxygen over time to form unstable peroxides that can explode. == Toxicology == Isopropyl alcohol, via its metabolites, is somewhat more toxic than ethanol, but considerably less toxic than ethylene glycol or methanol. Death from ingestion or absorption of even relatively large quantities is rare. Both isopropyl alcohol and its metabolite, acetone, act as central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Poisoning can occur from ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption. Symptoms of isopropyl alcohol poisoning include flushing, headache, dizziness, CNS depression, nausea, vomiting, anesthesia, hypothermia, low blood pressure, shock, respiratory depression, and coma. Overdoses may cause a fruity odor on the breath as a result of its metabolism to acetone. Isopropyl alcohol does not cause an anion gap acidosis, but it produces an osmolal gap between the calculated and measured osmolalities of serum, as do the other alcohols. The findings of acetone without acidosis leads to the sine qua non of ""ketosis without acidosis."" Isopropyl alcohol is oxidized to form acetone by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver and has a biological half-life in humans between 2.5 and 8.0 hours. Unlike methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, the metabolites of isopropyl alcohol are considerably less toxic, and treatment is largely supportive. Furthermore, there is no indication for the use of fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, unless co-ingestion with methanol or ethylene glycol is suspected. In forensic pathology, people who have died as a result of diabetic ketoacidosis or alcoholic ketoacidosis, with no isopropyl alcohol ingestion, usually have detectable blood concentrations of isopropyl alcohol of 1 to 40 mg/dL, while those by fatal isopropyl alcohol ingestion usually have blood concentrations of hundreds of mg/dL. == References == == External links == CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Isopropyl alcohol Environmental Health Criteria 103: 2-Propanol",Propan-2-ol,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('IND', -0.7236773371696472), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' PERSONAL', -0.4648977220058441), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.0031797364354133606), (' MED', -0.02068132720887661), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.16517479717731476), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -2.3483953555114567e-05), ('ĠINDU', -0.06255344301462173), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.04859982058405876), ('ĠPERSON', -0.0017431078013032675), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -3.576272320060525e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023264897987246513)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('IND', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0001234428636962548), (' PERSONAL', -0.001171056181192398), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.47407805919647217), (' MED', -0.0004306692280806601), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD; https://wintzell-fried.com/products/propan-2-ol/,https://byjus.com/propan-2-ol-formula/,https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/medicine-and-healthcare/pharmaceutical-medicine/propan-2-ol,https://testbook.com/chemistry-formulas/propan-2-ol-formula,https://collegedunia.com/exams/propan-2-ol-formula-chemistry-articleid-4721,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/propan-2-ol-formula-structure-properties-uses-sample-questions/,https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Propan-2-ol,https://pmarketresearch.com/product/worldwide-propan-2-ol-market-research-2024-by-type-application-participants-and-countries-forecast-to-2030/,https://pediaa.com/difference-between-propan-1-ol-and-propan-2-ol/,https://www.wiseguyreports.com/reports/propan-2-ol-market ', [])"

Eighty-three patients were enrolled and received ≥1 BMS-986158 dose. Diarrhea (43%) and thrombocytopenia (39%) were the most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). A lower incidence of TRAEs was found with schedules A (72%) and C (72%) vs. B (100%). Stable disease was achieved in 12 (26.1%), 3 (37.5%), and 9 (31.0%) patients on schedules A, B, and C, respectively. Two patients on schedule A with a 4.5-mg starting dose (ovarian cancer, n = 1; nuclear protein in testis [NUT] carcinoma, n = 1) experienced a partial response. BMS-986158 demonstrated rapid-to-moderate absorption (median time to maximum observed plasma concentration, 1-4 h). As expected with an epigenetic modifier, expression changes in select BET-regulated genes occurred with BMS-986158 treatment.

Latent reservoir persistence remains a major obstacle for curing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Thus, strategies for the elimination of latent HIV-1 are urgently needed. As a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor, BMS-986158 has been used in clinical trials for advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Here, we found that BMS-986158 reactivated latent HIV-1 in three types of HIV-1 latency cells in vitro, and in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-treated patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells ex vivo, without influencing global immune cell activation. BMS-986158 reactivated latent HIV-1 by increasing phosphorylation of CDK9 at Thr186 and promoting recruitment of CDK9 and RNA polymerase II to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in J-Lat cells. Furthermore, BMS-986158 exerted strong synergism in reactivating latent HIV-1 when combined with prostratin and vorinostat and enhanced the antiviral activity of anti-HIV-1 drugs. Finally, BMS-986158 showed antiviral activity in an HIV-1 acute infection model, possibly by arresting the cell cycle in infected cells.

It is available as a generic medication. It is also sold as a combination drug with chlortalidone under the brand name Edarbyclor. == Medical uses == Azilsartan is used for the treatment of hypertension in adults. One of the benefits of the medication is that Azilsartan does not need dose adjustments for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. == Contraindications == Azilsartan must not be used with aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, in patients with diabetes as this increases the risk of serious adverse effects. Like other antihypertensive drugs acting on the renin–angiotensin system, it is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. It should not be used during pregnancy. == Interactions == No relevant drug interactions have been found in studies. Based on experiences with other drugs acting on the renin–angiotensin system, it is theorized that azilsartan could increase the toxicity of lithium and of other drugs increasing potassium levels, such as potassium sparing diuretics. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Azilsartan medoxomil lowers blood pressure by blocking the action of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, a hormone that contracts blood vessels and reduces water excretion through the kidneys. === Pharmacokinetics === Azilsartan medoxomil is quickly absorbed from the gut, independently of food intake. Maximal blood plasma concentrations are reached after one to three hours. The liver enzyme CYP2C9 is involved in the formation of the two main metabolites, which are pharmacologically inactive; they are the O-deethylation and decarboxylation products of azilsartan. Elimination half life is about 11 hours. 55% are excreted via the feces, and 42% via the urine, of which 15% are present as azilsartan and the rest in form of the metabolites. == Chemistry == The drug formulation contains the potassium salt of azilsartan medoxomil (codenamed TAK-491), an ester of azilsartan's carboxyl group with the alcohol (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-yl)methanol. This ester is more lipophilic than azilsartan itself. == History == In February 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved azilsartan medoxomil for the treatment of high blood pressure in adults. In July 2011, azilsartan medoxomil was approved in the European Union for the treatment of essential hypertension. In March 2012, Health Canada approved the drug for mild to moderate essential hypertension.

It works directly on the colon to produce a bowel movement. It is typically prescribed for relief of episodic and chronic constipation and for the management of neurogenic bowel dysfunction, as well as part of bowel preparation before medical examinations, such as for a colonoscopy. Bisacodyl is a derivative of triphenylmethane. It was first used as a laxative in 1953 because of its structural similarity to phenolphthalein. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Bisacodyl is used to treat both episodic and chronic constipation, manage symptoms of neurogenic bowel dysfunction, as well as for bowel preparation for a colonoscopy. === Available forms === Bisacodyl is marketed under the trade names Dulcolax/Durolax, Muxol, Fleet, Nourilax, Alophen, Correctol, and Carter's Little Pills (formerly Carter's Little Liver Pills), as well as being available generically. It is usually sold as 5 mg tablets, 10 mg suppositories, or 5 mg pediatric suppositories. It is also available as a 1.25 US fluid ounces (37 ml) pre-packaged enema containing a 10 mg delivered dose of liquid bisacodyl. ==== Administration ==== When bisacodyl is administered orally, it is usually taken at breakfast. Oral administration is known to produce no action for more than eight hours and then to work suddenly and relatively quickly. This is especially true if more than 10 mg is taken at one time. Normally, the dosage is 5 or 10 mg, but up to 30 mg can be taken for complete cleansing of the bowel before a procedure. When administered rectally in suppository form, it is usually effective in 15 to 60 minutes. For optimal use, if used as a suppository, it is recommended that bisacodyl be given after breakfast to synchronize with the gastrocolic reflex. Two suppositories can be inserted at once if a very strong, purgative, enema-like result is needed. A few hours after the initial evacuation, there can be a secondary action which will continue as long as there is unexpelled bisacodyl present in the rectum. As a commercially prepared micro-enema, it is usually effective in 5 to 20 minutes. == Mechanism of action == Bisacodyl works by stimulating enteric neurons to cause peristalsis (i.e., colonic contractions). It is also a contact laxative; it increases fluid and salt secretion. The action of bisacodyl on the small intestine is negligible; stimulant laxatives mainly promote evacuation of the colon. == See also == Diphenyl-2-pyridylmethane Cyclofenil == References == == External links == Bisacodyl,00.html Bisacodyl at Drugdigest.org Bisacodyl Consumer Drug Information Dulcolax Laxative Dulcoflex Tablet Uses in Hindi",Bisacodyl,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.111314072157256e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009198724874295294)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601027.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Bisacodyl: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601027.html?utm_source=openai')])"
2141,"('Oxaloacetic acid', 'Oxalacetic acid', 'Oxaloacetate', 'Ketosuccinic acid', 'Oxosuccinic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Oxaloacetic acid (also known as oxalacetic acid or OAA) is a crystalline organic compound with the chemical formula HO2CC(O)CH2CO2H. Oxaloacetic acid, in the form of its conjugate base oxaloacetate, is a metabolic intermediate in many processes that occur in animals. It takes part in gluconeogenesis, the urea cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, amino acid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis and the citric acid cycle. == Properties == Oxaloacetic acid undergoes successive deprotonations to give the dianion: HO2CC(O)CH2CO2H ⇌ −O2CC(O)CH2CO2H + H+, pKa = 2.22 −O2CC(O)CH2CO2H ⇌ −O2CC(O)CH2CO2− + H+, pKa = 3.89 At high pH, the enolizable proton is ionized: −O2CC(O)CH2CO2− ⇌ −O2CC(O−)CHCO2− + H+, pKa = 13.03 The enol forms of oxaloacetic acid are particularly stable. Keto-enol tautomerization is catalyzed by the enzyme oxaloacetate tautomerase. trans-Enol-oxaloacetate also appears when tartrate is the substrate for fumarase. == Biosynthesis == Oxaloacetate forms in several ways in nature. A principal route is upon oxidation of L-malate, catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase, in the citric acid cycle. Malate is also oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase in a slow reaction with the initial product being enol-oxaloacetate. It also arises from the condensation of pyruvate with carbonic acid, driven by the hydrolysis of ATP: CH3C(O)CO2− + HCO3− + ATP → −O2CCH2C(O)CO2− + ADP + Pi Occurring in the mesophyll of plants, this process proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate, catalysed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Oxaloacetate can also arise from trans- or de- amination of aspartic acid. == Biochemical functions == Oxaloacetate is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, where it reacts with acetyl-CoA to form citrate, catalyzed by citrate synthase. It is also involved in gluconeogenesis, the urea cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, amino acid synthesis, and fatty acid synthesis. Oxaloacetate is also a potent inhibitor of complex II. === Gluconeogenesis === Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions, resulting in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrates substrates. The beginning of this process takes place in the mitochondrial matrix, where pyruvate molecules are found. A pyruvate molecule is carboxylated by a pyruvate carboxylase enzyme, activated by a molecule each of ATP and water. This reaction results in the formation of oxaloacetate. NADH reduces oxaloacetate to malate. This transformation is needed to transport the molecule out of the mitochondria. Once in the cytosol, malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate again using NAD+. Then oxaloacetate remains in the cytosol, where the rest of reactions will take place. Oxaloacetate is later decarboxylated and phosphorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and becomes 2-phosphoenolpyruvate using guanosine triphosphate (GTP) as phosphate source. Glucose is obtained after further downstream processing. === Urea cycle === The urea cycle is a metabolic pathway that results in the formation of urea using one ammonium molecule from degraded amino acids, another ammonium group from aspartate and one bicarbonate molecule. This route commonly occurs in hepatocytes. The reactions related to the urea cycle produce NADH, and NADH can be produced in two different ways. One of these uses oxaloacetate. In the cytosol there are fumarate molecules. Fumarate can be transformed into malate by the actions of the enzyme fumarase. Malate is acted on by malate dehydrogenase to become oxaloacetate, producing a molecule of NADH. After that, oxaloacetate will be recycled to aspartate, as transaminases prefer these keto acids over the others. This recycling maintains the flow of nitrogen into the cell. === Glyoxylate cycle === The glyoxylate cycle is a variant of the citric acid cycle. It is an anabolic pathway occurring in plants and bacteria utilizing the enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. Some intermediate steps of the cycle are slightly different from the citric acid cycle; nevertheless oxaloacetate has the same function in both processes. This means that oxaloacetate in this cycle also acts as the primary reactant and final product. In fact the oxaloacetate is a net product of the glyoxylate cycle because its loop of the cycle incorporates two molecules of acetyl-CoA. === Fatty acid synthesis === In previous stages acetyl-CoA is transferred from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm where fatty acid synthase resides. The acetyl-CoA is transported as a citrate, which has been previously formed in the mitochondrial matrix from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. This reaction usually initiates the citric acid cycle, but when there is no need of energy it is transported to the cytoplasm where it is broken down to cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Another part of the cycle requires NADPH for the synthesis of fatty acids. Part of this reducing power is generated when the cytosolic oxaloacetate is returned to the mitochondria as long as the internal mitochondrial layer is non-permeable for oxaloacetate. Firstly the oxaloacetate is reduced to malate using NADH. Then the malate is decarboxylated to pyruvate. Now this pyruvate can easily enter the mitochondria, where it is carboxylated again to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. In this way, the transfer of acetyl-CoA that is from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm produces a molecule of NADH. The overall reaction, which is spontaneous, may be summarized as: HCO3– + ATP + acetyl-CoA → ADP + Pi + malonyl-CoA === Amino acid synthesis === Six essential amino acids and three nonessential are synthesized from oxaloacetate and pyruvate. Aspartate and alanine are formed from oxaloacetate and pyruvate, respectively, by transamination from glutamate. Asparagine is synthesized by amidation of aspartate, with glutamine donating the NH4. These are nonessential amino acids, and their simple biosynthetic pathways occur in all organisms. Methionine, threonine, lysine, isoleucine, valine, and leucine are essential amino acids in humans and most vertebrates. Their biosynthetic pathways in bacteria are complex and interconnected. === Oxalate biosynthesis === Oxaloacetate produces oxalate by hydrolysis. oxaloacetate + H2O ⇌ oxalate + acetate This process is catalyzed by the enzyme oxaloacetase. This enzyme is seen in plants, but is not known in the animal kingdom. == Interactive pathway map == == See also == Dioxosuccinic acid Glycolysis Oxidative phosphorylation Citric acid cycle == References ==",Oxosuccinic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -4.5014188799541444e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -8.506661833962426e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.0027398450765758753), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.0490362910786644e-05), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16031621396541595)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.1269284337759018)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is a colorless solid that melts near room temperature. It is classified as a diamine. Together with cadaverine, it is largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh, but also contributes to other unpleasant odors. == Production == Putrescine is produced on an industrial scale by the hydrogenation of succinonitrile. Biotechnological production of putrescine from a renewable feedstock has been investigated. A metabolically engineered strain of Escherichia coli that produces putrescine at high concentrations in glucose mineral salts medium has been described. == Biochemistry == Spermidine synthase uses putrescine and S-adenosylmethioninamine (decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine) to produce spermidine. Spermidine in turn is combined with another S-adenosylmethioninamine and gets converted to spermine. Putrescine is synthesized in small quantities by healthy living cells by the action of ornithine decarboxylase. Putrescine is synthesized biologically via two different pathways, both starting from arginine. In one pathway, arginine is converted into agmatine. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme arginine decarboxylase (ADC). Agmatine is transformed into N-carbamoylputrescine by agmatine imino hydroxylase (AIH). Finally, N-carbamoylputrescine is hydrolyzed to give putrescine. In the second pathway, arginine is converted into ornithine and then ornithine is converted into putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Putrescine, via metabolic intermediates including N-acetylputrescine, γ-aminobutyraldehyde (GABAL), N-acetyl-γ-aminobutyric acid (N-acetyl-GABAL), and N-acetyl-γ-aminobutyric acid (N-acetyl-GABA), biotransformations mediated by diamine oxidase (DAO), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (ABALDH), and other enzymes, can act as a minor biological precursor of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain and elsewhere. In 2021, it was discovered that MAO-B does not mediate dopamine catabolism in the rodent striatum but instead participates in striatal GABA synthesis and that synthesized GABA in turn inhibits dopaminergic neurons in this brain area. It has been found that MAO-B, via the putrescine pathway, importantly mediates GABA synthesis in astrocytes in various brain areas, including in the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, cerebral cortex, and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). == Occurrence == Putrescine is found in all organisms. Putrescine is widely found in plant tissues, often being the most common polyamine present within the organism. Its role in development is well documented, but recent studies have suggested that putrescine also plays a role in stress responses in plants, both to biotic and abiotic stressors. The absence of putrescine in plants is associated with an increase in both parasite and fungal population in plants. Putrescine serves an important role in a multitude of ways, which include: a cation substitute, an osmolyte, or a transport protein. It also serves as an important regulator in a variety of surface proteins, both on the cell surface and on organelles, such as the mitochondria and chloroplasts. A recorded increase of ATP production has been found in mitochondria and ATP synthesis by chloroplasts with an increase in mitochondrial and chloroplastic putrescine, but putrescine has also been shown to function as a developmental inhibitor in some plants, which can be seen as dwarfism and late flowering in Arabiadopsis plants. Putrescine production in plants can also be promoted by fungi in the soil. Piriformospora indica (P. indica) is one such fungus, found to promote putrescine production in Arabidopsis and common garden tomato plants. In a 2022 study it was shown that the presence of this fungus had a promotional effect on the growth of the root structure of plants. After gas chromatography testing, putrescine was found in higher amounts in these root structures. Plants that had been inoculated with P. indica had presented an excess of arginine decarboxylase. This is used in the process of making putrescine in plant cells. One of the downstream effects of putrescine in root cells is the production of auxin. That same study found that putrescine added as a fertilizer showed the same results as if it was inoculated with the fungus, which was also shown in Arabidopsis and barley. The evolutionary foundations of this connection and putrescine are still unclear. Putrescine is a component of bad breath and bacterial vaginosis. It is also found in semen and some microalgae, together with spermine and spermidine. == Uses == Putrescine reacts with adipic acid to yield the polyamide nylon 46, which is marketed by Envalior (formerly DSM) under the trade name Stanyl. Application of putrescine, along with other polyamines, can be used to extend the shelf life of fruits by delaying the ripening process. Pre-harvest application of putrescine has been shown to increase plant resistance to high temperatures and drought. Both of these effects seem to result from lowered ethylene production following exogenous putrescine exposure. Due to its role in putrification, putrescine has also been proposed as a biochemical marker for determining how long a corpse has been decomposing. Putrescine together with chitosan has been successfully used in postharvest physiology as a natural fruit coating. Putrescine with chitosan treated fruits had higher antioxidant capacity and enzyme activities than untreated fruits. Fresh strawberries coated have lower decay percentage, higher tissue firmness, contents of total soluble solids. Nanoparticles of putrescine with chitosan are effective in preserving the nutritional quality and prolonging the post-harvest life of strawberries during storage up to 12 days. == History == Putrescine and cadaverine were first described in 1885 by the Berlin physician Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919). == Toxicity == In rats, putrescine has a low acute oral toxicity of 2000 mg/kg body weight, with no-observed-adverse-effect level of 2000 ppm (180 mg/kg body weight/day). == Further reading == Haglund, William (1996).

2144,"('Topiramate', 'Mcn 4853', 'Topamax', 'Epitomax', 'Topamax sprinkle')",Medical,"Topiramate, sold under the brand name Topamax among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy and prevent migraines. It has also been used for alcohol dependence and essential tremor. For epilepsy, this includes treatment for generalized or focal seizures. It is taken orally (by mouth). Common side effects include tingling, feeling tired, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, weight loss, and decreased cognitive function such as trouble concentrating. Serious side effects may include suicide, increased ammonia levels resulting in encephalopathy, and kidney stones. Topiramate can cause birth defects, including cleft lip and palate. Risks/benefits should be carefully discussed with the full treatment team. Topiramate is considered ""probably compatible"" with lactation and is not contraindicated for breastfeeding, though monitoring of the infant for diarrhea or poor weight gain may be considered. The mechanism of action is unclear. Topiramate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 84th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Topiramate is used to treat epilepsy in children and adults, and it was originally used as an anticonvulsant. In children, it is indicated for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a disorder that causes seizures and developmental delay. It is most frequently prescribed for the prevention of migraines, as it decreases the frequency of attacks. Topiramate is used to treat medication overuse headache and is recommended by the European Federation of Neurological Societies as one of the few medications showing effectiveness for this indication. === Pain === A 2018 review found topiramate of no use in chronic low back pain. Topiramate has not been shown to work as a pain medicine in diabetic neuropathy, the only neuropathic condition for which it has been adequately tested. === Other === One common off-label use for topiramate is in the treatment of bipolar disorder. A review published in 2010 suggested a benefit of topiramate in the treatment of symptoms of borderline personality disorder; however, the authors noted that this was based only on one randomized controlled trial and requires replication. Topiramate has been used as a treatment for alcoholism. The U.S. Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense 2015 guidelines on substance use disorders list topiramate as a ""strong for"" in its recommendations for alcohol use disorder. Other uses include treatment of obesity and binge eating disorder, and off-setting weight gain induced by taking antipsychotic medications. In 2012, the combination of phentermine/topiramate was approved in the United States for weight loss. == Adverse effects == People taking topiramate should be aware of the following risks: Avoid activities requiring mental alertness and coordination until drug effects are realized. Topiramate may impair heat regulation, especially in children. Use caution with activities leading to an increased core temperature, such as strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, or dehydration. Topiramate may cause visual field defects. Topiramate may decrease the effectiveness of oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Taking topiramate in the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of cleft lip/cleft palate in infants. As is the case for all antiepileptic drugs, it is advisable not to suddenly discontinue topiramate, as there is a theoretical risk of rebound seizures. Some studies have attributed loss of appetite and upper respiratory tract infection to topiramate, but studies have concluded these adverse events are not difficult to tolerate for most individuals. === Frequency === Adverse effects by incidence: Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Rarely, the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase may be strong enough to cause metabolic acidosis of clinical importance. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified prescribers that topiramate can cause acute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma in a small subset of people who take topiramate regularly. The symptoms, which typically begin in the first month of use, include blurred vision and eye pain. Discontinuation of topiramate may halt the progression of the ocular damage and may reverse the visual impairment. Preliminary data suggests that, as with several other anti-epileptic drugs, topiramate carries an increased risk of congenital malformations. This might be particularly important for women who take topiramate to prevent migraine attacks. In March 2011, the FDA notified healthcare professionals and patients of an increased risk of development of cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) in infants born to women treated with Topamax (topiramate) during pregnancy and placed it in Pregnancy Category D. Cognitive and word-finding difficulties, which may occur in some patients, may respond to piracetam. Carbonation dysgeusia (distortion of the sense of taste-sensation of carbonation) may respond to and/or be prevented with zinc. Topiramate has been associated with a statistically significant increase in suicidality, and ""suicidal thoughts or actions"" is now listed as one of the possible side effects of the drug ""in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500."" == Overdose == Symptoms of acute and acute on chronic exposure to topiramate range from asymptomatic to status epilepticus, including in patients with no seizure history. In children, overdose may also result in hallucinations. Topiramate has been deemed the primary substance that led to fatal overdoses in cases that were complicated by polydrug exposure. The most common signs of overdose are dilated pupils, somnolence, dizziness, psychomotor agitation, and abnormal, uncoordinated body movements. == Interactions == Topiramate has many drug-drug interactions. Some of the most common are listed below: As topiramate inhibits carbonic anhydrase, use with other inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase (e.g. acetazolamide) increases the risk of kidney stones. Enzyme inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) can increase the elimination of topiramate, possibly necessitating dose escalations of topiramate. Topiramate may increase the plasma levels of phenytoin. Topiramate itself is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19 and induces CYP3A4; a decrease in plasma levels of estrogens and digoxin has been noted during topiramate therapy. This can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (birth control pills); use of alternative birth control methods is recommended. Neither intrauterine devices (IUDs) nor Depo-Provera are affected by topiramate. Alcohol may cause increased sedation or drowsiness, and increase the risk of having a seizure. As topiramate may result in acidosis, other treatments that also do so may worsen this effect. Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia were reported in post-marketing reports about topiramate; antimuscarinic drugs (like trospium) can aggravate these disorders. == Pharmacology == The topiramate molecule is a sulfamate modified sugar – more specifically, fructose diacetonide, an unusual chemical structure for a pharmaceutical. Topiramate is quickly absorbed after oral use. It has a half-life of 21 hours and a steady state of the drug is reached in 4 days in patients with normal renal function. Most of the drug (70%) is excreted in the urine unchanged. The remainder is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation. Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose. Several cellular targets have been proposed to be relevant to the therapeutic activity of topiramate. These include (1) voltage-gated sodium channels; (2) high-voltage-activated calcium channels; (3) GABA-A receptors; (4) AMPA/kainate receptors; and (5) carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes. There is evidence that topiramate may alter the activity of its targets by modifying their phosphorylation state instead of by direct action. The effect on sodium channels could be of particular relevance for seizure protection. Although topiramate does inhibit high-voltage-activated calcium channels, its relevance to clinical activity is uncertain. Effects on specific GABA-A receptor isoforms could also contribute to the antiseizure activity of the drug. Topiramate selectively inhibits cytosolic (type II) and membrane-associated (type IV) forms of carbonic anhydrase. Its action on carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes may contribute to the drug's side effects, including its propensity to cause metabolic acidosis and calcium phosphate kidney stones. Topiramate inhibits maximal seizure activity in electroconvulsive therapy and in pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures as well as partial and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the kindling model, findings predictive of a broad spectrum of activities clinically. Its action on mitochondrial permeability transition pores has been proposed as a mechanism. While many anticonvulsants have been associated with apoptosis in young animals, animal experiments have found that topiramate is one of the very few anticonvulsants [see: levetiracetam, carbamazepine, lamotrigine] that do not induce apoptosis in young animals at doses needed to produce an anticonvulsant effect. === Detection in body fluids === Blood, serum, or plasma topiramate concentrations may be measured using immunoassay or chromatographic methods to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 10 mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 10 to 150 mg/L in overdose victims. == History == Topiramate was discovered in 1979 by Bruce E. Maryanoff and Joseph F. Gardocki during their research work at McNeil Pharmaceuticals. Topiramate was first sold in 1996. Mylan Pharmaceuticals was granted final approval by the FDA for the sale of generic topiramate in the United States and the generic version was made available in September 2006. The last patent for topiramate in the U.S. was for use in children and expired on 28 February 2009. == Research == Topiramate is being studied as a potential treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is some evidence for the use of topiramate in the management of cravings related to withdrawal from dextromethorphan. A 2023 systematic review of seizure treatment for infants aged 1 to 36 months identified three studies that evaluated the use of topiramate. Though its adverse effects, including upper respiratory tract infection and loss of appetite, were rarely severe enough for the medication to be discontinued in this age group, its effectiveness in reducing seizures was inconclusive. The available research suffers from small sample sizes, inconsistent findings, and inadequate comparison groups. == References == == External links == Media related to Topiramate at Wikimedia Commons",Topamax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5152843591058627e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001299296854995191)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/topamax.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Topamax: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/topamax.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Cilnidipine is approved for use in Japan, China, India, Nepal, and Korea for hypertension. It is a calcium antagonist accompanied with L-type and N-type calcium channel blocking functions. Unlike other calcium antagonists, cilnidipine can act on the N-type calcium channel in addition to acting on the L-type calcium channel. It was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1995. Cilnidipine is currently being repurposed and developed for use in patients with Raynaud's Phenomenon and Systemic Sclerosis by Aisa Pharma, a US biopharma development company. == Medical uses == Cilnidipine decreases blood pressure and is used to treat hypertension and its comorbidities. Due to its blocking action at the N-type and L-type calcium channel, cilnidipine dilates both arterioles and venules, reducing the pressure in the capillary bed. Cilnidipine is vasoselective and has a weak direct dromotropic effect, a strong vasodepressor effect, and an arrhythmia-inhibiting effect. Blood pressure control with cilnidipine treatment in Japanese post-stroke hypertensive patients [The CA-ATTEND study] - the results of a large-scale prospective post-marketing surveillance study of post-stroke hypertensive patients (n = 2667, male 60.4%, 69.0 ± 10.9 years) treated with cilnidipine indicate that cilnidipine was effective in treating uncontrolled blood pressure and was well tolerated in post-stroke hypertensive patients.

2146,"('Phenolphthalein', 'Phthalimetten', 'Euchessina', 'Phthalin', 'Espotabs')",Medical,"Phenolphthalein ( feh-NOL(F)-thə-leen) is a chemical compound with the formula C20H14O4 and is often written as ""HIn"", ""HPh"", ""phph"" or simply ""Ph"" in shorthand notation. Phenolphthalein is often used as an indicator in acid–base titrations. For this application, it turns colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic solutions. It belongs to the class of dyes known as phthalein dyes. Phenolphthalein is slightly soluble in water and usually is dissolved in alcohols in experiments. It is a weak acid, which can lose H+ ions in solution. The nonionized phenolphthalein molecule is colorless and the double deprotonated phenolphthalein ion is fuchsia. Further proton loss in higher pH occurs slowly and leads to a colorless form. Phenolphthalein ion in concentrated sulfuric acid is orange red due to sulfonation. == Uses == === pH indicator === Phenolphthalein's common use is as an indicator in acid-base titrations. It also serves as a component of universal indicator, together with methyl red, bromothymol blue, and thymol blue. Phenolphthalein adopts different forms in aqueous solution depending on the pH of the solution. Inconsistency exists in the literature about hydrated forms of the compounds and the color of sulfuric acid. Wittke reported in 1983 that it exists in protonated form (H3In+) under strongly acidic conditions, providing an orange coloration. However, a later paper suggested that this color is due to sulfonation to phenolsulfonphthalein. The lactone form (H2In) is colorless between strongly acidic and slightly basic conditions. The doubly deprotonated (In2-) phenolate form (the anion form of phenol) gives the familiar pink color. In strongly basic solutions, phenolphthalein is converted to its In(OH)3− form, and its pink color undergoes a rather slow fading reaction and becomes completely colorless when pH is greater than 13. The pKa values of phenolphthalein were found to be 9.05, 9.50 and 12 while those of phenolsulfonphthalein are 1.2 and 7.70. The pKa for the color change is 9.50. ==== Carbonation of concrete ==== Phenolphthalein's pH sensitivity is exploited in other applications: concrete has naturally high pH due to the calcium hydroxide formed when Portland cement reacts with water. As the concrete reacts with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, pH decreases to 8.5–9. When a 1% phenolphthalein solution is applied to normal concrete, it turns bright pink. However, if it remains colorless, it shows that the concrete has undergone carbonation. In a similar application, some spackling used to repair holes in drywall contains phenolphthalein. When applied, the basic spackling material retains a pink color; when the spackling has cured by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide, the pink color fades. ==== Education ==== In a highly basic solution, phenolphthalein's slow change from pink to colorless as it is converted to its Ph(OH)3− form is used in chemistry classes for the study of reaction kinetics. ==== Entertainment ==== Phenolphthalein is used in toys, for example as a component of disappearing inks, or disappearing dye on the ""Hollywood Hair"" Barbie hair. In the ink, it is mixed with sodium hydroxide, which reacts with carbon dioxide in the air. This reaction leads to the pH falling below the color change threshold as hydrogen ions are released by the reaction: OH−(aq) + CO2(g) → CO2−3(aq) + H+(aq). To develop the hair and ""magic"" graphical patterns, the ink is sprayed with a solution of hydroxide, which leads to the appearance of the hidden graphics by the same mechanism described above for color change in alkaline solution. The pattern will eventually disappear again because of the reaction with carbon dioxide. Thymolphthalein is used for the same purpose and in the same way, when a blue color is desired. ==== Detection of blood ==== A reduced form of phenolphthalein, phenolphthalin, which is colorless, is used in a test to identify substances thought to contain blood, commonly known as the Kastle–Meyer test. A dry sample is collected with a swab or filter paper. A few drops of alcohol, then a few drops of phenolphthalein, and finally a few drops of hydrogen peroxide are dripped onto the sample. If the sample contains hemoglobin, it will turn pink immediately upon addition of the peroxide, because of the generation of phenolphthalein. A positive test indicates the sample contains hemoglobin and, therefore, is likely blood. A false positive can result from the presence of substances with catalytic activity similar to hemoglobin. This test is not destructive to the sample; it can be kept and used in further tests. This test has the same reaction with blood from any animal whose blood contains hemoglobin, including almost all vertebrates; further testing would be required to determine whether it originated from a human. === Laxative === Phenolphthalein has been used for over a century as a laxative, but is now being removed from over-the-counter laxatives over concerns of carcinogenicity. Laxative products formerly containing phenolphthalein have often been reformulated with alternative active ingredients: Feen-a-Mint switched to bisacodyl, and Ex-Lax was switched to a senna extract. Thymolphthalein is a related laxative made from thymol. Despite concerns regarding its carcinogenicity based on rodent studies, the use of phenolphthalein as a laxative is unlikely to cause ovarian cancer. Some studies suggest a weak association with colon cancer, while others show none at all. Phenolphthalein is described as a stimulant laxative. In addition, it has been found to inhibit human cellular calcium influx via store-operated calcium entry (SOCE, see Calcium release activated channel § Structure) in vivo. This is effected by its inhibiting thrombin and thapsigargin, two activators of SOCE that increase intracellular free calcium. Phenolphthalein has been added to the European Chemicals Agency's candidate list for substance of very high concern (SVHC). It is on the IARC group 2B list for substances ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"". The discovery of phenolphthalein's laxative effect was due to an attempt by the Hungarian government to label genuine local white wine with the substance in 1900. Phenolphthalein did not change the taste of the wine and would change color when a base is added, making it a good label in principle. However, it was found that ingestion of the substance led to diarrhea. Max Kiss, a Hungarian-born pharmacist residing in New York, heard about the news and launched Ex-Lax in 1906. == Synthesis == Phenolphthalein can be synthesized by condensation of phthalic anhydride with two equivalents of phenol under acidic conditions.

2147,"('Lopinavir', 'Aluviran', 'Koletra', 'A 157378.0', 'Lopinavir (abt-378)')",Medical,"Lopinavir is an antiretroviral of the protease inhibitor class. It is used against HIV infections as a fixed-dose combination with another protease inhibitor, ritonavir (lopinavir/ritonavir). It was patented in 1995 and approved for medical use in 2000. Considered now as second-line therapy in the West, it is still prescribed in LMIC, especially among children living with HIV. Lopinavir and ritonavir can be taken as a tablet or an oral solution, a preferred option in children. In the early stages of COVID-19 pandemics, lopinavir was repurposed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the hope of disturbing its protease activity. == Side effects == Side effects, interactions, and contraindications have only been evaluated in the drug combination lopinavir/ritonavir. They include nausea, vomiting, and stomach aches. == Pharmacology == Lopinavir is highly bound to plasma proteins (98–99%). Reports are contradictory regarding lopinavir penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Anecdotal reports state that lopinavir cannot be detected in the CSF; however, a study of paired CSF-plasma samples from 26 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir found lopinavir CSF levels above the IC50 in 77% of samples. == Research == A 2014 study indicates that lopinavir is effective against the human papilloma virus (HPV). The study used the equivalent of one tablet twice a day applied topically to the cervices of women with high-grade and low-grade precancerous conditions. After three months of treatment, 82.6% of the women who had high-grade disease had normal cervical conditions, confirmed by smears and biopsies. Lopinavir has been shown to impair protein synthesis via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) activation, a mechanism that is similar to the antiviral effect of protein phosphatase 1 inhibitors. Lopinavir was found to inhibit MERS-CoV replication in the low-micromolar range in cell cultures. In 2020, lopinavir/ritonavir was found not to work in severe COVID-19.

Whether orexin modulates learning and memory is not fully understood. Orexin has biphasic effects on learning and memory: promoting learning and memory at homeostatic levels and inhibiting at supra- and sub-homeostatic levels. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples encode memory information and are essential for memory consolidation and retrieval. The role of orexin on sharp wave-ripples in hippocampal CA1 remains unknown. Here, we used multi-electrode array recordings in acute ex vivo hippocampal slices to determine the effects of orexin receptor antagonists on sharp wave-ripples. Bath-application of either the orexin-1 receptor antagonist N-(2-Methyl-6-benzoxazolyl)-N'-1,5-naphthyridin-4-yl urea (SB-334867) or the orexin-2 receptor antagonist N-Ethyl-2-[(6-methoxy-3-pyridinyl)[(2-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]amino]-N-(3-pyridinylmethyl)-acetamide (EMPA) reduced sharp wave and ripple incidence, sharp wave amplitude, and sharp wave duration. SB-334867 and EMPA effects on sharp wave amplitude and duration were equivalent, whereas EMPA exhibited a greater reduction of sharp wave and ripple incidence. EMPA also increased ripple duration, whereas SB-334867 had no effect. Inhibition of both orexin receptors with a dual orexin receptor antagonist N-[1,1'-Biphenyl]-2-yl-1-[2-[(1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)thio]acetyl-2-pyrrolidinedicarboxamide (TCS-1102) had effects similar to EMPA, however, sharp wave amplitude and duration were unaffected. Region-specific expression of orexin receptors suggests orexin may regulate sharp wave generation in CA3, dentate gyrus-mediated sharp wave modification, sharp wave propagation to CA1, and local ripple emergence in CA1. Our study indicates an orexin contribution to hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes and suggests a mechanism by which sub-homeostatic concentrations of orexin may inhibit learning and memory function. To determine whether orexinergic hypothalamic peptides can influence the survival of brainstem dopamine (DA) neurons, we used a model system of rat midbrain cultures in which DA neurons degenerate spontaneously and progressively as they mature. We established that orexin (OX)-B provides partial but significant protection to spontaneously dying DA neurons, whereas the homologous peptide OXA has only marginal effects. Importantly, DA neurons rescued by OXB accumulated DA efficiently by active transport, suggesting that they were functional. G-protein-coupled OX1 and OX2 receptors were both present on DA neurons, but the protective effect of OXB was attributable solely to OX2 receptors; a selective inhibitor of this receptor subtype, N-ethyl-2-[(6-methoxy-3-pyridinyl)[(2-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]amino]-N-(3-pyridinylmethyl)-acetamide (EMPA), suppressed this effect, whereas a selective agonist, [Ala(11), d-Leu(15)]OXB, reproduced it. Survival promotion by OXB required intracellular calcium mobilization via inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and ryanodine receptors. Nicotine, a well known neuroprotective molecule for DA neurons, improved OXB-mediated rescue through the activation of α-bungarotoxin-sensitive (presumably α7) nicotinic receptors, although nicotine had no effect on its own. Altogether, our data suggest that the loss of hypothalamic orexinergic neurons that occurs in Parkinson's disease might confer an increased vulnerability to midbrain DA neurons in this disorder.","Acetamide, n-ethyl-2-((6-methoxy-3-pyridinyl)((2-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)amino)-n-(3-pyridinylmethyl)-",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.10024183988571167), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.4981493651866913), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6932367086410522)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/empa?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=6, title='N-Ethyl-2-[(6-methoxy-3-pyridinyl)[(2-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]amino]-N-(3-pyridinylmethyl)acetamide | C23H26N4O4S | CID 9981404 - PubChem', type='url_citation', url='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/empa?utm_source=openai')])"
2151,"('Trans-cinnamaldehyde', 'Cinnamaldehyde', 'Cinnamic aldehyde', '(e)-cinnamaldehyde', 'Cinnamal')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Cinnamaldehyde is an organic compound with the formula C9H8O or C6H5CH=CHCHO. Occurring naturally as predominantly the trans (E) isomer, it gives cinnamon its flavor and odor. It is a phenylpropanoid that is naturally synthesized by the shikimate pathway. This pale yellow, viscous liquid occurs in the bark of cinnamon trees and other species of the genus Cinnamomum. It is an essential oil. The bark of cinnamon tree contains high concentrations of cinnamaldehyde. == Structure and synthesis == Cinnamaldehyde was isolated from cinnamon essential oil in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugène-Melchior Péligot and synthesized in the laboratory by the Italian chemist Luigi Chiozza in 1854. The natural product is trans-cinnamaldehyde. The molecule consists of a benzene ring attached to an unsaturated aldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde is an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Its color is due to the π → π* transition: increased conjugation in comparison with acrolein shifts this band towards the visible. === Biosynthesis === Cinnamaldehyde is biosynthesized from phenylalanine. Deamination of L-phenylalanine into cinnamic acid is catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). PAL catalyzes this reaction by a non-oxidative deamination. This deamination relies on the MIO prosthetic group of PAL. PAL gives rise to trans-cinnamic acid. In the second step, 4-coumarate–CoA ligase (4CL) converts cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA by an acid–thiol ligation. 4CL uses ATP to catalyze the formation of cinnamoyl-CoA. 4CL effects this reaction in two steps. 4CL forms a hydroxycinnamate–AMP anhydride, followed by a nucleophile attack on the carbonyl of the acyl adenylate. Finally, Cinnamoyl-CoA is reduced by NADPH catalyzed by CCR (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase) to form cinnamaldehyde. === Preparation === Several methods of laboratory synthesis exist. The compound can be prepared from related compounds such as cinnamyl alcohol. An early synthesis involved the aldol condensation of benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde can also be obtained from the steam distillation of the oil of cinnamon bark. == Applications == === As a flavorant === The most obvious application for cinnamaldehyde is as flavoring in chewing gum, ice cream, candy, e-liquid and beverages; use levels range from 9 to 4,900 parts per million (ppm) (that is, less than 0.5%). It is also used in some perfumes of natural, sweet, or fruity scents. Almond, apricot, butterscotch, and other aromas may partially employ the compound for their pleasant smells. Cinnamaldehyde can be used as a food adulterant; powdered beechnut husk aromatized with cinnamaldehyde can be marketed as powdered cinnamon. Some breakfast cereals contain as much as 187 ppm cinnamaldehyde. === As an agrichemical === Cinnamaldehyde has been tested as a safe and effective insecticide against mosquito larvae. A concentration of 29 ppm of cinnamaldehyde kills half of Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae in 24 hours. Trans-cinnamaldehyde works as a potent fumigant and practical repellant for adult mosquitos. It also has antibacterial and antifungal properties. === Miscellaneous uses === Cinnamaldehyde is a corrosion inhibitor for steel and other alloys. It is believed to form a protective film on the metal surface. == Derivatives == Numerous derivatives of cinnamaldehyde are commercially useful. Dihydrocinnamyl alcohol (3-phenylpropanol) occurs naturally but is produced by double hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. It has the fragrances of hyacinth and lilac. Cinnamyl alcohol similarly occurs naturally and has the odor of lilac but can be also produced starting from cinnamaldehyde. Dihydrocinnamaldehyde is produced by the selective hydrogenation of the alkene subunit. α-Amylcinnamaldehyde and α-hexylcinnamaldehyde are important commercial fragrances, but they are not prepared from cinnamaldehyde. Hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, if directed to the alkene, gives hydrocinnamaldehyde. == Toxicology == Cinnamaldehyde is used in agriculture because of its low toxicity, but it is a skin irritant. Cinnamaldehyde may cause allergic contact stomatitis in sensitised individuals, however allergy to the compound is believed to be uncommon. Cinnamaldehyde can contain traces of styrene, which arises during storage or transport. Styrene especially forms in high humidity and high temperatures. == DNA repair == Cinnamaldehyde is a dietary antimutagen that effectively inhibits both induced and spontaneous mutations. Experimental evidence indicates that cinnamaldehyde induces a type of DNA damage in the bacterium Escherichia coli and in human cells that elicits recombinational DNA repair that then reduces spontaneous mutations. In mice, X-ray–induced chromosome aberrations were reduced when cinnamaldehyde was given orally to the mice after X-ray irradiation, perhaps due to cinnamaldehyde-stimulated DNA repair. == References == == External links == GMD MS Spectrum",Cinnamic aldehyde,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -1.4378848391061183e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.006717974785715342), (' PERSONAL', -0.07890939712524414), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.014177731238305569), (' INDUSTR', -2.816093228830141e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0022967883851379156), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.004206974990665913), ('ĠINDU', -0.40148794651031494), ('ST', -3.540453326422721e-05), ('RI', -2.3007127310847864e-05), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5759809613227844)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0007099286303855479), (' INDUSTR', -0.00012356207298580557), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.01814994215965271), (' PERSONAL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://www.altmeyers.org/en/allergology/cinnamic-aldehyde-133376,https://foreverest.net/news-list/application-research-of-cinnamic-aldehyde-in-fragrance-flavor-daily-chemicals-and-food-additives,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamaldehyde ', [])"

In 2.5 and 10 mM glucose, the EC(50) values for activation of GK by MK-0941 were 0.240 and 0.065 μM, respectively. Treatment of isolated rat islets of Langerhans and hepatocytes with 10 μM MK-0941 increased insulin secretion by 17-fold and glucose uptake up to 18-fold, respectively. MK-0941 exhibited strong glucose-lowering activity in C57BL/6J mice maintained on a high-fat diet (HFD), db/db mice, HFD plus low-dose streptozotocin-treated mice, and nondiabetic dogs. In both mice and dogs, oral doses of MK-0941 were rapidly absorbed and rapidly cleared from the blood; plasma levels reached maximum within 1 h and fell thereafter with a half-life of ~2 h. During oral glucose tolerance testing in dogs, MK-0941 reduced total area-under-the-curve postchallenge (0-2 h) plasma glucose levels by up to 48% compared with vehicle-treated controls. When administered twice daily to mice for 16 days, and once daily to the dog for 4 days, MK-0941 remained efficacious on successive days.

2156,"('Fingolimod', 'Fingolimod [inn]', 'Gilenya (tn)', 'Fingolimod (inn)', 'Fingolimodum')",Medical,"Fingolimod, sold under the brand name Gilenya, is an immunomodulating medication, used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, which sequesters lymphocytes in lymph nodes, preventing them from contributing to an autoimmune reaction. It has been reported to reduce the rate of relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis by approximately one-half over a two-year period. == Medical uses == Fingolimod is used in the treatment of the relapsing form of multiple sclerosis. Its effect in those with primary progressive multiple sclerosis is not clear. It may also be used in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects of fingolimod have been head colds, headache, increased gamma-glutamyl transfer (≤15%), diarrhea (13%), nausea (13%), abdominal pain (11%) and fatigue. A few cases of skin cancer have been reported, which has also been reported in patients taking natalizumab (Tysabri), an approved multiple sclerosis drug. Fingolimod has also been associated with potentially fatal infections, bradycardia and, in 2009, a case of hemorrhaging focal encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain with bleeding. Two people died: one due to brain herpes infection, and a second one due to herpes zoster. It is unclear whether the drug was responsible for the events. At least 24 cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy had also occurred as of 2023. Fingolimod has also been known to cause macular edema, resulting in decreased vision. Therefore, frequent surveillance eye examinations are required while taking this medication. In the United States, fingolimod must be dispensed with a medication guide that contains important information about its uses and risks. Serious risks include slowing of the heart rate, especially after the first dose. Fingolimod may increase the risk of serious infections. Patients should be monitored for infection during treatment and for two months after discontinuation of treatment. A rare brain infection that usually leads to death or severe disability, called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported in patients being treated with the drug. PML cases usually occur in patients with weakened immune systems. Fingolimod can cause vision problems. It may increase the risk for swelling and narrowing of the blood vessels in the brain (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome). Other serious risks include respiratory problems, liver injury, increased blood pressure and skin cancer. Fingolimod may cause harm to a developing fetus; health care professionals should advise women of child-bearing age of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated that the multiple sclerosis medicine fingolimod (Gilenya) must not be used in pregnant women and in women able to have children who are not using effective contraception. == Structure and mechanism == It is derived from myriocin (ISP-1), a metabolite of the fungus Isaria sinclairii. It is a structural analogue of sphingosine and is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases in the cell (most importantly sphingosine kinase 2). The molecular biology of phospho-fingolimod is thought to lie in its activity at one of the five sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, S1PR1. Phospho-fingolimod causes the internalization of S1P receptors, which sequesters lymphocytes in lymph nodes, preventing them from moving to the central nervous system and causing a relapse of multiple sclerosis. The unphosphorylated moiety of fingolimod, which is the predominant form of the drug in the body, is also an active molecule. Unphosphorylated fingolimod impairs the ability of cytotoxic CD8 T cells to kill their target cells by a different mechanism, which involves the arachidonic acid pathway, which is unrelated to sphingosine phosphate receptors. This has implications both for increasing susceptibility to viral infections as well as enhancing therapeutic efficacy in multiple sclerosis. Additionally, fingolimod shifts macrophages to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. It modulates their proliferation, morphology, and cytokine release via inhibition of the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7. (TRPM7). Finally, fingolimod has also been found to have other molecular targets and functions. Fingolimod has been reported to be a cannabinoid receptor antagonist, a cPLA2 inhibitor and a ceramide synthase inhibitor. It has also been reported to stimulate the repair process of glial cells and glial precursor cells after injury. == History == First synthesized in 1992 by Yoshitomi Pharmaceuticals, fingolimod was derived from an immunosuppressive natural product, myriocin (ISP-I) through chemical modification. Myriocin was isolated from the culture broth a type of entomopathogenic fungus (Isaria sinclairii) that was an eternal youth nostrum in traditional Chinese medicine. Showing positive results in both in vitro (mixed lymphocyte reaction) and in vivo screening (prolonging rat skin graft survival time), myriocin was modified through a series of steps to yield fingolimod, code named at the time FTY720. A recent review highlights the synthetic methods, mode of action and potential applications of this molecule. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies on myriocin homologs and partially synthetic derivatives showed that the configuration at the carbon bearing the 3-hydroxy group or the 14-ketone, the 6-double bond, and the 4-hydroxy group were not important for its activity and simplification of the structure of ISP-I was done in an attempt to reduce toxicity and improve drug ability. Elimination of side chain functionalities and removal of chiral centers was part of the simplification process and an intermediate compound (ISP-I-28) with the carboxylic acid of myriocin transformed to a hydroxymethyl group was generated. ISP-I-28 was found to be less toxic and more effective at lengthening rat skin allograft time than ISP-1. In September 2010, fingolimod became the first oral disease-modifying drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce relapses and delay disability progression in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In April 2011 Novartis said that the drug would be available in Canadian pharmacies. In March 2011, the European Medicines Agency approved the drug for use in the European Union. In 2016, a systematic review concluded that treatment of people relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is effective in reducing the probability of acute inflammatory relapses, with potentially little or no effect on disability progression, compared to placebo. The risk/benefit profile compared to other disease-modifiying therapies being unclear due to a lack of direct comparisons. In December 2019, generic fingolimod was approved in the United States for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in adults. The FDA granted approvals of generic fingolimod applications to HEC Pharm Co. Limited, Biocon Limited and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited. On 19 July 2019, fingolimod received fast approval for use in China. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In 2015, after a challenge at the US Patent and Trademark Office by a generic competitor, the patent office quashed Novartis's patent claims stating they were obvious. Novartis appealed and the federal circuit upheld the patent office decision in April 2017, leaving a high likelihood of generics coming to market by 2019. In January 2020, a panel of judges at the Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit called into question the validity of the last remaining orange book patent protecting Gilenya. In October 2022, the Supreme Court turned down a request by Novartis to block the launch of generic versions of Gilenya in the United States. In April 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Novartis's request to revive a key patent on Gilenya that had been invalidated by a lower court. == Research == Clinical trials are ongoing to prevent neuropathic pain in patients with breast cancer treated with paclitaxel. Recently, the fingolimod molecule has been incorporated in mRNA delivery vehicles to increase targeting of lymphocytes expressing the S1P1 receptor in pre-clinical models. == References ==",Fingolimod,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.593343616463244e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001250427303602919)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingolimod,https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/fingolimod-marketed-gilenya-information,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a611006.html ', [])"

It improves the survival rate of children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse. The combination of mitoxantrone and prednisone is approved as a second-line treatment for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. This combination was once the first line of treatment; however, a combination of docetaxel and prednisone improves survival rates and lengthens the disease-free period. Mitoxantrone is also used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), most notably the subset of the disease known as secondary-progressive MS. In the absence of a cure, mitoxantrone is effective in slowing the progression of secondary-progressive MS and extending the time between relapses in both relapsing-remitting MS and progressive-relapsing MS. == Side effects == Mitoxantrone, as with other drugs in its class, may cause adverse reactions of varying severity, including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, heart damage and immunosuppression, possibly with delayed onset. Cardiomyopathy is a particularly concerning effect as it is irreversible; thus regular monitoring with echocardiograms or MUGA scans is recommended for patients. Because of the risk of cardiomyopathy, mitoxantrone carries a limit on the cumulative lifetime dose (based on body surface area) in MS patients. == Mechanism of action == Mitoxantrone is a type II topoisomerase inhibitor; it disrupts DNA synthesis and DNA repair in both healthy cells and cancer cells by intercalation between DNA bases.

2159,"('Thioridazine (hydrochloride)', 'Thioridazine', 'Mellaril', 'Thioridazin', 'Melleril')",Medical,"Thioridazine (Mellaril or Melleril) is a first generation antipsychotic drug belonging to the phenothiazine drug group and was previously widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia and psychosis. The branded product was withdrawn worldwide in 2005 because it caused severe cardiac arrhythmias. However, generic versions are still available in the US. == Indications == Thioridazine was voluntarily discontinued by its manufacturer, Novartis, worldwide because it caused severe cardiac arrhythmias. However, generics remain on the market in some countries. Its primary use in medicine is for the treatment of schizophrenia. It was also tried with some success as a treatment for various psychiatric symptoms seen in people with dementia, but chronic use of thioridazine and other anti-psychotics in people with dementia is not recommended. Generic forms of thioridazine remain on the market in a few countries, usually with restrictions due to the risk of arrhythmias. For example, in the US, it is restricted to patients who have taken at least 2 other antipsychotics that either failed or caused serious side effects. == Side effects == Thioridazine prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-dependent manner. It produces significantly less extrapyramidal side effects than most first-generation antipsychotics, likely due to its potent anticholinergic effect. Its use, along with the use of other typical antipsychotics, has been associated with degenerative retinopathies (specifically retinitis pigmentosa). It has a higher propensity for causing anticholinergic side effects coupled with a lower propensity for causing extrapyramidal side effects and sedation than chlorpromazine, but also has a higher incidence of hypotension and cardiotoxicity. It is also known to possess a relatively high liability for causing orthostatic hypotension compared to other antipsychotics. Similarly to other first-generation antipsychotics it has a relatively high liability for causing prolactin elevation. It is moderate risk for causing weight gain. As with all antipsychotics thioridazine has been linked to cases of tardive dyskinesia (an often permanent neurological disorder characterised by slow, repetitive, purposeless and involuntary movements, most often of the facial muscles, that is usually brought on by years of continued treatment with antipsychotics, especially the first-generation (or typical) antipsychotics such as thioridazine) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic treatment). Blood dyscrasias such as agranulocytosis, leukopenia and neutropenia are possible with thioridazine treatment. Thioridazine is also associated with abnormal retinal pigmentation after many years of use. Thioridazine has been correlated to rare instances of clinically apparent acute cholestatic liver injury. == Pharmacology == Thioridazine has the following binding profile: Note: The Binding affinities given are towards cloned human receptors unless otherwise specified Acronyms used HB – Human brain receptor RC – Cloned rat receptor ND – No data == Metabolism == Thioridazine is a racemic compound with two enantiomers, both of which are metabolized, according to Eap et al., by CYP2D6 into (S)- and (R)-thioridazine-2-sulfoxide, better known as mesoridazine, and into (S)- and (R)-thioridazine-5-sulfoxide. Mesoridazine is in turn metabolized into sulforidazine. Thioridazine is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. == History == The manufacturer Novartis/Sandoz/Wander of the brands of thioridazine, Mellaril in the US and Canada and Melleril in Europe, discontinued the drug worldwide in June 2005. Generic forms of thioridazine however remain on the market in a few countries usually with restrictions for example in the US its restricted to patients who have taken at least 2 other antipsychotics that either failed or caused serious side effects == Antibiotic activity == Thioridazine is known to kill extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and to make methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to β-lactam antibiotics. A possible mechanism of action for the drug's antibiotic activity is via the inhibition of bacterial secretion pumps. The β-lactam antibiotic resistance is due to the secretion β-lactamase, a protein that destroys antibiotics. If the bacteria cannot secrete the β-lactamase, then the antibiotic will be effective. The drug has been successfully used in the treatment of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis in conjunction with more conventional amoebicidal medications. == Synthesis == Note: Same sidechain used for mesoridazine and sulforidazine. The alkylation of 2-Picoline [109-06-8] (1) with formaldehyde gives 2-Pyridineethanol [103-74-2] (2). Forming the quat salt with methyl iodide [74-88-4] leads to 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methyl-pyridinium iodide [56622-15-2] (3). Catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of hydrochloric acid leads to 2-(2-Chloroethyl)-1-Methylpiperidine [50846-01-0] (4).

2160,"('Isosorbide', 'Dianhydro-d-glucitol', 'Isobide', 'Devicoran', 'Hydronol')",Medical,"Isosorbide is a bicyclic chemical compound from the group of diols and the oxygen-containing heterocycles, containing two fused furan rings. The starting material for isosorbide is D-sorbitol, which is obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of D-glucose, which is in turn produced by hydrolysis of starch. Isosorbide is discussed as a plant-based platform chemical from which biodegradable derivatives of various functionality can be obtained. In 2022, it was the 119th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Uses == === Isosorbide === Because of its pronounced hygroscopicity, isosorbide is used as a humectant and in medicine as an osmotic diuretic for the treatment of hydrocephalus and acute angle-closure glaucoma. The two secondary hydroxy groups make isosorbide a versatile platform chemically-accessible from renewable resources. As a diol, isosorbide can be mono- or biderivatized using the standard methods of organic chemistry, such as nitration, esterification, etherification, tosylation, etc., and converted into compounds with interesting properties or into monomeric units for novel polymers. === Isosorbide nitrates === By nitration of isosorbide with concentrated nitric acid, 2,5-isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) can be obtained. 2,5-isosorbide dinitrate is suitable (just like its major metabolite 5-isosorbide mononitrate, ISMN) for the treatment of angina pectoris due to its vasodilator effect. === Isosorbide esters === Esterification of isosorbide with fatty acids gives access to isosorbide monoesters, which are useful as detergents in household cleaners, dishwashing detergents, and cosmetic preparations, because of their properties as surfactant. The likewise readily available isosorbide diesters are used as dispersants for pigments, preservatives, polymer stabilizers, as emulsifiers for cosmetics and as plasticizers for vinyl polymers (in particular polyvinyl chloride, PVC). Isosorbide dioctanoate is a diester of isosorbide and octanoic acid (obtained from palm oil, for example) and therefore made entirely from bio-based building blocks and has been used as Polysorb ID 37 by Roquette Frères for some time as a particularly non-toxic product. === Isosorbide ethers === Isosorbide ethers (and in particular the simplest representative, 2,5-dimethylisosorbide, abbreviated DMI), are increasingly used as a renewable solvent for cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations, as an electrolyte additive for lithium-ion accumulators [18] and as a fuel additive for diesel. === Isosorbide phosphates === Phosphoric acid derivatives of isosorbide are explored as an environmentally friendly alternative to halogen-containing flame retardants. So far, 1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) has been widely used as a flame retardant in extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) in the construction and insulation sector, but it was as SVHC (substance of very high concern) banned from manufacturing and application in May 2013. Phosphorus-based isosorbide compounds, such as isosorbide bis (diphenyl phosphate) [ISTP] are considered as a replacement. ISTP is readily accessible by transesterification of isosorbide with triphenyl phosphate in the presence of potassium carbonate at 150 °C. The isosorbide-bis-diphenyl phosphate obtained in 88% yield as a yellowish oil contains about 20% dimers. The high decomposition temperature of ISTP allows a use in XPS, although the high softening effect is a drawback. The flame retardancy is particularly pronounced in the presence of sulfur-containing synergists such as bis(diphenylphosphinothionyl)disulfide (BDPS). This allows to reach the minimum requirement of fire protection (class B2) with only 3% ISTP. === Polymers from Isosorbide === Isosorbide has been examined as a potential platform chemical for the production of diverse polymers and resins. The hydroxy groups can be converted into the primary amino groups via the tosylates and azides or by addition of acrylonitrile followed by hydrogenation into the corresponding aminopropyl derivatives. The latter have potential for the preparation of polyurethanes, as diamines for the preparation of polyamides, and as a hardener for epoxy resins. When monoethylene glycol as a diol is replaced with isosorbide in the polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyisosorbide terephthalate (PIT) is obtained, which is characterized by an extreme thermal stability (up to 360 °C under nitrogen). However, the inherently lower reactivity of the secondary hydroxyl groups in isosorbide cause in comparison lower molecular weights and high residual contents of terephthalic acid, which leads to the insufficient chemical stability of the resulting polymers. Therefore, today's polyesters with isosorbide and monoethylene glycol are examined as diol components that show improved properties such as less discoloration. Isosorbide is of also of interest as a precursor to polycarbonates,. It could in principle replace the bisphenol A, which was identified as xenoestrogen. Limitations of isosorbide-based polycarbonates are their unsatisfactory temperature resistance and limited impact resistance, which can be improved though by the addition of comonomers to the isosorbide or by polymer blends. Isosorbide, a diol, is a precursor to In polyurethanes. or as a building block for the polyol [29] It could be converted to the diisocyanate component as well as a chain extender. By reacting isosorbide with epichlorohydrin, isosorbide bis-glycidyl ether (a bis-epoxide) is formed, which could be used as a replacement for the analog bisphenol A bis-epoxide. Isosorbide bis-glycidyl ether can be crosslinked to a thermosetting epoxy resins with suitable curing agents, such as polyamines or cyclic acid anhydrides. These resins are used as adhesives, paints or coatings for food cans. Furthermore, polyoxazolidones are described which can be obtained by reaction of isosorbide diglycidyl ethers with diisocyanates. Polyoxazolidones could find use as rigid, highly branched and solvent-resistant thermoset plastics in the electrical and electronics industry. == Production == Hydrogenation of glucose gives sorbitol. Isosorbide is obtained by acid-catalyzed dehydration of D-sorbitol which yields the monocyclic furanoid sorbitan, which in turn forms by further dehydration the bicyclic furofuran derivative isosorbide. The reaction gives about 70 to 80% isosorbide in addition to 30 to 20% of undesirable by-products which have to be removed costly by distillation, recrystallization from alcohols, recrystallization from the melt, by a combination of these methods or by deposition from the vapor phase. A high purity product (> 99.8%) is essential for the use of a monomer when uncoloured, high molecular weight polymers shall be obtained. == Properties == Isosorbide is a white, crystalline, highly hydrophilic solid. The two secondary hydroxy groups in the V-shaped bicyclic system possess different orientations leading to different chemical reactivities. This allows a selective monoderivatization of isosorbide. The hydroxy group in 5-position is endo oriented and forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom in the adjacent furan ring. This makes the hydroxy group in 5-position more nucleophilic and more reactive than the exo oriented hydroxy group in 2-position; however, it is more shielded from the attack of sterically demanding reactants. === Safety === With an LD50 value of 25.8 g·kg−1 (rat, oral), isosorbide is similarly nontoxic as D-glucose (also with an LD50 of 25.8 g·kg−1, rat, oral) and is classified by the Food and Drug Administration FDA as GRAS (""generally recognized as safe""). == References ==",Isobide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0038542284164577723), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.6223472356796265), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' INDUSTR', -0.17977967858314514), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.31344959139823914), (' FOOD', -8.911954500945285e-05)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.03261153772473335), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), (',', -0.00044586253352463245), ('ĠINDU', -0.14524418115615845), ('ST', -1.6689160474925302e-05), ('RI', -5.602820692729438e-06), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.12696468830108643), ('ĠPERSON', -0.20285415649414062), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -3.3378546504536644e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47417372465133667)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/isobide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='ISOBIDE - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/isobide?utm_source=openai')])"

Chemically, molindone is an indole and is structurally distinct from many other antipsychotics. Molindone was first described by 1966 and was introduced for medical use in 1974. It remains marketed only in the United States. The drug has been repurposed and is being developed for potential treatment of aggression in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). == Medical uses == Molindone is used in the treatment of schizophrenia. === Available forms === Molindone is available in the form of 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg oral tablets. == Adverse effects == The side effect profile of molindone is similar to that of other typical antipsychotics. This includes extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia. Unlike most antipsychotics, however, molindone use is associated with decreased appetite and weight loss rather than with weight gain. Molindone may have less potential for sedation than certain other antipsychotics owing to its lack of antihistamine activity. It has little or no anticholinergic activity and may be less likely than certain other antipsychotics to cause orthostatic hypotension. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Molindone is known to act as a potent antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 84–140 nM) and of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor (IC50 = 410 nM). It is far less potent as an antagonist of the dopamine D1, D3, and D5 receptors (IC50 = 3,200–8,300 nM) and of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (IC50 = 14,000 nM). The drug does not significantly bind to or inhibit the α-adrenergic receptors, nor does it affect various other receptors, such as the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. Likewise, molindone has essentially no affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and has very little affinity for the histamine H1 receptor or the α1-adrenergic receptor. However, it has been found to have intermediate affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor. The metabolites of molindone appear to be largely inactive in vitro. The preceding findings suggest that molindone is pharmacologically distinct from most atypical antipsychotics, which act as potent antagonists of both the D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Additional binding data on molindone are also available and in some cases have found contrasting results relative to the above findings, for instance high affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor. Molindone is described as an antipsychotic, sedative, and major tranquilizer. In animals, it reduces spontaneous locomotor activity, inhibits conditioned avoidance responses, produces catalepsy and hypothermia, and limits aggression in monkeys. Like other antipsychotics, molindone antagonizes the effects of the dopamine releasing agent amphetamine and the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine. In contrast to many antipsychotics however, molindone shows antidepressant-like effects in animals, for example reversing ptosis induced by the dopamine depleting agent tetrabenazine, potentiating 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced tremors, and potentiating certain effects of levodopa (L-DOPA). It shows little anticholinergic activity in animals and its lack of histamine H1 receptor antagonism suggests less potential for sedation and weight gain than certain other antipsychotics. The drug shows antiemetic effects in animals. Molindone has been reported to inhibit monoamine oxidase both in vitro and in vivo. However, very high concentrations (~100,000 nM) and high doses (10 and 40 mg/kg) are required for monoamine oxidase inhibition. Its inhibition of monoamine oxidase is irreversible and is selective for monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). The drug is much more potent in inhibiting monoamine oxidase in vivo than in vitro, suggesting that an active metabolite may be responsible for its monoamine oxidase inhibition. The MAO-A inhibition of molindone may be responsible for its antidepressant-like effects in animals. It is unclear whether the monoamine oxidase inhibition of molindone observed in preclinical research occurs therapeutically in humans or is clinically significant. It has no affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life of molindone is approximately 2 hours. This half-life is much shorter than that of most other antipsychotics. Concentrations of molindone are negligible 12 hours following the last dose even it is used at high doses. Lithium has been found to prolong the half-life of molindone by at least 4-fold. In spite of the preceding findings, the duration of action of molindone is 24 to 36 hours. It has been suggested that the antipsychotic effects of molindone may be mediated by active metabolites rather than by molindone itself. == Chemistry == Molindone is an indole derivative or dihydroindole and is structurally distinct from many other antipsychotics. === Analogues === Some structurally related compounds include L-741,626, losindole, and piquindone. Other indole-containing antipsychotics include ciclindole, flucindole, roxindole, sertindole, and tepirindole. === Synthesis === Condensation of oximinoketone 2 (from nitrosation of 3-pentanone), with cyclohexane-1,3-dione (1) in the presence of zinc and acetic acid leads directly to the partly reduced indole derivative 6. The transformation may be rationalized by assuming as the first step, reduction of 2 to the corresponding α-aminoketone. Conjugate addition of the amine to 1 followed by elimination of hydroxide (as water) would give ene-aminoketone 3. This enamine may be assumed to be in tautomeric equilibrium with imine 4. Aldol condensation of the side chain carbonyl group with the doubly activated ring methylene group would then result in cyclization to pyrrole 5; simple tautomeric transformation would then give the observed product. Mannich reaction of 6 with formaldehyde and morpholine gives the tranquilizer molindone (7). == History == Molindone was first described in the literature by 1966. It was first approved for medical use, to treat schizophrenia, in 1974 in the United States. == Society and culture == === Availability === Molindone has been marketed in the United States, Finland, and Hong Kong. In 2000, it was available only in these three countries. By 2017, molindone continued to be marketed only in the United States. The drug was discontinued by its original supplier, Endo Pharmaceuticals, on January 13, 2010. After having been produced and subsequently discontinued by Core Pharma in 2015 to 2017, molindone is available again from Epic Pharma effective December 2018. == Research == === Depression and anxiety === Molindone has been studied in the treatment of depression and anxiety. Some antidepressant and anxiolytic effects have been observed in small and old clinical studies, but findings in terms of effectiveness were mixed. === Aggression in children and adolescents === Molindone was found to reduce aggressive symptoms, including agitation, hostility, and uncooperativeness, in adults with schizophrenia in the 1970s. Many other antipsychotics have also shown clinical anti-aggressive effects. Subsequently, molindone was found to potentially be effective in the treatment of hospitalized aggressive children with conduct disorder in a clinical trial comparing it with thioridazine in the 1980s. This study eventually led to molindone being developed for treatment of impulsive aggression in youth much later on. Low-dose extended-release molindone (developmental code name SPN-810) is under development for the treatment of impulsive aggression in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As of May 2024, it is in phase 3 clinical trials for this indication. Negative effectiveness findings in a phase 3 trial have been reported. The exact mechanism of action of molindone for this indication is unknown, but has been proposed to be related to dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2B receptor antagonism. == References ==",Moban,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016091958968900144)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molindone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Molindone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molindone?utm_source=openai')])"

Because recent studies have demonstrated that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is partly responsible for the induction of acquired drug resistance in cancers, we hypothesized that correcting the dysregulation of key miRNAs would reverse the acquired resistance to platinum-based drugs in ovarian cancer. Cisplatin-resistant SKOV3 and A2780 ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3-R and A2780-R, respectively) were established by long-term exposure to cisplatin. MTT assays were performed to evaluate the viability of SKOV3, SKOV3-R, A2780, and A2780-R cells. Quantitative PCR was used to examine the expression of miR-139-5p in these cell lines. The regulatory mechanism was confirmed by western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assays. After treatment with miR-139-5p and cisplatin, mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis were measured by using flow cytometry. Interaction with c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) was evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xl) and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were detected by western blotting. Expression of miR-139-5p was decreased in SKOV3-R and A2780-R cells. Recovery of miR-139-5p increased the sensitivity of SKOV3-R and A2780-R cells to cisplatin treatment, inhibited the interaction of c-Jun and ATF2, and decreased Bcl-xl expression in SKOV3-R and A2780-R cells. Expression of miR-139-5p promoted cisplatin-induced mitochondrial apoptosis through binding the 3' untranslated region of c-Jun mRNA. Recovery of miR-139-5p suppressed the expression of c-Jun and thus reversed cisplatin-resistance in ovarian cancer. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Perceval sutureless valve in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. We report the 30-day clinical outcomes of 139 patients. From January 2014 to December 2016, 139 patients underwent sutureless aortic valve replacement. Their operation notes, National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database and perioperative transoesophageal echocardiography findings were studied retrospectively. Ninety-two patients underwent isolated aortic valve replacement (group A) with Perceval valve and 47 patients had combined procedures of aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting (group B). The patients received a size S (n=23), M (n=39), L (n=42) or XL (n=35) prosthesis. Perceval valve was successfully implanted in 135 (97.1%) patients. Mean cross-clamping time and bypass time were 40 and 63 minutes for isolated cases, while 68 and 107 minutes for combined cases. Three (2.1%) patients died within 30 days. Four patients suffered stroke and 5 patients went into acute renal failure. Median intensive care unit and hospital stay was 2 and 8.5, respectively. Four valves were explanted due to significant paravalvular leak after surgery. Five patients had permanent pacemaker as a result of complete heart block and mean postoperative drainage was 295 mL for isolated case and 457 mL for combined cases. The mean gradient across Perceval valve was 12.5 mmHg while its effective orifice area was 1.5 cm2. Early postoperative results showed that Perceval valve is safe. Further follow up is needed to evaluate the long-term outcome with this bioprosthesis. The multifunctional caspase-2 protein is involved in apoptosis, NF-κB regulation, and tumor suppression in mice. However, the mechanisms of caspase-2 responsible for tumor suppression remain unclear. Here we identified two sites of caspase-2, the catalytic Cys-320 site and the Ser-139 site, to be important for suppression of cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Using SV40- and K-Ras-transformed caspase-2 KO mouse embryonic fibroblast cells reconstituted with expression of wild-type, catalytic dead (C320A), or Ser-139 (S139A) mutant caspase-2, we demonstrated that similar to caspase-2 deficiency, when Cys-320 and Ser-139 were mutated, caspase-2 lost its ability to inhibit cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. These mutant cells exhibited enhanced cell proliferation, elevated clonogenic activity, accelerated anchorage-independent growth, and transformation and were highly tumorigenic, rapidly producing large tumors in athymic nude mice. Investigation into the underlying mechanism showed that these two residues are needed for caspase-2 to suppress NF-κB activity, promote apoptosis, and sustain the G(2)/M checkpoint following DNA damage induction. In addition, tumors in nude mice derived from the two mutant cell lines had higher constitutive NF-κB activity and elevated expression of NF-κB targets of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, XIAP, and cIAP2. A reduction in caspase-2 mRNA was associated with multiple types of cancers in patients. Together, these observations suggest the combined functions of caspase-2 in suppressing NF-κB activation, promoting apoptosis, and sustaining G(2)/M checkpoint contribute to caspase-2 tumor-suppressing function and that caspase-2 may also impact tumor suppression in humans. These findings provide insight into tumor suppression at the cross-roads of apoptosis, cell cycle checkpoint, and NF-κB pathways.",Xl 139,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -6.635164754698053e-05)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.004218370653688908), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029870985075831413)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22560567/ ', [])"
2163,"('Dofequidar (fumarate)', 'Dofequidar', 'Ms 209', 'Dofequidar (r)-isomer', 'Dofequidar (s)-isomer')",Medical," The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (ABC-T) actively efflux structurally and mechanistically unrelated anticancer drugs from cells. As a consequence, they can confer multidrug resistance (MDR) to cancer cells. ABC-T are also reported to be phenotypic markers and functional regulators of cancer stem/initiating cells (CSC) and believed to be associated with tumor initiation, progression, and relapse. Dofequidar fumarate, an orally active quinoline compound, has been reported to overcome MDR by inhibiting ABCB1/P-gp, ABCC1/MDR-associated protein 1, or both. Phase III clinical trials suggested that dofequidar had efficacy in patients who had not received prior therapy. Here we show that dofequidar inhibits the efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs and increases the sensitivity to anticancer drugs in CSC-like side population (SP) cells isolated from various cancer cell lines. Dofequidar treatment greatly reduced the cell number in the SP fraction. Estimation of ABC-T expression revealed that ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mRNA level, but not the ABCB1/P-gp or ABCC1/MDR-associated protein 1 mRNA level, in all the tested SP cells was higher than that in non-SP cells. The in vitro vesicle transporter assay clarified that dofequidar had the ability to suppress ABCG2/BCRP function. Dofequidar treatment sensitized SP cells to anticancer agents in vitro. We compared the antitumor efficacy of irinotecan (CPT-11) alone with that of CPT-11 plus dofequidar in xenografted SP cells. Although xenografted SP tumors showed resistance to CPT-11, treatment with CPT-11 plus dofequidar greatly reduced the SP-derived tumor growth in vivo. Our results suggest the possibility of selective eradication of CSC by inhibiting ABCG2/BCRP. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of dofequidar plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) therapy in comparison with CAF alone, in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer. Dofequidar is a novel, orally active quinoline derivative that reverses multidrug resistance. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients were treated with six cycles of CAF therapy: 28 days/cycle, with doxorubicin (25 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) administered on days 1 and 8 and cyclophosphamide (100 mg orally [PO]) administered on day 1 through 14. Patients received dofequidar (900 mg PO) 30 minutes before each dose of doxorubicin. Primary end point was overall response rate (ORR; partial or complete response). In total, 221 patients were assessable. ORR was 42.6% for CAF compared with 53.1% for dofequidar + CAF, a 24.6% relative improvement and 10.5% absolute increase (P = .077). There was a trend for prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; median 241 days for CAF v 366 days for dofequidar + CAF; P = .145). In retrospectively defined subgroups, significant improvement in PFS in favor of dofequidar was observed in patients who were premenopausal, had no prior therapy, and were stage IV at diagnosis with an intact primary tumor. Except for neutropenia and leukopenia, there was no statistically significant excess of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with CAF. Treatment with dofequidar did not affect the plasma concentration of doxorubicin. Dofequidar + CAF was well tolerated and is suggested to have efficacy in patients who had not received prior therapy.",Dofequidar (fumarate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00012385078298393637), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011759040644392371)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([synapse.patsnap.com](https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/da780ce856de44f68168a8392d4811ab?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=114, start_index=6, title='Dofequidar fumarate - Drug Targets, Indications, Patents - Synapse', type='url_citation', url='https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/da780ce856de44f68168a8392d4811ab?utm_source=openai')])"

A dry cough is common as with all ACE inhibitors. Other possible adverse effects are described at ACE inhibitor#Adverse effects. == Interactions == No interaction studies have been conducted except with digoxin, which slightly decreases imidapril levels, possibly because it reduces its absorption from the gut. Other potential interactions are not well studied: Rifampicin reduces the activation of imidapril to its active metabolite imidaprilat. Like other ACE inhibitors, imidapril increases potassium levels in the blood and can therefore cause hyperkalaemia, especially when combined with potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium substitution. Other diuretics, vasodilators, tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics can add to the antihypertensive effect of imidapril. Lithium can reach toxic levels when combined with imidapril. The effect of antidiabetic drugs can be increased, potentially causing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === === Pharmacokinetics === About 70% of the ingested imidapril is absorbed quickly from the gut; this percentage is reduced significantly when taken with a fatty meal.

2167,"('Propylthiouracil',)",Medical,"Propylthiouracil (PTU) is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. This includes hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter. In a thyrotoxic crisis it is generally more effective than methimazole. Otherwise it is typically only used when methimazole, surgery, and radioactive iodine is not possible. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include itchiness, hair loss, parotid swelling, vomiting, muscle pains, numbness, and headache. Other severe side effects include liver problems and low blood cell counts. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Propylthiouracil is in the antithyroid family of medications. It works by decreasing the amount of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland and blocking the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). Propylthiouracil came into medical use in the 1940s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Side effects == Propylthiouracil is generally well tolerated, with side effects occurring in one of every 100 patients. The most common side effects are related to the skin and include rash, itching, hives, abnormal hair loss, and skin pigmentation. Other common side effects are swelling, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, loss of taste, joint or muscle aches, numbness and headache, allergic reactions, and hair whitening. Its notable side effects include a risk of agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. On 3 June 2009, the FDA published an alert ""notifying healthcare professionals of the risk of serious liver injury, including liver failure and death, with the use of propylthiouracil."" As a result, propylthiouracil is no longer recommended in non-pregnant adults and in children as the front line antithyroid medication. One possible side effect is agranulocytosis, a decrease of white blood cells in the blood. Symptoms and signs of agranulocytosis include infectious lesions of the throat, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin with an overall feeling of illness and fever. A decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) also may occur. Since platelets are important for the clotting of blood, thrombocytopenia may lead to problems with excessive bleeding. Side effects are suspected and the drug is sometimes discontinued if the patient complains of recurrent episodes of sore throat. Another life-threatening side effect is sudden, severe, fulminant liver failure resulting in death or the need for a liver transplantation, which occurs in up to 1 in 10,000 people taking propylthiouracil. Unlike agranulocytosis which most commonly occurs in the first three months of therapy, this side effect may occur at any time during treatment. === Pregnancy === Propylthiouracil is classified as Drug Class D in pregnancy. Class D signifies there is positive evidence of human fetal risk. The maternal benefit may outweigh fetal risk in life-threatening situations. PTU is preferred over methimazole (which is also a class D) only in the first trimester of pregnancy and in women who may become pregnant because of the increased risk of teratogenicity of methimazole during critical organogenesis. In the second and third trimester, this risk is diminished and methimazole is preferred to avoid the risk of liver complications from PTU in the mother. The primary effect on the fetus from transplacental passage of PTU is the production of a mild hypothyroidism when the drug is used close to term. This usually resolves within a few days without treatment. The hypothyroid state may be observed as a goiter in the newborn, and is the result of increased levels of fetal pituitary thyrotropin. The incidence of fetal goiter after PTU treatment in reported cases is approximately 12%. == Mechanism of action == === Thyroid === PTU inhibits the enzyme thyroperoxidase, which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I−) to iodine (I0), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor thyroglobulin. This is one of the essential steps in the formation of thyroxine (T4). PTU does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transporter located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors, such as perchlorate and thiocyanate. === T3/T4 target tissues === PTU also acts by inhibiting the enzyme 5'-deiodinase (tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase), which converts T4 to the more active form T3. (This is in contrast to methimazole, which shares propylthiouracil's central mechanism, but not its peripheral one.) It is important to recognize that these enzymes only work on the conjugated tyrosine molecules of T3 and T4: a completely different enzyme family is responsible for the deiodinase activity of iodized single tyrosine molecules within the thyroid follicular cells. For information on that enzyme family, see Iodotyrosine deiodinase. == Pharmacokinetics == The administration is oral, with peak serum concentrations occurring in one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. Depending on several patient variables, however, euthyroid status may not be achieved until 2–4 months after treatment initiation. Of note, the drug is approximately 70% protein-bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the antithyroid agent methimazole is substantially less protein bound. However, both are equally transferred across the placenta. The plasma half-life is one hour and is not altered appreciably by the thyroid status of the patient. Due to the concentration in the thyroid, however, dosing intervals may last 8 hours or longer. Less than 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged, with the remaining fraction undergoing extensive hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation. == Chemical synthesis == Propylthiouracil can be prepared from ethyl 3-oxohexanoate and thiourea. == Role in taste == Propylthiouracil, together with phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), are known to have bitter taste.

Postpartum breastfeeding women with other risk factors for venous thromboembolism generally should not use combined hormonal contraceptives until 6 weeks after delivery.[1] World Health Organization guidelines are more restrictive, stating that combined oral contraceptives should not be used in nursing mothers before 42 days postpartum and the disadvantages of using the method generally outweigh the advantages between 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum.[2] A decrease in milk supply can happen over the first few days of estrogen exposure.[3] Acetyl-CoA represents a central node of carbon metabolism that plays a key role in bioenergetics, cell proliferation, and the regulation of gene expression. Highly glycolytic or hypoxic tumors must produce sufficient quantities of this metabolite to support cell growth and survival under nutrient-limiting conditions. Here, we show that the nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetase enzyme, ACSS2, supplies a key source of acetyl-CoA for tumors by capturing acetate as a carbon source. Despite exhibiting no gross deficits in growth or development, adult mice lacking ACSS2 exhibit a significant reduction in tumor burden in two different models of hepatocellular carcinoma. ACSS2 is expressed in a large proportion of human tumors, and its activity is responsible for the majority of cellular acetate uptake into both lipids and histones. These observations may qualify ACSS2 as a targetable metabolic vulnerability of a wide spectrum of tumors.

2172,"('Cabergoline', 'Dostinex', 'Cabaser', 'Cabergolinum [latin]', 'Cabergolina [spanish]')",Medical,"Cabergoline, sold under the brand name Dostinex among others, is a dopaminergic medication used in the treatment of high prolactin levels, prolactinomas, Parkinson's disease, and for other indications. It is taken by mouth. Cabergoline is an ergot derivative and a potent dopamine D2 receptor agonist. Cabergoline was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Lactation suppression Hyperprolactinemia Adjunctive therapy of prolactin-producing pituitary gland tumors (prolactinomas); Monotherapy of Parkinson's disease in the early phase; Combination therapy, together with levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor such as carbidopa, in progressive-phase Parkinson's disease; In some countries also: ablactation and dysfunctions associated with hyperprolactinemia (amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, anovulation, nonpuerperal mastitis and galactorrhea); Treatment of uterine fibroids. Adjunctive therapy of acromegaly, cabergoline has low efficacy in suppressing growth hormone levels and is highly efficient in suppressing hyperprolactinemia that is present in 20-30% of acromegaly cases; growth hormone and prolactin are similar structurally and have similar effects in many target tissues, therefore targeting prolactin may help symptoms when growth hormone secretion cannot be sufficiently controlled by other methods; Cabergoline is frequently used as a first-line agent in the management of prolactinomas due to its higher affinity for D2 receptor sites, less severe side effects, and more convenient dosing schedule than the older bromocriptine, though in pregnancy bromocriptine is often still chosen since there is less data on safety in pregnancy for cabergoline. === Off-label === Cabergoline has at times been used as an adjunct to SSRI antidepressants as there is some evidence that it counteracts certain side effects of those drugs, such as reduced libido and anorgasmia. It also has been suggested that it has a possible recreational use in reducing or eliminating the male refractory period, thereby allowing men to experience multiple ejaculatory orgasms in rapid succession, and at least two scientific studies support those speculations.: e28–e33 Additionally, a systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that prophylactic treatment with cabergoline reduces the incidence, but not the severity, of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), without compromising pregnancy outcomes, in females undergoing stimulated cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Also, a study on rats found that cabergoline reduces voluntary alcohol consumption, possibly by increasing GDNF expression in the ventral tegmental area. It may be used in the treatment of restless legs syndrome.. Oral administration of cabergoline was faced with gastrointestinal problems which cause poor compliance in patients. One of the preferred solutions is to use non-oral dosage forms like suppositories. Vaginal suppositories have ease of use and could hinder gastrointestinal effects of cabergoline. === Pregnancy and lactation === Relatively little is known about the effects of this medication during pregnancy and lactation. In some cases the related bromocriptine may be an alternative when pregnancy is expected. Pregnancy: available preliminary data indicates a somewhat increased rate of congenital abnormalities in patients who became pregnant while treated with cabergoline.. However, one study concluded that ""foetal exposure to cabergoline through early pregnancy does not induce any increase in the risk of miscarriage or foetal malformation."" Lactation: In rats cabergoline was found in the maternal milk. Since it is not known if this effect also occurs in humans, breastfeeding is usually not recommended if/when treatment with cabergoline is necessary. Lactation suppression: In some countries cabergoline (Dostinex) is sometimes used as a lactation suppressant. It is also used in veterinary medicine to treat false pregnancy in dogs. == Contraindications == Hypersensitivity to ergot derivatives Pediatric patients (no clinical experience) Severely impaired liver function or cholestasis Concomitant use with drugs metabolized mainly by CYP450 enzymes such as erythromycin and ketoconazole, because increased plasma levels of cabergoline may result (although cabergoline undergoes minimal CYP450 metabolism). Cautions: severe cardiovascular disease, Raynaud's disease, gastroduodenal ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension. == Side effects == Side effects are mostly dose dependent. Much more severe side effects are reported for treatment of Parkinson's disease and (off-label treatment) for restless leg syndrome which both typically require very high doses. The side effects are considered mild when used for treatment of hyperprolactinemia and other endocrine disorders or gynecologic indications where the typical dose is one hundredth to one tenth that for Parkinson's disease. Cabergoline requires slow dose titration (2–4 weeks for hyperprolactinemia, often much longer for other conditions) to minimize side effects. The extremely long bioavailability of the medication may complicate dosing regimens during titration and require particular precautions. Cabergoline is considered the best tolerable option for hyperprolactinemia treatment although the newer and less tested quinagolide may offer similarly favourable side effect profile with quicker titration times. Approximately 200 patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease participated in a clinical study of cabergoline monotherapy. Seventy-six (76) percent reported at least one side effect. These side effects were chiefly mild or moderate: GI tract: Side effects were extremely frequent. Fifty-three percent of patients reported side effects. Very frequent: Nausea (30%), constipation (22%), and dry mouth (10%). Frequent: Gastric irritation (7%), vomiting (5%), and dyspepsia (2%). Psychiatric disturbances and central nervous system (CNS): Altogether 51 percent of patients were affected. Very frequent: Sleep disturbances (somnolence 18%, insomnia 11%), vertigo (27%), and depression (13%). Frequent: dyskinesia (4%) and hallucinations (4%). Cardiovascular: Approximately 30 percent of patients experienced side effects. Most frequent were hypotension (10%), peripheral edema (14%) and non-specific edema (2%). Arrhythmias were encountered in 4.8%, palpitations in 4.3%, and angina pectoris in 1.4%. In a combination study with 2,000 patients also treated with levodopa, the incidence and severity of side effects was comparable to monotherapy. Encountered side effects required a termination of cabergoline treatment in 15% of patients. Additional side effects were infrequent cases of hematological side effects, and an occasional increase in liver enzymes or serum creatinine without signs or symptoms. As with other ergot derivatives, pleuritis, exudative pleura disease, pleura fibrosis, lung fibrosis, and pericarditis are seen. These side effects are noted in less than 2% of patients. They require immediate termination of treatment. Clinical improvement and normalization of X-ray findings are normally seen soon after cabergoline withdrawal. It appears that the dose typically used for treatment of hyperprolactinemia is too low to cause this type of side effects. === Valvular heart disease === In two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine on January 4, 2007, cabergoline was implicated along with pergolide in causing valvular heart disease. As a result of this, the FDA removed pergolide from the U.S. market on March 29, 2007. Since cabergoline is not approved in the U.S. for Parkinson's Disease, but for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market. The lower doses required for treatment of hyperprolactinemia have been found to be not associated with clinically significant valvular heart disease or cardiac valve regurgitation. == Interactions == No interactions were noted with levodopa or selegiline. The drug should not be combined with other ergot derivatives. Dopamine antagonists such as antipsychotics and metoclopramide counteract some effects of cabergoline. The use of antihypertensive drugs should be intensively monitored because excessive hypotension may result from the combination. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine D2 receptor agonist. In-vitro rat studies show a direct inhibitory effect of cabergoline on the prolactin secretion in the lactotroph cells of the pituitary gland and cabergoline decreases serum prolactin levels in reserpinized rats. Although cabergoline is commonly described principally as a D2 receptor agonist, it also possesses significant affinity for the dopamine D3, and D4, serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C, and α2-adrenergic receptors, as well as moderate/low affinity for the dopamine D1, serotonin 5-HT7, and α1-adrenergic receptors. Cabergoline functions as a partial or full agonist at all of these receptors except for the 5-HT7, α1-adrenergic, and α2-adrenergic receptors, where it acts as an antagonist. Cabergoline has been associated with cardiac valvulopathy due to activation of 5-HT2B receptors. Ergot derivatives like cabergoline have been described as non-hallucinogenic in spite of acting as serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists. === Pharmacokinetics === Following a single oral dose, resorption of cabergoline from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is highly variable, typically occurring within 0.5 to 4 hours. Ingestion with food does not alter its absorption rate. Human bioavailability has not been determined since the drug is intended for oral use only. In mice and rats the absolute bioavailability has been determined to be 30 and 63 percent, respectively. Cabergoline is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile and to a lesser extent in urine. All metabolites are less active than the parental drug or inactive altogether. The human elimination half-life is estimated to be 63 to 68 hours in patients with Parkinson's disease and 79 to 115 hours in patients with pituitary tumors. Average elimination half-life is 80 hours. The metabolism of cabergoline is mediated by unidentified enzymes via a hepatic route and mainly consists of hydrolysis and oxidation by the alkylurea group and oxidation at the alkene. == History == Cabergoline was first synthesized by scientists working for the Italian drug company Farmitalia-Carlo Erba in Milan who were experimenting with semisynthetic derivatives of the ergot alkaloids, and a patent application was filed in 1980. The first publication was a scientific abstract at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in 1991. Farmitalia-Carlo Erba was acquired by Pharmacia in 1993, which in turn was acquired by Pfizer in 2003. Cabergoline was first marketed in The Netherlands as Dostinex in 1992. The drug was approved by the FDA on December 23, 1996. It went generic in late 2005 following US patent expiration. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names of cabergoline include Cabaser, Dostinex, Galastop (veterinary), and Kelactin (veterinary), among others. == Research == Cabergoline was studied in one person with Cushing's disease, to lower adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels and cause regression of ACTH-producing pituitary adenomas. == References ==",Cabaser,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00017212340026162565), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004104048945009708)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([news-medical.net](https://www.news-medical.net/drugs/Cabaser.aspx?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=9, title='Cabaser Drug / Medicine Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.news-medical.net/drugs/Cabaser.aspx?utm_source=openai')])"

We aimed to explore the metabolites of daporinad generated from liver microsomes and to propose metabolic pathways. The metabolites were generated by individually incubating daporinad (10 μM) with liver microsomes at 37°C for 60 min. The metabolites were identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-Orbitrap-MS) using electrospray ionization in positive ion mode. They were deduced by accurate MS and MS/MS data. In total, 16 metabolites were found and their identities were characterized. In rat, dog and human, they were minor; in monkey, M11 was the most abundant. Daporinad was metabolized mainly through N-dealkylation, amide hydrolysis, hydrogenation, oxygenation and dehydrogenation. There was no human-specific metabolite.

We evaluated MK-8353, an ERK1 and ERK2 inhibitor, plus pembrolizumab in a phase 1b study in patients with advanced solid tumors. This open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation study (NCT02972034) enrolled adults with advanced solid tumors previously treated with 1‒5 prior lines of therapy. MK-8353 was administered orally in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks as follows: twice daily (arm A; MK-8353 50‒350 mg), once daily (arm B; MK-8353 50‒600 mg), or once daily every other week (arm C; MK-8353 50‒300 mg). The primary objective was evaluation of safety via occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). A secondary objective was objective response by RECIST v1.1 per investigator assessment. Among 110 evaluable patients (arm A, n = 22; arm B, n = 50; arm C, n = 38), median age was 58.0 (range, 35‒79) years and 50% had received 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy. DLTs occurred in 19 patients (n = 6 [27%], n = 8 [16%], and n = 5 [13%], respectively); the most frequent was grade 3 maculopapular rash (n = 15). Grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 35% of patients; the most common were maculopapular rash (13%) and increased lipase (5%); none were grade 5. Eight patients (7%) attained an objective response (arm B, n = 7 [complete response, n = 1; partial response, n = 6]; arm C, n = 1 [complete response]). In conclusion, MK-8353 once daily plus pembrolizumab could be administered with a manageable toxicity profile but had modest antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors.",Mk 8353,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.988221684878226e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.712543447269127e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019408691441640258)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00033546582562848926)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.8b00220?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=9, title='MK-8353: Discovery of an Orally Bioavailable Dual Mechanism ERK Inhibitor for Oncology | ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters', type='url_citation', url='https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.8b00220?utm_source=openai')])"

2177,"('Reparixin', 'Repertaxin', 'Df 1681y', 'Reparixin (repertaxin)', '(r)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-n-(methylsulfonyl)propanamide')",Medical," Reparixin, an anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits interleukin 8 (IL-8) activity, might be life-saving for high-risk in-hospital patients without increasing the risk of infection according to a previous meta-analysis. With the increasing availability of randomised data the aim of the current study is to update previous findings by including any randomised control trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of reparixin on survival of critically ill or transplant patients. A search strategy was developed to identify all RCTs involving reparixin in critically ill or transplant patients, with the exclusion of oncological patients. Two trained and independent authors conducted a thorough search of relevant databases. In addition, backward snowballing was employed. Language restrictions were not imposed. Our analysis included a total of nine studies involving 733 patients: 437 received reparixin and 296 the comparator. The reparixin group had a significantly lower all-cause mortality rate compared to the control group [15/437 (3.4%) vs. 19/294 (6.4%), odds ratio = 0.47 (95% confidence interval 0.23-0.96), p-value for effect .04, I2 = 22%, number needed to treat = 33]. These findings had the same direction and magnitude of effect across COVID-19 patients (n = 325) and non-COVID-19 patients (n = 408). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the rate of pneumonia, sepsis or non-serious infections between the two groups. The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that reparixin, an anti-inflammatory drug, improved survival in critically ill or transplant patients (including both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients) without increasing the risk of infection. Myocardial ischemia is a lack of blood supply to myocardial tissue. Rapid reperfusion therapy is required to prevent myocardial infarction. However, ischemia and reperfusion contribute to myocardial and endothelial injury or ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). A pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8/CXCL8) plays an important role in the activation of neutrophil accumulation and promotes endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, inhibition of IRI through the regulation of inflammation using a CXCL8 receptor inhibitor reparixin is an attractive target. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of reparixin on endothelial cell viability after IRI. Human vascular endothelial cells (EA.hy926) were cultured and pretreated with reparixin at concentrations of 0-1 mg/ml. To simulate ischemia, the cells were exposed to simulated ischemia solution for 60 min. Then, the cells were given complete medium as reperfusion followed by treatment with reparixin and incubated for 24 h. Cell viability was tested using MTT assay. Percentages of cell viability of reparixin-treated groups of 0.0625 mg/mL (67.88 ± 7.82% control) and 0.125 mg/mL (84.28 ± 4.68% control) were significantly higher than that of the IR group (44.31 ± 4.64% control) at  Pretreatment and treatment of endothelial cells with reparixin, which is a CXCL-8 receptor inhibitor, demonstrated a protective effect on cell viability after simulated ischemia-reperfusion. However, further studies to investigate the underlying mechanisms are needed. A great number of anti-inflammatory drugs have been suggested in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reparixin, a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor of the CXCL8 (IL-8) receptors C-X-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CXCR1) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2), has already been tried out as a treatment in different critical settings. Due to the contrasting existing literature, we decided to perform the present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the effect of the use of reparixin on survival in patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality. We created a search strategy to include any human RCTs performed with reparixin utilization in patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality, excluding oncological patients. Two trained, independent authors searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for appropriate studies. Furthermore, references of review articles and included RCTs were screened to identify more studies. No language restrictions were enforced. To assess the risk of bias of included trials, the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was used. Overall, six studies were included and involved 406 patients (220 received reparixin and 186 received the comparator). The all-cause mortality in the reparixin group was significantly lower than that in the control group [5/220 (2.3%) in the reparixin group vs. 12/186 (6.5%) in the control group, odds ratio = 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.96),  Our meta-analysis of randomized trials suggests that short-term inhibition of CXCL8 activity improved survival in patients at high risk for in-hospital mortality without increasing the risk of infection.

2178,"('Sumatriptan (succinate)', 'Gr 43175', 'Sumatriptan', 'Sumatran', 'Sumax')",Medical,"Sumatriptan, sold under the brand name Imitrex among others, is a medication used to treat migraine headaches and cluster headaches. It is taken orally, intranasally, or by subcutaneous injection. Therapeutic effects generally occur within three hours. Its primary effect as a serotonin 5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor agonist can create common side effects such as chest pressure, fatigue, vomiting, tingling, and vertigo. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, heart attack, stroke, and seizures. With excessive use, medication overuse headaches may occur. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. The mechanism of action is not entirely clear. It is in the triptan class of medications. Sumatriptan was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 95th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. It is also available as the combination product sumatriptan/naproxen. == Medical uses == Sumatriptan is effective for ending or relieving the intensity of migraine and cluster headaches. It is most effective when taken early after the start of the pain. Injected sumatriptan is more effective than other formulations. Oral sumatriptan can be used also in the treatment of post-dural puncture headache. == Adverse effects == Overdose of sumatriptan can cause sulfhemoglobinemia, a rare condition in which the blood changes from red to green, due to the integration of sulfur into the hemoglobin molecule. If sumatriptan is discontinued, the condition reverses within a few weeks. Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan injection or tablets. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. There are reports of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and transient amnesia after sumatriptan use. The most common side effects reported by at least 2% of patients in controlled trials of sumatriptan (25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets) for migraine are atypical sensations (paresthesia and warm/cold sensations) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 5–6% in the sumatriptan groups, pain and other pressure sensations (including chest pain) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 6–8% in the sumatriptan groups, neurological events (vertigo) reported by less than 1% in the placebo group and less than 1% to 2% in the sumatriptan groups. Malaise/fatigue occurred in less than 1% of the placebo group and 2–3% of the sumatriptan groups. Sleep disturbance occurred in less than 1% in the placebo group to 2% in the sumatriptan group. Sumatriptan has a low abuse potential; however overuse is associated with medication overuse headache. Moreover, prolonged sumatriptan use is associated with pronociceptive effects, resulting in allodynia. This effect's association with medication overuse headache, however, is controversial, due to the fact that animal-model studies are not consistent with typical presentation of this disorder. == Interactions == Concurrent use with other triptans or ergot-containing medications (e.g., ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) within 24 hours can result in additive vasoconstriction. Increased systemic exposure to sumatriptan can occur if used within 2 weeks after a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported with co-administration of triptans and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Sumatriptan is molecularly similar to serotonin (5-HT), and is a 5-HT receptor (types 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B) agonist. Sumatriptan's primary therapeutic effect is related in its inhibition of the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), likely through its 5-HT1D/1B receptor agonist action. This has been substantiated by the efficacy of more recently developed CGRP targeting drugs and antibodies developed for the preventive treatment of migraine. How agonism of the 5-HT1D/1B receptors inhibits CGRP release is not fully understood. CGRP is believed to cause sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons, contributing to the pain experienced in migraine. Sumatriptan is also shown to decrease the activity of the trigeminal nerve, which presumably accounts for sumatriptan's efficacy in treating cluster headaches. The injectable form of the drug has been shown to abort a cluster headache within 30 minutes in 77% of cases. === Pharmacokinetics === Sumatriptan is administered in several forms: tablets, subcutaneous injection, and nasal spray. Oral administration (as succinate salt) has low bioavailability, partly due to presystemic metabolism—some of it gets broken down in the stomach and bloodstream before it reaches the target arteries. A rapid-release tablet formulation with the same bioavailability but a high concentration can achieve therapeutic effects on average 10–15 minutes earlier than other oral formulations. When injected, sumatriptan is faster-acting (usually within 10 minutes), but the effect lasts for a shorter time. There is no simple, direct relationship between sumatriptan concentration (pharmacokinetics) per se in the blood and its anti-migraine effect (pharmacodynamics). This paradox has, to some extent, been resolved by comparing the rates of absorption of the various sumatriptan formulations, rather than the absolute amounts of drug that they deliver. ==== Metabolism ==== Sumatriptan is metabolised primarily by monoamine oxidase A into indol-3-yl-acetaldehyde and then into corresponding carboxylic acid. It is further modified by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase into a conjugate with glucuronic acid. Other pathways are mediated by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which give an N-oxide derivative, and N-desmethyl and N,N-didesmethyl forms (the latter can be converted into the aldehyde by monoamine oxidase A). N-desmethyl derivative can also undergo a reaction with D-cysteine. These metabolites are excreted in the urine and bile. Only about 3% of the active drug may be recovered unchanged. == History == In 1991, Glaxo received approval for sumatriptan, which was the first available triptan. In July 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a single-use jet injector formulation of sumatriptan. The device delivers a subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan, without the use of a needle. Autoinjectors with needles have been previously available in Europe and North America. Phase III studies with an iontophoretic transdermal patch (Zelrix/Zecuity) started in July 2008. This patch uses low voltage controlled by a pre-programmed microchip to deliver a single dose of sumatriptan through the skin within 30 minutes. Zecuity was approved by the FDA in January 2013. Sales of Zecuity have been stopped following reports of skin burns and irritation. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In the United States, it is available only by medical prescription. It is available over the counter in many states in Australia. The product requires labelling by a pharmacist and is only available in packs of two without a medical prescription. However, it can be bought over the counter in the UK and Sweden. In Russia, versions of sumatriptan which are not registered in the State Register of Medicines may be regarded as narcotic drugs (derivatives of dimethyltryptamine). === Generics === Glaxo patents for sumatriptan expired in February 2009. At that time, Imitrex sold for about $25 a pill. Par Pharmaceutical then introduced generic versions of sumatriptan injection (sumatriptan succinate injection) 4- and 6-mg starter kits and 4- and 6-mg filled syringe cartridges, and 6-mg vials soon after. Mylan Laboratories Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories, Sandoz (a subsidiary of Novartis), Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, and other companies have been producing generic versions of sumatriptan tablets in 25-, 50-, and 100-mg doses. Generic forms of the drug are available in U.S. and European markets after Glaxo's patent protections expired in the respective countries. A nasal spray form of sumatriptan known as AVP-825 has been developed by Avanir and is generically available in some countries. === Controversy === According to the American Headache Society, ""Patients frequently state that they have difficulty accessing triptans prescribed to them."" In the U.S. triptans cost from $12 to $120 each, and more than 80% of U.S. health insurance plans place a limit on the amount of pills available to a patient per month, which has been called ""arbitrary and unfair."" == References ==",Sumax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00027247529942542315), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031980343628674746)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/sumax?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='SUMAX - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/sumax?utm_source=openai')])"
2179,"('Brefeldin a', 'Cyanein', 'Decumbin', 'Ascotoxin', 'Synergisidin')",Medical,"Brefeldin A is a lactone antiviral produced by the fungus Penicillium brefeldianum. Brefeldin A inhibits protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi complex indirectly by preventing association of COP-I coat to the Golgi membrane. Brefeldin A was initially isolated with hopes to become an antiviral drug but is now primarily used in research to study protein transport. == History == The compound gets its name from a species of anamorph fungus of the Penicillium genus known as Eupenicillium brefeldianum, though it is found in a variety of species that span several genera. It was first isolated from Penicillium decumbens in 1958 by V.L. Singleton who initially called it Decumbin. It was later identified as a metabolite by H.P. Siggs who then went on to identify the chemical structure of the compound in 1971. Since then several successful total synthesis methods have been described. Interest in researching brefeldin A was initially lacking due to poor antiviral activity. However, upon discovery of its mechanism involving disruption of protein transport by Takatsuki and Tamura in 1985 and the cytotoxic effects observed in certain cancer cell lines, research efforts were revitalized. It is currently used solely in research mainly as an assay tool for studying membrane traffic and vesicle transport dynamics between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. == Physical properties and storage information == Brefeldin A is found naturally as a white to off-white crystalline solid. It forms a clear colorless solution when dissolved. It is soluble in methanol (10 mg/mL), ethanol (5 mg/mL), DMSO (20 mg/mL), acetone, and ethyl acetate (1 mg/mL) without the aid of heating. It is poorly soluble in water (slightly miscible). It is sold commercially with a purity of 98% or greater. It is recommended that it be stored desiccate at -20 °C away from direct sunlight. Its suggested shelf life for use is 6 months as a solid and 1 month as a solution with tightly sealed storage at -20 °C. Since the compound is combustible, contamination with oxidizing agents should be avoided to prevent the risk of fire. Direct contact should be avoided as well. == Mechanism of action == In mammalian and yeast cells, the main target of brefeldin A appears to be a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) called GBF1. GBF1 is a member of the Arf family of GEFs which are recruited to membranes of the Golgi. It is responsible for the regulation of Arf1p GTPase. It does this through converting the inactive GDP-bound form of Arf1p to the active GTP-bound form. The nucleotide exchange occurs at the catalytic Sec7 domain of GBF1. Activated Arf1p then recruits coat protein β-COP, a subunit of the COP-I complex, to cargo-bound receptors on the membrane. Coat protein recruitment is necessary for proper vesicle formation and transport. Brefeldin A reversibly inhibits the function of GBF1 uncompetitively by binding to the complex it forms with GDP-bound Arf1p and preventing conversion to the GTP-bound form. The lack of active Arf1p prevents coat protein recruitment, which then ultimately induces the fusion of neighboring ER and Golgi membranes due to lack of vesicle formation. This is because lack of vesicle formation results in a buildup of SNARE proteins in the Golgi which would otherwise be bound to coat protein-coated vesicles and removed with the vesicles once they bud off. SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion and it is postulated that the described SNARE build up in the Golgi increases the chances of aberrant fusion of the Golgi membrane with that of the ER. The collapse of the Golgi into the ER triggers activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) (or ER stress) which can result in apoptosis. == Toxicity == The toxological effects of brefeldin A have not been studied extensively yet. Some animal LD50 values have been reported including 250 mg/kg in mice (interperitoneal) and 275 mg/kg in rats (oral). Generally, antibiotic macrolides that share a similar macrocyclic lactone ring to that of brefeldin A have been shown to produce gastrointestinal discomfort as the most common side effect. Some macrolides have been shown to produce allergic reactions and though uncommon this possibility in the case of brefeldin A cannot be disregarded as of yet. The compound may bind to hemoglobin and inhibit oxygen uptake resulting in methemoglobinemia, a form of oxygen starvation, though this is not confirmed. Brefeldin A is not considered to be harmful from direct skin or eye exposure other than transient irritation. It may cause irritation of the respiratory system if inhaled. == See also == Unfolded protein response Endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress) == References == == External links == Klausner RD, Donaldson JG, Lippincott-Schwartz J (March 1992).

2180,"('Salinomycin', 'Procoxacin', 'Coxistac', 'Bio-cox', 'Salinomicina')",Medical,"Salinomycin is an antibacterial and coccidiostat ionophore therapeutic drug. == Antibacterial activity == Salinomycin and its derivatives exhibit high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including the most problematic bacteria strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Salinomycin is inactive against fungi such as Candida and Gram-negative bacteria. == Cancer research == === Pre-clinical === Salinomycin has been shown by Piyush Gupta et al. of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Broad Institute to kill breast cancer stem cells in mice at least 100 times more effectively than the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel. The study screened 16,000 different chemical compounds and found that only a small subset, including salinomycin and etoposide, targeted cancer stem cells responsible for metastasis and relapse. The mechanism of action by which salinomycin kills cancer stem cells involves lysosomal iron sequestration, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species, lysosome membrane permeabilization and ferroptosis. Studies performed in 2011 showed that salinomycin could induce apoptosis of human cancer cells at higher concentrations. C20 amino derivatives such as ironomycin have shown to be more potent in vitro models of persister cancer cells and in vivo doi:10.1038/nchem.2778. Promising results from a few clinical pilot studies reveal that salinomycin is able to effectively eliminate cancer stem cells and to induce partial clinical regression of heavily pretreated and therapy-resistant cancers. The ability of salinomycin to kill both cancer stem cells and therapy-resistant cancer cells (persister) may define the compound as a novel and an effective anticancer drug. It has been also shown that salinomycin and its derivatives exhibit potent antiproliferative activity against the drug-resistant cancer cell lines. Salinomycin is the key compound in the pharmaceutical company Verastem's efforts to produce an anti-cancer-stem-cell drug. == Use in agriculture == Salinomycin is used in chicken feed as a coccidiostat. == Biosynthesis == A team from the University of Cambridge has cloned and sequenced the biosynthetic cluster responsible for salinomycin production, from Streptomyces albus DSM 41398. This has shown that the polyketide backbone of salinomycin is synthesised on an assembly line of nine polyketide synthase) multienzymes. Furthermore, the cluster contains genes involved in oxidative cyclization including salC (epoxidase) and salBI/BII/BIII (epoxide hydrolase) genes. The cluster also contains genes suspected to be involved in self-resistance, export, precursor supply and regulation. The cluster contains a NRPS-like carrier protein, SalX, that is suspected to tether “pre-salinomycin” during oxidative cyclization. By inactivating salC the researchers have demonstrated that salinomycin biosynthesis proceeds via a diene intermediate. == See also == Narasin a derivative of salinomycin which has an additional methyl group.
