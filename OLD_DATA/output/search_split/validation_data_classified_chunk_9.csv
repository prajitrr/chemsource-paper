In the United States, the combinations of netupitant/palonosetron and the prodrug fosnetupitant/palonosetron (both brand name Akynzeo) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, including highly emetogenic chemotherapy such as with cisplatin. In the European Union, the combinations are approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the same indication. == Adverse effects == Side effects of the combination netupitant/palonosetron are similar to palonosetron alone, so that no common side effects can be attributed to netupitant. == Interactions == Netupitant blood plasma levels are expected to increase when combined with inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and lowered when combined with inductors of this enzyme. Being a CYP3A4 inhibitor itself, netupitant could also increase plasma levels of pharmaceuticals that are metabolized by CYP3A4. This effect has been observed with dexamethasone, the anti-cancer drugs docetaxel and etoposide, and to a minor (not clinically significant) extent with levonorgestrel, erythromycin and midazolam. The clinical relevance of the anti-cancer drug interactions has been questioned. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Netupitant is a selective NK1 receptor antagonist. Netupitant is a selective neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist with potential antiemetic activity. Netupitant competitively binds to and blocks the activity of the human substance P/NK1 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby inhibiting NK1-receptor binding of the endogenous tachykinin neuropeptide substance P (SP), which may result in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). SP is found in neurons of vagal afferent fibers innervating the brain-stem nucleus tractus solitarii and the area postrema, which contains the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and may be elevated in response to chemotherapy. The NK-receptor is a G-protein receptor coupled to the inositol phosphate signal-transduction pathway and is found in both the nucleus tractus solitarii and the area postrema. === Pharmacokinetics === Bioavailability is estimated to be over 60% for orally taken netupitant. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached five hours after application. Availability is moderately (10–20%) increased when taken after a fatty meal. Netupitant and its main metabolites (called M1 and M3) are bound to plasma proteins to more than 99%, and M2 protein binding is 97%. The substance is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. The main metabolites are desmethyl-netupitant (M1), netupitant N-oxide (M2), and hydroxy-netupitant (M3); all three are pharmacologically active. Netupitant and its metabolites are mainly excreted via the faeces. Biological half-life is 88 hours, significantly longer than that of the first NK1 receptor antagonist, aprepitant, which has a half-life of 9 to 13 hours. == References == == External links == ""Netupitant"".

It is available as beef-flavored tablets. == Medical uses == Deracoxib is used in dogs for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and for the prevention of pain following orthopedic surgery or dental procedures. In cats, the use of deracoxib is not recommended. == Contraindications == Deracoxib is contraindicated for treatment of dogs with hypersensitivity to deracoxib or other NSAIDs, and dogs with gastro-intestinal ulcers, renal disease, hepatic disorders, hypoproteinemia, dehydration, or cardiac disease. Dogs with renal disease may need dose adjustment (if the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks), while those on concurrent diuretic therapy are at increased risk for NSAID toxicity and should not be given this medication. The concurrent use of deracoxib with steroids or other NSAIDs should be avoided. The safety of deracoxib has not been established in pregnant or nursing dogs or in dogs younger than 4 months of age. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects of treatment with deracoxib are vomiting, anorexia, lethargy and depression. Other adverse effects of deracoxib are caused by its effects on the gastrointestinal tract, and include erosions or ulcerations of the lining of the stomach or intestines. Serious adverse effects, including ulcers which perforate the gastrointestinal tract, have occurred in dogs administered higher than recommended doses of deracoxib, or dogs administered deracoxib at the same time as (or soon after) other NSAIDs or corticosteroid medications. Documented adverse side effects include serious and sometimes fatal organ system damage or failure. Other side effects include increase in drinking or urination, jaundice, bloody or black stools, pale gums, hot spots, increased respiration (fast or heavy breathing), incoordination, and behavior changes. == Pharmacology == Deracoxib is a coxib class nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Like other NSAIDs, its effects are caused by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. At the doses used to treat dogs, deracoxib causes greater inhibition of COX-2 than of COX-1, but at doses twice those recommended for use in dogs, deracoxib significantly inhibits COX-1 as well. In dogs, the half-life of deracoxib at the recommended dose is three hours. == Society and culture == In the U.S., deracoxib was first approved for use in dogs in 2002, under the trade name Deramaxx chewable tablets, sold by Novartis Animal Health. == References ==",Deramaxx,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.18173478543758392), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.019120311364531517), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011074034497141838)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deracoxib,https://www.drugs.com/pro/deramaxx.html,https://yourpetandyou.elanco.com/us/our-products/deramaxx ', [])"

It is a near-complete (>90%) transthyretin stabilizer, developed to mimic the protective properties of the naturally-occurring T119M mutation, to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. It is taken by mouth. The most common adverse reactions include diarrhea and upper abdominal pain. Acoramidis was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2024, and in the European Union in February 2025. == Medical uses == Acoramidis is indicated for the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of wild-type or variant transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) in adults to reduce cardiovascular death and cardiovascular-related hospitalization. ATTR-CM is a rare and serious disease that affects the heart muscle. In people with ATTR-CM, there is a build-up of protein deposits in the heart, causing the walls of the heart to become stiff, and making the left ventricle unable to properly relax and fill with blood (called cardiomyopathy). As the condition progresses, the heart can become unable to pump blood out adequately, causing heart failure. There are two types of ATTR-CM, hereditary ATTR-CM (hATTR-CM) and wild-type ATTR-CM (wATTR-CM). In hATTR-CM, which can run in families, there's a variant in the transthyretin gene, which results in protein deposits in the heart. In wATTR-CM, there is no variant in the transthyretin gene. == Side effects == The most common side effects are diarrhea and abdominal pain. == History == The efficacy and safety of acoramidis were evaluated in a multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 611 adult participants with wild-type or hereditary (variant) ATTR-CM (NCT03860935). === Clinical trials === Phase I data indicated acoramidis achieved near-complete (>90%) TTR stabilization across the entire dosing interval at steady state. Phase II and the Open-Label Extension (OLE) data indicated after a median of 38 months, long-term treatment with acoramidis was generally well tolerated and resulted in a median decline in NT-proBNP levels, normalization of serum TTR, and sustained stabilization of TTR in individuals with ATTR-CM. Phase III data from ATTRibute-CM indicated acoramidis resulted in a significantly better four-step primary hierarchical outcome containing components of mortality, morbidity, and function than placebo at 30 months in participants with ATTR-CM. Adverse events were similar in the two groups. Other analyses from ATTRibute-CM indicated a 50% reduction in cumulative cardiovascular hospitalizations (CVH), a 42% reduction in all-cause mortality (ACM) and recurrent CVH, and a 3-month time-to-separation of the Kaplan Meier curves for ACM or CVH. No other treatment has demonstrated this degree of treatment effect this quickly in participants with ATTR-CM. In vitro data indicated acoramidis exhibits near-complete (>90%) TTR stabilization at therapeutic trough concentrations, and its TTR stabilization exceeds that of tafamidis' across a range of destabilizing TTR mutations. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Acoramidis was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2024. The approval was granted to BridgeBio Pharma. In December 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Beyonttra, intended for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adults with cardiomyopathy. The applicant for this medicinal product is BridgeBio Europe B.V. Acoramidis was designated an orphan medicine by the EMA. Acoramidis was authorized for medical use in the European Union in February 2025. === Names === During development, acoramidis was known as AG10 (the Alhamadsheh-Graef molecule 10).

It is available in the form of tablets and as an intramuscular injection, as well as in an injectable combination with rilpivirine under the brand name Cabenuva. It is an integrase inhibitor with a carbamoyl pyridone structure similar to that of dolutegravir. In December 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved cabotegravir for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in at-risk people under the brand name Apretude. In September 2023, it was approved for pre-exposure prophylaxis in the European Union. == Medical uses == Cabotegravir in combination with rilpivirine is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) in adults. The combination injection is intended for maintenance treatment of adults who have undetectable HIV levels in the blood (viral load less than 50 copies/mL) with their current antiretroviral treatment, and when the virus has not developed resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors. The tablets are used to check whether a person tolerates the treatment before the injection therapy is started. The two medicines are the first antiretroviral drugs that come in a long-acting injectable formulation. Cabotegravir (Apretude) is indicated for use in at-risk people weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 lb) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV. == Contraindications and interactions == Cabotegravir must not be combined with the drugs rifampicin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital, which induce the enzyme UGT1A1. These drugs significantly decrease cabotegravir concentrations in the body and thus may reduce its effectiveness. Additionally, they induce the enzyme CYP3A4, which leads to reduced rilpivirine concentrations in the body. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects of the injectable combination therapy with rilpivirine are reactions at the injection site (in up to 84% of patients) such as pain and swelling, as well as headache (up to 12%) and fever or feeling hot (in 10%). For the tablets, headache and a hot feeling were slightly less frequent. Less common side effects (under 10%) for both formulations are depressive disorders, insomnia, and rashes. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Cabotegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor. This means it blocks the HIV's enzyme integrase, thereby preventing its genome from being integrated into the human cells' DNA. As this is a necessary step for the virus to replicate, its further spread is hampered. === Pharmacokinetics === When taken by mouth, cabotegravir reaches highest blood plasma levels after three hours. Taking the drug together with food slightly increases its concentrations in the blood, but this is not clinically relevant. After injection into the muscle, cabotegravir is slowly absorbed into the bloodstream, reaching its highest blood plasma levels after about seven days. Over 99% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. The drug is inactivated in the body by glucuronidation, mainly by the enzyme UGT1A1, and to a much lesser extent by UGT1A9. More than 90% of the circulating substance are the unchanged cabotegravir, however. The biological half-life is 41 hours for the tablets and 5.6 to 11.5 weeks for the injection. Elimination has only been studied for oral administration: Most of the drug is eliminated via the faeces in unchanged form (47%). It is not known how much of this amount comes from the bile, and how much was not absorbed in the first place. (The bile actually contains the glucuronide, but this could be broken up again in the gut lumen to give the parent substance that is observed in the faeces.) To a lesser extent it is excreted via the urine (27%), almost exclusively as the glucuronide. === Pharmacogenomics === UGT1A1 poor metabolizers have 1.3- to 1.5-fold increased cabotegravir concentrations in the body. This is not considered clinically significant. == Chemistry == Cabotegravir is a white to off-white, crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in aqueous solutions under pH 9, and slightly soluble above pH 10. It is slightly acidic with a pKa of 7.8 for the enolic acid and 11.1 (calculated) for the carboxamide. The molecule has two asymmetric carbon atoms; only one of the four possible configurations is present in the medication. === Formulation === In studies, the agent was packaged into nanoparticles (GSK744LAP) conferring a biological half-life of 21 to 50 days following a single dose. The marketed injection achieves its long half-life not via nanoparticles but with a suspension of the free cabotegravir acid. The tablets contain cabotegravir sodium salt. == History == Cabotegravir was examined in the clinical trials HPTN 083 and HPTN 084. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Vocabria intended for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in combination with rilpivirine injection. The EMA also recommended marketing authorization be given for rilpivirine and cabotegravir injections to be used together for the treatment of people with HIV-1 infection. Cabotegravir was approved for medical use in the European Union in December 2020. In December 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cabotegravir for pre-exposure prophylaxis. The FDA granted the approval of Apretude to Viiv. Zimbabwe became the first African country to approve the drug in October 2022. === Names === Cabotegravir is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and the international nonproprietary name (INN). == Research == === Pre-exposure prophylaxis === In 2020, results for some studies were released showing success in using injectable cabotegravir for long-acting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with greater efficacy than the emtricitabine/tenofovir combination being widely used for PrEP at the time. The safety and efficacy of cabotegravir to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV were evaluated in two randomized, double-blind trials that compared cabotegravir to emtricitabine/tenofovir, a once daily oral medication for HIV PrEP. Trial 1 included HIV-uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men and have high-risk behavior for HIV infection. Trial 2 included uninfected cisgender women at risk of acquiring HIV. In trial 1, 4,566 cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men received either cabotegravir or emtricitabine/tenofovir. The trial measured the rate of HIV infections among trial participants taking daily cabotegravir followed by cabotegravir injections every two months compared to daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir. The trial showed participants who took cabotegravir had 69% less risk of getting infected with HIV when compared to participants who took emtricitabine/tenofovir. In trial 2, 3,224 cisgender women received either cabotegravir or emtricitabine/tenofovir. The trial measured the rate of HIV infections in participants who took oral cabotegravir and injections of cabotegravir compared to those who took emtricitabine/tenofovir orally. The trial showed participants who took cabotegravir had 90% less risk of getting infected with HIV when compared to participants who took emtricitabine/tenofovir. == References ==",Vocabria,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00013243274588603526)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([iapac.org](https://www.iapac.org/fact-sheet/cabotegravir-vocabria/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=97, start_index=9, title='cabotegravir (Vocabria) – International Association of Providers of AIDS Care', type='url_citation', url='https://www.iapac.org/fact-sheet/cabotegravir-vocabria/?utm_source=openai')])"

The drug is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC (also called malignant hepatoma), the most common type of liver cancer. Brivanib is no longer in active development. Brivanib alaninate is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (as is sorafenib). Brivanib alaninate also inhibits VEGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), which is known to play a major role in the etiopathogenesis of HCC. To date, brivanib alaninate has been investigated in 29 studies, including more than 4,000 patients around the world. == Hepatocellular carcinoma (summary) == Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary cancer of the liver and is more common in men than in women. The disease occurs mostly in people who have scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) or after infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Symptoms include pain and swelling in the abdomen, weight loss, weakness, loss of appetite, and nausea. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a severe and life-threatening disease that is associated with poor overall survival. While the choice of treatment depends mainly on how advanced the disease is, the only proven therapies to cure the cancer are either surgical removal of the tumors or remove and replace the liver via transplantation, but these therapies can only be carried out in very few patients. Other treatments include chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Radiofrequency ablation and ethanol injection are also used to remove small tumors. As a result of poor liver function, metastases, or both, only 10% to 20% of patients undergo surgery. In patients having surgery, the 5-year survival rate is only 25% to 50%. Several chemotherapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Doxorubicin (trade name Adriamycin; also known as hydroxydaunorubicin), the most widely used agent in HCC, has shown a 4% to 10.5% response rate in patients with HCC. Studies have shown that the overall response (OR) rate, but not overall survival (OS), doubles when doxorubicin was given in combination with cisplatin, IFN, and 5-fluorouracil. The multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib (trade name Nexavar), which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, raf, c-kit, and flt-3, has been shown to inhibit HCC-induced proliferation and angiogenesis. Sorafenib has also been shown to provide a significant improvement in OS in patients with HCC. Based on these results, researchers concluded that this class of agents may be effective in the treatment of HCC. == Biological activity == Brivanib is the alanine ester of a VEGFR-2 inhibitor BMS-540215 and is hydrolyzed to the active moiety BMS-540215 in vivo. BMS-540215, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, shows potent and selective inhibition of VEGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinases. BMS-540215 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of human VEGFR-2, with an IC50 of 25 nmol/L and Ki of 26 nmol/L. In addition, it inhibits VEGFR-1 (IC50 = 380 nmol/L) and VEGFR-3 (IC50 = 10 nmol/L). BMS-540215 also showed good selectivity for FGFR-1 (IC50 = 148 nmol/L), FGFR-2 (IC50 = 125 nmol/L), and FGFR-3 (IC50 = 68 nmol/L). Furthermore, BMS-540215 has been shown to selectively inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells stimulated by VEGF and FGF in vitro with IC50 values of 40 and 276 nmol/L, respectively. It also shows broad-spectrum in vivo antitumor activity over multiple dose levels and induces stasis in large tumors, suggesting that it may have a role in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). == Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles == === Mechanisms of action === The exact mechanisms by which brivanib treatment induces growth inhibition are not well understood. Ongoing research has shown that brivanib affects the host endothelium based on both in vitro and in vivo effects). Brivanib may prevent the tumor mass from expanding by cutting off the supply of nutrients and growth factors to the tumor cells. A recent study showed that brivanib effectively inhibits tumor growth and that brivanib-induced growth inhibition is associated with inactivation of VEGFR-2, increased apoptosis, a reduction in microvessel density, inhibition of cell proliferation, and down-regulation of cell cycle regulators, including cyclin D1, Cdk-2, Cdk-4, cyclin B1, and phospho-c-Myc. Based on this study, researchers have concluded that cell cycle arrest due to a reduction in positive cell cycle regulators may be responsible for the observed growth inhibition. The same study showed that treatment with brivanib also led to a decrease in the number of proliferating cells compared with control. == Ongoing clinical development == While a phase II trial for hepatocellular carcinoma showed an acceptable safety profile and results indicating efficacy against HCC, four subsequent phase III trials found no increased survival and increased rates of adverse effects when compared with sorafenib or placebo. == Regulatory status == On 27 October 2011, orphan designation (EU/3/11/918) was granted by the European Commission to Bristol-Myers Squibb for brivanib alaninate for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Clofarabine can cause vomiting and diarrhea which may lead to low body fluid (dehydration). Signs and symptoms of dehydration include dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells, or decreased urination. Other side effects. The most common side effects are stomach problems (including vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea), and effects on blood cells (including low red blood cells count, low white blood cell count, low platelet count, fever, and infection). Clofarabine can also cause tachycardia and can affect the liver and kidneys. == Contraindications == pregnancy or planned pregnancy breast-feeding liver problems kidney problems == Drug interactions == nephrotoxic drugs hepatotoxic drugs == Delivery == By intravenous infusion. Dosage is a 2-hour infusion (52 mg/m2) every day for five days. The cycle is repeated every 2 to 6 weeks. Regular blood tests to monitor his or her blood cells, kidney function, and liver function. == Biology == Clofarabine is a second-generation purine nucleoside analog designed to overcome biological limitations observed with ara-A and fludarabine. A 2´(S)-fluorine in clofarabine significantly increased the stability of the glycosidic bond in acidic solution and toward phosphorolytic cleavage as compared to fludarabine. A chlorine substitution at the 2-position of the adenine base avoids production of a 2-fluoroadenine analog, a precursor to the toxic 2-fluoro-adenosine-5´-triphosphate and prevents deamination of the base as compared to ara-A. Clofarabine can be administered intravenously or given orally. Clofarabine enters cells via hENT1, hENT2, and hCNT2, where upon it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to generate clofarabine-5´-monophosphate. The rate-limiting step in clofarabine metabolism is clofarabine-5´-diphosphosphate. Clofarabine-5´-triphosphate is the active-metabolite, and it inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in a decrease cellular dNTP concentrations, which promotes greater incorporation of clofarabine-5´-triphosphate during DNA synthesis. Embedded clofarabine-5´-monophosphate in the DNA promotes polymerase arrest at the replication fork, triggering DNA repair mechanisms that without repair lead to DNA strand breaks in vitro and cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis in vitro. Studies using cell lines have shown that clofarabine-5´-triphosphate can also be incorporated into RNA. Mechanisms of resistance and turnover have been reported. Clofarabine-resistance arises from decreased deoxycytidine kinase activity in vitro. ABC transporter ABCG2 promotes export of clofarabine-5´-monophosphate and thus limits the cytotoxic effects of this analog in vivo. Biochemically, clofarabine-5’-triphosphate was shown to be substrate for SAMHD1, thus potentially limiting the amount of active compound in cells. == References == == External links == ""Clofarabine"".

900,"('Chloroxine', 'Capitrol', 'Chlorquinol', 'Dichloroxin', 'Quixalin')",Medical,"Shampoo () is a hair care product, typically in the form of a viscous liquid, that is formulated to be used for cleaning (scalp) hair. Less commonly, it is available in solid bar format. (""Dry shampoo"" is a separate product.) Shampoo is used by applying it to wet hair, massaging the product in the hair, roots and scalp, and then rinsing it out. Some users may follow a shampooing with the use of hair conditioner. Shampoo is typically used to remove the unwanted build-up of sebum (natural oils) in the hair without stripping out so much as to make hair unmanageable. Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water. The sulfate ingredient acts as a surfactant, trapping oils and other contaminants, similarly to soap. Shampoos are marketed to people with hair. There are also shampoos intended for animals that may contain insecticides or other medications to treat skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas. == History == === Indian subcontinent === In the Indian subcontinent, a variety of herbs and their extracts have been used as shampoos since ancient times. The first origin of shampoo came from the Indus Valley Civilization. A very effective early shampoo was made by boiling Sapindus with dried Indian gooseberry (amla) and a selection of other herbs, using the strained extract. Sapindus, also known as soapberries or soapnuts, a tropical tree widespread in India, is called ksuna (Sanskrit: क्षुण) in ancient Indian texts and its fruit pulp contains saponins which are a natural surfactant. The extract of soapberries creates a lather which Indian texts called phenaka (Sanskrit: फेनक). It leaves the hair soft, shiny and manageable. Other products used for hair cleansing were shikakai (Acacia concinna), hibiscus flowers, ritha (Sapindus mukorossi) and arappu (Albizzia amara). Guru Nanak, the founder and the first Guru of Sikhism, made references to soapberry tree and soap in the 16th century. Cleansing the hair and body massage (champu) during one's daily bath was an indulgence of early colonial traders in India. When they returned to Europe, they introduced the newly learned habits, including the hair treatment they called shampoo. The word shampoo entered the English language from the Indian subcontinent during the colonial era. It dated to 1762 and was derived from the Hindi word cā̃pō (चाँपो, pronounced [tʃãːpoː]), itself derived from the Sanskrit root chapati (चपति), which means 'to press, knead, or soothe'. === Ancient Mesopotamia === Ancient Mesopotamian tablets from the Neo-Assyrian period document the use of medicated shampoo to treat scalp eruptions. === Europe === Sake Dean Mahomed, an Indian traveller, surgeon, and entrepreneur, is credited with introducing the practice of shampoo or ""shampooing"" to Britain. In 1814, Mahomed, with his Irish wife Jane Daly, opened the first commercial ""shampooing"" vapour masseur bath in England, in Brighton. He described the treatment in a local paper as ""The Indian Medicated Vapour Bath (type of Turkish bath), a cure to many diseases and giving full relief when everything fails; particularly Rheumatic and paralytic, gout, stiff joints, old sprains, lame legs, aches and pains in the joints"". This medical work featured testimonies from his patients, as well as the details of the treatment made him famous. The book acted as a marketing tool for his unique baths in Brighton and capitalised on the early 19th-century trend for seaside spa treatments. During the early stages of shampoo in Europe, English hair stylists boiled shaved soap in water and added herbs to give the hair shine and fragrance. Commercially made shampoo was available from the turn of the 20th century. A 1914 advertisement for Canthrox Shampoo in American Magazine showed young women at camp washing their hair with Canthrox in a lake; magazine advertisements in 1914 by Rexall featured Harmony Hair Beautifier and Shampoo. In 1900, German perfumer and hair-stylist Josef Wilhelm Rausch developed the first liquid hair washing soap and named it ""Champooing"" in Emmishofen, Switzerland. Later, in 1919, J.W. Rausch developed an antiseptic chamomile shampooing with a pH of 8.5. In 1927, liquid shampoo was improved for mass production by German inventor Hans Schwarzkopf in Berlin; his name became a shampoo brand sold in Europe. Originally, soap and shampoo were very similar products; both containing the same naturally derived surfactants, a type of detergent. Modern shampoo as it is known today was first introduced in the 1930s with Drene, the first shampoo using synthetic surfactants instead of soap. === Indonesia === Early shampoos used in Indonesia were made from the husk and straw (merang) of rice. The husks and straws were burned into ash, and the ashes (which have alkaline properties) are mixed with water to form lather. The ashes and lather were scrubbed into the hair and rinsed out, leaving the hair clean, but very dry. Afterwards, coconut oil was applied to the hair in order to moisturize it. === Philippines === Filipinos have been traditionally using gugo before commercial shampoos were sold in stores. The shampoo is obtained by soaking and rubbing the bark of the vine Gugo (Entada phaseoloides), producing a lather that cleanses the scalp effectively. Gugo is also used as an ingredient in hair tonics. === Pre-Columbian North America === Certain Native American tribes used extracts from North American plants as hair shampoo; for example the Costanoans of present-day coastal California used extracts from the coastal woodfern, Dryopteris expansa. === Pre-Columbian South America === Before quinoa can be eaten the saponin must be washed out from the grain prior to cooking. Pre-Columbian Andean civilizations used this soapy by-product as a shampoo. == Types == Shampoos can be classified into four main categories: deep cleansing shampoos, sometimes marketed under descriptions such as volumizing, clarifying, balancing, oil control, or thickening, which have a slightly higher amount of detergent and create a lot of foam; conditioning shampoos, sometimes marketed under descriptions such as moisturizing, 2-in-1, smoothing, anti-frizz, color care, and hydrating, which contain an ingredient like silicone or polyquaternium-10 to smooth the hair; baby shampoos, sometimes marketed as tear-free, which contain less detergent and produce less foam; and anti-dandruff shampoos, which are medicated to reduce dandruff. == Composition == Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water to form a thick, viscous liquid. Other essential ingredients include salt (sodium chloride), which is used to adjust the viscosity, a preservative and fragrance. Other ingredients are generally included in shampoo formulations to maximize the following qualities: pleasing foam ease of rinsing minimal skin and eye irritation thick or creamy feeling pleasant fragrance low toxicity good biodegradability slight acidity (pH less than 7) no damage to hair repair of damage already done to hair Many shampoos are pearlescent. This effect is achieved by the addition of tiny flakes of suitable materials, e.g. glycol distearate, chemically derived from stearic acid, which may have either animal or vegetable origins. Glycol distearate is a wax. Many shampoos also include silicone to provide conditioning benefits. === Commonly used ingredients === Ammonium chloride Ammonium lauryl sulfate Glycol Sodium laureth sulfate is derived from coconut oils and is used to soften water and create a lather. Hypromellose cellulose ethers are widely used as thickeners, rheology modifiers, emulsifiers and dispersants in Shampoo products. Sodium lauroamphoacetate is naturally derived from coconut oils and is used as a cleanser and counter-irritant. This is the ingredient that makes the product tear-free. Polysorbate 20 (abbreviated as PEG(20)) is a mild glycol-based surfactant that is used to solubilize fragrance oils and essential oils, meaning it causes liquid to spread across and penetrate the surface of a solid (i.e. hair). Polysorbate 80 (abbreviated as PEG(80)) is a glycol used to emulsify (or disperse) oils in water so the oils do not float on top. PEG-150 distearate is a simple thickener. Citric acid is produced biochemically and is used as an antioxidant to preserve the oils in the product. While it is a severe eye-irritant, the sodium lauroamphoacetate counteracts that property. Citric acid is used to adjust the pH down to approximately 5.5. It is a fairly weak acid which makes the adjustment easier. Shampoos usually are at pH 5.5 because at slightly acidic pH, the scales on a hair follicle lie flat, making the hair feel smooth and look shiny. It also has a small amount of preservative action. Citric acid, as opposed to any other acid, will prevent bacterial growth. Quaternium-15 is used as a bacterial and fungicidal preservative. Polyquaternium-10 acts as the conditioning ingredient, providing moisture and fullness to the hair. Di-PPG-2 myreth-10 adipate is a water-dispersible emollient that forms clear solutions with surfactant systems. Chloromethylisothiazolinone, or CMIT, is a powerful biocide and preservative. === Benefit claims regarding ingredients === In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that shampoo containers accurately list ingredients on the products container. The government further regulates what shampoo manufacturers can and cannot claim as any associated benefit. Shampoo producers often use these regulations to challenge marketing claims made by competitors, helping to enforce these regulations. While the claims may be substantiated, however, the testing methods and details of such claims are not as straightforward. For example, many products are purported to protect hair from damage due to ultraviolet radiation. While the ingredient responsible for this protection does block UV, it is not often present in a high enough concentration to be effective. The North American Hair Research Society has a program to certify functional claims based on third-party testing. Shampoos made for treating medical conditions such as dandruff or itchy scalp are regulated as OTC drugs in the US marketplace. In the European Union, there is a requirement for the anti-dandruff claim to be substantiated as with any other advertising claim, but it is not considered to be a medical problem. == Health risks == A number of contact allergens are used as ingredients in shampoos, and contact allergy caused by shampoos is well known. Patch testing can identify ingredients to which patients are allergic, after which a physician can help the patient find a shampoo that is free of the ingredient to which they are allergic. The US bans 11 ingredients from shampoos, Canada bans 587, and the EU bans 1328. == Specialized shampoos == === Dandruff === Cosmetic companies have developed shampoos specifically for those who have dandruff. These contain fungicides such as ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione and selenium disulfide, which reduce loose dander by killing fungi like Malassezia furfur. Coal tar and salicylate derivatives are often used as well. Alternatives to medicated shampoos are available for people who wish to avoid synthetic fungicides. Such shampoos often use tea tree oil, essential oils or herbal extracts. === Colored hair === Many companies have also developed color-protection shampoos suitable for colored hair; some of these shampoos contain gentle cleansers according to their manufacturers. Shampoos for color-treated hair are a type of moisturizing shampoo. === Baby === Shampoo for infants and young children is formulated so that it is less irritating and usually less prone to produce a stinging or burning sensation if it were to get into the eyes. For example, Johnson's Baby Shampoo advertises under the premise of ""No More Tears"". This is accomplished by one or more of the following formulation strategies. dilution, in case the product comes in contact with eyes after running off the top of the head with minimal further dilution adjusting pH to that of non-stress tears, approximately 7, which may be a higher pH than that of shampoos which are pH adjusted for skin or hair effects, and lower than that of shampoo made of soap Use of surfactants which, alone or in combination, are less irritating than those used in other shampoos (e.g. Sodium lauroamphoacetate) use of nonionic surfactants of the form of polyethoxylated synthetic glycolipids and polyethoxylated synthetic monoglycerides, which counteract the eye sting of other surfactants without producing the anesthetizing effect of alkyl polyethoxylates or alkylphenol polyethoxylates The distinction in 4 above does not completely surmount the controversy over the use of shampoo ingredients to mitigate eye sting produced by other ingredients, or the use of the products so formulated. The considerations in 3 and 4 frequently result in a much greater multiplicity of surfactants being used in individual baby shampoos than in other shampoos, and the detergency or foaming of such products may be compromised thereby. The monoanionic sulfonated surfactants and viscosity-increasing or foam stabilizing alkanolamides seen so frequently in other shampoos are much less common in the better baby shampoos. === Sulfate-free shampoos === Sulfate-free shampoos are composed of natural ingredients and free from both sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. These shampoos use alternative surfactants to cleanse the hair. === Animal === Shampoo intended for animals may contain insecticides or other medications for treatment of skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special care must be taken not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues. Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets, commonly dogs and cats, are normally intended to do more than just clean the pet's coat or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act different and are meant to treat a skin condition or an allergy or to fight against fleas. The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, antiseborrheic, antibacterials, antifungals, emollients, emulsifiers and humectants. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarian's indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused. Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin, pyrethroids (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and carbaryl. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations. Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections. These might contain ingredients such as miconazole, chlorhexidine, providone iodine, ketoconazole or selenium sulfide (which cannot be used on cats). Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, triclosan, ethyl lactate, or sulfur. Antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies. These usually contain colloidal oatmeal, hydrocortisone, Aloe vera, pramoxine hydrochloride, menthol, diphenhydramine, sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet. Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, salicylic acid, refined tar (which cannot be used on cats), selenium sulfide (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa, which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs. Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as almond, corn, cottonseed, coconut, olive, peanut, Persia, safflower, sesame, lanolin, mineral or paraffin oil. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as cetyl alcohol, laureth-5, lecithin, PEG-4 dilaurate, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, sodium lactate, propylene glycol, glycerin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone. Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus, lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil. On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos. Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats. Pet shampoos which include fragrances, deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity. === Solid shampoo bars === Invented in 1987 by Lush co-founder, Mo Constantine and cosmetic chemist, Stan Krystal, solid shampoos or shampoo bars can either be soap-based or use other plant-based surfactants, such as sodium cocoyl isethionate or sodium coco-sulfate combined with oils and waxes. Soap-based shampoo bars are high in pH (alkaline) compared to human hair and scalps, which are slightly acidic. Alkaline pH increases the friction of the hair fibres which may cause damage to the hair cuticle, making it feel rough and drying out the scalp. === Jelly and gel === Stiff, non-pourable clear gels to be squeezed from a tube were once popular forms of shampoo, and can be produced by increasing a shampoo's viscosity. This type of shampoo cannot be spilled, but unlike a solid, it can still be lost down the drain by sliding off wet skin or hair. === Paste and cream === Shampoos in the form of pastes or creams were formerly marketed in jars or tubes. The contents were wet but not completely dissolved. They would apply faster than solids and dissolve quickly. === Antibacterial === Antibacterial shampoos are often used in veterinary medicine for various conditions, as well as in humans before some surgical procedures. == No Poo Movement == Closely associated with environmentalism, the ""no poo"" movement consists of people rejecting the societal norm of frequent shampoo use. Some adherents of the no poo movement use baking soda or vinegar to wash their hair, while others use diluted honey. Further methods include the use of raw eggs (potentially mixed with salt water), rye flour, or chickpea flour dissolved in water. Other people use nothing or rinse their hair only with conditioner. === Theory === In the 1970s, ads featuring Farrah Fawcett and Christie Brinkley asserted that it was unhealthy not to shampoo several times a week. This mindset is reinforced by the greasy feeling of the scalp after a day or two of not shampooing. Using shampoo every day removes sebum, the oil produced by the scalp. This causes the sebaceous glands to produce oil at a higher rate, to compensate for what is lost during shampooing. According to Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University, a gradual reduction in shampoo use will cause the sebum glands to produce at a slower rate, resulting in less grease in the scalp. Although this approach might seem unappealing to some individuals, many people try alternate shampooing techniques like baking soda and vinegar in order to avoid ingredients used in many shampoos that make hair greasy over time. Whereas the use of baking soda for hair cleansing has been associated with hair damage and skin irritation, likely due to its high pH value and exfoliating properties, honey, egg, rye flour, and chickpea flour hair washes seem gentler for long-term use. == See also == Soap Dry shampoo Baby shampoo Hair conditioner Exfoliant No Poo == References == == External links == Media related to Shampoo at Wikimedia Commons Quotations related to Shampoo at Wikiquote The dictionary definition of shampoo at Wiktionary",Quixalin,WIKIPEDIA,"('PERSONAL CARE', [('PERSON', -0.526009738445282), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE', [('P', -0.32166850566864014), ('ERSON', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -2.7894584491150454e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16026340425014496)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of RA is hampered by significant side effects induced by their unfavorable pharmacokinetics. Delivering glucocorticoids by means of nanotechnologies is promising but the encapsulation of highly crystalline and poorly water-soluble drugs results in poor loading and low stability. We report here the design of 130 nm nanoparticles made of solely dexamethasone palmitate, stabilized by polyethylene glycol-linked phospholipids displaying a negative zeta potential (-55 mV), high entrapment efficiency and stability over 21 days under storage at 4 °C. X ray diffraction showed no crystallization of the drug. When incubated in serum, nanoparticles released free dexamethasone which explains the in vitro anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrate in a murine collagen-induced arthritis model the improved therapeutic efficacy of these nanoparticles. Their passive accumulation in arthritic joints leads to disease remission and recovery of the joint structure at a dose of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone, without any adverse effects. Dexamethasone palmitate nanoparticles are promising in the treatment of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis with a very significant difference occurring at the late stage of inflammation allowing to prevent the progression of the disease. The efficacy of dexamethasone palmitate in extending durations of local anesthetic blocks is uncertain. In a randomized, double-blind study of patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, we tested whether intravenous or perineural dexamethasone palmitate caused prolonged analgesia after intercostal nerve block. A total of 90 patients subjected to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery between May and December 2022 were randomly assigned to one of three intercostal nerve blocks study arms (n = 30 each), requiring the addition of 0.5% ropivacaine (23 ml) as follows: controls (C group), 2 ml saline; IV-DXP group, 2 ml saline + 2 ml (8 mg) intravenous dexamethasone palmitate; and PN-DXP group, 2 ml (8 mg) perineural dexamethasone palmitate.

904,"('Clofazimine', 'Lamprene', 'Lampren', 'Chlofazimine', 'Clofazimina')",Medical,"Clofazimine, sold under the brand name Lamprene, is a medication used together with rifampicin and dapsone to treat leprosy. It is specifically used for multibacillary (MB) leprosy and erythema nodosum leprosum. Evidence is insufficient to support its use in other conditions though a retrospective study found it 95% effective in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) when administered with a macrolide and ethambutol, as well as the drugs amikacin and clarithromycin. However, in the United States, clofazimine is considered an orphan drug, is unavailable in pharmacies, and its use in the treatment of MAC is overseen by the Food and Drug Administration. It is taken orally. Common side effects include abdominal pain, diarrhea, itchiness, dry skin, and change in skin color. It can also cause swelling of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, increased blood sugar, and sensitivity to the sun. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe. Clofazimine is a phenazine dye and is believed to work by interfering with DNA. Clofazimine was discovered in the 1950s at Trinity College, Dublin, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1986. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States it is not available commercially but can be obtained from the US Department of Health and Human Services. == Medical uses == The primary use of clofazimine is for the treatment of leprosy. Other uses have not been proven to be safe or effective. It has been studied in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs to treat Mycobacterium avium infections in people with HIV/AIDS and Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis. Clofazimine also has a marked anti-inflammatory effect and is given to control the leprosy reaction, erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1993, p1619). The drug is given as an alternative to people who can not tolerate the effects of dapsone for leprosy. Early research suggested clofazimine inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and reduce viral load and inflammation in the lung in animal models == Side effects == Clofazimine produces pink to brownish skin pigmentation in 75-100% of patients within a few weeks, as well as similar discoloration of most bodily fluids and secretions. These discolorations are reversible but may take months to years to disappear. There is evidence in medical literature that as a result of clofazimine administration, several patients have developed depression which in some cases resulted in suicide. It has been hypothesized that the depression was a result of this chronic skin discoloration. Cases of ichthyosis and skin dryness are also reported in response to this drug (8%-28%), as well as rash and itchiness (1-5%). == Mechanism == Clofazimine works by binding to the guanine bases of bacterial DNA, thereby blocking the template function of the DNA and inhibiting bacterial proliferation. It also increases activity of bacterial phospholipase A2, leading to release and accumulation of lysophospholipids, which are toxic and inhibit bacterial proliferation. Clofazimine is also a FIASMA (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase). == Metabolism == Clofazimine has a biological half life of about 70 days. Autopsies performed on those who have died while on clofazimine show crystal-like aggregates in the intestinal mucosa, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. == History == Clofazimine, initially known as B663, was first synthesised in 1954 by a team of scientists at Trinity College, Dublin: Frank Winder, J.G. Belton, Stanley McElhinney, M.L. Conalty, Seán O'Sullivan, and Dermot Twomey, led by Vincent Barry. Clofazimine was originally intended as an anti-tuberculosis drug but proved ineffective. In 1959, a researcher named Y. T. Chang identified its effectiveness against leprosy. After clinical trials in Nigeria and elsewhere during the 1960s, Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis launched the product in 1969 under the brand name Lamprene. Novartis was granted FDA approval of clofazimine in December 1986 as an orphan drug. The drug is currently no longer commercially available in the United States as Novartis has discontinued production of clofazimine for the US market and no generic or other brand names are marketed in the US although it retains FDA approval. == Society and culture == Clofazimine is marketed under the trade name Lamprene by Novartis although its discontinued in some countries like the US. Other brands are also available in many countries. Another producer of the clofazimine molecule is Sangrose Laboratories, located in Mavelikara, India. == Research == The immunosuppressive effects of clofazimine were immediately noticed when applied in animal model. Macrophages were first reported to be inhibited due to the stabilization of lysosomal membrane by clofazimine. Clofazimine also showed a dosage-dependent inhibition of neutrophil motility, lymphocyte transformation, mitogen-induced PBMC proliferation and complement-mediated solubilization of pre-formed immune complexes in vitro. A mechanistic studying of clofazimine in human T cells revealed that this drug is a Kv1.3 (KCNA3) channel blocker. This indicates that clofazimine will be potentially used for treatment of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. Because the Kv1.3-high effector memory T cells (TEM) are actively involved in the development of these diseases, and Kv1.3 activity is essential for stimulation and proliferation of TEM by regulating calcium influx in the T cells. Several clinical trials were also conducted looking for its immunosuppressive activity even before it was approved for leprosy by FDA. It was first reported to be effective in treating chronic discoid lupus erythematosus with 17 out of 26 patients got remission. But later another group found it was ineffective in treating diffuse, photosensitive, systemic lupus erythematosus. Clofazimine also has been sporadically reported with some success in other autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, Miescher's granulomatous cheilitis. == References == == External links == ""Lamprene (clofazimine) capsules, for oral use Initial U.S. Approval: 1986"".

Later studies in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells showed that lonidamine inhibits both respiration and glycolysis leading to a decrease in cellular ATP. Clinical trials of lonidamine in combination with other anticancer agents for a variety of cancers has begun. This is due to its proven ability to inhibit energy metabolism in cancer cells, and to enhance the activity of anticancer agents.

Metuchen Pharmaceuticals obtained exclusive rights within the United States. Avanafil acts by inhibiting a specific phosphodiesterase type 5 enzyme found in various body tissues, primarily in the corpus cavernosum penis. Other similar drugs are sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil. The advantage of avanafil is that it has very fast onset of action compared with other PDE5 inhibitors. It is absorbed quickly, reaching a maximum serum concentration in about thirty to forty-five minutes. About two-thirds of the participants were able to engage in sexual activity within fifteen minutes. == Medical use == Avanafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). == Adverse effects == Although avanafil is generally well tolerated, dose dependent adverse effects can occur.

909,"('Zuclopenthixol', '(z)-clopenthixol', 'Clopixol', 'Cisordinol', 'Zuclopentixol [spanish]')",Medical,"Zuclopenthixol (brand names Cisordinol, Clopixol and others), also known as zuclopentixol, is a medication used to treat schizophrenia and other psychoses. It is classed, pharmacologically, as a typical antipsychotic. Chemically it is a thioxanthene. It is the cis-isomer of clopenthixol (Sordinol, Ciatyl). Clopenthixol was introduced in 1961, while zuclopenthixol was introduced in 1978. Zuclopenthixol is a D1 and D2 antagonist, α1-adrenergic and 5-HT2 antagonist. While it is approved for use in Australia, Canada, Ireland, India, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and the UK, it is not approved for use in the United States. == Medical uses == === Available forms === Zuclopenthixol is available in three major preparations: As zuclopenthixol decanoate (Clopixol Depot, Cisordinol Depot), it is a long-acting intramuscular injection. Its main use is as a long-acting injection given every two or three weeks to people with schizophrenia who have a poor compliance with medication and suffer frequent relapses of illness. There is some evidence it may be more helpful in managing aggressive behaviour. As zuclopenthixol acetate (Clopixol-Acuphase, Cisordinol-Acutard), it is a shorter-acting intramuscular injection used in the acute sedation of psychotic inpatients. The effect peaks at 48–72 hours providing 2–3 days of sedation. As zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride (Clopixol, Cisordinol), it is a tablet used in the treatment of schizophrenia in those who are compliant with oral medication. It is also used in the treatment of acute bipolar mania. === Dosing === As a long-acting injection, zuclopenthixol decanoate comes in a 200 mg and 500 mg ampoule. Doses can vary from 50 mg weekly to the maximum licensed dose of 600 mg weekly. In general, the lowest effective dose to prevent relapse is preferred. The interval may be shorter as a patient starts on the medication before extending to 3 weekly intervals subsequently. The dose should be reviewed and reduced if side effects occur, though in the short-term an anticholinergic medication benztropine may be helpful for tremor and stiffness, while diazepam may be helpful for akathisia. 100 mg of zuclopenthixol decanoate is roughly equivalent to 20 mg of flupentixol decanoate or 12.5 mg of fluphenazine decanoate. In oral form zuclopenthixol is available in 2, 10, 25 and 40 mg tablets, with a dose range of 20–60 mg daily. == Side effects == Chronic administration of zuclopenthixol (30 mg/kg/day for two years) in rats resulted in small, but significant, increases in the incidence of thyroid parafollicular carcinomas and, in females, of mammary adenocarcinomas and of pancreatic islet cell adenomas and carcinomas. An increase in the incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas is a common finding for D2 antagonists which increase prolactin secretion when administered to rats. An increase in the incidence of pancreatic islet cell tumours has been observed for some other D2 antagonists. The physiological differences between rats and humans with regard to prolactin make the clinical significance of these findings unclear. Withdrawal syndrome: Abrupt cessation of therapy may cause acute withdrawal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, or insomnia). Symptoms usually begin in 1 to 4 days of withdrawal and subside within 1 to 2 weeks. Other permanent side effects are similar to many other typical antipsychotics, namely extrapyramidal symptoms as a result of dopamine blockade in subcortical areas of the brain. This may result in symptoms similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease and include a restlessness and inability to sit still known as akathisia, a slow tremor and stiffness of the limbs. Zuclopenthixol is thought to be more sedating than the related flupentixol, though possibly less likely to induce extrapyramidal symptoms than other typical depots. As with other dopamine antagonists, zuclopenthixol may sometimes elevate prolactin levels; this may occasionally result in amenorrhoea or galactorrhoea in severe cases. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal side effect. Any unexpected deterioration in mental state with confusion and muscle stiffness should be seen by a physician. Zuclopenthixol decanoate induces a transient dose-dependent sedation. However, if the patient is switched to maintenance treatment with zuclopenthixol decanoate from oral zuclopenthixol or from i.m. zuclopenthixol acetate the sedation will be no problem. Tolerance to the unspecific sedative effect develops rapidly. Very common Adverse Effects (≥10% incidence) Hypersalivation Somnolence Akathisia Hyperkinesia Hypokinesia Common (1–10%) Tachycardia Heart palpitations Vertigo Accommodation disorder Abnormal vision Salivary hypersecretion Constipation Vomiting Dyspepsia Diarrhoea Asthenia Fatigue Malaise Pain (at the injection site) Increased appetite Weight gain Myalgia Tremor Dystonia Hypertonia Dizziness Headache Paraesthesia Disturbance in attention Amnesia Abnormal gait Insomnia Depression Anxiety Abnormal dreams Agitation Decreased libido Nasal congestion Dyspnoea Hyperhidrosis Pruritus Uncommon (0.1–1%) Hyperacusis Tinnitus Mydriasis Abdominal pain Nausea Flatulence Thirst Injection site reaction Hypothermia Pyrexia Abnormal liver function tests Decreased appetite Weight loss Muscle rigidity Trismus Torticollis Tardive dyskinesia Hyperreflexia Dyskinesia Parkinsonism Syncope Ataxia Speech disorder Hypotonia Convulsion Migraine Apathy Nightmares Libido increased Confused state Ejaculation failure Erectile dysfunction Female orgasmic disorder Vulvovaginal Dryness Rash Photosensitivity Pigmentation disorder Seborrhoea Dermatitis Purpura Hypotension Hot flush Rare (0.01–0.1%) Thrombocytopenia Neutropenia Leukopenia Agranulocytosis QT prolongation Hyperprolactinaemia Hypersensitivity Anaphylactic reaction Hyperglycaemia Glucose tolerance impaired Hyperlipidaemia Gynaecomastia Galactorrhoea Amenorrhoea Priapism Withdrawal symptoms Very rare (<0.01%) Cholestatic hepatitis Jaundice Neuroleptic malignant syndrome Venous thromboembolism == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Zuclopenthixol antagonises both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, α1-adrenoceptors and 5-HT2 receptors with a high affinity, but has no affinity for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It weakly antagonises the histamine (H1) receptor but has no α2-adrenoceptor blocking activity .

912,"('Chloroquine', 'Aralen', 'Chlorochin', 'Chloraquine', 'Artrichin')",Medical,"Chloroquine is an antiparasitic medication that treats malaria. It works by increasing the levels of haeme in the blood, a substance toxic to the malarial parasite. This kills the parasite and stops the infection from spreading. Certain types of malaria, resistant strains, and complicated cases typically require different or additional medication. Chloroquine is also occasionally used for amebiasis that is occurring outside the intestines, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus erythematosus. While it has not been formally studied in pregnancy, it appears safe. It is taken by mouth. It was studied to treat COVID-19 early in the pandemic, but these studies were largely halted in the northern summer of 2020, and the NIH does not recommend its use for this purpose. Common side effects include muscle problems, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and skin rash. Serious side effects include problems with vision, muscle damage, seizures, and low blood cell levels. Chloroquine is a member of the drug class 4-aminoquinoline. As an antimalarial, it works against the asexual form of the malaria parasite in the stage of its life cycle within the red blood cell. How it works in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus is unclear. Chloroquine was discovered in 1934 by Hans Andersag. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === Malaria === Chloroquine has been used in the treatment and prevention of malaria from Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. It is generally not used for Plasmodium falciparum as there is widespread resistance to it. Chloroquine has been extensively used in mass drug administrations, which may have contributed to the emergence and spread of resistance. It is recommended to check if chloroquine is still effective in the region prior to using it. In areas where resistance is present, other antimalarials, such as mefloquine or atovaquone, may be used instead. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend against treatment of malaria with chloroquine alone due to more effective combinations. === Amebiasis === In treatment of amoebic liver abscess, chloroquine may be used instead of or in addition to other medications in the event of failure of improvement with metronidazole or another nitroimidazole within five days or intolerance to metronidazole or a nitroimidazole. === Rheumatic disease === As it mildly suppresses the immune system, chloroquine is used in some autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and has an off-label indication for lupus erythematosus. == Side effects == Side effects include blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, diarrhea, swelling legs/ankles, shortness of breath, pale lips/nails/skin, muscle weakness, easy bruising/bleeding, hearing and mental problems. Unwanted/uncontrolled movements (including tongue and face twitching, diskenesia, and dystonia) Deafness or tinnitus Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps Headache Mental/mood changes (such as confusion, personality changes, unusual thoughts/behavior, depression, feeling being watched, hallucinating) Signs of serious infection (such as high fever, severe chills, persistent sore throat) Skin itchiness, skin color changes, hair loss, and skin rashes Chloroquine-induced itching is very common among black Africans (70%), but much less common in other races. It increases with age, and is so severe as to stop compliance with drug therapy. It is increased during malaria fever; its severity is correlated to the malaria parasite load in blood. Some evidence indicates it has a genetic basis and is related to chloroquine action with opiate receptors centrally or peripherally. Triggering of a severe psoriasis attack in those with psoriasis Unpleasant metallic taste This could be avoided by ""taste-masked and controlled release"" formulations such as multiple emulsions. Chloroquine retinopathy (irreversible retinal damage) Electrocardiographic changes This manifests itself as either conduction disturbances (bundle-branch block, atrioventricular block) or cardiomyopathy — often with hypertrophy, restrictive physiology, and congestive heart failure. The changes may be irreversible. Only two cases have been reported requiring heart transplantation, suggesting this particular risk is very low. Electron microscopy of cardiac biopsies show pathognomonic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, reversible agranulocytosis, low blood platelets, neutropenia Worsening of the condition for those with porphyria Delayed hypersensitivity syndrome has been described. === Pregnancy === Chloroquine has not been shown to have any harmful effects on the fetus when used in the recommended doses for malarial prophylaxis. Small amounts of chloroquine are excreted in the breast milk of lactating women. However, this drug can be safely prescribed to infants, the effects are not harmful. Studies with mice show that radioactively tagged chloroquine passed through the placenta rapidly and accumulated in the fetal eyes which remained present five months after the drug was cleared from the rest of the body. Women who are pregnant or planning on getting pregnant are still advised against traveling to malaria-risk regions. === Elderly === There is not enough evidence to determine whether chloroquine is safe to be given to people aged 65 and older. Since it is cleared by the kidneys, toxicity should be monitored carefully in people with poor kidney functions, as is more likely to be the case in the elderly. == Drug interactions == Chloroquine has a number of drug–drug interactions that might be of clinical concern: Ampicillin – levels may be reduced by chloroquine; Antacids – may reduce absorption of chloroquine; Cimetidine – may inhibit metabolism of chloroquine; increasing levels of chloroquine in the body; Cyclosporine – levels may be increased by chloroquine; and Mefloquine – may increase risk of convulsions. == Overdose == Chloroquine, in overdose, has a risk of death of about 20%. It is rapidly absorbed from the gut with an onset of symptoms generally within an hour. Symptoms of overdose may include sleepiness, vision changes, seizures, stopping of breathing, and heart problems such as ventricular fibrillation and low blood pressure. Low blood potassium may also occur. While the usual dose of chloroquine used in treatment is 10 mg/kg, toxicity begins to occur at 20 mg/kg, and death may occur at 30 mg/kg. In children as little as a single tablet can be fatal. Treatment recommendations include early mechanical ventilation, cardiac monitoring, and activated charcoal. Intravenous fluids and vasopressors may be required with epinephrine being the vasopressor of choice. Seizures may be treated with benzodiazepines. Intravenous potassium chloride may be required, however this may result in high blood potassium later in the course of the disease. Dialysis has not been found to be useful. == Pharmacology == Absorption of chloroquine is rapid and primarily happens in the gastrointestinal tract. It is widely distributed in body tissues. Protein binding in plasma ranges from 46% to 79%. Its metabolism is partially hepatic, giving rise to its main metabolite, desethylchloroquine. Its excretion is ≥50% as unchanged drug in urine, where acidification of urine increases its elimination. It has a very high volume of distribution, as it diffuses into the body's adipose tissue. Accumulation of the drug may result in deposits that can lead to blurred vision and blindness. It and related quinines have been associated with cases of retinal toxicity, particularly when provided at higher doses for longer times. With long-term doses, routine visits to an ophthalmologist are recommended. Chloroquine is also a lysosomotropic agent, meaning it accumulates preferentially in the lysosomes of cells in the body. The pKa for the quinoline nitrogen of chloroquine is 8.5, meaning it is about 10% deprotonated at physiological pH (per the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation). This decreases to about 0.2% at a lysosomal pH of 4.6. Because the deprotonated form is more membrane-permeable than the protonated form, a quantitative ""trapping"" of the compound in lysosomes results. == Mechanism of action == === Malaria === The lysosomotropic character of chloroquine is believed to account for much of its antimalarial activity; the drug concentrates in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite and interferes with essential processes. Its lysosomotropic properties further allow for its use for in vitro experiments pertaining to intracellular lipid related diseases, autophagy, and apoptosis. Inside red blood cells, the malarial parasite, which is then in its asexual lifecycle stage, must degrade hemoglobin to acquire essential amino acids, which the parasite requires to construct its own protein and for energy metabolism. Digestion is carried out in a vacuole of the parasitic cell. Hemoglobin is composed of a protein unit (digested by the parasite) and a heme unit (not used by the parasite). During this process, the parasite releases the toxic and soluble molecule heme. The heme moiety consists of a porphyrin ring called Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (FP). To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes heme to form hemozoin, a nontoxic molecule. Hemozoin collects in the digestive vacuole as insoluble crystals. Chloroquine enters the red blood cell by simple diffusion, inhibiting the parasite cell and digestive vacuole. Chloroquine (CQ) then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole is known to be acidic (pH 4.7); chloroquine then cannot leave by diffusion. Chloroquine caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further biocrystallization of heme, thus leading to heme buildup. Chloroquine binds to heme (or FP) to form the FP-chloroquine complex; this complex is highly toxic to the cell and disrupts membrane function. Action of the toxic FP-chloroquine and FP results in cell lysis and ultimately parasite cell autodigestion. Parasites that do not form hemozoin are therefore resistant to chloroquine. ==== Resistance in malaria ==== Since the first documentation of P. falciparum chloroquine resistance in the 1950s, resistant strains have appeared throughout East and West Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. The effectiveness of chloroquine against P. falciparum has declined as resistant strains of the parasite evolved. Resistant parasites are able to rapidly remove chloroquine from the digestive vacuole using a transmembrane pump. Chloroquine-resistant parasites pump chloroquine out at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive parasites; the pump is coded by the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) gene. The natural function of the chloroquine pump is to transport peptides: mutations to the pump that allow it to pump chloroquine out impairs its function as a peptide pump and comes at a cost to the parasite, making it less fit. Resistant parasites also frequently have mutation in the ABC transporter P. falciparum multidrug resistance (PfMDR1) gene, although these mutations are thought to be of secondary importance compared to PfCRT. An altered chloroquine-transporter protein, CG2 has been associated with chloroquine resistance, but other mechanisms of resistance also appear to be involved. Verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, has been found to restore both the chloroquine concentration ability and sensitivity to this drug. Other agents which have been shown to reverse chloroquine resistance in malaria are chlorpheniramine, gefitinib, imatinib, tariquidar and zosuquidar. As of 2014 chloroquine is still effective against poultry malaria in Thailand. Sohsuebngarm et al. 2014 test P. gallinaceum at Chulalongkorn University and find the parasite is not resistant.: 1237 Sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine reverse chloroquine resistance, making resistant biotypes susceptible if used in a cotreatment. === Antiviral === Chloroquine has antiviral effects against some viruses. It increases late endosomal and lysosomal pH, resulting in impaired release of the virus from the endosome or lysosome — release of the virus requires a low pH. The virus is therefore unable to release its genetic material into the cell and replicate. Chloroquine also seems to act as a zinc ionophore that allows extracellular zinc to enter the cell and inhibit viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. === Other === Chloroquine inhibits thiamine uptake. It acts specifically on the transporter SLC19A3. Against rheumatoid arthritis, it operates by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation, phospholipase A2, antigen presentation in dendritic cells, release of enzymes from lysosomes, release of reactive oxygen species from macrophages, and production of IL-1. == History == In Peru, the indigenous people extracted the bark of the Cinchona tree (Cinchona officinalis) and used the extract to fight chills and fever in the seventeenth century. In 1633, this herbal medicine was introduced in Europe, where it was given the same use and also began to be used against malaria. The quinoline antimalarial drug quinine was isolated from the extract in 1820.: 130–131 After World War I, the German government sought alternatives to quinine. Chloroquine, a synthetic analogue with the same mechanism of action was discovered in 1934, by Hans Andersag and coworkers at the Bayer laboratories, who named it resochin. It was ignored for a decade, because it was considered too toxic for human use. Instead, in World War II, the German Africa Corps used the chloroquine analogue 3-methyl-chloroquine, known as sontochin. After Allied forces arrived in Tunis, sontochin fell into the hands of Americans, who sent the material back to the United States for analysis, leading to renewed interest in chloroquine. United States government-sponsored clinical trials for antimalarial drug development showed unequivocally that chloroquine has a significant therapeutic value as an antimalarial drug.: 61–66 It was introduced into clinical practice in 1947 for the prophylactic treatment of malaria. === Chemical synthesis === The first synthesis of chloroquine was disclosed in a patent filed by IG Farben in 1937. In the final step, 4,7-dichloroquinoline was reacted with 1-diethylamino-4-aminopentane. By 1949, chloroquine manufacturing processes had been established to allow its widespread use. == Society and culture == === Formulations === Chloroquine comes in tablet form as the phosphate, sulfate, and hydrochloride salts. Chloroquine is usually dispensed as the phosphate. === Names === Brand names include Chloroquine FNA, Resochin, Dawaquin, and Lariago. == Other animals == Chloroquine, in various chemical forms, is used to treat and control surface growth of anemones and algae, and many protozoan infections in aquariums, e.g. the fish parasite Amyloodinium ocellatum. It is also used in poultry malaria.: 1237 == Research == In biomedicinal science, chloroquine is used for in vitro experiments to inhibit lysosomal degradation of protein products. === SARS-CoV === Chloroquine was proposed as a treatment for SARS, with in vitro tests inhibiting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In October 2004, a published report stated that chloroquine acts as an effective inhibitor of the replication of SARS-CoV in vitro. In August 2005, a peer-reviewed study confirmed and expanded upon the results. === COVID-19 === === Other === Chloroquine was being considered in 2003, in pre-clinical models as a potential agent against chikungunya fever. The radiosensitizing and chemosensitizing properties of chloroquine are being evaluated for anticancer strategies in humans. Chloroquine and its modified forms have also been evaluated as treatment options for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. == References == == External links == ""Medicines for the Prevention of Malaria While Traveling – Chloroquine (Aralen)"" (PDF) (Fact sheet).

It is a small molecule inhibitor of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), which is mutated in several forms of cancer. Ivosidenib is an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 inhibitor that works by decreasing abnormal production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), leading to differentiation of malignant cells. Ivosidenib was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2018, and in the European Union in May 2023. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Ivosidenib is indicated for people with acute myeloid leukemia and locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. == Adverse effects == In ivosidenib-treated patients, reported adverse effects have been febrile neutropenia, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, colitis, hypertension, maculopapular rash. However, Ivosidenib was taken in conjunction with standard AML induction treatment, and side effects can not be directly related to the drug. == History == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) awarded orphan drug designations for acute myeloid leukemia and for cholangiocarcinoma. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 23 February 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Tibsovo, intended for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia and for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. The applicant for this medicinal product is Les Laboratoires Servier. Tibsovo was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2023. == Research == In tumors from people diagnosed with glioma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cholangiocarcinoma, and chondrosarcoma, somatic mutations in the conserved active site of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 are observed. With these new mutations, these enzymes exhibit new, neomorphic behavior, which results in the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate. The new molecule competitively inhibits α-ketoglutarate–dependent enzymes, ultimately leading to epigenetic alterations and impaired hematopoietic differentiation. Mutations in the IDH1 enzyme mutations occur in approximately 6 to 10% of the patients with AML, and IDH2 mutations occur in approximately 9 to 13% of those with AML, with unknown statistics on other conditions listed. The drug is also believed to be a slow-binding inhibitor of the IDH1-WT homodimer. Ivosidenib showed uncompetitive inhibition to the NADP cofactor, showing a hyperbolic curve for the rate constant of inhibition relative to concentration. Ivosidenib also showed no time-dependence in IC50 between 1 and 16 hours of incubation for either homodimer. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02074839 for ""Study of Orally Administered AG-120 in Subjects With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies With an IDH1 Mutation"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02989857 for ""Study of AG-120 in Previously Treated Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma With IDH1 Mutations (ClarIDHy) (ClarIDHy)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Tibsovo,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.396077979938127e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -4.792098479811102e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-therapy-rare-form-blood-cancers-called-myelodysplastic-syndromes?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=173, start_index=9, title='FDA Approves New Therapy for Rare Form of Blood Cancers Called Myelodysplastic Syndromes | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-therapy-rare-form-blood-cancers-called-myelodysplastic-syndromes?utm_source=openai')])"
915,"('Sunitinib', 'Su 11248', 'Sutent', 'Sunitinib base', 'Su-011248')",Medical,"Sunitinib, sold under the brand name Sutent, is an anti-cancer medication. It is a small-molecule, multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that was approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in January 2006. Sunitinib was the first cancer drug simultaneously approved for two different indications. As of August 2021, sunitinib is available as a generic medicine in the US. == Medical uses == === Gastrointestinal stromal tumor === Like renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors do not generally respond to standard chemotherapy or radiation. Imatinib was the first chemotherapeutic agent proven effective for metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors and represented a significant development in the treatment of this rare but challenging disease. However, approximately 20% of patients do not respond to imatinib (early or primary resistance), and among those who do respond initially, 50% develop secondary imatinib resistance and disease progression within two years. Before sunitinib, patients had no therapeutic option once they became resistant to imatinib. Sunitinib offers patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors a new treatment option to stop further disease progression and, in some cases, even reverse it. This was shown in a large phase III clinical trial in which patients who failed imatinib therapy (due to primary or secondary resistance or intolerance) were treated in a randomized and blinded fashion with either sunitinib or placebo. The study was unblinded early—at the first interim analysis—due to the clearly emerging benefit of sunitinib. Patients receiving a placebo were offered to switch to sunitinib at that time. In the primary endpoint of the study, the median time to tumor progression (TTP) was more than four-fold longer with sunitinib (27 weeks) compared with placebo (six weeks, P<.0001), based on an independent radiological assessment. The benefit of sunitinib remained statistically significant when stratified by many prespecified baseline variables. Among the secondary endpoints, the difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was similar to that in TTP (24 weeks vs. six weeks, P<.0001). Seven percent of sunitinib patients had significant tumor shrinkage (objective response) compared to 0% of patients receiving placebo (P=.006). Another 58% of sunitinib patients had disease stabilization vs. 48% of patients receiving placebo. The median time to response with sunitinib was 10.4 weeks. Sunitinib reduced the relative risk of disease progression or death by 67% and the risk of death alone by 51%. The difference in survival benefit may be diluted because placebo patients crossed over to sunitinib upon disease progression, and most of these patients subsequently responded to sunitinib. Sunitinib was relatively well tolerated. About 83% of sunitinib patients experienced a treatment-related adverse event of any severity, as did 59% of patients who received placebo. Serious adverse events were reported in 20% of sunitinib patients and 5% of placebo patients. Adverse events were generally moderate and easily managed by dose reduction, dose interruption, or other treatment. Nine percent of sunitinib patients and 8% of placebo patients discontinued therapy due to an adverse event. Fatigue is the adverse event most commonly associated with sunitinib therapy. In this study, 34% of sunitinib patients reported any fatigue, compared with 22% for placebo. The grade 3 (severe) fatigue incidence was similar between the two groups, and no grade 4 fatigue was reported. === Meningioma === Sunitinib is being studied for the treatment of meningioma, which is associated with neurofibromatosis. === Aggressive fibromatosis === As of 2024, sunitinib is being studied for aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumors). === Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors === In November 2010, sunitinib was authorized in the European Union for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors with disease progression in adults. In May 2011, the USFDA approved sunitinib for treating people with 'progressive neuroendocrine cancerous tumors located in the pancreas that cannot be removed by surgery, or that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). === Renal cell carcinoma === Sunitinib is approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Renal cell carcinoma is generally resistant to chemotherapy or radiation. Before RTKs, metastatic disease could only be treated with the cytokines interferon alpha (IFNα) or interleukin-2. However, these agents demonstrated low rates of efficacy (5%-20%). In a phase III study, median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the sunitinib group (11 months) than in the IFNα group (five months), with a hazard ratio of 0.42. In the secondary endpoints, 28% had significant tumor shrinkage with sunitinib compared to 5% with IFNα. Patients receiving sunitinib had a better quality of life than IFNα. An update in 2008 showed that the primary endpoint of median progression-free survival (PFS) remained superior with sunitinib: 11 months versus 5 months for IFNα, P<.000001. Objective response rate also remained superior: 39-47% for sunitinib versus 8-12% with IFNα, P<.000001. Sunitinib treatment trended towards a slightly longer overall survival, although this was not statistically significant. Median overall survivability was 26 months with sunitinib vs 22 months for IFNα regardless of stratification (P-value ranges from .051 to .0132, depending on statistical analysis). The first analysis includes 25 patients initially randomized to IFNα who crossed over to sunitinib therapy, which may have confounded the results; in an exploratory analysis that excluded these patients, the difference becomes more robust: 26 vs 20 months, P=.0081. Patients in the study were allowed to receive other therapies once they had progressed on their study treatment. For a ""pure"" analysis of the difference between the two agents, an analysis was done using only patients who did not receive any post-study treatment. This analysis demonstrated the greatest advantage for sunitinib: 28 months vs 14 months for IFNα, P=.0033. The number of patients in this analysis was small, which does not reflect actual clinical practice; therefore, it is not meaningful. Hypertension (HTN) was found to be a biomarker of efficacy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib. Patients with mRCC and sunitinib-induced hypertension had better outcomes than those without treatment-induced HTN. == Mechanism of action == Sunitinib inhibits cellular signalling by targeting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). These include all receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-Rs) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), which play a role in both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. The simultaneous inhibition of these targets therefore reduces tumor vascularization and triggers cancer cell apoptosis and thus results in tumor shrinkage. Sunitinib also inhibits CD117 (c-KIT), the receptor tyrosine kinase that (when improperly activated by mutation) drives the majority of gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors. It has been recommended as a second-line therapy for patients whose tumors develop mutations in c-KIT that make them resistant to imatinib, or who the cannot tolerate the drug. In addition, sunitinib binds other receptors. These include: RET CD114 CD135 The fact that sunitinib targets many different receptors, leads to many of its side effects such as the classic hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis, and other dermatologic toxicities. == History == The drug was discovered at SUGEN, a biotechnology company which pioneered protein kinase inhibitors. It was the third in a series of compounds including SU5416 and SU6668. The concept was of an ATP mimic that would compete with ATP for binding to the catalytic site of receptor tyrosine kinases. This concept led to the invention of many small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including Gleevec, Sutent, Tarceva and many others. == Side effects == Sunitinib adverse events are considered somewhat manageable and the incidence of serious adverse events low. The most common adverse events associated with sunitinib therapy are fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, hypertension, a yellow skin discoloration, hand-foot skin reaction, and stomatitis. In the placebo-controlled Phase III GIST study, adverse events which occurred more often with sunitinib than placebo included diarrhea, anorexia, skin discoloration, mucositis/stomatitis, asthenia, altered taste, and constipation. Serious (grade 3 or 4) adverse events occur in ≤10% of patients and include hypertension, fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, and chemotherapy-induced acral erythema. Lab abnormalities associated with sunitinib therapy include lipase, amylase, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets. Hypothyroidism and reversible erythrocytosis have also been associated with sunitinib. A study done at MD Anderson Cancer Center compared the outcomes of metastatic renal cell cancer patients who received sunitinib on the standard schedule (50 mg/4 weeks on 2 weeks off) with those who received sunitinib with more frequent and short drug holidays (alternative schedule). It was seen that the overall survival, progression free survival and drug adherence were significantly higher in the patients who received Sunitinib on the alternative schedule. Patients also had a better tolerance and lower severity of adverse events which frequently lead to discontinuation of treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer patients. == Interactions == Epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a major constituent of green tea, may reduce the bioavailability of sunitinib when they are taken together. == Society and culture == === Economics === Sunitinib is marketed by Pfizer as Sutent, and was subject to patents and market exclusivity as a new chemical entity until 15 February 2021. Sutent has been cited in financial news as a potential revenue source to replace royalties lost from Lipitor following the expiration of the latter drug's patent expiration in November 2011. Sutent is one of the most expensive drugs widely marketed. Doctors and editorials have criticized the high cost for a drug that does not cure cancer, but only prolongs life. ==== US ==== In the U.S., many insurance companies have refused to pay for all or part of the costs of Sutent. Because it is an oral therapy, the copay associated with this therapy can be very substantial. If a patient's secondary insurance does not cover this, the cost burden to the patient can be extreme. Particularly challenging is the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Patients have to spend thousands of dollars out-of-pocket during the gap in coverage. If this is done at the end of a calendar year, it has to be paid again at the beginning of the next calendar year, which may be burdensome financially. ==== UK ==== In the UK, NICE refused (late 2008) to recommend sunitinib for late-stage renal cancer (kidney cancer) due to the high cost per QALY, estimated by NICE at £72,000/QALY and by Pfizer at £29,000/QALY. This was overturned in February 2009 after pricing changes and public responses. Therefore, sunitinib is recommended as a first-line treatment option for people with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma who are suitable for immunotherapy and have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (i.e. completely ambulatory). ==== AU ==== Sunitinib is available in Australia and is subsidized by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for Stage IV Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). The cost to the patient who meets the clinical criteria of Stage IV RCC is AUD $35.40 for 28 capsules, regardless of dose. Manufacturer pricing for sunitinib ranges from AUD $1,834.30 to AUD $6897.54, depending on dose (12.5 mg to 50 mg). == Research == === Other solid tumors === The efficacy of sunitinib is currently being evaluated in a broad range of solid tumors, including breast, lung, thyroid and colorectal cancers. Early studies have shown single-agent efficacy in a number of different areas. Sunitinib blocks the tyrosine kinase activities of KIT, PDGFR, VEGFR2 and other tyrosine kinases involved in the development of tumours. A Phase II study in previously treated patients with metastatic breast cancer found sunitinib “has significant single agent activity”. A phase II study of refractory non-small-cell lung cancer found “Sunitinib has provocative single-agent activity in previously treated pts with recurrent and advanced NSCLC, with the level of activity similar to currently approved agents.” In a phase II study of patients with nonresectable neuroendocrine tumors, 91% of patients responded to sunitinib (9% partial response + 82% stable disease). Sunitinib was found to protect JIMT-1 breast cancer cells against natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which was claimed to block the anticancer immune response. If sunitinib were to be paired with anticancer immunotherapies, this finding might need to be taken into account. === Leukemia === Sunitinib was used to treat the leukemia of a Washington University in St. Louis leukemia researcher who developed the disease himself. His team used genetic sequencing and noticed that the FLT3 gene was hyperactive in his leukemia cells and used sunitinib as a treatment. === Unsuccessful trials === Between April 2009 and May 2011, Pfizer has reported unsuccessful late-stage trials in breast cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, and castration-resistant prostate cancer. == References == == External links == ""Sunitinib"".

917,"('Pyrimethamine', 'Pirimecidan', 'Pirimetamin', 'Rp 4753', 'Daraprim')",Medical,"Pyrimethamine, sold under the brand name Daraprim among others, is a medication used with leucovorin (leucovorin is used to decrease side effects of pyrimethamine; it does not have intrinsic anti-parasitic activity) to treat the parasitic diseases toxoplasmosis and cystoisosporiasis. It is also used with dapsone as a second-line option to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in people with HIV/AIDS. It was previously used for malaria but is no longer recommended due to resistance. Pyrimethamine is taken by mouth. Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, severe allergic reactions, and bone marrow suppression. It should not be used by people with folate deficiency that has resulted in anemia. There is concern that it may increase the risk of cancer. While occasionally used in pregnancy it is unclear if pyrimethamine is safe for the baby. Pyrimethamine is classified as a folic acid antagonist. It works by inhibiting folic acid metabolism and therefore the making of DNA. Pyrimethamine was discovered in 1952 and came into medical use in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was approved as a generic in the United States in February 2020. == Medical uses == Pyrimethamine is typically given with a sulfonamide and folinic acid. It is used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, actinomycosis, and isosporiasis, and for the treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. === Toxoplasmosis === Pyrimethamine is also used in combination with sulfadiazine to treat active toxoplasmosis. The two drugs bind the same enzymatic targets as the drugs trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole - dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase, respectively. Pyrimethamine has also been used in several trials to treat retinochoroiditis. === Pregnancy consideration === Pyrimethamine is labeled as pregnancy category C in the United States. To date, not enough evidence on its risks in pregnancy or its effects on the fetus is available. === Malaria === It is primarily active against Plasmodium falciparum, but also against Plasmodium vivax. Due to the emergence of pyrimethamine-resistant strains of P. falciparum, pyrimethamine alone is seldom used now. In combination with a long-acting sulfonamide such as sulfadiazine, it was widely used, such as in Fansidar, though resistance to this combination is increasing. == Contraindications == Pyrimethamine is contraindicated in people with folate-deficiency anaemia. == Side effects == When higher doses are used, as in the treatment of toxoplasmosis, pyrimethamine can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, glossitis, anorexia, and diarrhea. A rash, which can be indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction, is also seen, particularly in combination with sulfonamides. Central nervous system effects include ataxia, tremors, and seizures. Hematologic side effects such as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia can also occur. == Interactions == Other antifolate agents such as methotrexate and trimethoprim may potentiate the antifolate actions of pyrimethamine, leading to potential folate deficiency, anaemia, and other blood dyscrasias. == Mechanism of action == Pyrimethamine interferes with the regeneration of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolate by competitively inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Tetrahydrofolic acid is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis in many species, including protozoa. It has also been found to reduce the expression of SOD1, a key protein involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. === Other medications === Pyrimethamine is typically given with folinic acid and sulfadiazine. Sulfonamides (e.g. sulfadiazine) inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase, an enzyme that participates in folic acid synthesis from para-aminobenzoic acid. Hence, sulfonamides work synergistically with pyrimethamine by blocking a different enzyme needed for folic acid synthesis. Folinic acid (leucovorin) is a folic acid derivative converted to tetrahydrofolate, the primary active form of folic acid, in vivo, without relying on dihydrofolate reductase. Folinic acid reduces side effects related to folate deficiency in the patient. === Mechanism of resistance === Resistance to pyrimethamine is widespread. Mutations in the malarial gene for dihydrofolate reductase may reduce its effectiveness. These mutations decrease the binding affinity between pyrimethamine and dihydrofolate reductase via loss of hydrogen bonds and steric interactions. == History == Nobel Prize-winning American scientist Gertrude Elion developed the drug at Burroughs-Wellcome (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) to combat malaria. Pyrimethamine has been available since 1953. In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline sold the marketing rights for Daraprim to CorePharma. Impax Laboratories sought to buy CorePharma in 2014, and completed the acquisition, including Daraprim, in March 2015. In August 2015, the rights were bought by Turing Pharmaceuticals. Turing subsequently became infamous for a price hike controversy when it raised the price of a dose of the drug in the U.S. market from US$13.50 to US$750, a 5,500% increase. == Society and culture == === Economics === In the United States in 2015, Turing Pharmaceuticals was criticized for increasing the price 50-fold, from US$13.50 to $750 a tablet, leading to a cost of $75,000 for a course of treatment reported at one hospital. ==== United States ==== In the United States, in 2015, with Turing Pharmaceuticals' acquisition of the US marketing rights for Daraprim tablets, Daraprim became a single-source and specialty pharmacy item, and the price was increased. The cost of a monthly course for a person on 75 mg dose rose to about $75,000/month at one hospital, or $750 per tablet while it was previously priced at $13.50. Outpatients could no longer obtain the medication from a community pharmacy, but only through a single dispensing pharmacy, Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy, and institutions could no longer order from their general wholesaler, but had to set up an account with the Daraprim Direct program. Presentations from Retrophin, a company formerly headed by Martin Shkreli, CEO of Turing, from which Turing acquired the rights to Daraprim, suggested that a closed distribution system could prevent generic competitors from legally obtaining the drugs for the bioequivalence studies required for FDA approval of a generic drug. Shkreli defended the price hike by saying, ""If there was a company that was selling an Aston Martin at the price of a bicycle, and we buy that company and we ask to charge Toyota prices, I don't think that that should be a crime."" As a result of the backlash, Shkreli hired a crisis public relations firm to help explain his fund's move. Turing Pharmaceuticals announced on 24 November 2015, ""that it would not reduce the list price of that drug after all"", but they would offer patient assistance programs. New York Times journalist Andrew Pollack noted that these programs ""are standard for companies selling extremely high-priced drugs. They enable the patients to get the drug while pushing most of the costs onto insurance companies and taxpayers."" The price increase was criticized by physician groups such as HIV Medicine Associates and Infectious Diseases Society of America. In 2016, a group of high school students from Sydney Grammar supported by the University of Sydney prepared pyrimethamine as an illustration that the synthesis is comparatively easy and the price-hike unjustifiable. His team produced 3.7 g for US$20, which would have been worth between US$35,000 and US$110,000 in the United States at the time. Shkreli said the schoolboys were not competition, likely because the necessary bioequivalence studies require a sample of the existing medication provided directly by the company, and not simply purchased from a pharmacy, which Turing could decline to provide. Nonetheless, the students' work was featured in The Guardian and Time magazine, and on ABC Australia, the BBC, and CNN. On 22 October 2015, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals announced it had made available compounded and customizable formulations of pyrimethamine and leucovorin in capsules to be taken by mouth starting as low as $99 for a 100-count bottle in the United States. Pyrimethamine was approved as a generic in the United States in February 2020. In January 2020, the FTC filed a case against Vyera ""alleging an elaborate anticompetitive scheme to preserve a monopoly for the life-saving drug, Daraprim"". A settlement was reached in December 2021. According to AP News, the settlement ""requires Vyera and Phoenixus to provide up to $40 million in relief over 10 years to consumers who allegedly were fleeced by their actions and requires them to make Daraprim available to any potential generic competitor at the cost of producing the drug."" According to Law360, company executive Kevin Mulleady ""agreed to a seven-year ban on working for or holding more than an 8% share in most pharmaceutical companies."" ==== Other countries ==== In India, multiple combinations of generic pyrimethamine are available for a price ranging from US$0.04 to US$0.10 each (3–7 rupees). In the UK, the same drug is available from GSK at a cost of US$20 (£13) for 30 tablets (about $0.66 each). In Australia, the drug is available in most pharmacies at a cost of US$9.35 (A$12.99) for 50 tablets (around US$0.18 each). In Brazil, the drug is available for R$0.07 a pill, or about US$0.02. In Switzerland, the drug is available for US$9.45 (CHF9.05) for 30 tablets (around US$0.32 a piece). == Research == In 2011, researchers discovered that pyrimethamine can increase β-hexosaminidase activity, thus potentially slowing down the progression of late-onset Tay–Sachs disease. It is being evaluated in clinical trials as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. == See also == Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine == References == == External links == ""Pyrimethamine"".

It is available in oral and parenteral formulations. It was patented in 1977 and approved for medical use in 1997. Brand names include Xefo and Xefocam among others. == Medical uses == Lornoxicam is used for the treatment of various types of pain, especially resulting from inflammatory diseases of the joints, osteoarthritis, surgery, sciatica, and other inflammations. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated in patients who must not take other NSAIDs, possible reasons including salicylate sensitivity, gastrointestinal bleeding and bleeding disorders, and severe impairment of heart, liver or kidney function. Lornoxicam is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding and is contraindicated during the last third of pregnancy. == Adverse effects == Lornoxicam has side effects similar to other NSAIDs, most commonly mild ones like gastrointestinal disorders (nausea and diarrhea) and headache.

When inhaled it is used for the long term management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the nose it is used for hay fever and nasal polyps. It can also be used for mouth ulcers. It works by decreasing inflammation. Common side effects when inhaled include upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, thrush, and cough. Common side effects when used in the nose include nosebleeding and sore throat. Unlike fluticasone furoate, which is approved in children as young as two years of age when used for allergies, fluticasone propionate is only approved for children four years and older. Fluticasone propionate was patented in 1980, and approved for medical use in 1990. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, fluticasone was the 25th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 22 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Fluticasone propionate is used by powder or aerosol inhalation for the prophylaxis of asthma. The nasal spray is used for prevention and treatment of allergic rhinitis. Nasal drops are used in the treatment of nasal polyps. The nasal spray can also be used in the mouth for mouth ulcers. Fluticasone propionate in a topical form can be used to treat skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and rashes. == Adverse effects == The nasal spray and oral inhaler formulation have fewer corticosteroid side effects than the tablet formulation because they limit systemic (blood) absorption. However, systemic absorption is not negligible even with correct administration. Using the spray or inhaler at higher than recommended doses or with other corticosteroids can increase the risk for serious, systemic corticosteroid induced side effects. These side effects include weakened immune system, increased risk of systemic infections, osteoporosis, and elevated pressure in the eyes. === Nasal spray === Common side effects may include nasal irritation (burning, stinging, bleeding), headache, upset stomach (nausea, vomiting), and diarrhea. Rare side effects include infection (evidenced by, for example, fever, sore throat, and cough), vision problems, severe swelling, hoarse voice, and difficulty breathing or swallowing. === Inhaled === Common side effects may include upper respiratory tract infection, throat irritation, thrush, cough, and headache. Rare side effects include bruising, swelling of the face/neck, depression, tiredness, and shortness of breath. == Pharmacology == Fluticasone propionate is a highly selective agonist at the glucocorticoid receptor with negligible activity at androgen, estrogen, or mineralocorticoid receptors, thereby producing anti-inflammatory and vasoconstriction effects. It has been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cell, eosinophil, neutrophil, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. Fluticasone propionate is stated to exert a topical effect on the lungs without significant systemic effects at usual doses, due to its low systemic bioavailability. == Interactions == Fluticasone propionate is broken down by CYP3A4 (cytochrome P450 3A4), and has been shown to interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ritonavir and ketoconazole. Coadministration of ritonavir and fluticasone may lead to increased levels of fluticasone in the body, which may lead to Cushing's syndrome and adrenal insufficiency.

In 2022, it was the 311th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 200,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Mometasone furoate is used in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders (such as eczema and psoriasis) (topical form), allergic rhinitis (such as hay fever) (topical form), asthma (inhalation form) for patients unresponsive to less potent corticosteroids, and penile phimosis. In terms of steroid strength, it is more potent than hydrocortisone, and less potent than dexamethasone. Some low-quality evidence suggests the use of mometasone for symptomatic improvement in children with adenoid hypertrophy. Mometasone is used to alleviate inflammation and itchiness in skin conditions that respond to treatment with glucocorticoids such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Nasal Mometasone is used in people over two years of age to diminish the symptoms of hay fever (seasonal allergic rhinitis) and other allergies (perennial rhinitis), including nasal congestion, discharge, pruritus, sneezing, and treat nasal polyps. It is not useful for the common cold. === Asthma === Mometasone furoate can be used with formoterol for the treatment of asthma, due to its anti-inflammatory properties. == Contraindications == People should not use inhaled mometasone or mometasone nasal spray if they have: glaucoma or cataracts hypersensitivity, or are allergic to any ingredient in mometasone Those who are using mometasone nasal or inhaled for a long period of time (e.g. more than three months) should get regular eye exams to check for glaucoma and cataracts and should take precautions to avoid infections such as taking a vitamin D supplement, staying away from those with an infection (chickenpox, measles, colds or flu, COVID-19), washing foods, hand washing and calling a family doctor at the first sign of a severe infection. People should not use mometasone topical (skin cream) if: hypersensitive or allergic to any ingredient in the skin cream The risks of Mometasone furoate to the baby during pregnancy cannot be ruled out. == Side effects == The nasal spray form of mometasone may cause the following side effects: headache Viral upper respiratory infections sore throat nose bleeds cough muscle and joint pain Serious side effects include: Thrush (fungal infection in the nose or throat), slow wound healing, eye problems such as glaucoma or cataracts, weakened immune system (immunodeficiency) which causes increased susceptibility to infections and adrenal insufficiency. The inhaled form of mometasone for asthma may cause the following side effects: headache stuffy or runny nose dry throat swelling of nose, throat and sinuses flu-like symptoms painful menstrual periods Serious side effects may include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), increased risk of osteoporosis, glaucoma and cataracts, thrush in the mouth or throat, growth retardation in children, bronchospasms, adrenal insufficiency and weakened immune system which causes increased susceptibility to infections. The topical (skin cream) version may cause: burning and itching at the application site acne changes in skin color dryness at the application site skin sores The only serious side effect that is known with mometasone topical is adrenal insufficiency. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Mometasone furoate reduces inflammation by causing several effects: Reversing the activation of inflammatory proteins Activating the secretion of anti-inflammatory proteins Stabilizing cell membranes Decreasing the influx of inflammatory cells In addition to the glucocorticoid properties of mometasone furoate, it is a very potent agonist of the progesterone receptor as well as a partial agonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor. ==== Mechanism of action ==== Mometasone, like other corticosteroids, possesses anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. For allergies, corticosteroids reduce the allergic reactions in various types of cells (mastocytes and eosinophils) that are responsible for allergic reactions. Mometasone and other corticosteroids circulate in the blood easily, crossing cellular membranes and binding with cytoplasmic receptors, resulting in the transcription and synthesis of proteins. It also inhibits the actions of the enzyme cytochrome P450 2C8 which participates in the activity of monooxygenase. The inflammation is reduced by decreasing the liberation of hydrolase acids of leukocytes, the prevention of the accumulation of macrophages in the sites of inflammation, the interference with the adhesion of leukocytes to capillary walls, the reduction of the permeability of the capillary membranes and consequently edema, the reduction of complementary components, inhibition of histamine and kinin liberation, and interference with scar tissue formation. The proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen deposits is also reduced. It is believed that the action of corticosteroid anti-inflammatory agents is bound to inhibitive proteins of phospholipase A2, collectively called lipocortins. The lipocortins, in turn, control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation as the prostaglandins and leukotrienes, inhibiting the liberation of the molecular precursors of arachidonic acid. Intranasal mometasone alleviates symptoms such as rhinorrhea aquosa, nasal congestion, nasal drip, sneezing, and pharyngeal itching. Topical administration applied to the skin reduces the inflammation associated with chronic or acute dermatosis. Although mometasone furoate does not have significant systemic immunomodulatory effects, it can be considered a local immunosuppressive drug because clinical studies have shown reductions (vs. baseline ) in neutrophils (a white blood cell) in the nasal mucosa. It could be also considered an antihistamine along with its glucocorticoid effects because it significantly reduces histamine and eosinophil cationic protein levels. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Metabolism ==== Extensive metabolic hepatic metabolism of mometasone furoate to multiple metabolites occurs. No principal metabolites are detectable in plasma. After in vitro incubation, one of the minor metabolites formed is furoate 6β-hydroxymometasone. In human hepatic microsomes, the formation of these metabolites is regulated by CYP3A4. === Mometasone === Mometasone by itself is a synthetic, steroidal glucocorticoid or corticosteroid that was never marketed. The C17α furoate ester of mometasone, is the marketed medication. Mometasone furoate acts as a prodrug of mometasone. In addition to its glucocorticoid activity, mometasone also has very potent progestogenic activity and acts as a partial agonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor. == Society and culture == === Availability === As of 2016, mometasone furoate is available worldwide in formulations for nasal, oral inhalation, and topical administration, for human and veterinary use, either as a single active agent or in combination with other medications, under many brand names. === Combinations === The following combination medications are available as of 2022: == References ==",Nasonex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.969590397900902e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000717144284863025)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/nasonex.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Nasonex 24HR Allergy: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/nasonex.html?utm_source=openai')])"
925,"('Lenvatinib', 'Lenvima', 'Lenvatinib (e7080)', 'E 7080', 'Lenvatinib free base')",Medical,"Lenvatinib, sold under the brand name Lenvima among others, is an anti-cancer medication for the treatment of certain kinds of thyroid cancer and for other cancers as well. It was developed by Eisai Co. and acts as a multiple kinase inhibitor against the VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 kinases. == Medical uses == Lenvatinib is approved (since 2015) for the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer that is either locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, and did not respond to treatment with radioactive iodine (radioiodine). In May 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it (in combination with everolimus) for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The drug is also approved in the US and in the European Union for hepatocellular carcinoma that cannot be removed surgically in patients who have not received cancer therapy by mouth or injection. == Adverse effects == Hypertension (high blood pressure) was the most common side effect in studies (73% of patients, versus 16% in the placebo group), followed by diarrhoea (67% vs. 17%) and fatigue (67% vs. 35%). Other common side effects included decreased appetite, hypotension (low blood pressure), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), nausea, muscle and bone pain. == Interactions == As lenvatinib moderately prolongs QT time, addition of other drugs with this property could increase the risk of a type of abnormal heart rhythm, namely torsades de pointes. No relevant interactions with enzyme inhibitors and inducers are expected. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Lenvatinib acts as a multiple kinase inhibitor. It inhibits the three main vascular endothelial growth factor receptors VEGFR1, 2 and 3, as well as fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1, 2, 3 and 4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha, c-Kit, and the RET proto-oncogene. Some of these proteins play roles in cancerogenic signalling pathways. VEGFR2 inhibition is thought to be the main reason for the most common side effect, hypertension. === Pharmacokinetics === Lenvatinib is absorbed quickly from the gut, reaching peak blood plasma concentrations after one to four hours (three to seven hours if taken with food). Bioavailability is estimated to be about 85%. The substance is almost completely (98–99%) bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Lenvatinib is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4 to desmethyl-lenvatinib (M2). M2 and lenvatinib itself are oxidized by aldehyde oxidase (AO) to substances called M2' and M3', the main metabolites in the feces. Another metabolite, also mediated by a CYP enzyme, is the N-oxide M3. Non-enzymatic metabolization also occurs, resulting in a low potential for interactions with enzyme inhibitors and inducers. Terminal half-life is 28 hours, with about two thirds being excreted via the feces, and one quarter via the urine. == Chemistry == Lenvatinib is used in form of the mesylate salt (CAS number 857890-39-2 ). == History == A phase I clinical trial in cancer patients was performed in 2006. A phase III trial treating thyroid cancer patients started in March 2011. Lenvatinib was granted orphan drug status for treatment of various types of thyroid cancer that do not respond to radioiodine in the US and Japan in 2012 and in Europe in 2013. In February 2015, the U.S. FDA approved lenvatinib for treatment of progressive, radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. In May 2015, European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the drug for the same indication. In May 2016, the FDA approved it (in combination with everolimus) for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. In August 2018, the FDA approved lenvatinib for the first-line treatment of people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). == References ==",Lenvima,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.07818695041351e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.260862523457035e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/history/lenvima.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=9, title='Lenvima (lenvatinib) FDA Approval History - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/history/lenvima.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Patients with advanced solid tumours participated in a phase 1 dose-escalation trial to profile the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ilorasertib. Ilorasertib monotherapy was administered at 10-180 mg orally once daily (Arm I, n = 23), 40-340 mg orally twice daily (Arm II, n = 28), or 8-32 mg intravenously once daily (Arm III, n = 7), on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Dose-limiting toxicities were predominantly related to VEGFR inhibition. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events ( > 30%) were: fatigue (48%), anorexia (34%), and hypertension (34%). Pharmacodynamic markers suggested that ilorasertib engaged VEGFR2 and Aurora B kinase, with the VEGFR2 effects reached at lower doses and exposures than Aurora inhibition effects. In Arm II, one basal cell carcinoma patient (40 mg twice daily (BID)) and one patient with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site (230 mg BID) had partial responses. In patients with advanced solid tumours, ilorasertib treatment resulted in evidence of engagement of the intended targets and antitumour activity, but with maximum inhibition of VEGFR family kinases occurring at lower exposures than typically required for inhibition of Aurora B in tissue. NCT01110486. Ilorasertib (ABT-348) is a novel inhibitor of Aurora kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and the Src families of tyrosine kinases. Ilorasertib alone or in combination with azacitidine demonstrated activity in preclinical models in various hematological malignancies, indicating that pan-Aurora kinase and multiple kinase inhibition may have preferential antileukemic activity. This phase 1 trial determined the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of ilorasertib alone or combined with azacitidine in advanced hematologic malignancies. Fifty-two patients (median age, 67 years; 35 % with >4 prior regimens) with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML; n = 38), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12), or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (n = 2) received 3 or 6 doses of ilorasertib per 28-day cycle and were assigned to arm A (once-weekly oral), B (twice-weekly oral), C (once-weekly oral plus azacitidine), or D (once-weekly intravenous) treatment. Maximum tolerated doses were not determined; the recommended phase 2 oral monotherapy doses were 540 mg once weekly and 480 mg twice weekly. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were hypertension (28.8 %), hypokalemia (15.4 %), anemia (13.5 %), and hypophosphatemia (11.5 %). Oral ilorasertib pharmacokinetics appeared dose proportional, with a 15-hour half-life and no interaction with azacitidine. Ilorasertib inhibited biomarkers for Aurora kinase and VEGF receptors, and demonstrated clinical responses in 3 AML patients.

928,"('Moxonidine', 'Norcynt', 'Nucynt', 'Cynt', 'Be 5895')",Medical,"Moxonidine (INN) is a new-generation alpha-2/imidazoline receptor agonist antihypertensive drug licensed for the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. It may have a role when thiazides, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are not appropriate or have failed to control blood pressure. In addition, it demonstrates favourable effects on parameters of the insulin resistance syndrome, apparently independent of blood pressure reduction. It is also a growth hormone releaser. It is manufactured by Solvay Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Abbott in 2009) under the brand name Physiotens and Moxon. == Mechanism of action == Moxonidine is a selective agonist at the imidazoline receptor subtype 1 (I1). This receptor subtype is found in both the rostral ventro-lateral pressor and ventromedial depressor areas of the medulla oblongata. Moxonidine therefore causes a decrease in sympathetic nervous system activity and, therefore, a decrease in blood pressure. Compared to the older central-acting antihypertensives, moxonidine binds with much greater affinity to the imidazoline I1-receptor than to the α2-receptor. In contrast, clonidine binds to both receptors with near equal affinity. Moxonidine has an affinity for I1 that is 33 times greater than α2, compared to clonidine which is only four times greater. In addition, moxonidine may also promote sodium excretion, improve insulin resistance and glucose tolerance and protect against hypertensive target organ damage, such as kidney disease and cardiac hypertrophy. == Pharmacodynamic properties == === Effects on insulin resistance === In all animal models of insulin resistance, moxonidine had striking effects on the development of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and impaired glucose homeostasis. Given the importance of insulin resistance as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is of considerable relevance that it has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity. == Contraindications == It is contraindicated if there has been a past history of angioedema; heart conduction disorders (e.g. sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree heart block); bradycardia; severe heart failure or coronary artery disease. Also: Raynaud's syndrome, intermittent claudication, epilepsy, depression, Parkinson's disease, glaucoma. Use in pregnancy is discouraged. Moxonidine passes into breast milk. Moxonidine should be avoided in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug should also be avoided. If concomitant treatment with a beta blocker has to be stopped, the beta blocker should be discontinued first, then moxonidine after a few days. Alcohol may potentiate the hypotensive effects of Moxonidine. Excess mortality has been seen in patients with symptomatic heart failure in the MOXCON study. However, the MOXCON trial utilised a very high dose of 3.0 mg daily which is well above the normal dose of 0.2–0.6 mg daily. == Adverse effects == Noteworthy side effects include dry mouth, headache, fatigue, dizziness, intermittent facial oedema, nausea, sleep disturbances (rarely sedation), asthenia, vasodilatation, and rarely, skin reactions. === Safety === Routine toxicology studies have provided no evidence that moxonidine has any teratogenic, mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. No evidence has been found of serious adverse effects on organs or organ systems, and the drug has not been shown to have deleterious effects on perinatal or postnatal growth and development. == Drug interactions == Concomitant administration of moxonidine and a thiazide diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide gave a synergistic antihypertensive effect. == See also == Rilmenidine == References == == External links == Media related to Moxonidine at Wikimedia Commons",Moxonidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.135155202471651e-05), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005627478822134435)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxonidine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Moxonidine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxonidine?utm_source=openai')])"
929,"('Citalopram (hydrobromide)', '(¬±)-citalopram hydrobromide', 'Lu 10-171', 'Citalopram', 'Nitalapram')",Medical,"Citalopram, sold under the brand name Celexa among others, is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social phobia. The antidepressant effects may take one to four weeks to occur. It is typically taken orally (swallowed by mouth). In some European countries, it is sometimes given intravenously (injected into a vein) to initiate treatment, before switching to the oral route of administration for continuation of treatment. It has also been used intravenously in other parts of the world in some other circumstances. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, sexual problems, shakiness, feeling tired, and sweating. Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, glaucoma, and QT prolongation. It should not be used in persons who take or have recently taken an MAO inhibitor. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may harm the fetus. Citalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 40th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 15 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Depression === In the United States, citalopram is approved to treat major depressive disorder. Citalopram appears to have comparable efficacy and superior tolerability relative to other antidepressants. In the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ranking of ten antidepressants for efficacy and cost-effectiveness, citalopram is fifth in effectiveness (after mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline) and fourth in cost-effectiveness. Evidence for the effectiveness of citalopram for treating depression in children is uncertain. === Panic disorder === Citalopram is licensed in the UK and other European countries for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. === Other === Citalopram may be used off-label to treat anxiety, and dysthymia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. It appears to be as effective as fluvoxamine and paroxetine in obsessive–compulsive disorder. Some data suggest the effectiveness of intravenous infusion of citalopram in resistant OCD. Citalopram is well tolerated and as effective as moclobemide in social anxiety disorder. There are studies suggesting that citalopram can be useful in reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior. It appears to be superior to placebo for behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. It has also been used successfully for hypersexuality in early Alzheimer's disease. A meta-analysis, including studies with fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram versus placebo, showed SSRIs to be effective in reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase. For alcoholism, citalopram has produced a modest reduction alcohol intake and increase in drink-free days in studies of alcoholics, possibly by decreasing desire or reducing the reward. While on its own citalopram is less effective than amitriptyline in the prevention of migraines, in refractory cases, combination therapy may be more effective. Citalopram and other SSRIs can be used to treat hot flashes.: 107 A 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in autistic children from citalopram, raising doubts about whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in children with autism. Some research suggests citalopram interacts with cannabinoid protein-couplings in the rat brain, and this is put forward as a potential cause of some of the drug's antidepressant effects. == Administration == Citalopram is typically taken in one dose, either in the morning or evening. It can be taken with or without food. Its absorption does not increase when taken with food, but doing so can help prevent nausea. Nausea is often caused when the 5-HT3 receptors actively absorb free serotonin, as this receptor is present within the digestive tract. == Adverse effects == Citalopram theoretically causes side effects by increasing the concentration of serotonin in other parts of the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in dopamine release associated with increased serotonin. Citalopram is also a mild antihistamine, which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.: 104 Other common side effects of citalopram include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, hyperactivity and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares. Citalopram is associated with a higher risk of arrhythmia than other SSRIs. Citalopram and other SSRIs can induce a mixed state, especially in those with undiagnosed bipolar disorder.: 105 According to an article published in 2020, one of the other rare side effects of Citalopram could be triggering visual snow syndrome; which does not resolve after the discontinuation of the medicine. === Sexual dysfunction === Sexual dysfunction is often a side effect of SSRIs. Some people experience persistent sexual side effects when taking SSRIs or after discontinuing them. Symptoms of medication-induced sexual dysfunction from antidepressants include difficulty with orgasm, erection, or ejaculation. Other symptoms may be genital anesthesia, anhedonia, decreased libido, vaginal lubrication issues, and nipple insensitivity in women. Rates are unknown, and there is no established treatment. === Abnormal heart rhythm === In August 2011, the FDA announced, ""Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation. Citalopram should no longer be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day"". A further clarification, issued in March 2012, restricted the maximum dose to 20 mg for subgroups of patients, including those older than 60 years and those taking an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C19.7. === Endocrine effects === As with other SSRIs, citalopram can cause an increase in serum prolactin level. Citalopram has no significant effect on insulin sensitivity in women of reproductive age and no changes in glycaemic control were seen in another trial. === Exposure in pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including citalopram) during pregnancy is associated with shorter duration of gestation (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. It is uncertain whether there is an increased prevalence of septal heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed an SSRI in early pregnancy. === Overdose === Overdosage may result in vomiting, sedation, disturbances in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremors, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions.: 105 Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the sole agent. Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 50-400 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000–3000 μg/L in patients who survive acute overdosage, and 3–30 mg/L in those who do not survive. It is the most dangerous of SSRIs in overdose. === Suicidality === In the United States, citalopram carries a boxed warning stating it may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24. === Discontinuation syndrome === SSRI discontinuation syndrome has been reported when treatment is stopped. It includes sensory, and gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, lethargy, and sleep disturbances, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety/agitation, irritability, and poor concentration. Electric shock-like sensations are typical for SSRI discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as paraesthesiae, sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with citalopram should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished. == Interactions == === Serotonin syndrome === Citalopram should not be taken with St John's wort, tryptophan or 5-HTP as the resulting drug interaction could lead to serotonin syndrome. With St John's wort, this may be caused by compounds in the plant extract reducing the efficacy of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes that process citalopram. Tryptophan and 5-HTP are precursors to serotonin. When taken with an SSRI, such as citalopram, this can lead to levels of serotonin that can be lethal. This may also be the case when SSRIs are taken with SRAs (serotonin releasing agents) such as in the case of MDMA. It is possible that SSRIs could reduce the effects associated with an SRA since SSRIs stop the reuptake of Serotonin by blocking SERT. This would allow less serotonin in and out of the transporters, thus decreasing the likelihood of neurotoxic effects. However, these concerns are still disputed as the exact pharmacodynamic effects of citalopram and MDMA have yet to be fully identified. Citalopram is contraindicated in individuals taking MAOIs, owing to a potential for serotonin syndrome. === Other interactions === SSRIs, including citalopram, can increase the risk of bleeding, especially when coupled with aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants. Taking citalopram with omeprazole may cause higher blood levels of citalopram. This is a potentially dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed. == Pharmacokinetics == Citalopram is considered safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic dose range. Distinct from some other agents in its class, it exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interaction potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or comorbid patients. == Stereochemistry == Citalopram has one stereocenter, to which a 4-fluoro phenyl group and an N, N-dimethyl-3-aminopropyl group bind. As a result of this chirality, the molecule exists in (two) enantiomeric forms (mirror images). They are termed S-(+)-citalopram and R-(–)-citalopram. Citalopram is sold as a racemic mixture, consisting of 50% (R)-(−)-citalopram and 50% (S)-(+)-citalopram. Only the (S)-(+) enantiomer has the desired antidepressant effect. Lundbeck now markets the (S)-(+) enantiomer, the generic name of which is escitalopram. Whereas citalopram is supplied as the hydrobromide, escitalopram is sold as the oxalate salt (hydrooxalate). In both cases, the salt forms of the amine make these otherwise lipophilic compounds water-soluble. == Metabolism == Citalopram is metabolized in the liver mostly by CYP2C19, but also by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Metabolites desmethylcitalopram and didesmethylcitalopram are significantly less energetic and their contribution to the overall action of citalopram is negligible. The half-life of citalopram is about 35 hours. Approximately 80% is cleared by the liver and 20% by the kidneys. The elimination process is slower in the elderly and in patients with liver or kidney failure. With once-daily dosing, steady plasma concentrations are achieved in about a week. Potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 might decrease citalopram clearance. Tobacco smoke exposure was found to inhibit the biotransformation of citalopram in animals, suggesting that the elimination rate of citalopram is decreased after tobacco smoke exposure. After intragastric administration, the half-life of the racemic mixture of citalopram was increased by about 287%. == History == Citalopram was first synthesized in 1972 by chemist Klaus Bøgesø and his research group at the pharmaceutical company Lundbeck and was first marketed in 1989 in Denmark. It was first marketed in the US in 1998. The original patent expired in 2003, allowing other companies to legally produce and market generic versions. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Citalopram is sold under these brand names: === European Commission fine === On 19 June 2013, the European Commission imposed a fine of €93.8 million on the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck, plus a total of €52.2 million on several generic pharmaceutical-producing companies. This was in response to Lundbeck entering an agreement with the companies to delay their sales of generic citalopram after Lundbeck's patent on the drug had expired, thus reducing competition in breach of European antitrust law. == Other uses == Citalopram is also a parasiticide.

930,"('Escitalopram (oxalate)', '(s)-citalopram (oxalate)', 'Escitalopram', '(s)-citalopram', 'Scitalopram')",Medical,"Escitalopram, sold under the brand names Lexapro and Cipralex, among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is mainly used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorder. Escitalopram is taken by mouth. For commercial use, it is formulated as an oxalate salt exclusively. Common side effects include headache, nausea, sexual problems, mild sedation, and trouble sleeping. More serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in people up to the age of 24 years. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Escitalopram is the (S)-enantiomer of citalopram (which exists as a racemate), hence the name es-citalopram. Escitalopram was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. Escitalopram is rarely replaced by twice the dose of citalopram; escitalopram is safer and more effective. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the second most prescribed antidepressant and fifteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 30 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. Other first-line SSRIs that have similar results include sertraline, paroxetine and fluoxetine among others. == Medical uses == Escitalopram is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents and adults, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. In European countries including the United Kingdom, it is approved for depression and anxiety disorders; these include: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. In Australia it is approved for major depressive disorder. === Depression === Escitalopram is among the most effective and well-tolerated antidepressants for the short-term treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. It is also the safest one to give to children and adolescents. Controversy existed regarding the effectiveness of escitalopram compared with its predecessor, citalopram. The importance of this issue followed from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic mixture of isomers of citalopram, prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of evergreening. Accordingly, this issue has been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. As of 2012, reviews had concluded (with caveats in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to citalopram in efficacy and tolerability. === Anxiety disorders === Escitalopram appears to be effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder, with relapse on escitalopram at 20% rather than placebo at 50%, which translates to a number needed to treat of 3.33. Escitalopram appears effective in treating social anxiety disorder as well. === Other === Escitalopram probably reduces premenstrual symptoms in women with premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder and is probably more effective when taken continuously compared to luteal phase administration. == Side effects == Escitalopram, like other SSRIs, has been shown to affect sexual function, causing side effects such as decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, and anorgasmia. There is also evidence that SSRIs are correlated with an increase in suicidal ideation. An analysis conducted by the FDA found a statistically insignificant 1.5 to 2.4-fold (depending on the statistical technique used) increase of suicidality among the adults treated with escitalopram for psychiatric indications. The authors of a related study note the general problem with statistical approaches: due to the rarity of suicidal events in clinical trials, it is hard to draw firm conclusions with a sample smaller than two million patients. Citalopram and escitalopram are associated with a mild dose-dependent QT interval prolongation, which is a measure of how rapidly the heart muscle repolarizes after each heartbeat. Prolongation of the QT interval is a risk factor for torsades de pointes (TdP), a heart rhythm disturbance that is sometimes fatal. Despite the observed change in the QT interval, the risk of TdP from escitalopram appears to be quite low, and it is similar to other antidepressants that are not known to affect the QT interval. A 2013 review discusses several reasons to be optimistic about the safety of escitalopram. It references a crossover study in which 113 subjects were each given four different treatments in randomized order: placebo, 10 mg/day escitalopram, 30 mg/day escitalopram, or 400 mg/day moxifloxacin (a positive control known to cause QTc prolongation). At 10 mg/day, escitalopram increased the QTc interval by 4.5 milliseconds (ms). At 30 mg/day, the QTc increased by 10.7 ms. A QTc increase of less than 60 ms is not likely to confer significant risk. The 30 mg/day escitalopram dose induced significantly less QTc prolongation than a therapeutically equivalent 60 mg/day dose of citalopram, which increased the QTc interval by 18.5 ms. More data about the cardiac risk from escitalopram can be found in a large observational study from Sweden that took note of all the medications used by all the patients presenting with TdP, and found the incidence of TdP in escitalopram users to be only 0.7 cases of TdP for every 100,000 patients who took the drug (ages 18-64), and only 4.1 cases of TdP for every 100,000 elderly patients who took the drug (ages 65 and up). Of the 9 antidepressants that were used by patients with TdP, escitalopram ranked 7th by TdP incidence in elderly patients (only venlafaxine and amitriptyline had less risk), and it ranked 5th of 9 by TdP incidence in patients ages 18-64. Antidepressants as a class had a relatively low risk of TdP, and most patients on an antidepressant who experienced TdP were also taking another drug that prolonged QT interval. Specifically, 80% of the escitalopram users who experienced TdP were taking at least one other drug known to cause TdP. For comparison, the most popular antiarrhythmic drug in the study was sotalol with 52,750 users, and sotalol had a TdP incidence of 81.1 cases and 41.2 cases of TdP per 100,000 users in the ≥65 and 18-64-year-old demographics, respectively. Drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as escitalopram, should be used with caution in those with congenital long QT syndrome or known pre-existing QT interval prolongation, or in combination with other medicines that prolong the QT interval. ECG measurements should be considered for patients with cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances should be corrected before starting treatment. In December 2011, the UK implemented new restrictions on the maximum daily doses at 20 mg for adults and 10 mg for those older than 65 years or with liver impairment. The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada did not similarly order restrictions on escitalopram dosage, only on its predecessor citalopram. Like other SSRIs, escitalopram has also been reported to cause hyponatremia (low sodium levels), with rates ranging from 0.5 to 32%, which can often be attributed to SIADH. This is typically not dose-dependent and at higher risk for occurrence within the first few weeks of starting treatment. === Very common effects === Very common effects (>10% incidence) include: Headache (24%) Nausea (18%) Ejaculation disorder (9–14%) Somnolence (4–13%) Insomnia (7–12%) === Common (1–10% incidence) === Common effects (1–10% incidence) include: === Psychomotor effects === The most common effect is fatigue or somnolence, particularly in older adults, although patients with pre-existing daytime sleepiness and fatigue may experience paradoxical improvement of these symptoms. Escitalopram has not been shown to affect serial reaction time, logical reasoning, serial subtraction, multitasking, or Mackworth Clock task performance. === Sexual dysfunction === Some people experience persistent sexual side effects when taking SSRIs or after discontinuing them. Symptoms of medication-induced sexual dysfunction from antidepressants include difficulty with orgasm, erection, or ejaculation. Other symptoms may be genital anesthesia, anhedonia, decreased libido, vaginal lubrication issues, and nipple insensitivity in women. Rates are unknown, and there is no established treatment. === Pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including escitalopram) is associated with shorter duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). Antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. There is a tentative association of SSRI use during pregnancy with heart problems in the baby. The advantages of their use during pregnancy may thus not outweigh the possible negative effects on the baby. === Withdrawal === Escitalopram discontinuation, particularly abruptly, may cause certain withdrawal symptoms such as ""electric shock"" sensations, colloquially called ""brain shivers"" or ""brain zaps"" by those affected. Frequent symptoms in one study were dizziness (44%), muscle tension (44%), chills (44%), confusion or trouble concentrating (40%), amnesia (28%), and crying (28%). Very slow tapering is recommended. There have been spontaneous reports of discontinuation of escitalopram and other SSRIs and SNRIs, especially when abrupt, leading to dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, anxiety, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. Other symptoms such as panic attacks, hostility, aggression, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), mania, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation can emerge when the dose is adjusted down. == Overdose == Excessive doses of escitalopram usually cause relatively minor untoward effects, such as agitation and tachycardia. However, dyskinesia, hypertonia, and clonus may occur in some cases. Therapeutic blood levels of escitalopram are usually in the range of 20–80 μg/L but may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, and those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods. Chiral techniques are available to distinguish escitalopram from its racemate, citalopram. == Interactions == Escitalopram weakly inhibits CYP2D6, and hence may increase plasma levels of some CYP2D6 substrates such as aripiprazole, risperidone, tramadol, codeine, etc. As escitalopram is only a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, analgesia from tramadol may not be affected. Escitalopram (at the maximum dose of 20 mg/day) has been found to increase peak levels of the CYP2D6 substrate desipramine by 40% and total exposure by 100%. Likewise, it has been found to increase peak levels of the CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol by 50% and overall exposure by 82%. Escitalopram does not inhibit CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1. Exposure to escitalopram is increased moderately, by about 50%, when it is taken with omeprazole, a CYP2C19 inhibitor. The authors of this study suggested that this increase is unlikely to be of clinical concern. Combination of citalopram with fluoxetine or fluvoxamine resulted in increased exposure to the escitalopram enantiomer, owing to the strong inhibition of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 by these agents. Bupropion, a known strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, has been found to significantly increase citalopram plasma concentration and systemic exposure (peak levels increased by 30%, total exposure increased by 40%); as of April 2018 the interaction with escitalopram had not been studied, but some monographs warned of the potential interaction. Citalopram did not affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion or its metabolites in the study. Escitalopram should be taken with caution when using St. John's wort, ginseng, dextromethorphan (DXM), linezolid, tramadol, and other serotonergic drugs due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. As an SSRI, escitalopram should not be given concurrently with MAOIs. Escitalopram, similarly to other SSRIs, may increase bleeding risk with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid), antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and garlic supplements due to escitalopram's inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation via blocking serotonin transporters on platelets. Escitalopram can also prolong the QT interval, and hence it is not recommended in patients who are concurrently on other medications that also can prolong the QT interval. These drugs include antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, some antihistamines (astemizole, mizolastine), macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (except palonosetron), and some antiretrovirals (ritonavir, saquinavir, lopinavir). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Escitalopram increases intrasynaptic levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter into the presynaptic neuron. Over time, this leads to a downregulation of pre-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance, and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases. Of the SSRIs currently available, escitalopram has the highest selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) compared to the norepinephrine transporter (NET), making the side-effect profile relatively mild in comparison to less-selective SSRIs. In addition to its antagonist action at the orthosteric site of SERT, escitalopram also binds to an allosteric site on the transporter, thereby decreasing its disassociation rate. Escitalopram binds to this allosteric site at a greater affinity than other SSRIs. The clinical relevance of this action is unknown. === Pharmacokinetics === Escitalopram is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and hence P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as verapamil and quinidine may improve its blood-brain barrier penetrability. In a preclinical study in rats combining escitalopram with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, its antidepressant-like effects were enhanced. == Chemistry == Escitalopram is the (S)-enantiomer (left-handed version) of the racemate citalopram, which is responsible for its name: escitalopram. == History == Escitalopram was developed in cooperation between Lundbeck and Forest Laboratories. Its development was initiated in 1997, and the resulting new drug application was submitted to the US FDA in March 2001. The short time (3.5 years) it took to develop escitalopram can be attributed to the previous experience of Lundbeck and Forest with citalopram, which has similar pharmacology. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Escitalopram is sold under many brand names worldwide such as Cipralex, Lexapro, Lexam, Mozarin, Aciprex, Depralin, Ecytara, Elicea, Gatosil, Nexpram, Nexito, Nescital, Szetalo, Stalopam, Pramatis, Betesda, Scippa and Rexipra. === Legal status === The FDA issued the approval of escitalopram for major depression in August 2002, and for generalized anxiety disorder in December 2003. In May 2006, the FDA approved a generic version of escitalopram by Teva. In July 2006, the U.S. District Court of Delaware decided in favor of Lundbeck regarding a patent infringement dispute and ruled the patent on escitalopram valid. In 2006, Forest Laboratories was granted an 828-day (2 years and 3 months) extension on its US patent for escitalopram. This pushed the patent expiration date from 7 December 2009, to 14 September 2011. Together with the 6-month pediatric exclusivity, the final expiration date was 14 March 2012. === Allegations of illegal marketing === In 2004, separate civil suits alleging illegal marketing of citalopram and escitalopram for use by children and teenagers by Forest were initiated by two whistleblowers: a physician named Joseph Piacentile and a Forest salesman named Christopher Gobble. In February 2009, the suits were joined. Eleven states and the District of Columbia filed notices of intent to intervene as plaintiffs in the action. The suits alleged that Forest illegally engaged in off-label promotion of Lexapro for use in children; hid the results of a study showing lack of effectiveness in children; paid kickbacks to physicians to induce them to prescribe Lexapro to children; and conducted so-called ""seeding studies"" that were, in reality, marketing efforts to promote the drug's use by doctors. Forest denied the allegations but ultimately agreed to settle with the plaintiffs for over $313 million. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == External links == Harris G (1 September 2009).

It is used topically (as eye drops) to control the progression of open-angle glaucoma and in the management of ocular hypertension, alone or in combination with other medication. It reduces intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes. == Adverse effects == The most common side effect is conjunctival hyperemia, which occurs in 4 to 20% of patients. Less common side effects include stinging of the eyes, headache, and respiratory infections. Rare side effects are dyspnoea (breathing difficulties), worsening of asthma, and macular oedema. == Interactions == Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can either reduce or increase the effect of tafluprost. Timolol eye drops, a common kind of glaucoma medication, does not negatively interact with this drug. No interactions with systemic (for example, oral) drugs are expected because tafluprost does not reach relevant concentrations in the bloodstream. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tafluprost is a prodrug of the active substance, tafluprost acid, a structural and functional analogue of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). Tafluprost acid is a selective agonist at the prostaglandin F receptor, increasing outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes and thus lowering intraocular pressure. Other PGF2α analogues with the same mechanism include latanoprost and travoprost. === Pharmacokinetics === Tafluprost, as a lipophilic ester, easily penetrates the cornea and is then activated to the carboxylic acid, tafluprost acid. Onset of action is 2 to 4 hours after application, the maximal effect is reached after 12 hours, and ocular pressure remains lowered for at least 24 hours. Tafluprost acid is inactivated by beta oxidation to 1,2-dinortafluprost acid, 1,2,3,4-tetranortafluprost acid, and its lactone, which are subsequently glucuronidated or hydroxylated. The cytochrome P450 liver enzymes play no role in the metabolism.

932,"('Chlorprothixene', 'Taractan', 'Truxal', 'Clorprotixeno', 'Chlorprothixen')",Medical,"Chlorprothixene, sold under the brand name Truxal among others, is a typical antipsychotic of the thioxanthene group. == Medical uses == Chlorprothixene's principal indications are the treatment of psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) and of acute mania occurring as part of bipolar disorders. Other uses are pre- and postoperative states with anxiety and insomnia, severe nausea / emesis (in hospitalized patients), the amelioration of anxiety and agitation due to use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression and, off-label, the amelioration of alcohol and opioid withdrawal. It may also be used cautiously to treat nonpsychotic irritability, aggression, and insomnia in pediatric patients. An intrinsic antidepressant effect of chlorprothixene has been discussed, but not proven. Likewise, it is unclear if chlorprothixene has genuine (intrinsic) analgesic effects. However, chlorprothixene can be used as co-medication in severe chronic pain. Also, like most antipsychotics, chlorprothixene has antiemetic effects. == Side effects == Chlorprothixene has a strong sedative activity with a high incidence of anticholinergic side effects. The types of side effects encountered (dry mouth, massive hypotension and tachycardia, hyperhidrosis, substantial weight gain etc.) normally do not allow a full effective dose for the remission of psychotic disorders to be given. So cotreatment with another, more potent, antipsychotic agent is needed. Chlorprothixene is structurally related to chlorpromazine, with which it shares, in principle, all side effects. Allergic side effects and liver damage seem to appear with an appreciable lower frequency. The elderly are particularly sensitive to anticholinergic side effects of chlorprothixene (precipitation of narrow angle glaucoma, severe obstipation, difficulties in urinating, confusional and delirant states). In patients >60 years the doses should be particularly low. Early and late extrapyramidal side effects may occur but have been noted with a low frequency (one study with a great number of participants has delivered a total number of only 1%). == Overdose == Overdose symptoms can be confusion, hypotension, and tachycardia, and several fatalities have been reported with concentrations in postmortem blood ranging from 0.1 to 7.0 mg/L compared to non-toxic levels in postmortem blood which can extend to 0.4 mg/kg. == Interactions == Chlorprothixene may increase the plasma-level of concomitantly given lithium. In order to avoid lithium intoxication, lithium plasma levels should be monitored closely. If chlorprothixene is given concomitantly with opioids, the opioid dose should be reduced (by approx. 50%), because chlorprothixene amplifies the therapeutic actions and side effects of opioids considerably. Avoid the concomitant use of chlorprothixene and tramadol (Ultram). Seizures may be encountered with this combination. Consider additive sedative effects and confusional states to emerge, if chlorprothixene is given with benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Choose particular low doses of these drugs. Exert particular caution in combining chlorprothixene with other anticholinergic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants and antiparkinsonian agents): Particularly the elderly may develop delirium, high fever, severe obstipation, even ileus and glaucoma . == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Chlorprothixene is an antagonist of the following receptors: 5-HT2, 5-HT6, 5-HT7: antipsychotic effects, sedation/anxiolysis, antidepressant effect, weight gain D1, D2, D3, D4, D5: antipsychotic effects, sedation, extrapyramidal side effects, prolactin increase, depression, apathy/anhedonia, weight gain H1: sedation, weight gain Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors: anticholinergic effects, inhibition of extrapyramidal side effects α1-Adrenergic: hypotension, sedation, anxiolysis Because of its potent serotonin 5-HT2A and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism, chlorprothixene causes relatively mild extrapyramidal symptoms. This is in contrast to most other typical antipsychotics. For this reason, chlorprothixene has sometimes been described instead as an atypical antipsychotic. Chlorprothixene has also been found to act as FIASMA (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase). === Pharmacokinetics === One metabolite of chlorprothixene is N-desmethylchlorprothixene. == History == Chlorprothixene was the first of the thioxanthene antipsychotics to be synthesized. It was introduced in 1959 by Lundbeck. Lometraline, tametraline, and sertraline were reportedly derived via structural modification of chlorprothixene. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Chlorprothixene is sold mainly under the brand name Truxal. === Availability === Chlorprothixene is widely available throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world.

It belongs to a new class of anthelmintics called aminoacetonitrile derivatives (AAD). It is marketed by Elanco as Zolvix (United Kingdom) as a single active, or Zolvix Plus (New Zealand, Australia) in combination with the macrocyclic lactone abamectin. == History == Aminoacetonitrile derivatives were originally discovered by scientists working at Novartis to have high potency against in vitro parasite models. Compounds were further validated in rodent parasite models following oral and subcutaneous administration. A lead compound AAD 1566 was isolated that eliminated pathogenic nematodes at doses of 2.5 mg/kg in sheep and 5.0 mg/kg in cattle and was named monepantel. The structure and anthelmintic activity of monepantel were first described in patent WO2005/44784. It was first registered in 2009 for use in sheep in New Zealand to control adult and immature L4 stages of all major GI nematodes. == Mechanism of action == Studies using a molecular genetic approach in C. elegans indicated that AADs worked via ligand-gated ion channels. Further research identified the DEG-3 subfamily of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as the likely putative target of monepantel. Rufener et al published in 2009 that MPTL-1 was the likely binding site of monepantel in Haemonchus contortus. The DEG-3 subfamily is absent in mammals and this might explain the minimal toxicity of monepantel. It has been shown the AADs and monepantel in particular potentiate DEG-3/Des-2 receptors of H. contortus acting as an agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor producing spastic paralysis and death of the nematode. Interestingly, only the S-enantiomer is found to be active against gastrointestinal nematodes. == Pharmacology == After administration to either sheep or cattle, monepantel is rapidly converted to its major metabolite monepantel sulphone, which also has similar levels of efficacy against gastrointestinal nematodes compared to the parent compound. === Sheep === Data on the pharmacokinetics of monepantel in sheep following intravenous and oral dosing have been published. The sulphone metabolite was rapidly formed and predominated after four hours regardless of the route of administration. Following oral dosing of sheep with 3 mg/kg of monepantel the Tmax, Cmax and AUC of monepantel were 16 h, 17.9 ng/mL and 671 ng.h/mL, while for the sulphone metabolite they were 24 h, 94.3 ng/mL and 11125 ng.h/mL. === Cattle === After oral treatment of dairy cattle monepantel and monepantel sulphone are found in the plasma and milk. Monepantel is rapidly converted to the major metabolite monepantel sulphone which is then found in much higher concentration and lasts much longer in tissues than the parent compound. In one study in calves dosed orally with 2.5 mg/kg of monepantel the Tmax was 8 hours, Cmax 21.5 ng/mL and AUC 2174 ng.h/mL, while the major metabolite monepantel sulphone had a Tmax of 41.3 hours, Cmax of 96.8 ng/mL and AUC of 10242 ng.h.mL. In dairy cows given monepantel orally the major metabolite observed in plasma and milk was monepantel sulphone. Monepantel was detected for up to 33 hours in milk and the sulphone metabolite up to 177 hours. The milk concentrations of the sulphone metabolite were substantially higher than the plasma with the AUC being nearly 7 fold higher in milk than plasma. There was no significant change in the pharmacokinetics with the addition of oxfendazole. == Efficacy == As an oral drench dosed at 2.5 mg/kg in sheep it has claimed efficacy against adult and immature L4 stages of all major GI nematodes, namely: Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, Teladorsagia trifurcata, Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Trichostrongylus rugatus, Trichostrongylus vitrinus, Nematodirus, battus, Nematodirus filicollis, Nematodirus spathiger (adult stage only), Nematodirus abnormalis (only adult stage tested), Cooperia curticei, Cooperia oncophora, Oesophagostomum venulosum (L4 stageonly) Chabertia ovina == Safety == In sheep monepantel is considered to have a good safety profile. Weaned lambs treated with 1x, 3x and 5x doses every 21 days for 8 occasions were found to be unaffected with no adverse events noted. Between control lambs and treated lambs there were no significant differences in body weight, organ weight, blood chemistry and haematology and coagulation detected. == Anthelmintic resistance == Due to having a different mode of action and molecular target than other anthelmintics, monepantel will generally kill nematodes resistant to the other major classes of anthelmintics. However, within a few years of monepantel's release on the market, anthelmintic resistance was reported in several countries including Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, Brazil, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. These reports have shown a number of species were resistant to monepantel, including Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, and Oesophagostomum. == References ==",Monepantel,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.029796196147799492), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.4645250737667084), ('DU', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25228628516197205)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monepantel,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18594861/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25200288/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29366967/,https://stockhead.com.au/health/pharmaust-achieves-successful-phase-ii-trials-on-monepantel-for-canine-cancer-shares-jump/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20679419/,https://www.neurologylive.com/view/pharmaaust-als-agent-monepantel-meets-primary-end-point-phase-1,https://www.invivochem.com/monepantel.html ', [])"

939,"('Trovafloxacin', 'Trovafloxacin [inn]', 'Trovafloxacin (inn)', 'Trovan (oral)', 'Fluorinated quinolone')",Medical,"Trovafloxacin (sold as Trovan by Pfizer and Turvel by Laboratorios Almirall) is a broad spectrum antibiotic that inhibits the uncoiling of supercoiled DNA in various bacteria by blocking the activity of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It was withdrawn from the market due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. It had better Gram-positive bacterial coverage but less Gram-negative coverage than the previous fluoroquinolones. == Adverse reactions == Trovafloxacin use is significantly restricted due to its high potential for inducing serious and sometimes fatal liver damage. Currently, the drug is not approved for use in the U.S. or the European Union due to association with cases of acute liver failure and death. == Manufacturing == The key reaction in building the ring consists of 1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition of ethyl diazoacetate to N-Cbz-3-pyrroline to afford the pyrrazolidine (3). Pyrolysis results in loss of nitrogen and formation of the cyclopropylpyrrolidine ring. The stereochemistry of the ring simply reflects the thermodynamics, since cis ring fusion is by far the most stable arrangement, as is the cis configuration of the ester group. The ester is then saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acid (5). The acid undergoes a version of the Curtius rearrangement when treated with diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) to afford the transient isocyanate (6). The reactive function adds t-BuOH from the reaction medium to afford the product as its tert-Butyloxycarbonyl protecting group derivative (7). Catalytic hydrogenation then removes the carbobenzyloxy protecting group to afford the secondary amine (8). In a standard quinoline reaction, this amine is then used to displace the more reactive fluorine at the 7-position in Ethyl 1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6,7-difluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylate (9). == Society and culture == === Legal status === The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved trovafloxacin for therapeutic use in December 1997 for use in patients aged 18 years and older. In June 1999, the agency advised doctors to limit the prescription of trovafloxacin due to adverse events associated with the drug (over 100 cases of acute liver injury reported to FDA). In May 2000, the FDA withdrew marketing authorisation for trovafloxacin. Trovafloxacin received marketing authorisation in the European Union in October 1998. In June 1999, in view of reported adverse events, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products recommended suspension of the marketing authorisation for a year. The suspension took effect in August 1999 and was renewed in September 2000. In October 2000, Pfizer notified the European Commission of its decision to voluntarily withdraw the marketing authorisation which was approved by EMA in March 2001. === Economics === Trovan sales during its first full year on the market contributed US$160 million of Pfizer's total revenue of US$12.6 billion. Investors expected it to eventually bring in US$1 billion per year. === Nigerian clinical trial controversy === In 1996, during a meningitis epidemic in Kano, Nigeria, the drug was administered to approximately 200 infected children. Eleven children died in the trial: five after taking Trovan and six after taking an older antibiotic used for comparison in the clinical trial. Others suffered blindness, deafness and brain damage, common consequences of meningitis that have not been seen in patients treated with trovafloxacin for other infection types. An investigation by the Washington Post concluded that Pfizer had administered the drug as part of an illegal clinical trial without authorization from the Nigerian government or consent from the children's parents. The case came to light in December 2000 as the result of an investigation by The Washington Post, and sparked significant public outcry. The most serious error was the falsification and backdating of an ethics approval letter by the lead investigator of the trial, Dr. Abdulhamid Isa Dutse. Dr. Dutse is now the chief medical officer of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. The result of the trial was that children treated with oral trovafloxacin had a 5% (5/100) mortality rate compared to a 6% (6/100) mortality rate with intramuscular ceftriaxone. Between 2002 and 2005 the victims of the Trovan tests in Nigeria filed a series of unsuccessful lawsuits in the United States. However, in January 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the Nigerian victims and their families were entitled to bring suit against Pfizer in the United States under the Alien Tort Statute. A US$75 million settlement with the State of Kano was reached on July 30, 2009. Additionally two lawsuits also remain pending in New York, United States.

Pelitinib is known to be an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used in clinical trials for colorectal and lung cancers, but the role of pelitinib in cancer metastasis has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the anti-migration and anti-invasion activities of pelitinib in HCC cell lines. Using three HCC cell lines (Huh7, Hep3B, and SNU449 cells), the effects of pelitinib on cell cytotoxicity, invasion, and migration were determined by cell viability, wound healing, transwell invasion, and spheroid invasion assays. The activities of MMP-2 and -9 were examined through gelatin zymography. Through immunoblotting analyses, the expression levels of EMT-TFs (Snail1, Twist1, and ZEB1) and EMT-related signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Akt signaling pathways were measured. The activity and expression levels of target genes were analyzed by reporter assay, RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunoblotting analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's Multiple comparison tests in Prism 3.0 to assess differences between experimental conditions. In this study, pelitinib treatment significantly inhibited wound closure in various HCC cell lines, including Huh7, Hep3B, and SNU449. Additionally, pelitinib was found to inhibit multicellular cancer spheroid invasion and metalloprotease activities in Huh7 cells. Further investigation revealed that pelitinib treatment inhibited the migration and invasion of Huh7 cells by inducing Twist1 degradation through the inhibition of MAPK and Akt signaling pathways. We also confirmed that the inhibition of cell motility by Twist1 siRNA was similar to that observed in pelitinib-treated group. Furthermore, pelitinib treatment regulated the expression of target genes associated with EMT, as demonstrated by the upregulation of E-cadherin and downregulation of N-cadherin. Based on our novel finding of pelitinib from the perspective of EMT, pelitinib has the ability to inhibit EMT activity of HCC cells via inhibition of Twist1, and this may be the potential mechanism of pelitinib on the suppression of migration and invasion of HCC cells. Therefore, pelitinib could be developed as a potential anti-cancer drug for HCC. Pelitinib is a potent irreversible EGFR TK inhibitor currently in clinical trials for the treatment of lung cancer. Hyperthermia has been applied concomitantly with chemotherapy and radiotherapy to enhance treatment outcome. In this study, we investigated the ability of the combination of pelitinib with other conventional anticancer drugs to specifically target cancer cells with up-regulated efflux transporters ABCB1/ABCG2 after hyperthermia as a novel way to eradicate the cancer stem-like cells responsible for cancer recurrence. Alterations in intracellular topotecan accumulation, the efflux of fluorescent probe substrates, expression and ATPase activity of ABCB1/ABCG2 and tumoursphere formation capacity of side population (SP) cells sorted after hyperthermia were examined to elucidate the mechanism of pelitinib-induced chemosensitization. While pelitinib did not modulate ABCB1/ABCG2 expressions, the combination of pelitinib with transporter substrate anticancer drugs induced more marked apoptosis, specifically in cells exposed to hyperthermia. The flow cytometric assay showed that both ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated drug effluxes were significantly inhibited by pelitinib in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition kinetics suggested that pelitinib is a competitive inhibitor of ABCB1/ABCG2, which is consistent with its ability to stimulate their ATPase activity. SP cells sorted after hyperthermia were found to be more resistant to anticancer drugs, presumably due to the up-regulation of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Importantly, pelitinib specifically enhanced the chemosensitivity but reduced the tumoursphere formation capacity of these SP cells. This study demonstrated a novel approach, exploiting drug resistance, to selectively kill cancer stem-like cells after hyperthermia. Biomarkers for treatment sensitivity or drug resistance used in precision medicine include prognostic and predictive molecules, critical factors in selecting appropriate treatment protocols and improving survival rates. However, identification of accurate biomarkers remain challenging due to the high risk of false-positive findings and lack of functional validation results for each biomarker. Here, we discovered a mechanical correlation between leucine proline-enriched proteoglycan 1 (LEPRE1) and pelitinib drug sensitivity using in silico statistical methods and confirmed the correlation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and A549 lung cancer cells. We determined that high LEPRE1 levels induce protein kinase B activation, overexpression of ATP-binding cassette superfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) and E-cadherin, and cell colonization, resulting in a cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Sensitivity to pelitinib increases in LEPRE1-overexpressing cells due to the reversing effect of ABCG2 upregulation. LEPRE1 silencing induces pelitinib resistance and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through actin rearrangement via a series of Src/ERK/cofilin cascades. The in silico results identified a mechanistic relationship between LEPRE1 and pelitinib drug sensitivity, confirmed in two cancer types. This study demonstrates the potential of LEPRE1 as a biomarker in cancer through in-silico prediction and in vitro experiments supporting the clinical development of personalized medicine strategies based on bioinformatics findings.",Pelitinib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012742503313347697), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014184369705617428)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([tocris.com](https://www.tocris.com/products/pelitinib_6349?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Pelitinib | EGFR | Tocris Bioscience', type='url_citation', url='https://www.tocris.com/products/pelitinib_6349?utm_source=openai')])"

More than 90% of CML cases are caused by a chromosomal abnormality that results in the formation of a so-called Philadelphia chromosome. This abnormality was discovered by Peter Nowell in 1960 and is a consequence of fusion between the Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinase gene at chromosome 9 and the break point cluster (Bcr) gene at chromosome 22, resulting in a chimeric oncogene (Bcr-Abl) and a constitutively active Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Compounds have been developed to selectively inhibit the tyrosine kinase. Before the 2001 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of imatinib, no drugs were available to alter the natural progression of CML. Only cytotoxic drugs such as busulfan, hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha (rIFN-α) were utilized. Even though the first Bcr-Abl TK inhibitor was named ""the magic bullet"" to cure cancer by Time magazine, a second generation of Bcr-Abl TKI was subsequently developed to combat the initial resistance that emerged. New forms of resistance can arise as: missense mutations within the Abl kinase domain, over-expression of Bcr-Abl, increased production of transmembrane plasma proteins, or the constitutive activation of downstream signaling molecules such as Src-family kinases. Bcr-Abl TKIs are also being investigated as potential disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson’s disease. While initial results have shown modest efficacy, further studies involving highly potent representatives of this drug class are necessary. == History == CML has a well defined molecular target and relatively selective therapies aimed at that target, which is not the case for the majority of cancers and chemotherapies today. Bcr-Abl was regarded as highly attractive target for drug intervention since the Bcr-Abl fusion gene encodes a constitutively activated kinase. Drug discovery that specifically targeted the ATP binding site of a single kinase was regarded as quite a challenging task since hundreds of protein kinases were known in the human genome. In the presence of TKI the binding of ATP is blocked, phosphorylation is prevented and Bcr-Abl expressing cells either have a selective growth disadvantage or undergo apoptotic cell death. Due to increasing resistance and intolerance to imatinib efforts were made to develop new drugs that could inhibit the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. This led to the discovery of second generation drugs. While drug screening was used to develop imatinib, second generation TKI's were developed with rational drug design approach due to increased knowledge in structural biology of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. == First generation == === Imatinib (STI571) === Imatinib (Gleevec) was discovered in 1992 and is regarded as first generation drug since it is the first Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor to be used in the treatment of CML. ==== Development ==== In the development of imatinib, the structure of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase played a limited role because it was unknown. A high-throughput screening of chemical libraries at Novartis was performed to identify a starting molecule, which was called ""Pyrimidine A"". This compound served as a lead compound and was then tested and modified to develop imatinib. With a replacement of the imidazole group with a benzamido group, the compound's specificity increased while its activity as a kinase inhibitor remained the same. Subsequently, introducing a methyl substituent ortho to the pyrimidinyl-amino group enhanced the potency. ==== Binding ==== Since then crystallographic studies have revealed that imatinib binds to the kinase domain of Abl only when the domain adopts the inactive or ""closed"" conformation. This is where the glycine-rich, P-binding phosphate loop (P-loop) folds over the ATP binding site and the activation-loop adopts a conformation in which it occludes the substrate binding site and disrupts the ATP phosphate binding site to block the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The shift of the AspPheGly (DFG) triad at the N-terminal end of the activation loop results in the exposure of a binding pocket which can be utilized by inhibitors. This conformation is referred to as DFGout. Imatinib binds to Abl domain via six hydrogen bond interactions. This stabilizes the imatinib Bcr-Abl complex and prevents ATP from reaching its binding site. The hydrogen bonds involve the pyridine-N and backbone-NH of Met-318, the aminopyrimidine and side chain hydroxyl of Thr-315, the amide-NH and side chain carboxylate of Glu-286, the carbonyl and backbone-NH of Asp-381, the protonated methylpiperazine with the backbone-carbonyl atoms of Ile-360 and His-361. Additionally, a number of van der Waals interactions contribute to binding. A hydrophobic pocket is formed by amino acid residues Ile-293, Leu-298, Leu-354 and Val-379 around the phenyl ring adjacent to the piperazinyl-methyl group of imatinib. At the time of its discovery, in the absence of structural information, no clear explanation for the impressive selectivity of imatinib could be found. Although first-generation treatment achieved an extremely high response rate and a low relapse rate in CML patients, some patients do experience resistance or intolerance to imatinib. == Drug resistance == Drug resistance is the main drive in continuing research and development of Bcr-Abl TKI. Shortly after the introduction of imatinib, investigators began to describe a number of in vitro derived cell lines with resistance to the drug. This was rapidly followed by the clinical description of imatinib resistant cells in patients, which has resulted in efforts to better understand the biology behind these observations. Assessments of therapeutic response of imatinib in patients with CML are based upon meeting hematologic, cytogenic and molecular milestones. Patients that fail to achieve defined responses at predefined time points are described as primarily resistant to therapy, and those losing previously obtained milestones in disease regression are termed secondarily resistant. Before a conclusion is drawn, it is important to consider that retrospective data has showed a high incidence of imatinib non-compliance in CML patients and this could lead to undesired clinical outcomes. In general, imatinib resistance can be subdivided into Bcr-Abl dependent and independent mechanisms. Bcr-Abl dependent mechanisms include over expression or amplification of the Bcr-Abl gene and point mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain that interfere with imatinib binding. Bcr-Abl independent mechanisms include factors influencing the concentration of imatinib within the cell, for example by alterations in drug influx and efflux and activation of Bcr-Abl independent pathways, such as members of the Src kinase family. Imatinib resistance can also be produced by other mechanisms that will not be mentioned here as the importance of those mechanisms still remain a question due to lack of clinical data. === Bcr-Abl dependent mechanisms of resistance === ==== Bcr-Abl duplication ==== The first reports of resistance to imatinib described a development of oncogene amplification. That is, the gene that encodes for the pathogenic Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is duplicated in the DNA sequence, leading to higher expression of the pathogen. Increasing the imatinib dose could surmount this kind of resistance, provided that severe or intolerable adverse effects are not produced. ==== Bcr-Abl mutation ==== Point mutations can cause amino acid substitutions inside the kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl protein and disrupt the binding site of imatinib on the tyrosine kinase, resulting in a loss of sensitivity to the drug. These mutations normally affect the structure of the Bcr-Abl protein, leading either to interruption of critical contact points between the drug and the Bcr-Abl protein or induction of a conformational change, resulting in a protein that imatinib is unable to bind to. Mutational frequencies appear to increase as the disease, CML, progresses from chronic phase to the blast phase. The most important mutations are the P-loop mutations and the T315I mutation. Mutations on other sites of the kinase have also been reported, for example on the C-helix, SH2 domain, substrate binding site, activation loop and C-terminal lobe. Some of these mutations have clinical significance, but none as much as P-loop and T315I mutations. ===== T315I mutation ===== The T315I is a unique mutation because of its resistance to all approved Bcr-Abl inhibitors, prior to ponatinib. It is caused by a single cytosine to thymine (C -> T) base pair substitution at position 944 of the Abl gene (codon '315' of the Abl protein) sequence resulting in amino acid Threonine being substituted by Isoleucine at that position - thus 'T315I'. This substitution eliminates a critical oxygen molecule needed for hydrogen bonding between imatinib and the Abl kinase, and also creates steric hindrance to the binding of most TKIs. When discovered, it was estimated that every 6 out of 9 cases of advanced stage CML with imatinib resistance carried this mutation. T315I produces the highest magnitude of resistance of any mutation both to imatinib and second generations TKIs. Ponatinib (Iclusig) by Ariad was approved in 2013 for use as second-line CML treatment, and is the only licensed TKI which binds to the T315I mutated kinase successfully. ===== P-loop mutations ===== The structure of Bcr-Abl contains two flexible loops, the ATP-binding P-loop and the activation loop. These loops have specific arrangements in the inactive conformation of Bcr-Abl that stabilize the basal conformation. Mutations in these loops destabilize arrangement of the loops such that the kinase domain cannot assume the inactive conformation required for imatinib binding. Mutations in the P-loop region are the most common, accounting for 36-48% of all mutations. There are clinical data indicating that Bcr-Abl mutations in the P-loop is 70-100 fold less sensitive to imatinib compared with native Bcr-Abl. === Bcr-Abl Independent mechanisms of resistance === Additional mechanisms have been postulated to describe resistance seen in various model systems although none have been clearly identified as a sole source of clinical resistance. ==== Drug efflux caused by P-glycoproteins ==== Some investigations in cell lines have shown that imatinib resistance may be partly due to an increase in the expression of the P-glycoprotein efflux pump. By utilizing agents that inhibit P-glycoprotein activity imatinib susceptibility has been restored in some cases. ==== Drug import by organic cation transporter 1 ==== The entry of imatinib into cells is dependent on an organic cation transporter (OCT1). OCT1 plays a significant role in imatinib resistance by inhibiting its influx and thus decreasing the intracellular bioavailability of imatinib. Patients with low expression, activity or polymorphisms of OCT1 had significantly lower intracellular levels of imatinib. The response of patients with low OCT1 activity was significantly dose-dependent. This data indicates that OCT1 activity is an important determinant in the molecular response to imatinib. ==== Alternative signaling pathway activation ==== In a few patient groups, resistance may be caused by the activation of other signaling pathways, particularly the Src family kinases. The Src family kinases have been implicated in Bcr-Abl signaling and mediate imatinib resistance by stabilizing the active conformation of Bcr-Abl, a conformation that does not bind imatinib. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that Src family kinases are also involved in Bcr-Abl-independent forms of imatinib resistance. === Solutions === The treatment options for imatinib resistant or intolerant CML patients may include strategies such as increasing the dose of imatinib or the use of second-generation drugs. Escalation of imatinib-doses has shown to overcome some cases of primary resistance to imatinib, such as Bcr-Abl duplication, but the response is usually short acting. In the case of resistance or intolerance, it could be helpful to test for Bcr-Abl mutations to direct the choice of second line treatment as the variable options have different function profile against the different mechanisms of resistance. Second-generation drugs offer improved potency and a greater likelihood of success in resistant patients. There is also a growing interest in testing the hypothesis that administration of multiple Abl kinase inhibitors in early phase patients could be used to delay or prevent the emergence of drug resistant clones. The combination of two agents targeting different pathways involved in CML may significantly improve response rates and potentially increase survival. == Second generation drugs == Second generation drugs are intended to have decreased resistance and intolerance than imatinib. Second generation drugs that are currently marketed are nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib (third generation). === Nilotinib (AMN107) === ==== Development ==== Nilotinib is a phenylamino-pyrimidine derivative that is structurally related to imatinib. It was developed based on the structure of the Abl-imatinib complex to address the need associated with imatinib intolerance and resistance. Small changes were made on the imatinib molecule to make it more potent and selective as a Bcr-Abl inhibitor and these changes resulted in the discovery of nilotinib. Nilotinib is a selective Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor. Nilotinib is 10-30 fold more potent than imatinib in inhibiting activity of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase and proliferation of Bcr-Abl expressing cells. The drug effectively inhibits the auto phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl on Tyr-177 that is involved in CML pathogenesis. Synergistic activity of imatinib and nilotinib has been reported following coadministration. This might be a result of the fact that the drugs are taken up in cells by different mechanisms: imatinib influx is dependent on OCT1 but nilotinib is not. Nilotinib is also not a substrate for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein pump, unlike imatinib. Although the two dimensional molecular structures of these two drugs might look similar, they are dissimilar in terms of spatial structure and molecular properties. ==== Binding ==== Nilotinib binds to the inactive conformation of the Abl kinase domain, largely through lipophilic interactions and thus blocks its catalytic activity. Nilotinib binds to the kinase domain by making four hydrogen bond interactions involving the pyridyl-N and the backbone NH of Met-318, the anilino-NH and the side chain OH of Thr-315, the amido-NH and side chain carboxylate of Glu-286 and the amido carbonyl with the backbone NH of the Asp-381. The [4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl] anilino segment of nilotinib has close binding interactions with Met-318, Phe-317 and Thr-315 residues of a region within the ATP binding site. The remaining half of the compound extends beyond the Thr-315 gatekeeper residue to bind within an additional pocket. The 3-methylimidazole and trifluoro-methyl groups of nilotinib make important interactions with the Abl kinase domain. These groups also make the shape of nilotinib very different from that of imatinib. Nilotinib also binds to the kinase through a large number of weak van der Waals interactions. ==== Resistance ==== Nilotinib has shown effect against most mutations (32/33) that are associated with imatinib resistance but the T315I mutant remains resistant to nilotinib. Its ineffectiveness against the T315I mutant seems to be a consequence of the loss of an H-bond interaction between threonine-O and aniline-NH on nilotinib and a steric clash between the isoleucine-methyl group and 2-methylphenyl phenyl group of nilotinib. On the other hand, resistance to nilotinib is associated with a limited spectrum of Bcr-Abl kinase mutations that mostly affect the P-loop and T315I. However all mutations except T315I were effectively suppressed by increasing nilotinib concentration. Although nilotinib is more potent than imatinib it is possible that its specific mode of binding to Abl may make other sites vulnerable to new kinds of drug resistance. === Dasatinib (BMS-354825) === ==== Development ==== Dasatinib is a thiazolylaminopyrimidine developed as the hydrochloride salt. It was discovered with a program directed towards immunosuppressive drugs and is 325-fold more potent against cells expressing wild type Bcr-Abl than imatinib. Dasatinib is a multi targeted inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases. It also has inhibitory activity against additional downstream kinases. ==== Binding ==== Dasatinib binds to Abl with less stringent conformational requirements than imatinib so it exhibits increased potency but reduced selectivity compared to imatinib. Dasatinib binds both the active and inactive conformation of Abl kinase, contrary to the binding of most other TKIs to the active form only. Compounds that target the active conformation have been identified but the binding site in all the hundreds of human protein kinases is very similar. Therefore, there is a considerably greater scope for dissimilarities between the inactive conformations so the efforts to discover highly selective kinase inhibitors are being directed towards molecules that bind to the inactive conformation. Dasatinib has some structural elements in common with nilotinib, in particular the juxtaposition of the aminopyrimidine and the carboxamide groups. The aminothiazole segment of dasatinib makes a bi-dentate H-bonding interaction with the backbone CO and NH of Met-318 and the amide-NH makes an H-bond with the side chain oxygen of Thr-315. ==== Resistance ==== Since dasatinib is an inhibitor of Src family kinases, it can overcome resistance due to Src family kinase activation. Because it does not bind to Bcr-Abl with the same stringent conformational requirements as imatinib, it can inhibit all Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutants except for T315I. Dasatinib is also not a substrate of multidrug P-glycoprotein efflux pumps like imatinib. Because of this dasatinib may be active in some patients after failure with both imatinib and nilotinib. Although dasatinib is much more potent than imatinib it is possible, like with nilotinib, that its specific mode of binding to Abl may lead to new vulnerable sites that could confer new kinds of drug resistance. Mutations have been found on Phe317 so that is a potential vulnerable site for this drug. === Bosutinib (SKI-606) === ==== Development ==== Bosutinib's structure is based on a quinoline scaffold and is structurally related to the AstraZeneca quinazoline template. Src kinase dependent yeast screening led to characterization of a 4-anilino-3-quinolinecarbonitrile as an Src inhibitor. Combination of the features of this hit and a related compound, and attachment of solubilizing groups, led to the discovery of bosutinib. It was suggested to be an Abl kinase inhibitor and when tested as such it turned out to be slightly more potent against Abl than Src (IC50 1,4 nM vs. 3,5 nM). Bosutinib's activity was first described in 2001 and it was disclosed as an Abl kinase inhibitor in 2003. At first it was believed that bosutinib was a selective Src kinase inhibitor but now it is known that its kinase inhibition profile is far less restricted than originally thought. Bosutinib inhibits Src, Abl and a wide range of both tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. ==== Resistance ==== Bosutinib inhibited cells expressing a variety of mutations, some of which led to imatinib resistance, but the T315 mutation was completely resistant to bosutinib. In contrast to imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib, bosutinib is not an efficient substrate for multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters that promotes efflux of foreign molecules from cells. Bosutinib even inhibits these transporter proteins in higher concentrations. === Ponatinib (AP24534) === ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced on September 10, 2010 that ponatinib, an orally active Bcr-Abl TKI effective against the T315I mutation had been approved for a phase II clinical trial. The road to discovery can be linked to AP23464, one of the first of Ariad's ATP competitive dual Src/Abl inhibitors. AP23464 was identified using structure base drug design and focused synthetic libraries of trisubstituted purine analogs. The substance potently inhibits, on nanomolar scale, Src and Bcr-Abl kinases including many common imatinib resistant Bcr-Abl mutations. AP23464 does not inhibit the T315I mutation, however, whereas AP24534 (ponatinib) does. ==== Development ==== Ariad used the highly potent drug lead, AP23464 to further investigate inhibitory possibilities of purine cored templates for dual Src/Abl inhibitors. First, searching for substances effective on the inactive conformation of Abl, the side chain bound to the nitrogen on the purine core was replaced with a diarylamide structure, that was known to have a high affinity to the inactive conformation by forming crucial hydrogen bonds and filling hydrophobic pockets on the kinase. Furthermore, it was determined that the cyclopentyl group on the purine core clashed with a glycine rich P-loop in that confirmation and was thus removed from the molecule. Then with in-vitro testing on inhibitory activity and in-vivo oral absorption assays a more lipophilic, amide bound, cyclopropyl group on C6 on the purine core was found to display both satisfactory pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Finally modifications on the diarylamide side chain by adding imidazole appendages were inspired by then newly released nilotinib structure. Those modifications resulted in what was called AP24163. During this development cycle, Ariad tested several substances against cells transfected with T315I mutated Bcr-Abl kinase and, surprisingly, found AP24163 demonstrated reasonable inhibitory action on top of potent inhibition of native Bcr-Abl. Following up on that breakthrough Ariad began further research to increase the efficacy of compound AP24163 against the T315I mutation. Docking of the molecule into the ATP binding site of T315I mutated Bcr-Abl kinase revealed that the expected steric clash with isoleucine was not present due to a lesser sterically demanding vinyl linkage between the purine core and the diarylamide side chain compared to other TKIs. The first step was to try to find an even less sterically demanding structure. First an acetylene linkage was tested, that resulted in higher potency but unfavorable pharmacokinetics. Later, a more stable 2-butyne linkage was selected. To achieve this linkage an imidazol[1,2-a]pyridine core was used as a starting material for a Sonogashira reaction; but the pharmacokinetics were still poor. When developing AP24163, adding a cyclopropane side chain on C8 in the purine core resulted in favorable pharmacokinetics. Several different side chains were then tested, but the best results were obtained with no side chain at all, resulting a substance with satisfactory pharmacokinetics, but now with reduced potency against T315I also. The first step in increasing the potency again was to look at other TKI's. Imatinib has a terminal methyl piperazine group which has been shown to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of residue Ile-360 in the activation loop of the Abl kinase. The piperazine ring is also a common solubilizing group that could further improve the pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule. Those speculations were confirmed with a two-fold increase in inhibitory action against Bcr-Abl T315I mutated kinase and the silver lining was the plasma protein binding of the substance (named '19a') appeared to have decreased, allowing for smaller doses with the same potency. Whilst '19a' exhibited good oral pharmacokinetics in both mice and rats, it also retained high partition coefficient at 6.69. So, in attempts to reduce the molecule's lipophilicity further, substitution of a single carbon atom on the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine core was made; which resulted in what is now known as the compound ponatinib. ==== Binding ==== X-ray crystallographic analysis of ponatinib and T315I Bcr-Abl mutated kinase display that the imidazo[1,2b]pyridazine core rests in the adenine pocket of the enzyme. The methylphenyl group occupies a hydrophobic pocket behind I315, the ethynyl linkage forms favorable van der Waals interactions with the amino acid and the trifluoromethyl group binds to a pocket induced by the inactive conformation kinase. Also in the conformation of the kinase that ponatinib rests in, additional favorable van der Waals interactions between the drug and Tyr-253 and Phe-382. Five hydrogen bonds are generated, with the backbone of Met-318 in the hinge region, with the backbone of Asp-381, with the side chain of Glu-286 and the protonated methylpiperazine with the backbone-carbonyl atoms of Ile-360 and His-361. With this structure ponatinib has been shown to have a relatively broad kinase specificity profile which can probably be linked to the linearity of the linkage section of the molecule. With this linear structure the drug appears to avoid steric clashes with hydrophobic TK gatekeeper residues. Despite, or even because of this, ponatinib is a potent drug and targets not just most of the known mutations on the Bcr-Abl TK but, most importantly of all, T315I. This mutation is emerging as a common pathway to failure of both first and second line treatments. Unlike other T315I targeting inhibitors in development, ponatinib does not target Aurora kinases, which clearly distinguishes it from them and emphasizes the significance of its discovery. === Bafetinib (INNO-406) === With the emerging resistance to imatinib treatment after its launch alternative treatment was highly sought after. Bafetinib was the offspring of an attempt to create a more potent drug than imatinib, with efficacy against various point mutations in the Bcr-Abl kinase, with fewer adverse effects and with narrower kinase spectra, namely just Lyn and Bcr-Abl. ==== Development ==== In the search for a substance that fit the criteria mentioned, the crystal structure of imatinib bound to Abl was examined. This revealed a hydrophobic pocket around the phenyl ring adjacent to the piperazinylmethyl group of imatinib. Attempts to utilize this pocket to increase efficacy led to the addition of various hydrophobic groups including single fluoro, bromo and chloro substituents. Finally a trifluoromethyl group at position 3 was found to give the best results, with approximately 36-fold improvement over imatinib. The addition of a hydrophobic group now needed to be countered to sustain the solubility of the substance. Closer examination of the crystal structure of imatinib-kinase complex revealed Tyr-236 was in close proximity to the pyridine ring of imatinib, suggesting there was little or no room for a larger group there. With that in mind a more hydrophilic pyrimidine ring was substituted for the pyridine, which was found to increase solubility while leaving efficacy the same or even slightly greater. Finally to improve the hydrogen bonding of the piperazine ring of imatinib with Ile-360 and His-361, pyrrolidine and azetidine derivatives were introduced. The most promising substance from these final modifications was labeled NS-187. ==== Binding ==== Due to the structural similarities of imatinib and bafetinib, their binding to Bcr-Abl is also quite similar. The only notable difference comes from the hydrophobic interaction between the trifluoromethyl group and the hydrophobic pocket created by Ile-293, Leu-298, Leu-354, and Val-379. This group can also be linked to bafetinib's specificity for Lyn, as the binding site there is almost identical to that on Bcr-Abl. Bafetinib has its place in TKI therapy as it is effective both against most imatinib resistant mutations (not including T315I) and some dasatinib resistant mutations. Bafetinib also has more affinity for Bcr-Abl than nilotinib (but less than dasatinib) but only targets Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases Lck and Lyn; with unrivalled specificity which suggests the probability of fewer adverse effects. CytRx has bafetinib in phase II clinical trial as a treatment for leukemia as of May 2010. === 1,3,4 thiadiazole derivatives - Substance 14 === Some interest has been with thiazol and thiadiazole derivatives and their ability to inhibit Bcr-Abl TKs. ==== Development ==== One Italian research group discovered through digital screening that commercially available thiadiazole derivatives displayed moderate inhibitory action on both Abl and Src kinases. Using a 1,3,4 thiadiazol core and trying different groups or molecules on the benzene rings, several different substances with inhibitory properties were produced. The flexibility of the core allowed a number of conformations of the substances to bind to the ATP site of the Abl kinase, though all of them bound to the kinase's active form. Further study of the binding showed that the position of the sulfur that binds to the toluene structure played an important role in regard to Abl binding and also that only one of the nitrogen's one thiadiazole formed a hydrogen bond. Furthermore, computer analysis of the structure showed the amide connected benzene-ketone could be substituted for a more favorable thiophene ring. Though this analysis was done with comparing the crystal structure of Abl and dasatinib, which is the inactive conformation of Abl, the knowledge gathered from the docking and structure analysis led to identification of a compound, referred to as substance 14, with a high affinity to Abl. ==== Binding ==== The binding of substance 14 is partly similar to dasatinib, the aminothiazole segment of substance 14 makes a bi-dentate H-bonding interaction with the backbone CO and NH of Met-318 while the methoxy-benzene falls nicely into a hydrophobic pocket created by Val 256, Ala 253, Lys 271 and Ala 380. Whilst the similar binding properties to those of dasatinib, suggests the possibility of producing Bcr-Abl TKI's from thiazole cores is real, the question remains open whether this research will just lead to a dasatinib analog or a novel way to inhibit TKs. === Others === Rebastinib (DCC-2036) Also an inhibitor of TIE-2 and VEGFR-2. It has had a phase 1 clinical trial for Leukemias (Ph+ CML With T315I Mutation). It is in a phase 1 clinical trial of combination therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Asciminib (ABL001) is an inhibitor of the Abelson kinase targeting the myristoyl pocket to allosterically inhibit the enzyme. As of August 2020, it had completed a phase III study in CML (ASCEMBL) showing superior efficacy to bosutinib. == Summary == == Current status - re Ph+ CML == Imatinib remains a standard frontline TKI. Nilotinib and dasatinib are also approved by the FDA as frontline drugs, in June and October 2010, respectively. Four of these drugs, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib are approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML. The first-line data for these compounds are encouraging and suggest that some or all of them may replace imatinib as a frontline standard TKI in the future. == References ==",Rebastinib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.264322317088954e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.003491498064249754), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014199061319231987)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([annalsofoncology.org](https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534%2821%2903400-1/fulltext?utm_source=openai), [annalsofoncology.org](https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534%2820%2940668-4/fulltext?utm_source=openai), [haematologica.org](https://haematologica.org/article/view/8003?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=328, start_index=6, title='728P A phase Ib/II study of rebastinib and paclitaxel in advanced/metastatic platinum-resistant ovarian cancer - Annals of Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534%2821%2903400-1/fulltext?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=328, start_index=6, title='558P A phase I study of rebastinib and carboplatin in patients with metastatic solid tumours - Annals of Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534%2820%2940668-4/fulltext?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=328, start_index=6, title='Phase 1 dose-finding study of rebastinib (DCC-2036) in patients with relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia | Haematologica', type='url_citation', url='https://haematologica.org/article/view/8003?utm_source=openai')])"

E7820 targets RBM39, affecting RNA splicing and angiogenesis by suppressing integrin α2. Phase I studies have demonstrated some stability in advanced solid malignancies; however, further efficacy studies are required. Indisulam causes G1 cell cycle arrest and delays the G1/S transition by modulating splicing through RBM39 degradation via DCAF15. Despite its limited initial efficacy, it shows promise in combination therapies, particularly for hematopoietic malignancies and gliomas. Tasisulam inhibits VEGF signaling, suppresses angiogenesis, and induces apoptosis. Although early trials indicated broad activity, safety concerns have halted its development. Chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide, initially investigated for cell cycle arrest and topoisomerase II inhibition, was discontinued owing to its limited efficacy and toxicity, despite promising initial results. Recent studies revealed the structural interaction of E7820 with DCAF15 and RBM39, although phase II trials on myeloid malignancies have shown limited efficacy. Indisulam is effective against glioblastoma and neuroblastoma, with potential synergy in combination therapies and metabolic disruption. Recent research on tasisulam reveals its potential in cancer therapy by targeting RBM39 degradation through DCAF15-mediated pathways. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to new treatments that affect alternative splicing and improve cancer therapies Overall, although these drugs exhibit promising mechanisms of action, further research is required to optimize their clinical efficacy and safety. LY573636-sodium (tasisulam) is a small molecule antitumor agent with a novel mechanism of action currently being investigated in a variety of human cancers. In vitro, tasisulam induced apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway, resulting in cytochrome c release and caspase-dependent cell death. Using high content cellular imaging and subpopulation analysis of a wide range of in vitro and in vivo cancer models, tasisulam increased the proportion of cells with 4N DNA content and phospho-histone H3 expression, leading to G(2)-M accumulation and subsequent apoptosis. Tasisulam also blocked VEGF, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor-induced endothelial cell cord formation but did not block acute growth factor receptor signaling (unlike sunitinib, which blocks VEGF-driven angiogenesis at the receptor kinase level) or induce apoptosis in primary endothelial cells. Importantly, in vivo phenocopying of in vitro effects were observed in multiple human tumor xenografts. Tasisulam was as effective as sunitinib at inhibiting neovascularization in a Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in vivo and also caused reversible, non G(2)-M-dependent growth arrest in primary endothelial cells. Tasisulam also induced vascular normalization in vivo. Interestingly, the combination of tasisulam and sunitinib significantly delayed growth of the Caki-1 renal cell carcinoma model, whereas neither agent was active alone. These data show that tasisulam has a unique, dual-faceted mechanism of action involving mitotic catastrophe and antiangiogenesis, a phenotype distinct from conventional chemotherapies and published anticancer agents. Tasisulam sodium (hereafter referred to as tasisulam) is a novel, highly albumin-bound agent that demonstrated activity in a phase 2 melanoma study. In this open-label phase 3 study, patients with AJCC stage IV melanoma received tasisulam (targeting an albumin-corrected exposure of 1200-6400 h (hour).μg/mL on day 1) or paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15) every 28 days as second-line treatment. The study was placed on clinical hold after randomization of 336 patients when a safety review indicated an imbalance of possibly drug-related deaths in the tasisulam arm. Efficacy results for tasisulam versus paclitaxel revealed a response rate of 3.0% versus 4.8%, a median progression-free survival of 1.94 months versus 2.14 months (P = .048), and a median overall survival of 6.77 months versus 9.36 months (P = .121). The most common drug-related grade ≥3 laboratory toxicities (graded according to Common Terminology for Adverse Events [version 3.0]) were thrombocytopenia (18.9%) for patients treated with tasisulam and neutropenia/leukopenia (8.7%) among those receiving paclitaxel. There were 13 possibly related deaths reported to occur on the study, with the majority occurring during cycle 2 in the setting of grade 4 myelosuppression, all in the tasisulam arm. Investigation of the unexpectedly high rate of hematologic toxicity revealed a subset of patients with low tasisulam clearance, leading to drug accumulation and high albumin-corrected exposure in cycle 2. Although the study was stopped early because of safety issues in the tasisulam arm, tasisulam was considered unlikely to be superior to paclitaxel, and paclitaxel activity in the second-line treatment of melanoma was much lower than expected. The toxicity imbalance was attributed to an unexpectedly low tasisulam clearance in a subset of patients, underscoring the importance of pharmacokinetic monitoring of compounds with complex dosing, even in late-phase studies.",Tasisulam,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010914575977949426), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0024857595562934875), ('ICAL', -3.933898824470816e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12695303559303284)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39271535/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21456002/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24676877/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=270, start_index=6, title='Recent advances in anticancer mechanisms of molecular glue degraders: focus on RBM39-dgrading synthetic sulfonamide such as indisulam, E7820, tasisulam, and chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39271535/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=270, start_index=6, title='A phase 2 study of tasisulam sodium (LY573636 sodium) as second-line treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21456002/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=270, start_index=6, title='A randomized, open-label clinical trial of tasisulam sodium versus paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients with metastatic melanoma', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24676877/?utm_source=openai')])"

It has a high potential for drug interactions. Enzalutamide is an antiandrogen, and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In doing so, it prevents the effects of these hormones in the prostate gland and elsewhere in the body. Enzalutamide was first described in 2006, and was introduced for the treatment of prostate cancer in 2012. It was the first second-generation NSAA to be introduced. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Enzalutamide is indicated for the treatment of people with castration-resistant prostate cancer; metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer; and non‑metastatic castration‑sensitive prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence at high risk for metastasis. === Prostate cancer === There is good evidence that enzalutamide is an effective treatment for increasing overall survival among people with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, particularly those with a PSA doubling time ≤ 6 months. === Other uses === Enzalutamide can be used as an antiandrogen in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. === Available forms === Enzalutamide is provided as a capsule or tablet. == Contraindications == Enzalutamide is contraindicated in women during pregnancy. It may cause fetal harm. == Side effects == Notable side effects of enzalutamide seen in clinical trials have included gynecomastia, breast pain/tenderness, fatigue, diarrhea, hot flashes, headache, sexual dysfunction, and, less commonly, seizures. Other ""common"" side effects reported in clinical trials have included neutropenia, visual hallucinations, anxiety, cognitive disorder, memory impairment, hypertension, dry skin, and pruritus (itching). Enzalutamide monotherapy is regarded as having a moderate negative effect on sexual function and activity, significantly less than that of GnRH analogues but similar to that of other NSAAs such as bicalutamide. === Central adverse effects === Seizures have occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated with enzalutamide in clinical trials. This is thought to be due to enzalutamide crossing the blood–brain barrier and exerting off-target binding to and inhibition of the GABAA receptor in the central nervous system (it has been found to inhibit the GABAA receptor in vitro (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 3.6 μM) and induces convulsions in animals at high doses). In addition to seizures, other potentially GABAA receptor-related side effects observed with enzalutamide treatment in clinical trials have included anxiety, insomnia, vertigo, paresthesia, and headache. Due to its ability to lower the seizure threshold, patients with known seizure disorders or brain injury should be closely monitored during enzalutamide treatment. NSAA-induced seizures are responsive to benzodiazepine treatment, and it has been suggested that GABAA receptor inhibition by enzalutamide could be treated with these drugs. In dose-ranging studies, severe fatigue was observed with enzalutamide at doses of 240 mg/day and above. === Rare adverse reactions === There is a single case report of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) with enzalutamide treatment. The mechanism of action of the side effect is unknown, but it was proposed to a consequence of inhibition of the GABAA receptor by enzalutamide. == Overdose == Enzalutamide may cause seizures in overdose. == Interactions == Enzalutamide is a moderate to strong inducer of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 and hence has a high potential for clinically relevant drug interactions. Circulating concentrations of enzalutamide may be altered by inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and should be avoided if possible. In a clinical study of enzalutamide for ERTooltip estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in women, enzalutamide was found to decrease serum concentrations of the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and exemestane by 90% and 50%, respectively, which could reduce their effectiveness. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Enzalutamide acts as a selective silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Unlike the first-generation NSAA bicalutamide, enzalutamide does not promote translocation of AR to the cell nucleus and in addition prevents binding of AR to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and AR to coactivator proteins. As such, it has been described as an AR signaling inhibitor in addition to antagonist. The drug is described as a ""second-generation"" NSAA because it has greatly increased efficacy as an antiandrogen relative to so-called ""first-generation"" NSAAs like flutamide and bicalutamide. The drug has only 2-fold lower affinity for the AR than DHT, the endogenous ligand of the AR in the prostate gland. When LNCaP cells (a prostate cancer cell line) engineered to express elevated levels of AR (as found in patients with advanced prostate cancer) were treated with enzalutamide, the expression of androgen-dependent genes PSA and TMPRSS2 was down regulated in contrast to bicalutamide where the expression was upregulated. In VCaP cells which over-express the AR, enzalutamide induced apoptosis whereas bicalutamide did not. Furthermore, enzalutamide behaves as an antagonist of the W741C mutant AR in contrast to bicalutamide which behaves as a pure agonist when bound to the W741C mutant. Dose-ranging studies of enzalutamide in men with prostate cancer have been performed. ==== Changes in hormone levels ==== Enzalutamide monotherapy at a dosage of 160 mg/day has been found to increase circulating levels of testosterone by 114.3%, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 51.7%, estradiol by 71.7%, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) by 100.6%, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by 9.6%, androstenedione by 51.1%, luteinizing hormone (LH) by 184.7%, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by 47.0%, and prolactin by 16.8%. These changes in hormone levels are similar to those with high-dose bicalutamide monotherapy. The median maximum decrease in levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels was 99.6%. ==== Comparison with other antiandrogens ==== Enzalutamide has approximately 8-fold higher binding affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) compared to bicalutamide. One study found an IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 21 nM for enzalutamide and 160 nM for bicalutamide at the AR in the LNCaP cell line (7.6-fold difference), while another found respective IC50 values of 36 nM and 159 nM (4.4-fold difference). In accordance, clinical findings suggest that enzalutamide is a significantly more potent and effective antiandrogen in comparison to first-generation NSAAs such as bicalutamide, flutamide, and nilutamide. Also, unlike with the first-generation NSAAs, there has been no evidence of hepatotoxicity or elevated liver enzymes in association with enzalutamide treatment in clinical trials. ==== Resistance mechanisms in prostate cancer ==== Enzalutamide is only effective for a certain period of time, after that the growth of the cancer is not inhibited by this antiandrogen. The mechanisms of resistance to Enzalutamide are being intensively studied. Currently, several mechanisms have been found: AR mutations AR splice variants Glucocorticoid receptor bypass Increase in flux of glycolysis Autophagy mediated resistance Wnt signaling activation Increase in intra-tumoral androgen biosynthesis mediated by AKR1C3 enzyme Interleukin 6 signaling mediated resistance ==== Cytochrome P450 modulation ==== Enzalutamide is reported to be a strong inducer of the enzyme CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and can affect the circulating concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of enzalutamide in humans is unknown, but is at least 84.6% based on the amount recovered from urine and bile in excretion studies. Similarly, the bioavailability of enzalutamide in rats is 89.7%. Steady-state concentrations of enzalutamide are achieved within 28 days of treatment initiation. The plasma protein binding of enzalutamide is 97 to 98%, while that of N-desmethylenzalutamide (NDME), its major metabolite, is 95%. Enzalutamide is primarily bound to albumin. The medication is metabolized in the liver, mainly by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the formation of NDME. Enzalutamide has a long elimination half-life of 5.8 days on average, with a range of 2.8 to 10.2 days. The elimination half-life of NDME is even longer, at about 7.8 to 8.6 days. Enzalutamide is eliminated 71.0% in urine, 13.6% in bile, and 0.39% in feces. == Chemistry == Enzalutamide is a synthetic diaryl thiohydantoin derivative and is structurally related to the earlier first-generation NSAAs such as flutamide, nilutamide, and bicalutamide as well as to newer second-generation NSAAs like apalutamide and proxalutamide. == History == Enzalutamide was discovered by Charles Sawyers and Michael Jung at the University of California, Los Angeles. They and their colleagues synthesized and evaluated nearly 200 thiohydantoin derivatives of RU-59063, an analogue of nilutamide, for AR antagonism in human prostate cancer cells, and identified enzalutamide and RD-162 as lead compounds. These compounds were patented in 2006 and described in 2007. Enzalutamide was developed and marketed by Medivation for the treatment of prostate cancer. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mCRPC in the United States in August 2012, and for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in July 2018. Enzalutamide was the first new AR antagonist to be approved for the treatment of prostate cancer in over 15 years, following the introduction of the first-generation NSAA bicalutamide in 1995. It was the first second-generation NSAA to be introduced. In July 2018, the FDA approved enzalutamide for the treatment of people with castration-resistant prostate cancer. The approval broadens the indication to include people with both non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Enzalutamide was previously approved for the treatment of people with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In December 2019, the FDA approved enzalutamide for the treatment of people with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). Enzalutamide was previously approved for the treatment of people with castration-resistant prostate cancer. In June 2023, the FDA approved talazoparib, in combination with enzalutamide, for the treatment of people with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In November 2023, the FDA approved enzalutamide for the treatment of people with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence at high risk for metastasis (high-risk BCR). Efficacy was evaluated in EMBARK (NCT02319837), a randomized, controlled clinical trial of 1068 patients with nmCSPC with high-risk BCR. All patients had prior definitive therapy with radical prostatectomy and/or radiotherapy with curative intent, had PSA doubling time ≤ 9 months, and were not candidates for salvage radiotherapy at enrollment. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive blinded enzalutamide 160 mg once daily plus leuprolide, open-label single- agent enzalutamide 160 mg once daily, or blinded placebo once daily plus leuprolide. The application was granted priority review and fast track designations. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In June 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Enzalutamide Viatris, intended for the treatment of prostate cancer. The applicant for this medicinal product is Viatris Limited. Enzalutamide Viatris is a generic of Xtandi. === Economics === Pfizer reported revenue of US$1.191 billion for Xtandi in 2023. == Research == === Breast cancer === Research suggests that enzalutamide may be effective in the treatment of certain types of breast cancer in women. It has been tested for the treatment of triple-negative, AR-positive breast cancer in a phase II clinical trial. === Hirsutism === Enzalutamide has been suggested as a potential treatment for hirsutism and hyperandrogenism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. == References ==",Enzalutamide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.483612312673358e-06), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -9.738924563862383e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;  ', [])"

945,"('Flumethasone', 'Flumetasone', 'Aniprime', 'Flucorticin', 'Flumethason')",Medical,"Flumetasone, also known as flumethasone, is a corticosteroid for topical use. It has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties, and it is approved for human and animal use for a variety of medical conditions. It was patented in 1951 and approved for medical use in 1964. == Chemistry and mechanism of action == Flumetasone is classified as a moderately potent corticosteroid and a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. Like other corticosteroids, it functions as an immunosuppressant by decreasing function of the lymphatic system, reducing immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, lowering lymphocyte concentrations, and preventing antigen-antibody binding. Flumethasone is 420 times as potent as cortisone in an animal model for anti-inflammatory activity. == Society and culture == === Names === Trade names include Locacorten, Locorten, and Orsalin. It is available in combination with clioquinol, under the brand name Locacorten-Vioform (in some countries Locorten-Vioform), for the treatment of otitis externa and otomycosis. It is usually formulated as the pivalic acid ester prodrug called flumetasone pivalate. == Veterinary uses == In April 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic version of flumethasone (Bimasone), for certain diseases that cause inflammation in horses, dogs, and cats. Flumetasone is recommended for the various rheumatic, allergic, dermatologic and other disease states that are known to be responsive to anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e., corticoids) in these species. In horses, flumetasone is approved for use for musculoskeletal conditions due to inflammation, such as bursitis (a painful condition that affects the fluid-filled sacs that cushion the bones, tendons and muscles near a horse's joints, often in the hip or shoulder), carpitis (inflammation of the connective tissues near the horse's carpus, which is comparable to the human wrist), osselets (arthritis in the fetlock joint of a horse, often in the front legs), and myositis (rapid muscle wasting, often in the horse's hindquarters). In dogs, Bimasone is approved for use for musculoskeletal conditions due to inflammation of muscles or joints, such as arthritis, osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc disease, and myositis. The drug has proven useful in treating canine ear infections (otitis externa) when used with topical medication for similar reasons. It is also approved for certain acute and chronic skin conditions (dermatoses) from various causes to help control the itchy skin (pruritus), irritation, and inflammation associated with these conditions, and for use in treating allergic reactions, such as hives, urticaria (raised itchy rash on skin), and insect bites. Flumetasone is also approved for treating shock in dogs, when administered intravenously. In cats, flumetasone is approved for certain acute and chronic skin conditions (dermatoses) from various causes to help control the itchy skin (pruritus), irritation, and inflammation associated with these conditions. == References ==",Flumetasone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.6756979322235566e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008622557856142521)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumetasone,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00663,https://www.midas-pharma.com/en/products/drug-substances/flumetasone/ ', [])"

It is used to treat two forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH): chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Riociguat constitutes the first drug of the class of sGC stimulators. The drug has a half-life of 12 hours and will decrease dyspnea associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is available as a generic medication. == Contraindications == Riociguat can cause fetal harm and is therefore contraindicated in pregnant women. The substance is also contraindicated in pulmonary hypertension in combination with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (PH-IIP). A clinical trial testing riociguat for this purpose was prematurely terminated because it increased severe adverse effects and mortality in patients with pulmonary hypertension caused by idiopathic interstitial pneumonia when compared to placebo. == Adverse effects == Serious adverse effects in clinical trials included bleeding. Hypotension (low blood pressure), headache, and gastrointestinal disorders also occurred. == Interactions == Nitrates and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (including PDE5 inhibitors) increase the hypotensive (blood pressure lowering) effect of riociguat. Combining such drugs is therefore contraindicated. Riociguat levels in the blood are reduced by tobacco smoking and strong inducers of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and increased by strong cytochrome inhibitors. == Chemistry and mechanism of action == In healthy individuals, nitric oxide (NO) acts as a signaling molecule on vascular smooth muscle cells to induce vasodilation. NO binds to soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and mediates the synthesis of the secondary messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). sGC forms heterodimers consisting of a larger alpha-subunit and a smaller haem-binding beta-subunit. The synthesised cGMP acts as a secondary messenger and activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G) to regulate cytosolic calcium ion concentration. This changes the actin–myosin contractility, which results in vasodilation. NO is produced by the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS). In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension eNOS levels are reduced. This results in overall lower levels of endothelial cell-derived NO and reduced vasodilation of smooth muscle cells. NO also reduces pulmonary smooth muscle cell growth and antagonises platelet inhibition, factors which play a key role in the pathogenesis of PAH. In contrast to NO- and haem-independent sGC activators like cinaciguat, the sGC stimulator riociguat directly stimulates sGC activity independent of NO and also acts in synergy with NO to produce anti-aggregatory, anti-proliferative, and vasodilatory effects. == Pharmacology == Riociguat at concentration between 0.1 and 100 μM stimulates in a dose-dependent manner sGC activity up to 73-fold. In addition, it acts synergistically with diethylamine/NO, the donor of NO, to increase sGC activity in vitro up to 112-fold. A phase I study showed that riociguat is rapidly absorbed, and maximum plasma concentration is reached between 0.5 and 1.5 h. The mean elimination half-life appears to be 5–10 hours. Riociguat plasma concentrations have been also shown to be quite variable between patients, indicating that for clinical use it is probably necessary to titrate the drug specifically for each individual. == History == === Discovery === The first nitric oxide (NO) independent, haem-dependent sGC stimulator, YC-1, a synthetic benzylindazole derivative, was described in 1978. The characterisation 20 years later demonstrated that as well as increasing sGC activity, YC-1 acted in synergy with NO to stimulate sGC. However, YC-1 was a relatively weak vasodilator and had side effects. Therefore, the search began for novel indazole compounds that were more potent and more specific sGC stimulators. The result was the identification of BAY 41-2272 and BAY 41–8543. Both compounds were tested in various preclinical studies on different animal models and appeared to improve systemic arterial oxygenation. To improve the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic profile an additional 1000 compounds were screened leading to the discovery of riociguat. Riociguat was tested in mouse and rat disease models, where it effectively reduced pulmonary hypertension and reversed the associated right heart hypertrophy and ventricular remodelling. Several clinical trials have been undertaken to investigate and evaluate diverse aspects of riociguat, and some of them are still ongoing. === Phase I clinical trials === One of the first studies was designed to test the safety profile, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single oral doses of riociguat (0.25–5 mg). 58 healthy male subjects were given riociguat orally (oral solution or immediate-release tablet) in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Doses of riociguat were increased stepwise, and riociguat was well tolerated up to 2.5 mg. === Phase II clinical trials === A proof-of-concept study, reported by the University of Gießen Lung Center, was the first small study (in 4 PAH patients) to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy parameters. The drug was well tolerated and superior to NO in efficacy and duration. An open-label, non-controlled phase II trial of riociguat in 75 adult patients (42 with CTEPH and 33 with PAH, all in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class II or III) evaluated the safety and tolerability, and the effects on hemodynamics, exercise capacity and functional class. Riociguat was given three times daily for 12 weeks. Doses were titrated at 2-week intervals from 1.0 mg three times daily to a maximum of 2.5 mg three times daily. Riociguat had a favourable safety profile, and also significantly improved exercise capacity and hemodynamic parameters such as pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac output and pulmonary arterial pressure compared to baseline values. In addition, a phase II study of riociguat is underway in patients with other forms of PH such as associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD). === Phase III clinical trials === The phase III trials on riociguat are multi-center studies. The study program included large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trial phase (CHEST-1 and PATENT-1), and open-label extensions of these studies (CHEST-2 and PATENT-2). Details of these studies are reported on ClinicalTrials.gov, a register of studies maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). ==== CHEST ==== The Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension sGC-Stimulator Trial (CHEST) was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of riociguat in CTEPH patients. After a 16-week riociguat treatment the patient's exercise capacity were evaluated by measuring the change in the six-minute walk test (6-MWT). Patients having completed CHEST-1 were invited to enter the extension trial, CHEST-2. The first interim analysis of CHEST-2 showed that riociguat was well tolerated, with a good long-term safety profile in patients with CTEPH. ==== PATENT ==== The Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension sGC-Stimulator Trial (PATENT) was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that investigated the efficacy and safety of riociguat in PAH patients. After a 12-week treatment the patient's exercise capacity was evaluated by measuring the change in the 6-MWT. Patients having completed PATENT-1 were invited to enter the extension trial, PATENT-2. The first interim analysis of PATENT-2 showed that at one year, long-term riociguat was well tolerated in patients with PAH and showed sustained benefits in 6MWD and WHO FC. The safety profile of riociguat in PATENT-2 was similar to that observed in PATENT-1. === Other studies === ==== Effect of riociguat on bone metabolism ==== This randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase I study investigated the effect of riociguat, administered as 2.5 mg immediate-release (IR)-tablets twice daily over 14 days, on the bone metabolism. Effects on bone formation had been seen in growing, juvenile and adolescent rats. In juvenile rats, the changes consisted of thickening of trabecular bone and hyperostosis and remodeling of metaphyseal and diaphyseal bone, whereas in adolescent rats an overall increase of bone mass was observed. On the other hand, no such effects were observed in adult rats. ==== Interaction study with sildenafil ==== This study investigated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and the impact on pulmonary and systemic haemodynamics of single doses of 0.5 and 1 mg of riociguat in patients with PAH and stable treatment of sildenafil (20 mg thrice daily) in a non-randomized uncontrolled trial. The study showed potentially unfavorable safety signals with sildenafil plus riociguat and no evidence of a positive benefit/risk ratio. Therefore, the concomitant use of riociguat with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors is contraindicated. == References ==",Adempas,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007164295529946685)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/adempas.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Adempas: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/adempas.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that works by blocking the action of enzymes called Janus kinases. These enzymes are involved in setting up processes that lead to inflammation, and blocking their effect brings inflammation in the joints under control. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), nausea, cough, and fever. Upadacitinib was approved for medical use in both the United States and the European Union in 2019. == Medical uses == Upadacitinib is indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and axial spondyloarthritis. Upadacitinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Upadacitinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. Upadacitinib was approved in January 2022, by the FDA for treating adults and children twelve years of age and older with moderate to severe treatment refractory atopic dermatitis. Upadacitinib was approved in March 2022, by the FDA for treating adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who did not respond to treatment with anti-TNF drugs (e.g. infliximab). Upadacitinib was approved in February 2023, by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to treat adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In April 2023, upadacitinib was approved in the EU for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adults. In May 2023, the FDA approved upadacitinib for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers. == Contraindications == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a boxed warning for tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib to include information about the risks of serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and death. The drug is contraindicated in people with active tuberculosis and other severe infections, severe liver impairment (Child–Pugh score C), and during pregnancy. == Interactions == Substances that strongly inhibit the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or clarithromycin, increase upadacitinib concentrations in the body. In a study, ketoconazole increased its AUC by 75%. Conversely, substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 lower upadacitinib concentrations. For example, rifampicin reduced the AUC by 60% in a study. Upadacitinib seems to be a weak inducer of CYP3A4, as it lowers concentrations of other substrates of this enzyme (such as the midazolam AUC by 26%). It has no effect on substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6. == Side effects == Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections such as common cold and sinus infections, nausea, cough, and fever. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases whose function is to transduce cytokine-mediated signals via the JAK-STAT pathway. There are four JAK subtypes, each of which has overlapping receptor responsibilities. Inhibitors of this enzyme family (jakinibs) have shown efficacy in treating certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. However, the first generation of these drugs, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, lacked subtype selectivity, affecting JAK1/JAK3 and JAK1/JAK2 respectively. This has led to dose-limiting side effects in this otherwise promising class of drugs. Upadacitinib is a second generation Janus kinase inhibitor that is selective for the JAK1 subtype of this enzyme over the JAK2 (74-fold), JAK3 (58-fold) and tyrosine kinase 2 subtypes. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral intake, upadacitinib reaches highest concentrations in the blood plasma after two to four hours. A fatty meal has no clinically relevant effect on its resorption. Steady-state conditions are reached after four days; accumulation is minimal. There is no significant first pass effect. When in the bloodstream, 52% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. It is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, and possibly to a minor extent by CYP2D6. The most important pathway consists of oxidation to a carboxylic acid and subsequent glucuronidation, yielding a metabolite called M4. However, 79% of the drug circulates in the form of upadacitinib itself, and only 13% as M4. Other metabolites are only present in small fractions. None are pharmacologically active. The drug is excreted mainly as the original substance, of which 38% are found in the feces and 24% in the urine. The mean terminal half-life is 9 to 14 hours. == History == Upadacitinib was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2019. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved upadacitinib based on evidence from five clinical trials (Trial 1/NCT02706873, Trial 2/NCT02706951, Trial 3/NCT02675426, Trial 4/NCT02629159, Trial 5/NCT02706847) of 3,141 participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The trials were conducted in Australia, New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, Asia, North/Central/South America, and Europe. Five trials established the benefits and side effects of upadacitinib. Trials enrolled participants with moderate to severe active RA in whom disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs did not work well or could not be tolerated. All participants had at least six tender and six swollen joints, and increased levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). hsCRP is a substance produced by the body to protect itself from illness. Trials lasted up to 5 years. Trial 1 enrolled participants who had never been treated with methotrexate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of upadacitinib or methotrexate daily for 24 weeks. Neither the subject nor the healthcare providers knew which medication was being given until after this 24-week treatment period. Trial 2 enrolled participants in whom methotrexate did not work well. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of upadacitinib daily by mouth or continue their usual dose of methotrexate for 14 weeks. At week 14, participants who were assigned to methotrexate received upadacitinib by mouth daily. Neither the subject nor the healthcare providers knew which medication was being given. Trial 3 enrolled participants in whom disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs did not work well. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of upadacitinib or placebo daily by mouth in addition to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for 12 weeks. At week 12, participants who received placebo were reassigned to upadacitinib daily. Neither the subject nor the healthcare providers knew which medication was being given. Trial 4 enrolled participants in whom methotrexate did not work well. Participants were randomly assigned to receive upadacitinib or placebo daily by mouth in addition to methotrexate for 14 weeks. Participants receiving placebo who did not have adequate improvement of signs and/or symptoms could be switched to upadacitinib after week 14. At week 26, all participants receiving placebo were switched to upadacitinib once daily by mouth. Neither the subject nor the healthcare providers knew which medication was being given. Trial 5 enrolled participants in whom disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs did not work well or could not be tolerated. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of upadacitinib or placebo treatment daily added to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for 12 weeks. At week 12, participants who received placebo were reassigned to upadacitinib daily. The benefit of upadacitinib was measured by comparing the proportion of participants treated with upadacitinib who achieved an American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response at week 12 or week 14 to the proportion of participants treated with MTX or placebo who achieved an ACR20 response. ACR20 is a 20% improvement in signs and symptoms of RA. Upadacitinib was approved for medical use in the European Union in December 2019. In February 2023, upadacitinib was approved in the UK for treatment of Crohn's disease. In April 2023, upadacitinib was approved in the EU for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adults. The approval was for adults who ""had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to conventional therapy or a biological agent"". The efficacy and safety of upadacitinib were evaluated in two randomized induction trials of 857 participants with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, CD-1 (NCT03345836) and CD-2 (NCT03345849). Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive 45 mg of upadacitinib or placebo once a day for 12 weeks. At week 12, a greater proportion of participants treated with 45 mg of upadacitinib, as compared to placebo, achieved clinical remission based on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), which measures clinical and laboratory variables that estimate disease activity in Crohn's disease. Similarly, a greater proportion of participants treated with 45 mg of upadacitinib demonstrated improvement in intestinal inflammation as assessed by colonoscopy. To assess upadacitinib as a maintenance treatment, CD-3 (NCT03345823) evaluated 343 participants who responded to 12 weeks of 45 mg of upadacitinib once daily. Participants were re-randomized to receive a maintenance regimen of 15 or 30 mg of upadacitinib once daily or placebo for 52 weeks, representing a total of at least 64 weeks of therapy. At week 52, a greater proportion of participants treated with 15 mg or 30 mg of upadacitinib, as compared to placebo, achieved clinical remission based on the CDAI, and demonstrated improvement in intestinal inflammation as assessed by colonoscopy. === Clinical trials === The safety and efficacy of upadacitinib were evaluated in multiple clinical trials: Clinical trial number NCT02706873 for ""A Study to Compare Upadacitinib (ABT-494) Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) Monotherapy in Adults With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Who Have Not Previously Taken Methotrexate (SELECT-EARLY)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02706951 for ""A Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) Monotherapy in Adults With Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Who Have an Inadequate Response to MTX (SELECT-MONOTHERAPY)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02675426 for ""A Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to Placebo in Adults With Rheumatoid Arthritis on a Stable Dose of Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) Who Have an Inadequate Response to csDMARDs Alone (SELECT-NEXT)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02629159 for ""A Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to Placebo and to Adalimumab in Adults With Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Are on a Stable Dose of Methotrexate and Who Have an Inadequate Response to Methotrexate (SELECT-COMPARE)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02706847 for ""A Study to Compare Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to Placebo in Adults With Rheumatoid Arthritis on Stable Dose of Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) With an Inadequate Response or Intolerance to Biologic DMARDs (SELECT-BEYOND)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02819635 for ""A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Upadacitinib (ABT-494) for Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Participants With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis (UC)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03104400 for ""A Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to Placebo and to Adalimumab in Participants With Psoriatic Arthritis Who Have an Inadequate Response to at Least One Non-Biologic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) (SELECT - PsA 1)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03104374 for ""A Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to Placebo in Participants With Active Psoriatic Arthritis Who Have a History of Inadequate Response to at Least One Biologic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (bDMARD) (SELECT - PsA 2)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03569293 for ""Evaluation of Upadacitinib in Adolescent and Adult Patients With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) (Measure Up 1)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03607422 for ""A Study to Evaluate Upadacitinib in Adolescents and Adults With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis (Measure Up 2)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03568318 for ""A Study to Evaluate Upadacitinib in Combination With Topical Corticosteroids in Adolescent and Adult Participants With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD Up)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03653026 for ""A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib (ABT-494) in Participants With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis (U-Accomplish)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03345836 for ""A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib (ABT-494) in Participants With Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease Who Have Inadequately Responded to or Are Intolerant to Biologic Therapy"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03345849 for ""A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib in Participants With Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease Who Have Inadequately Responded to or Are Intolerant to Conventional and/or Biologic Therapies (U-EXCEL)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03345823 for ""A Maintenance and Long-Term Extension Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib (ABT-494) in Participants With Crohn's Disease Who Completed the Studies M14-431 or M14-433"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03178487 for ""A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Upadacitinib in Adults With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis (SELECT-AXIS 1)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT04169373 for ""A Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib in Adults With Axial Spondyloarthritis (SELECT-AXIS 2)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov ==== Phase I studies ==== A phase I study revealed that upadacitinib followed a bi-exponential disposition with a terminal half-life of 6–16 hours. There was no significant accumulation over the dose range of 3–36 mg per day. No interaction was found in rheumatoid arthritis participants taking methotrexate. The most common adverse event was headache but its incidence was similar to that when taking placebo (15.6% for upadacitinib vs. 16.7% for placebo). An investigation into absorption and metabolism found that dosing after a high-fat meal had no effect on upadacitinib total drug exposure over time (area under the curve or AUC). ==== Phase II studies ==== Two phase IIb studies were initiated to study the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in participants with rheumatoid arthritis and one phase II study was initiated in participants with Crohn's disease. ===== BALANCE I ===== In the first study, 276 rheumatoid arthritis participants were recruited who had previously experienced inadequate response to anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and were currently on a stable dose of methotrexate. Participants were randomized to receive 3, 6, 12, or 18 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was a 20% improvement in symptoms according to the American College of Rheumatology improvement criteria (ACR20). At the completion of the study it was found that response rates were significantly higher in those receiving upadacitinib versus in those receiving placebo alone (36–42% and 22– 26%, respectively). Adverse events included headache, nausea, and infection but no infections were serious. ===== BALANCE II ===== In the second phase IIb study, 300 rheumatoid arthritis participants were recruited who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate. Participants were randomized to receive 3, 6, 12, or 18 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was a 20% improvement in symptoms according to the American College of Rheumatology improvement criteria (ACR20). At the completion of the study it was found that response rates were significantly higher in those receiving upadacitinib versus in those receiving placebo alone. (62%, 68%, 80%, 64%, and 76% for the 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mg doses, respectively) than with placebo (46%). Improvement in symptoms was rapid, with significant changes in disease scores by week 2. Adverse events were mild with infection being the most serious. One case of community-acquired pneumonia occurred at 12 mg. ===== CELEST ===== In this 16-week study, 220 participants were recruited with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Participants must have also experienced an inadequate response to or intolerance to Immunotherapy or TNF inhibitors. Participants were randomized to therapy with upadacitinib at 3, 6, 12, 24 mg twice daily or 24 mg once daily for 16 weeks or placebo, followed by blinded extension therapy for 36 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of participants who achieved clinical remission (soft stool frequency or daily abdominal pain score) at week 16 and endoscopic remission at week 12 or 16. Secondary endpoints included significant clinical response (≥30% reduction in symptoms) at week 16 and endoscopic response (≥25% decrease in symptoms) at week 12 or 16. At 16 weeks 22% of participants taking the 24 mg twice daily dose achieved endoscopic remission with upadacitinib compared to 0% of participants taking placebo. 27% of participants taking the 6 mg twice daily dose achieved clinical remission compared to 11% of participants taking placebo. Adverse events did not appear to be dose-related. A single case of non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in the 24 mg twice daily group. ==== Phase III studies ==== Abbvie has planned a total of six phase III trials that will evaluate over 4,000 participants with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Two Phase III trials are planned studying participants with psoriatic arthritis and one in participants with ulcerative colitis. ===== SELECT-COMPARE ===== In SELECT-COMPARE 1629 participants with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to methotrexate were randomized (2:2:1) to once-daily upadacitinib 15mg, placebo, or adalimumab 40mg, on stable background methotrexate. Primary endpoints were ACR20 and DAS28CRP<2.6 versus placebo at week 12; inhibition of radiographic progression was evaluated at week 26. The study was designed and powered to test for non-inferiority and superiority of upadacitinib versus adalimumab clinically and functionally. At week 12, both primary endpoints were met for upadacitinib versus placebo (p≤0.001). ACR20 was achieved by 71% versus 36%, and DAS28CRP<2.6 by 29% versus 6%. Upadacitinib was superior to adalimumab for ACR50, DAS28CRP≤3.2, ΔPain and ΔHAQDI. At week 26, more participants on upadacitinib vs placebo or adalimumab achieved low disease activity or remission (p≤0.001). Radiographic progression was less and observed in fewer participants receiving upadacitinib versus placebo (p≤0.001). Up to week 26, adverse events (AEs) including serious infections were comparable for upadacitinib and adalimumab. The proportions of participants with serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were highest for adalimumab; the proportion with herpes zoster and CPK elevations was highest for upadacitinib. Three malignancies, five MACE, and four deaths were reported, none on upadacitinib. Six venous thromboembolic events were reported [placebo, one; upadacitinib, two; adalimumab, three]. Upadacitinib was superior to placebo and adalimumab for improving signs, symptoms and physical function in RA participants on background methotrexate, and significantly inhibited radiographic progression versus placebo, while the overall safety profile was generally similar to adalimumab, except for higher rates of herpes zoster and CPK elevations on upadacitinib. ===== SELECT-CHOICE ===== SELECT-CHOICE was a phase III trial comparing upadacitinib and abatacept in 612 people whose rheumatoid arthritis did not respond to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. It compared their ability to reduce Disease Activity Score-28 with CRP (DAS-28 CRP), a measure of rheumatoid arthritis disease severity that includes number of tender and swollen joints, C-reactive protein level (a marker of inflammation), and overall health reported on a standardized scale. The trial found that after 12 weeks of treatment, people treated with upadacitinib had lower DAS-28 CRP scores and a higher rate of remission. There was also a higher rate of serious and opportunistic infections, elevated liver enzymes, and thromboembolism in the upadacitinib group. == References ==",Rinvoq,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.911301948595792e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00012706902634818107)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://news.abbvie.com/2021-12-14-RINVOQ-R-upadacitinib-Receives-U-S-FDA-Approval-for-Active-Psoriatic-Arthritis,https://news.abbvie.com/2022-04-29-RINVOQ-R-upadacitinib-Approved-by-U-S-FDA-as-an-Oral-Treatment-for-Adults-with-Active-Ankylosing-Spondylitis,https://news.abbvie.com/2023-05-18-U-S-FDA-Approves-RINVOQ-R-upadacitinib-as-a-Once-Daily-Pill-for-Moderately-to-Severely-Active-Crohns-Disease-in-Adults ', [])"

951,"('Tegobuvir', 'Gs 333126', 'Tegobuvir [usan:inn]', 'Gs 9190', 'Tegobuvir (usan/inn)')",Medical," GS-9190 (Tegobuvir) is a novel imidazopyridine inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication in vitro and has demonstrated potent antiviral activity in patients chronically infected with genotype 1 (GT1) HCV. GS-9190 exhibits reduced activity against GT2a (JFH1) subgenomic replicons and GT2a (J6/JFH1) infectious virus, suggesting that the compound's mechanism of action involves a genotype-specific viral component. To further investigate the GS-9190 mechanism of action, we utilized the susceptibility differences between GT1b and GT2a by constructing a series of replicon chimeras where combinations of 1b and 2a nonstructural proteins were encoded within the same replicon. The antiviral activities of GS-9190 against the chimeric replicons were reduced to levels comparable to that of the wild-type GT2a replicon in chimeras expressing GT2a NS5B. GT1b replicons in which the β-hairpin region (amino acids 435 to 455) was replaced by the corresponding sequence of GT2a were markedly less susceptible to GS-9190, indicating the importance of the thumb subdomain of the polymerase in this effect. Resistance selection in GT1b replicon cells identified several mutations in NS5B (C316Y, Y448H, Y452H, and C445F) that contributed to the drug resistance phenotype. Reintroduction of these mutations into wild-type replicons conferred resistance to GS-9190, with the number of NS5B mutations correlating with the degree of resistance. Analysis of GS-9190 cross-resistance against previously reported NS5B drug-selected mutations showed that the resistance pattern of GS-9190 is different from other nonnucleoside inhibitors. Collectively, these data demonstrate that GS-9190 represents a novel class of nonnucleoside polymerase inhibitors that interact with NS5B likely through involvement of the β-hairpin in the thumb subdomain. This phase II trial assessed the efficacy and safety of a combination regimen of the nonstructural protein (NS)5A inhibitor ledipasvir (LDV), NS3 protease inhibitor vedroprevir (VDV), non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor tegobuvir (TGV), and ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 without cirrhosis. Patients were randomized 1:2 to LDV 30 mg once daily (QD; Arm 1; n = 46) or LDV 90 mg QD (Arm 2; n = 94); patients in both arms also received VDV 200 mg QD, TGV 30 mg twice-daily, and RBV 1,000-1,200 mg/day. Patients in Arm 2 with vRVR, defined as HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) from treatment weeks 2 to 10, were randomized 1:1 to stop treatment at 12 weeks or continue for 24 weeks. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) was higher in patients receiving 90 mg of LDV for 24 weeks (63%), compared with LDV 90 mg for 12 weeks (54%) and LDV 30 mg for 24 weeks (48%). In patients with very rapid virologic response (vRVR) in Arm 2, SVR12 was achieved by 68% and 81% of patients treated for 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Virologic breakthrough was more common in patients with HCV genotype 1a and was associated with resistance-associated variants for all three direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs); however, in all but 1 patient who relapsed, resistance-associated variants directed against only one or two of the DAAs were detected. The most common adverse events were fatigue, headache, nausea, rash, and diarrhea. In patients with HCV genotype 1, an interferon-free regimen containing LDV/VDV/TGV/RBV was well tolerated and led to SVR12 in up to 63% of patients. LDV 90 mg is currently being investigated in combination with the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir. Tegobuvir (GS-9190), a non-nucleoside nonstructural protein (NS)5B polymerase inhibitor, and GS-9256, an NS3 serine protease inhibitor, individually have activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1. The antiviral activity of tegobuvir and GS-9256 as oral combination therapy, or together with ribavirin (RBV) or pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) alpha-2a and RBV, was assessed in a phase II, randomized, open-label trial. Treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 HCV were assigned 28 days of tegobuvir 40 mg twice-daily (BID) and GS-9256 75 mg BID (n = 16), tegobuvir and GS-9256 plus RBV 1,000-1,200 mg daily (n = 15), or tegobuvir and GS-9256 plus Peg-IFN alpha-2a (180 μg once-weekly)/RBV (n = 15). The primary efficacy endpoint was rapid virologic response (RVR), with HCV RNA <25 IU/mL at day 28. After 28 days, all patients received Peg-IFN/RBV. All patients with viral rebound or nonresponse, defined as >0.5-log(10) increase in HCV RNA from nadir or <2-log decrease at day 5, initiated Peg-IFN/RBV immediately. Median maximal reductions in HCV RNA were -4.1 log(10) IU/mL for tegobuvir/GS-9256, -5.1 log(10) IU/mL for tegobuvir/GS-9256/RBV, and -5.7 log(10) IU/mL for tegobuvir/9256/Peg-IFN/RBV. RVR was observed in 7% (1 of 15) of patients receiving tegobuvir/GS-9256, 38% (5 of 13) receiving tegobuvir/GS-9256/RBV, and 100% (14 of 14) receiving tegobuvir/9256/PEG-IFN/RBV. The addition of Peg-IFN/RBV at day 28 or earlier resulted in HCV RNA <25 IU/mL at week 24 in 67% (10 of 15), 100% (13 of 13), and 94% (13 of 14) of patients in the three treatment groups.

There have many evidences demonstrate the Notch signaling has deregulation in variety of human malignancies.MK-0752 is a novel potent γ-secretase inhibitor and now assessed in clinical trial for treatment of several types of cancer, our objective was to investigate the anticancer effects and mechanisms of MK-0752 alone or combined with cisplatin in ovarian cancer. Cell lines used: A2780, OVCAR3, SKOV3, HO8910PM, the effects of MK-0752 and cisplatin on cell proliferation were measured by MTT assay. The effect of combination treatment was examined by isobologram analysis. The distribution of cell cycle and cell apoptosis were analyzed using PI and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining by flow cytometric analysis. The mechanism in biochemistry was analyzed by using Western blot. Mouse xenograft model of A2780 was established to observe the anti-ovarian cancer effects in vivo setting, nude mice were randomized into four groups (n=6 per group) and treated every 4 days with control (solvent) group, MK-0752(25mg/kg) group, cisplatin (2mg/kg)group, combination group (both of MK-0752 and cisplatin). MK-0752 alone actively induced cell growth inhibition, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with down-regulation of Notch1 and its downstream effectors including Hes1, XIAP, c-Myc and MDM2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, sequential combination of cisplatin prior to MK-0752 significantly promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited the subcutaneous xenograft growth of ovarian cancer in nude mice. Our data supports the sequential combination of cisplatin prior to MK-0752 is a highly promising novel experimental therapeutic strategy against ovarian cancer. Two strategies to interrogate the insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway were investigated: vertical inhibition with dalotuzumab and MK-2206 or ridaforolimus to potentiate PI3K pathway targeting and horizontal cross-talk inhibition with dalotuzumab and MK-0752 to exert effects against cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and stem cell propagation. A phase I, multi-cohort dose escalation study was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumours. Patients received dalotuzumab (10 mg kg(-1)) and escalating doses of MK-2206 (90-200 mg) or escalating doses of dalotuzumab (7.5-10 mg kg(-1)) and MK-0752 (1800 mg) weekly. Upon maximum tolerated dose determination, patients with low-RAS signature, high-IGF1 expression ovarian cancer were randomised to dalotuzumab/MK-2206 versus dalotuzumab/ridaforolimus, whereas patients with high IGF1/low IGF2 expression colorectal cancer received dalotuzumab/MK-0752. A total of 47 patients were enrolled: 29 in part A (18 in the dalotuzumab/MK-2206 arm and 11 in the dalotuzumab/MK-0752 arm) and 18 in part B (6 in each arm). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) for dalotuzumab/MK-2206 included grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 serum sickness-like reaction, maculopapular rash, and gastrointestinal inflammation. For dalotuzumab/MK-0752, DLTs included grade 3 dehydration, rash, and diarrhoea. Seven patients remained on study for >4 cycles. Dalotuzumab/MK-2206 and dalotuzumab/MK-0752 combinations were tolerable. Further developments of prospectively validated predictive biomarkers to aid in patient selection for anti-IGF-1R therapies are needed. Amplification and high levels of NOTCH ligand expression have been identified in several types of pediatric brain tumors. A phase I trial of weekly MK-0752, an oral inhibitor of gamma-secretase, was conducted in children with recurrent central nervous system (CNS) malignancies to estimate the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of weekly MK-0752. MK-0752 was administered once weekly at 1000 and 1400 mg/m(2) using a rolling-6 design. PK analysis was performed during the first course. NOTCH and HES expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Ten eligible patients were enrolled (median age 8.8 years; range 3.1-19.2) with diagnoses of brain stem glioma (n = 3), ependymoma (n = 2), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 1), choroid plexus carcinoma (n = 2), medulloblastoma (n = 1), and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (n = 1). Nine were evaluable for toxicity. One DLT of fatigue occurred in the six evaluable patients enrolled at 1000 mg/m(2)/dose. No DLTs were experienced by three patients treated at 1400 mg/m(2)/dose. Non-dose-limiting grade 3 toxicities included lymphopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Median number of treatment courses was 2 (range 1-10). Two patients continued on therapy for at least 6 months. The median (range) C(max) of MK-0752 was 88.2 μg/mL (40.6 to 109 μg/mL) and 60.3 μg/mL (59.2 to 91.9 μg/mL) in patients receiving 1000 and 1400 mg/m(2)/week, respectively. NOTCH expression was decreased in six of seven patients for whom tissue was available at 24 h post-MK-0752.

Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, for active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth. There are common side effects which include headache, dizziness, and nausea. Other side effects include QT prolongation. Delamanid works by blocking the manufacture of mycolic acids thus destabilising the bacterial cell wall. It is in the nitroimidazole class of medications. Delamanid was approved for medical use in 2014 in Europe, Japan, and South Korea. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. As of 2016 the Stop TB Partnership had an agreement to get the medication for US$1,700 per six month for use in more than 100 countries. == Medical uses == Delamanid is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, for active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include headache, dizziness, and nausea. Other side effects include QT prolongation. Use in pregnancy has not been extensively studied, but there have been reports of success and it is currently recommended as part of the standard treatment regimen for pregnant women with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa. == Interactions == Delamanid is metabolised by the liver enzyme CYP3A4; therefore strong inducers of this enzyme can reduce its effectiveness. == Mechanism of action == Delamanid is activated in the mycobacterium by deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase (Ddn), an enzyme which uses dihydro-F420 (reduced form), into nitric oxide and a highly reactive metabolite. This metabolite attacks the synthesis enzyme DprE2, which is important for the synthesis of cell wall arabinogalactan, to which mycolic acid would be attached. This mechanism is shared with pretomanid. Clinical isolates resistant to this drug tend to have mutations in the biosynthetic pathway for Coenzyme F420. == History == In phase II clinical trials, the drug was used in combination with standard treatments, such as four or five of the drugs ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampicin, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and quinolones. Healing rates (measured as sputum culture conversion) were significantly better in patients who additionally took delamanid. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended conditional marketing authorization for delamanid in adults with multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis without other treatment options because of resistance or tolerability. The EMA considered the data show that the benefits of delamanid outweigh the risks, but that additional studies were needed on the long-term effectiveness. == Society and culture == The medication was not readily available globally as of 2015. It was believed that pricing will be similar to bedaquiline, which for six months is approximately US$900 in low income countries, US$3,000 in middle income countries, and US$30,000 in high income countries.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a randomized trial to prospectively enrich a study population with prodromal AD (PDAD) defined by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker criteria and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) symptoms. To assess the safety of the γ-secretase inhibitor avagacestat in PDAD and to determine whether CSF biomarkers can identify this patient population prior to clinical diagnosis of dementia. A randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial with a parallel, untreated, nonrandomized observational cohort of CSF biomarker-negative participants was conducted May 26, 2009, to July 9, 2013, in a multicenter global population. Of 1358 outpatients screened, 263 met MCI and CSF biomarker criteria for randomization into the treatment phase. One hundred two observational cohort participants who met MCI criteria but were CSF biomarker-negative were observed during the same study period to evaluate biomarker assay sensitivity. Oral avagacestat or placebo daily. Safety and tolerability of avagacestat. Of the 263 participants in the treatment phase, 132 were randomized to avagacestat and 131 to placebo; an additional 102 participants were observed in an untreated observational cohort. Avagacestat was relatively well tolerated with low discontinuation rates (19.6%) at a dose of 50 mg/d, whereas the dose of 125 mg/d had higher discontinuation rates (43%), primarily attributable to gastrointestinal tract adverse events. Increases in nonmelanoma skin cancer and nonprogressive, reversible renal tubule effects were observed with avagacestat. Serious adverse event rates were higher with avagacestat (49 participants [37.1%]) vs placebo (31 [23.7%]), attributable to the higher incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer. At 2 years, progression to dementia was more frequent in the PDAD cohort (30.7%) vs the observational cohort (6.5%). Brain atrophy rate in PDAD participants was approximately double that of the observational cohort. Concordance between abnormal amyloid burden on positron emission tomography and pathologic CSF was approximately 87% (κ = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48-0.87). No significant treatment differences were observed in the avagacestat vs placebo arm in key clinical outcome measures. Avagacestat did not demonstrate efficacy and was associated with adverse dose-limiting effects. This PDAD population receiving avagacestat or placebo had higher rates of clinical progression to dementia and greater brain atrophy compared with CSF biomarker-negative participants. The CSF biomarkers and amyloid positron emission tomography imaging were correlated, suggesting that either modality could be used to confirm the presence of cerebral amyloidopathy and identify PDAD. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00890890. The toxicity of avagacestat, a sulfonamide-based gamma (γ)-secretase inhibitor that was in development as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, was evaluated in a comprehensive nonclinical toxicology program that included 6-month and 1-year repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, respectively. There was a spectrum of mechanism-based changes attributed to inhibition of Notch signaling that regulates the differentiation and proliferation of cells throughout development and in adult tissues. In both rats and dogs, ovarian follicular degeneration and atrophy and a low incidence of granulosa cell hyperplasia and benign granulosa-thecal cell tumors were observed. Gastrointestinal (GI) findings, including goblet cell metaplasia, dilatation of intestinal crypts/glands, mucosal epithelial necrosis and regeneration, and villous atrophy, were limited to dogs that had clinical evidence of GI toxicity. Other avagacestat-related findings attributed to interference with Notch signaling included decreases in peripheral lymphocytes (T and/or B cells) and lymphoid depletion in lymph nodes and the spleen in both species, as well as epiphyseal cartilage and trabecular bone changes in rats. Pharmacologically mediated decreases in brain and cerebrospinal fluid levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42 and decreased expression of white blood cell mRNA levels of the Notch-regulated gene hairy and enhancer of split-1 confirmed target engagement at all doses. Reductions in brain Aβ peptide levels (22 to 34%) in dogs after 1 year at exposures up to the no-observed-effect level for GI toxicity of 1.1× the human plasma exposure, and reversible GI changes at a 3.2× multiple, indicated that a sustained pharmacodynamic effect was attained at exposures without dose-limiting toxicity. The concentration of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and has been used to evaluate the effectiveness of γ-secretase inhibition. Avagacestat is a selective γ-secretase inhibitor in development for the treatment of AD. The primary objective of this study was to assess the effects of single oral doses of avagacestat on the CSF Aβ concentrations in healthy male subjects. Secondary objectives included single-dose pharmacokinetics in CSF and plasma, safety and tolerability. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single-dose study. Healthy male subjects were assigned to one of three sequential avagacestat dose panels (50, 200 and 400 mg) or placebo as single oral doses. 34 subjects were enrolled. Administration of a single dose of 200 or 400 mg of avagacestat resulted in a marked decrease in CSF Aβ(1-38), Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) concentrations vs placebo; with smaller decreases observed in the 50 mg dose group. Avagacestat was quickly absorbed into the systemic circulation, with a mean time to reach maximum plasma concentration (t(max)) of approximately 1-2 h, and a CSF t(max) of approximately 3 h. Adverse events were uncommon and occurred with similar frequency in the placebo and avagacestat groups. Avagacestat was safe, well tolerated, and resulted in a notable decrease in CSF Aβ concentrations, suggestive of γ-secretase inhibition.

956,"('Mefloquine (hydrochloride)', 'Mefloquin hydrochloride', 'Mefloquine', 'Mefloquine hydrochloride', ""(11s,2'r)-erythro-mefloquine"")",Medical,"Mefloquine, sold under the brand name Lariam among others, is a medication used to prevent or treat malaria. When used for prevention it is typically started before potential exposure and continued for several weeks after potential exposure. It can be used to treat mild or moderate malaria but is not recommended for severe malaria. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sleep disorders, and a rash. Serious side effects include potentially long-term mental health problems such as depression, hallucinations, and anxiety and neurological side effects such as poor balance, seizures, and ringing in the ears. It is therefore not recommended in people with a history of mental health problems or epilepsy. It appears to be safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Mefloquine was developed by the United States Army in the 1970s and came into use in the mid-1980s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Mefloquine is used to both prevent and treat certain forms of malaria. === Malaria prevention === Mefloquine is useful for the prevention of malaria in all areas except for those where parasites may have resistance to multiple medications, and is one of several anti-malarial medications recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for this purpose. It is also recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America for malaria prophylaxis as a first or second-line agent, depending on resistance patterns in the malaria found in the geographic region visited. It is typically taken for one to two weeks before entering an area with malaria. Doxycycline and atovaquone/proguanil provide protection within one to two days and may be better tolerated. If a person becomes ill with malaria despite prophylaxis with mefloquine, the use of halofantrine and quinine for treatment may be ineffective.: 4 === Malaria treatment === Mefloquine is used as a treatment for chloroquine-sensitive or resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and is deemed a reasonable alternative for uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax malaria. It is one of several drugs recommended by the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is not recommended for severe malaria infections, particularly infections from P. falciparum, which should be treated with intravenous antimalarials. Mefloquine does not eliminate parasites in the liver phase of the disease, and people with P. vivax malaria should be treated with a second drug that is effective for the liver phase, such as primaquine.: 4 === Resistance to mefloquine === Resistance to mefloquine is common around the west border in Cambodia and other parts of Southeast Asia. The mechanism of resistance is by increase in Pfmdr1 copy number. == Contraindications == Mefloquine is contraindicated in those with a previous history of seizures or a recent history of psychiatric disorders. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Available data suggests that mefloquine is safe and effective for use by pregnant women during all trimesters of pregnancy, and it is widely used for this indication. In pregnant women, mefloquine appears to pose minimal risk to the fetus, and is not associated with increased risk of birth defects or miscarriages. Compared to other malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens, however, mefloqinone may produce more side effects in non-pregnant travelers. Mefloquine is also safe and effective for use during breastfeeding, though it appears in breast milk in low concentrations.: 9 The World Health Organization (WHO) gives approval for the use of mefloquine in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and use in the first trimester does not mandate termination of pregnancy. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and a rash. Severe side effects requiring hospitalization are rare, but include mental health problems such as depression, hallucinations, anxiety and neurological side effects such as poor balance, seizures, and ringing in the ears. Mefloquine is therefore not recommended in people with a history of psychiatric disorders or epilepsy. Liver function tests should be performed during long-term administration of mefloquine. Alcohol use should be avoided during treatment with mefloquine. === Neurologic and psychiatric === In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning to the prescription label of mefloquine regarding the potential for neuropsychiatric side effects that may persist even after discontinuing administration of the medication. In 2013 the FDA stated ""Neurologic side effects can occur at any time during drug use, and can last for months to years after the drug is stopped or can be permanent."" Neurologic effects include dizziness, loss of balance, seizures, and tinnitus. Psychiatric effects include nightmares, visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, anxiety, depression, unusual behavior, and suicidal ideations. Central nervous system events requiring hospitalization occur in about one in 10,000 people taking mefloquine for malaria prevention, with milder events (e.g., dizziness, headache, insomnia, and vivid dreams) in up to 25%. When some measure of subjective severity is applied to the rating of adverse events, about 11–17% of travelers are incapacitated to some degree. === Cardiac === Mefloquine may cause abnormalities with heart rhythms that are visible on electrocardiograms. Combining mefloquine with other drugs that cause similar effects, such as quinine or quinidine, can increase these effects. Combining mefloquine with halofantrine can cause significant increases in QTc intervals.: 10 == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of mefloquine is unclear and several competing hypotheses exist. ==== Off-target activities ==== Mefloquine has known off-target activities. This includes affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and to a lesser extent for the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, but not for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. Mefloquine acts as a partial agonist of both the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, similarly to serotonergic psychedelics like LSD, DOM, and DMT. It also binds to the serotonin transporter and acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, acts as a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, and shows affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor, among other actions. These properties of mefloquine, especially serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism, may be involved in the neurological and psychiatric adverse effects such as visual hallucinations that have been reported with its use particularly at high doses. === Pharmacokinetics === Mefloquine is metabolized primarily through the liver. Its elimination in persons with impaired liver function may be prolonged, resulting in higher plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions. The mean plasma elimination half-life of mefloquine is between 2 and 4 weeks. Total clearance is through the liver, and the primary means of excretion is through the bile and feces, as opposed to only 4% to 9% excreted through the urine. During long-term use, the plasma half-life remains unchanged. == Chemistry == Mefloquine is a chiral molecule with two asymmetric carbon centres, which means it has four different stereoisomers. The drug is currently manufactured and sold as a racemate of the (R,S)- and (S,R)-enantiomers by Hoffmann-La Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical company. Essentially, it is two drugs in one. Plasma concentrations of the (–)-enantiomer are significantly higher than those for the (+)-enantiomer, and the pharmacokinetics between the two enantiomers are significantly different. The (+)-enantiomer has a shorter half-life than the (–)-enantiomer. Specifically it is used as mefloquine hydrochloride. The chemical structure of mefloquine is similar to that of tryptamine and its derivatives. However, whereas tryptamine is an indolylethylamine, mefloquine is a quinolinylethylamine. Mefloquine's structure is also particularly similar to that of 10,11-secoergoline (α,N-tetramethylenetryptamine). == History == Mefloquine was formulated at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in the 1970s shortly after the end of the Vietnam war. Mefloquine was number 142,490 of a total of 250,000 antimalarial compounds screened during the study. Mefloquine was the first Public-Private Venture (PPV) between the US Department of Defense and a pharmaceutical company. WRAIR transferred all its phase I and phase II clinical trial data to Hoffman-LaRoche and Smith Kline. FDA approval as a treatment for malaria was swift. Most notably, phase III safety and tolerability trials were skipped. The drug was first approved in Switzerland in 1984 by Hoffmann-LaRoche, who brought it to market with the name Lariam. However, mefloquine was not approved by the FDA for prophylactic use until 1989. This approval was based primarily on compliance, while safety and tolerability were overlooked. Because of the drug's very long half-life, the Centers for Disease Control originally recommended a mefloquine dosage of 250 mg every two weeks; however, this caused an unacceptably high malaria rate in the Peace Corps volunteers who participated in the approval study, so the drug regimen was switched to once a week. By 1991, Hoffman was marketing the drug on a worldwide basis. By the 1992 UNITAF, Canadian soldiers were being prescribed the drug en masse. By 1994, medical professionals were noting ""severe psychiatric side effects observed during prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine"", and recommending that ""the absence of contraindications and minor side effects during an initial course of mefloquine should be confirmed before another course is prescribed."" Other doctors at the University Hospital of Zurich noted in a case of ""a 47-year-old, previously healthy Japanese tourist"" who had severe neuropsychiatric side-effects from the drug that The neuropsychiatric side effects of the antimalarial drug mefloquine are well documented. They include anxiety, depression, hallucinations, acute psychosis, and seizures. The incidence of these side effects is 1 in 13,000 with prophylactic use and 1 in 250 with therapeutic use. The first randomized, controlled trial on a mixed population was performed in 2001. Prophylaxis with mefloquine was compared to prophylaxis with atovaquone-proguanil. Roughly 67% of participants in the mefloquine arm reported greater than or equal to one adverse event, versus 71% in the atovaquone-proguanil arm. In the mefloquine arm, 5% of the users reported severe events requiring medical attention, versus 1.2% in the atovaquone-proguanil arm. In August 2009, Roche stopped marketing Lariam in the United States. Retired soldier Johnny Mercer, who was later appointed Minister for Veterans Affairs by Boris Johnson, told in 2015 that he had received ""a letter about once or twice a week"" about ill-effects from the drug. In July 2016, Roche took this brand off the market in Ireland. === Military === In 2006, the Australian military deemed mefloquine ""a third-line drug"" alternative, and over the five years from 2011 only 25 soldiers had been prescribed the drug, and only in cases of their intolerance for other alternatives. Between 2001 and 2012, 16,000 Canadian soldiers sent to Afghanistan were given the drug as a preventative measure. In 2013, the US Army banned mefloquine from use by its special forces such as the Green Berets. In autumn 2016, the UK military followed suit with their Australian peers after a parliamentary inquiry into the matter revealed that it can cause permanent side effects and brain damage. In early December 2016, the German defence ministry removed mefloquine from the list of medications it would provide to its soldiers. In autumn 2016, Canadian Surgeon General Brigadier General Hugh Colin MacKay told a parliamentary committee that faulty science supported the assertion that the drug has indelible noxious side effects. An expert from Health Canada named Barbara Raymond told the same committee that the evidence she had read failed to support the conclusion of indelible side effects. Canadian soldiers who took mefloquine when deployed overseas have claimed they have been left with ongoing mental health problems. In 2020 the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) admitted to a breach of duty regarding the use of Mefloquine. by acknowledging numerous instances of failure to assess the risks and warn of potential side effects of the drug. == Research == In June 2010, the first case report appeared of a progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy being successfully treated with mefloquine. Mefloquine can also act against the JC virus. Administration of mefloquine seemed to eliminate the virus from the patient's body and prevented further neurological deterioration. Mefloquine alters cholinergic synaptic transmission through both postsynaptic and presynaptic actions. The postsynaptic action to inhibit acetylcholinesterase changes transmission across synapses in the brain. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Mefloquine"".

The efficacy of BI 671800, a CRTH2 antagonist, was assessed in 2 separate trials in patients with asthma, in either the absence or the presence of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy. In this study, BI 671800 (50, 200 or 400 mg) and fluticasone propionate (220 μg) all given twice daily (bid) were compared with bid placebo in symptomatic controller-naïve adults with asthma (Trial 1), and BI 671800 400 mg bid compared with montelukast 10 mg once daily (qd), and matching placebo bid, in patients with asthma receiving inhaled fluticasone (88 μg bid) (Trial 2). The primary endpoint in both trials was change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) percent predicted. After 6 weeks' treatment, adjusted mean treatment differences (SE) for the primary endpoint compared with placebo in Trial 1 were 3.08% (1.65%), 3.59% (1.60%) and 3.98% (1.64%) for BI 671800 50, 200 and 400 mg bid, respectively, and 8.62% (1.68%) for fluticasone 220 μg bid (p = 0.0311, p = 0.0126, p = 0.0078 and p < 0.0001, respectively). In Trial 2, adjusted mean FEV1 (SE) treatment differences compared with placebo were 3.87% (1.49%) for BI 671800 400 mg bid and 2.37% (1.57%) for montelukast (p = 0.0050 and p = 0.0657, respectively). These findings suggest that BI 671800 is associated with a small improvement in FEV1 in symptomatic controller-naïve asthma patients, and in patients on ICS. Asthma is characterized by a complex interaction of inflammatory mediators. The prostaglandin D2 receptor, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule on Th2 cells (CRTH2), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. To ealuate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of BI 671800, a CRTH2 antagonist, when added to inhaled corticosteroid therapy in adult patients with symptomatic asthma. In this phase IIa, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, three-period, four-treatment, incomplete block crossover trial, BI 671800 was administered either as a single 400-mg dose in the morning (A.M.) or evening (P.M.), or 200 mg twice daily (A.M. and P.M.) versus placebo, together with fluticasone propionate (44 μg, two inhalations twice daily). The primary end point was the change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second percentage predicted after 4 weeks. The secondary end point was the change in Asthma Control Questionnaire score from baseline. A total of 108 patients were randomized and treated. After 4 weeks, the adjusted mean (± SE) treatment differences for the primary end point versus placebo were 0.08 ± 0.62%, 0.28 ± 0.61%, and 0.67 ± 0.63% for BI 671800 at 200 mg twice daily, 400 mg A.M., and 400 mg P.M., respectively (not statistically significant). No statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences in the Asthma Control Questionnaire score were observed versus placebo. Each treatment was well tolerated. BI 671800 at a dose of 400 mg administered for 4 weeks with fluticasone propionate did not provide clinical improvement in patients with asthma; reasons for this are unclear, but it may be due to insufficient inhibition of the CRTH2 receptor at the doses used. The inflammatory response in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is partly mediated by the prostaglandin D2 receptor chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule on T(H)2 cells (CRTH2). We sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of the oral CRTH2 antagonist BI 671800 (50, 200, and 400 mg twice daily), fluticasone propionate nasal spray (200 μg once daily), or oral montelukast (10 mg once daily) administered for 2 weeks in patients with SAR. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial-crossover study, participants aged 18 to 65 years with a positive skin prick test to Dactylis glomerata pollen were exposed to out-of-season allergen in the environmental challenge chamber for 6 hours. The primary efficacy variable was the total nasal symptom score assessed as the area under the curve (AUC)(0-6h). In total, 146 patients (63.7% male; mean age, 36.1 years) were randomized. The adjusted mean total nasal symptom score AUC(0-6h) was significantly reduced versus placebo with 200 mg of BI 671800 (absolute difference, -0.85; percentage difference, -17%; P = .0026), montelukast (absolute difference, -0.74; percentage difference, -15%; P = .0115), and fluticasone propionate (absolute difference, -1.64; percentage difference, -33%; P < .0001). Compared with placebo, BI 671800 significantly reduced nasal eosinophil values (P < .05 for all doses), significantly inhibited nasal inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-4 and eotaxin, P < .05; 200 mg twice daily), and induced a dose-related reduction in ex vivo prostaglandin D2-mediated eosinophil shape change.

The aim of the review was to summarize and critically review the key pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of tedizolid. Tedizolid displays linear pharmacokinetics with good tissue penetration. In in vitro susceptibility studies, tedizolid exhibits activity against the majority of Gram-positive bacteria (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] of ≤ 0.5 mg/L), is four-fold more potent than linezolid, and has the potential to treat pathogens being less susceptible to linezolid. Area under the unbound concentration-time curve (fAUC) related to MIC (fAUC/MIC) was best correlated with efficacy. In neutropenic mice, fAUC/MIC of ~ 50 and ~ 20 induced bacteriostasis in thigh and pulmonary infection models, respectively, at 24 h. The presence of granulocytes augmented its antibacterial effect. Hence, tedizolid is currently not recommended for immunocompromised patients. Clinical investigations with daily doses of 200 mg for 6 days showed non-inferiority to twice-daily dosing of linezolid 600 mg for 10 days in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections. In addition to its use in skin and skin-structure infections, the high pulmonary penetration makes it an attractive option for respiratory infections including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Resistance against tedizolid is rare yet effective antimicrobial surveillance and defining pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets for resistance suppression are needed to guide dosing strategies to suppress resistance development. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)is a common pathogen in acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections (ABSSSIs), nosocomial pneumonia, bacteremia, endocarditis, as well as diabetic foot, bone, and joint infections. Areas covered: This review summarizes the randomized controlled trials that evaluated the clinical efficacy of tedizolid in ABSSSIs, which is currently the only United States Food and Drug Administration-labeled indication for tedizolid. Expert opinion: Tedizolid has several potential advantages over linezolid including once-daily dosing, shorter duration of therapy, and increased tolerability. However, its cost will likely limit its adoption for ABSSSIs with MRSA because other oxazolidinone antibiotics are available in less costly generic versions. Tedizolid is also currently being investigated for its use in other MRSA infections including nosocomial pneumonia as well as diabetic foot, bone, and joint infections and tedizolid's use in these disease states appears more promising. Potential indications for future clinical investigation of tedizolid's efficacy and safety include bacteremia and meningitis. The mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical efficacy and safety of an investigational second-generation oxazolidinone are reviewed. Tedizolid is a protein synthesis inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of gram-positive infections. Similar to linezolid, tedizolid works by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit, thereby preventing the formation of the 70S initiation complex and inhibiting protein synthesis. Tedizolid has demonstrated potent in vitro activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), including some linezolid-resistant strains. Tedizolid has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile that allows for once-daily dosing and easy i.v.-to-oral conversion. Unlike linezolid, tedizolid has not been shown to interact with serotonergic agents in clinical studies. Two Phase III studies in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections have demonstrated the noninferiority of 6 days of tedizolid therapy (200 mg i.v. or orally once daily) relative to 10 days of linezolid therapy. In clinical trials to date, overall rates of treatment-related adverse effects with linezolid and tedizolid were comparable (40.8% versus 43.3%), with nausea being the most commonly reported adverse effect associated with tedizolid use (16% of patients). Planned studies will investigate tedizolid's potential role in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, and bacteremia.

959,"('Tedizolid', 'Tr 700', 'Torezolid', 'Sivextro', 'Da 7157')",Medical,"Tedizolid, sold under the brand name Sivextro (by Merck) is an oxazolidinone-class antibiotic. Tedizolid phosphate is a phosphate ester prodrug of the active compound tedizolid. It was developed by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, following acquisition of Trius Therapeutics (originator: Dong-A Pharmaceuticals), and is marketed for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (also known as complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs)). The most common side effects include nausea (feeling sick), headache, diarrhoea and vomiting. These side effects were generally of mild or moderate severity. Tedizolid was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2014, and for medical use in the European Union in March 2015. == Medical uses == Tedizolid was approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 20, 2014, with the indication for the treatment of acute bacterial Skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by certain susceptible bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains, MRSA, and methicillin-susceptible strains), various Streptococcus species (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. anginosus group including S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus), and Enterococcus faecalis. Tedizolid is a second-generation oxazolidinone derivative that is 4-to-16-fold more potent against staphylococci and enterococci compared to linezolid. The recommended dosage for treatment is 200 mg once daily for a total duration of six days, either orally (with or without food) or through an intravenous injection (if patient is older than 18 years old). In the European Union tedizolid is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. == Mechanism of action == Tedizolid phosphate (TR-701) is a prodrug activated by plasma or intestinal phosphatases to tedizolid (TR-700) following administration of the drug either orally or intravenously. Once activated, tedizolid exerts its bacteriostatic microbial activity through inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit (on the acceptor site) of the bacteria. == Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties == Tedizolid tablets have an oral bioavailability >90%. Tedizolid has higher binding to plasma proteins (80%), longer half-life, and a larger volume of distribution compared to linezolid. It is primarily metabolized by the liver as an inactive sulphate conjugate (phase II reaction), with no metabolism by cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Less than 20% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Tedizolid bactericidal activity on VRE and MRSA is time dependent. Correlations are closest between fAUC24/MIC and the tedizolid PK/PD index against MRSA and VRE. To achieve 1 log10 kill, tedizolid fAUC24/MIC in neutropenic mouse models with a thigh infection with VRE and MRSA should be 14.2 and 138.5, respectively. The post-antibiotic effects of tedizolid against VRE and MRSA are 2.39 and 0.99 h, respectively. == Clinical trials == Tedizolid proved its noninferiority to linezolid in two phase-III trials, known as the ESTABLISH trials. Tedizolid is the second treatment approved by the FDA under the new federal law Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (known as the GAIN Act). New antibiotics manufactured under this new act will be designed as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP), allowing an expedited review by the FDA and an additional five years of market exclusivity. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects found in the clinical trials were nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and dizziness. Tedizolid has also been found to have hematologic (blood) effects, as shown in Phase-I studies in which subjects exposed to doses longer than 6 days showed a possible dose and duration effect on hematologic parameters. Its safety in patients with decreased levels of white blood cells has not been established. Patients on tedizolid are also at low risk of peripheral and optic neuropathy, similar to other members of the oxazolidinone class. == References == == External links == ""Tedizolid Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information"".

960,"('Toremifene (citrate)', 'Z-toremifene (citrate)', 'Nk 622', 'Toremifene', 'Acapodene')",Medical,"Toremifene, sold under the brand name Fareston among others, is a medication which is used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of toremifene include hot flashes, sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vaginal discharge, and vaginal bleeding. It can also cause blood clots, irregular heartbeat, cataracts, visual disturbances, elevated liver enzymes, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer. High blood calcium levels can occur in women with bone metastases. The medication is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and hence is a mixed agonist–antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It has estrogenic effects in bone, the liver, and the uterus and antiestrogenic effects in the breasts. It is a triphenylethylene derivative and is closely related to tamoxifen. Toremifene was introduced for medical use in 1997. It was the first antiestrogen to be introduced since tamoxifen in 1978. It is available as a generic medication in the United States. == Medical uses == Toremifene is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive or unknown-status tumors. This is its only approved use in the United States. It shows equivalent effectiveness to tamoxifen for this indication. Toremifene has been found to be effective in the treatment of breast pain and may be a more effective medication than tamoxifen for this indication. It also has superior effects on bone mineral density and lipid profile, including levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, compared to tamoxifen. Toremifene has been reported to significantly improve symptoms of gynecomastia in men. === Available forms === Toremifene is provided in the form of 60 mg oral tablets. == Side effects == The side effects of toremifene are similar to those of tamoxifen. The most common side effect is hot flashes. Other side effects include sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vaginal discharge, and vaginal bleeding. In women with bone metastases, hypercalcemia may occur. Toremifene has a small risk of thromboembolic events. Cataracts, vision changes, and elevation of liver enzymes have been reported. The drug prolongs the QT interval and hence has a risk of potentially fatal dysrhythmias. The risk of dysrhythmias can be reduced by avoiding use in patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, pre-existing QT prolongation, and in those taking other QT-prolonging drugs. Because toremifene has estrogenic actions in the uterus, it can increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. Toremifene appears to be safer than tamoxifen. It has a lower risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (e.g., pulmonary embolism), stroke, and cataracts. The lower risk of VTE may be related to the fact tamoxifen decreases levels of the antithrombin III to a significantly greater extent than either 60 or 200 mg/day toremifene. == Interactions == Toremifene is a substrate of CYP3A4, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, and hence drugs that induce or inhibit this enzyme can respectively decrease or increase levels of toremifene in the body. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Toremifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). That is, it is a selective mixed agonist–antagonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), with estrogenic actions in some tissues and antiestrogenic actions in other tissues. The medication has estrogenic effects in bone, partial estrogenic effects in the uterus and liver, and antiestrogenic effects in the breasts. The affinity of toremifene for the ER is similar to that of tamoxifen. In studies using rat ER, toremifene had about 1.4% and tamoxifen had about 1.6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ER. The affinities (Ki) of toremifene at the human ERs have been reported as 20.3 ± 0.1 nM for the ERα and 15.4 ± 3.1 nM for the ERβ. In other rat ER studies, toremifene had 3–9% of the affinity of estradiol for the ER while its metabolites N-desmethyltoremifene and 4-hydroxytoremifene had 3–5% and 64–158% of the affinity of estradiol for the ER, respectively. The affinity of another metabolite, 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltoremifene, was not assessed. 4-Hydroxytoremifene showed about 100-fold higher antiestrogenic potency than toremifene in vitro in one study, but not in another. 4-Hydroxy-N-desmethyltoremifene has also been found to be strongly antiestrogenic in vitro. The metabolites of toremifene, particularly 4-hydroxytoremifene, may contribute importantly to the clinical activity of the medication. On the other hand, some authorities consider toremifene not to be a prodrug. Toremifene is very similar to tamoxifen and shares most of its properties. There are some indications that toremifene may be safer than tamoxifen as it is not a hepatocarcinogen in animals and may have less potential for genotoxicity. However, clinical studies have found no significant differences between toremifene and tamoxifen, including in terms of effectiveness, tolerability, and safety, and hence the clinical use of toremifene has been somewhat limited. Toremifene is thought to have about one-third of the potency of tamoxifen; i.e., 60 mg toremifene is roughly equivalent to 20 mg tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer. Toremifene has been found to have antigonadotropic effects in postmenopausal women, progonadotropic effects in men, to increase sex hormone-binding globulin levels, and to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 levels by about 20% in postmenopausal women and men. In addition to its activity as a SERM, 4-hydroxytoremifene is an antagonist of the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ). === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The bioavailability of toremifene has not been precisely determined but is known to be good and has been estimated to be approximately 100%. Levels of toremifene at steady state with a dosage of 60 mg/day are 800 to 879 ng/mL. Levels of N-desmethyltoremifene at steady state with toremifene were 3,058 ng/mL at 60 mg/day, 5,942 ng/mL at 200 mg/day, and 11,913 ng/mL at 400 mg/day. Levels of 4-hydroxytoremifene at steady state with toremifene were 438 ng/mL at 200 mg/day and 889 ng/mL at 400 mg/day. Concentrations of toremifene increase linearly across a dose range of 10 to 680 mg. ==== Distribution ==== Toremifene is 99.7% bound to plasma proteins, with 92% bound specifically to albumin, about 6% to β1 globulin fraction, and about 2% to a fraction between albumin and α1 globulins. The apparent volume of distribution of toremifene ranged from 457 to 958 L. ==== Metabolism ==== Toremifene is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 and then undergoes secondary hydroxylation. The metabolites of toremifene include N-desmethyltoremifene, 4-hydroxytoremifene, and 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltoremifene, among others. Ospemifene (deaminohydroxytoremifene) is also a major metabolite of toremifene. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination half-life of toremifene is 3 to 7 days in healthy individuals. In people with impaired liver function, the half-life is 11 days. The elimination half-lives of the metabolites of toremifene are 5 to 21 days for N-desmethyltoremifene, 5 days for 4-hydroxytoremifene, and 4 days for ospemifene. The long elimination half-lives of toremifene and its metabolites are thought to be due to enterohepatic recirculation and high plasma protein binding. Toremifene is eliminated 70% in the feces, as metabolites. == Chemistry == Toremifene, also known as 4-chlorotamoxifen, is a derivative of triphenylethylene and a close analogue of tamoxifen. It is also closely related to afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen) and ospemifene (deaminohydroxytoremifene). == History == Toremifene was introduced in the United States in 1997. It was the first antiestrogen to be introduced in this country since tamoxifen in 1978. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Toremifene is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while toremifene citrate is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name and torémifène is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. === Brand names === Toremifene is marketed almost exclusively under the brand name Fareston. === Availability === Toremifene is marketed widely throughout the world and is available in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, many other European countries, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere throughout the world. == Research == Toremifene was also evaluated for prevention of prostate cancer and had the tentative brand name Acapodene. In 2007 the pharmaceutical company GTx, Inc was conducting two different phase 3 clinical trials; First, a pivotal Phase clinical trial for the treatment of serious side effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (especially vertebral/spine fractures and hot flashes, lipid profile, and gynecomastia) for advanced prostate cancer, and second, a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for the prevention of prostate cancer in high risk men with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, or PIN. Results of these trials are expected by first quarter of 2008 An NDA for the first application (relief of prostate cancer ADT side effects) was submitted in Feb 2009, and in Oct 2009 the FDA said they would need more clinical data, e.g. another phase III trial. Ultimately, development was discontinued and toremifene was never marketed for complications associated with ADT or the treatment or prevention of prostate cancer. Toremifene may be useful in the prevention of bicalutamide-induced gynecomastia. === Phase III Trial Results === A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3 year clinical trial of toremifene was conducted using a sample of 1,260 men. Subjects had a median age of 64 years and were diagnosed with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), which is considered premalignant, though Thompson and Leach feel a low grade PIN could also be deemed premalignant. The sponsor, GTx, who designed and managed the study, found 34.7% of the placebo and 32.3% of the toremifene groups had cancer events. No distinction was found in Gleason scores of either group. Previous murine studies using transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice showed toremifene prevented palpable tumors in 60% of the animals. This study used toremifene as an early prophylactic, which differentiates it from the phase III human studies. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Toremifene - AdisInsight",Acapodene,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3856492842023727e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.10080794990062714), ('ICAL', -2.145764938177308e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04885914549231529)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
961,"('Tizanidine (hydrochloride)', 'Tizanidine', 'Sirdalud', 'Ternelin', 'Zanaflex')",Medical,"Tizanidine, sold under the brand name Zanaflex among others, is an alpha-2 (α2) adrenergic receptor agonist, similar to clonidine, that is used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and spastic cerebral palsy. Effectiveness appears similar to baclofen or diazepam. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects of tizanidine include dry mouth, sleepiness, weakness, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, psychosis, and QT prolongation. It is unclear if use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is safe. It is an α2-adrenergic agonist, but how it works is not entirely clear. Tizanidine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 94th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Tizanidine has been found to be as effective as other antispasmodic drugs and is more tolerable than baclofen and diazepam. == Side effects == Side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, weakness, nervousness, confusion, hallucinations, strange dreams, depression, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, stomach pain, heartburn, increased muscle spasms, back pain, rash, sweating, and a tingling sensation in the arms, legs, hands, and feet. Symptoms of overdose in 45 cases reported to a poison control center included: lethargy, bradycardia, hypotension, agitation, confusion, vomiting and coma. == Interactions == Concomitant use of tizanidine and moderate or potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (such as zileuton, certain antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, aciclovir, ticlopidine and oral contraceptives) is contraindicated. Concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor in humans, resulted in a 33-fold increase in the tizanidine AUC (plasma drug concentration-time curve). For this reason both fluvoxamine and tizanidine should not be taken at the same time. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin should also be avoided due to an increased serum concentration of tizanidine when administered concomitantly. Tizanidine has the potential to interact with other central nervous system depressants. Alcohol should be avoided, particularly as it can upset the stomach. The CNS-depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Caution with the following interactions: antibiotics such as enoxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin, or norfloxacin; blood pressure medications such as clonidine, guanabenz, guanfacine (Tenex), or methyldopa; heart rhythm medications such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone), mexiletine (Mexitil), propafenone (Rhythmol), and verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin). == Pharmacology == Tizanidine is an α2 receptor agonist closely related to clonidine. It has approximately one-tenth to one-fifteenth of the blood pressure-lowering effect of clonidine. The relation between the α2 receptor agonism and the spasmolytic action is still not fully understood. === Route of administration === Tizanidine is available as a tablet or capsule. Capsules may be opened and sprinkled on food. However, this may change the absorption of the medication compared to taking the capsule whole. It has a volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg following intravenous administration. == Chemistry == Tizanidine is a derivative of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and its first published synthesis was reported in a patent. The 5-chloro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4-amine intermediate was a known compound, produced in three steps from 4-chlorophenylenediamine as shown. Treatment with two equivalents of thionyl chloride in pyridine formed the heterocycle, which was nitrated with sodium nitrate in sulfuric acid and reduced using iron and acetic acid. The amine intermediate was treated with benzoyl chloride and ammonium thiocyanate followed by alkaline hydrolysis to form a thiourea. This was activated as its isothiuronium salt before being treated with ethylene diamine to give tizanidine. == References ==",Zanaflex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3708974620385561e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004415729199536145)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/zanaflex.html ', [])"
962,"('Gefitinib', 'Iressa', 'N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholinopropoxy)quinazolin-4-amine', 'Irressat', 'Zd 1839')",Medical,"Gefitinib, sold under the brand name Iressa, is a medication used for certain breast, lung and other cancers. Gefitinib is an EGFR inhibitor, like erlotinib, which interrupts signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in target cells. Therefore, it is only effective in cancers with mutated and overactive EGFR, but resistances to gefitinib can arise through other mutations. It is marketed by AstraZeneca and Teva. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Mechanism of action == Gefitinib is the first selective inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor's (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain. Thus gefitinib is an EGFR inhibitor. The target protein (EGFR) is a member of a family of receptors (ErbB) which includes Her1(EGFR), Her2(erb-B2), Her3(erb-B3) and Her4 (Erb-B4). EGFR is overexpressed in the cells of certain types of human carcinomas - for example in lung and breast cancers. This leads to inappropriate activation of the anti-apoptotic Ras signalling cascade, eventually leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Research on gefitinib-sensitive non-small cell lung cancers has shown that a mutation in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain is responsible for activating anti-apoptotic pathways. These mutations tend to confer increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Of the types of non-small cell lung cancer histologies, adenocarcinoma is the type that most often harbors these mutations. These mutations are more commonly seen in Asians, women, and non-smokers (who also tend to more often have adenocarcinoma). Gefitinib inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase by binding to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the enzyme. Thus the function of the EGFR tyrosine kinase in activating the anti-apoptotic Ras signal transduction cascade is inhibited, and malignant cells are inhibited. == Clinical uses == Gefitinib is marketed in many countries. Iressa was approved and marketed in July 2002, in Japan, making it the first country to import the drug. The FDA approved gefitinib in May 2003, for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It was approved as monotherapy for the treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of both platinum-based and docetaxel chemotherapies. In June 2005, the FDA withdrew approval for use in new patients due to lack of evidence that it extended life. In the European Union, gefitinib is indicated since 2009 in advanced NSCLC in all lines of treatment for patients harbouring EGFR mutations. This label was granted after gefitinib demonstrated as a first-line treatment to significantly improve progression-free survival vs. a platinum doublet regime in patients harbouring such mutations. IPASS has been the first of four phase III trials to have confirmed gefitinib superiority in this patient population. In most of the other countries where gefitinib is marketed it is approved for people with advanced NSCLC who had received at least one previous chemotherapy regime. However, applications to expand its label as a first-line treatment in patients harbouring EGFR mutations is currently in process based on the latest scientific evidence. As at August 2012 New Zealand has approved gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR mutation for naive locally advanced or metastatic, unresectable NSCLC. This is publicly funded for an initial four-month term and renewal if no progression. In July 2015, the FDA approved gefitinib as a first-line treatment for NSCLC. == Experimental uses == In August 2013, the BBC reported that researchers in Edinburgh and Melbourne found, in a small-scale trial of 12 patients, that the effectiveness of Methotrexate for treating ectopic pregnancy was improved when Gefitinib was also administered. == Studies == IPASS (IRESSA Pan-Asia Study) was a randomized, large-scale, double-blinded study which compared gefitinib vs. carboplatin/ paclitaxel as a first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC. IPASS studied 1,217 patients with confirmed adenocarcinoma histology who were former or never smokers. A pre-planned sub-group analyses showed that progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for gefitinib than chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation positive tumours (HR 0.48, 95 per cent CI 0.36 to 0.64, p less than 0.0001), and significantly longer for chemotherapy than gefitinib in patients with EGFR mutation negative tumours (HR 2.85, 95 per cent CI 2.05 to 3.98, p less than 0.0001). This, in 2009, was the first time a targeted monotherapy has demonstrated significantly longer PFS than doublet chemotherapy. === EGFR diagnostic tests === Roche Diagnostics, Genzyme, QIAGEN, Argenomics S.A. & other companies make tests to detect EGFR mutations, designed to help predict which lung cancer patients may respond best to some therapies, including gefitinib and erlotinib. The tests examine the genetics of tumors removed for biopsy for mutations that make them susceptible to treatment. The EGFR mutation test may also help AstraZeneca win regulatory approval for use of their drugs as initial therapies. Currently the TK inhibitors are approved for use only after other drugs fail. In the case of gefitinib, the drug works only in about 10% of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. == Adverse effects == As gefitinib is a selective chemotherapeutic agent, its tolerability profile is better than previous cytotoxic agents. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are acceptable for a potentially fatal disease. Acne-like rash is reported very commonly. Other common adverse effects (≥1% of patients) include: diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis, dehydration, skin reactions, paronychia, asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes, asthenia, conjunctivitis, blepharitis. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include: interstitial lung disease, corneal erosion, aberrant eyelash and hair growth. == Resistance == Gefitinib and other first-generation EGFR inhibitors reversibly bind to the receptor protein, effectively competing for the ATP binding pocket. Secondary mutations can arise that alter the binding site, the most common mutation being T790M, where a threonine is replaced by a methionine at amino acid position 790, which is in the ligand-binding domain that typically binds ATP. Threonine 790 is the gatekeeper residue, meaning it is key in determining specificity in the binding pocket. When it is mutated into a methionine, researchers originally hypothesized that it caused drug inhibition due to the steric hindrance of the bulkier methionine that selected for the binding of ATP instead of gefitinib. As of 2008, the current hypothesized mechanism is that resistance to gefitinib is conveyed by increasing the ATP affinity of EGFR on an enzymatic level, meaning that the protein preferentially binds ATP over gefitinib. In order to combat this acquired resistance to gefitinib and other first-generation inhibitors, researchers have used irreversible EGFR inhibitors like neratinib or dacomitinib, called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These new drugs covalently bind to the ATP binding pocket, so when they are attached to EGFR, they cannot be displaced by ATP. Even if the mutated versions of EGFR have a higher affinity for ATP, they will eventually use the irreversible inhibitors as ligands, which effectively shuts down their activity. When enough irreversible ligands have bound to EGFR, proliferation will be halted and apoptosis will be triggered through multiple pathways; for example, Bim can be activated after it is no longer inhibited by ERK, one of the kinases in the EGFR signaling pathway. Even with gefitinib halting progression of NSCLC, the development of the cancer progresses after 9 to 13 months due to acquired resistances like the T790M mutation. These TKIs like dacomitinib extended overall survival by close to a year. == References == == External links == ""Gefitinib"".

967,"('Loxapine', 'Cloxazepine', 'Oxilapine', 'Loxitane', 'Loxapin')",Medical,"Loxapine, sold under the brand names Loxitane and Adasuve (inhalation only) among others, is a tricyclic antipsychotic medication used primarily in the treatment of schizophrenia. The medicine is a member of the dibenzoxazepine class and structurally very similar to clozapine. Several researchers have argued that loxapine, initially classified as a typical antipsychotic, behaves as an atypical antipsychotic. Loxapine may be metabolized by N-demethylation to amoxapine, a tricyclic antidepressant. == Medical uses == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved loxapine inhalation powder for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder in adults. A brief review of loxapine found no conclusive evidence that it was particularly effective in patients with schizophrenia. A subsequent systematic review considered that the limited evidence did not indicate a clear difference in its effects from other antipsychotics. === Available forms === Loxapine can be taken by mouth. It is also available as an intramuscular injection and as a powder for inhalation. == Side effects == Loxapine can cause side effects that are generally similar to that of other antipsychotic medications. These include, e.g., gastrointestinal problems (like constipation and abdominal pain), cardiovascular problems (like tachycardia), moderate likelihood of drowsiness (relative to other antipsychotics), and movement problems (i.e. extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS]). At lower dosages its propensity for causing EPS appears to be similar to that of atypical antipsychotics. Although it is structurally similar to clozapine, it has much lower risk of agranulocytosis (which, even with clozapine, is 0.8%); however, mild and temporary fluctuations in blood leukocyte levels can occur. Abuse of loxapine has been reported. The inhaled formulation of loxapine carries a low risk for a type of airway adverse reaction called bronchospasm that is not thought to occur when loxapine is taken by mouth. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Some scientists say loxapine is a ""mid-potency"" typical antipsychotic. However, unlike most other typical antipsychotics, it has significant potency at the 5HT2A receptor (6.6 nM), which is similar to atypical antipsychotics like clozapine (5.35 nM). The higher likelihood of EPS with loxapine, compared to clozapine, may be due to its higher affinity for the D2 receptor compared to clozapine, which has one of the lowest binding affinities at the D2 receptor of any antipsychotic. === Pharmacokinetics === Loxapine is metabolized to amoxapine, as well as its 8-hydroxy metabolite (8-hydroxyloxapine). Amoxapine is further metabolized to its 8-hydroxy metabolite (8-hydroxyamoxapine), which is also found in the blood of people taking loxapine. At steady-state after taking loxapine by mouth, the relative amounts of loxapine and its metabolites in the blood is as follows: 8-hydroxyloxapine > 8-hydroxyamoxapine > loxapine. The pharmacokinetics of loxapine change depending on how it is given. Intramuscular injections of loxapine lead to higher blood levels and area under the curve of loxapine than when it is taken by mouth. == Chemistry == Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine and is structurally very similar to clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic. == References == == External links == ""Loxapine"".

Evidence suggests there may be a link between Cx43 hemichannel activity and inflammation in the diabetic kidney. The consequences of blocking tubular Cx43 hemichannel-mediated ATP release in priming/activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a model of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) was investigated. We examined downstream markers of inflammation and the proinflammatory and chemoattractant role of the tubular secretome on macrophage recruitment and activation. Analysis of human transcriptomic data from the Nephroseq repository correlated gene expression to renal function in DKD. Primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were cultured in high glucose and inflammatory cytokines as a model of DKD to assess Cx43 hemichannel activity, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and epithelial-to-macrophage paracrine-mediated crosstalk. Tonabersat assessed a role for Cx43 hemichannels. Transcriptomic analysis from renal biopsies of patients with DKD showed that increased Cx43 and NLRP3 expression correlated with declining glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased proteinuria. In vitro, Tonabersat blocked glucose/cytokine-dependant increases in Cx43 hemichannel-mediated ATP release and reduced expression of inflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RPTECs. We observed a reciprocal relationship in which NLRP3 activity exacerbated increased Cx43 expression and hemichannel-mediated ATP release, events driven by nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB)-mediated priming and Cx43 hemichannel opening, changes blocked by Tonabersat. Conditioned media (CM) from RPTECs treated with high glucose/cytokines increased expression of inflammatory markers in MDMs, an effect reduced when macrophages were pre-treated with Tonabersat. Co-culture using conditioned media from Tonabersat-treated RPTECs dampened macrophage inflammatory marker expression and reduced macrophage migration. Using a model of DKD, we report for the first time that high glucose and inflammatory cytokines trigger aberrant Cx43 hemichannel activity, events that instigate NLRP3-induced inflammation in RPTECs and epithelial-to-macrophage crosstalk. Recapitulating observations previously reported in diabetic retinopathy, these data suggest that Cx43 hemichannel blockers (i.e., Tonabersat) may dampen multi-system damage observed in secondary complications of diabetes. Randomized clinical trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of tonabersat compared with placebo as prophylaxis for migraine were systematically reviewed in this study.

For this systematic review, 133 studies were identified. Of these, 131 studies were excluded, and a total of 2 studies (after removal of duplicate publications) met inclusion criteria for methodological quality assessment with the randomized trial study. The evidence for tonabersat for migration prophylaxis failed to demonstrate a reduction when compared to placebo because of a lack of evidence. But the good tolerability supports further exploration of tonabersat in the prevention of migraine attacks. The limitation of this systematic review was a lack of available evidence. There is fair evidence for migraine prophylaxis, but a lack of available evidence for tonabersat for migraine prophylaxis. Although tonabersat failed to demonstrate a significantly greater reduction of migraine headache days than placebo, it was well tolerated. Future work should further investigate the utility of tonabersat in the preventive management of migraine. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease marked by chronic neuroinflammation thought to be mediated by the inflammasome pathway. Connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels contribute to the activation of the inflammasome through the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) inflammasome activation signals. The objective of the study was to evaluate if the Cx43 hemichannel blocker, tonabersat, is effective in modulating the inflammatory response and reducing disability in the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG",Tonabersat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.988221684878226e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.011236953549087048), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07896079868078232)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19723122/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19222510/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28560708/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19723123/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=358, start_index=6, title='Tonabersat, a gap-junction modulator: efficacy and safety in two randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging studies of acute migraine', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19723122/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=358, start_index=6, title='Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study of the cortical spreading depression inhibiting agent tonabersat in migraine prophylaxis - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19222510/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=358, start_index=6, title='Tonabersat Prevents Inflammatory Damage in the Central Nervous System by Blocking Connexin43 Hemichannels - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28560708/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=358, start_index=6, title='Tonabersat, a novel gap-junction modulator for the prevention of migraine - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19723123/?utm_source=openai')])"
969,"('Np-g2-044', 'Ex-a3988', 'S2962')",Medical," Fascin is an actin-binding protein that promotes tumor metastasis. The inhibition of fascin on the progress of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not very clear. Hence, this study explored the potential effect of NP-G2-044, a novel fascin inhibitor, in human NSCLC lines and the Lewis lung cancer (LCC) mice model. The growth of cells was analyzed via CCK-8 assays, and the flow cytometry was adopted for cell cycle and apoptosis analysis, as well as the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells with or without NP-G2-044. The therapy of NP-G2-044, which synergizes with cisplatin and PD-1, was evaluated in the established xenograft Lewis's lung cancer of mice. Fascin was overexpressed in human NSCLC cells, and inhibition of fascin by NP-G2-044 attenuated NSCLC cell growth and remarkably undermined the ability of migration and invasion in vitro, which was related to the reduced epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) including downregulation of N-cadherin and vimentin, and upregulation of E-cadherin. Further results implied that the above changes may be partially mediated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In vivo, NP-G2-044 slowed down tumor development and enhanced overall survival alone, leading to synergistic anticancer effects with cisplatin or PD-1 inhibitor. Fascin inhibition could inhibit the metastasis of NSCLC and has the potential to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin and PD-1 inhibitors by blocking the Wnt/β- catenin pathway.",Np-g2-044,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.615255839889869e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.313594251871109), ('ICAL', -2.7418097943154862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10059193521738052)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.selleckchem.com/datasheet/np-g2-044-S296201-DataSheet.html,https://bydrug.pharmcube.com/news/detail/b58ef8ef8f7934cf45d803495f11a51d,https://www.invivochem.com/np-g2-044.html ', [])"
970,"('Ketoconazole', 'Ketoconazol', 'R 41400', 'Nizoral', 'Panfungol')",Medical,"Ketoconazole, sold under the brand name Nizoral, among others, is an antiandrogen, antifungal, and antiglucocorticoid medication used to treat a number of fungal infections. Applied to the skin it is used for fungal skin infections such as tinea, cutaneous candidiasis, pityriasis versicolor, dandruff, and seborrheic dermatitis. Taken by mouth it is a less preferred option and recommended for only severe infections when other agents cannot be used. Other uses include treatment of excessive male-patterned hair growth in women and Cushing's syndrome. Common side effects when applied to the skin include redness. Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, headache, and liver problems. Liver problems may result in death or the need for a liver transplantation. Other severe side effects when taken by mouth include QT prolongation, adrenocortical insufficiency, and anaphylaxis. It is an imidazole and works by hindering the production of ergosterol required for the fungal cell membrane, thereby slowing growth. Ketoconazole was patented in 1977 by Belgian pharmaceutical company Janssen, and came into medical use in 1981. It is available as a generic medication and formulations that are applied to the skin are over the counter in the United Kingdom. In 2022, it was the 175th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. The formulation that is taken by mouth was withdrawn in the European Union and in Australia in 2013, and in China in 2015. In addition, its use was restricted in the United States and Canada in 2013. == Medical uses == === Topical antifungal === Topically administered ketoconazole is usually prescribed for fungal infections of the skin and mucous membranes, such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (yeast infection or thrush), jock itch, and tinea versicolor. Topical ketoconazole is also used as a treatment for dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp) and for seborrheic dermatitis on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus Malassezia furfur on the skin. === Systemic antifungal === Ketoconazole has activity against many kinds of fungi that may cause human disease, such as Candida, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Blastomyces (although it is not active against Aspergillus), chromomycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis. First made in 1977, ketoconazole was the first orally-active azole antifungal medication. However, ketoconazole has largely been replaced as a first-line systemic antifungal medication by other azole antifungal agents, such as fluconazole and/or itraconazole, because of ketoconazole's greater toxicity, poorer absorption, and more limited spectrum of activity. Ketoconazole is used orally in dosages of 200 to 400 mg per day in the treatment of superficial and deep fungal infections. === Off-label uses === ==== Hair loss ==== Ketoconazole shampoo in conjunction with an oral 5α-reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride has been used off label to treat androgenic alopecia. It was speculated that antifungal properties of ketoconazole reduce scalp microflora and consequently may reduce follicular inflammation that contributes to alopecia. Limited clinical studies suggest ketoconazole shampoo used either alone or in combination with other treatments may be useful in reducing hair loss in some cases. ==== Hormonal ==== The side effects of ketoconazole are sometimes harnessed in the treatment of non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol ergosterol in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800 mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert pregnenolone into androgens, and 11β-hydroxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism. Ketoconazole has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. == Contraindications == Oral ketoconazole has various contraindications, such as concomitant use with certain other drugs due to known drug interactions. Other contraindications of oral ketoconazole include liver disease, adrenal insufficiency, and known hypersensitivity to oral ketoconazole. == Side effects == === Gastrointestinal === Vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, dry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, flatulence, tongue discoloration may occur. === Endocrine === The drug may cause adrenal insufficiency so the level of the adrenocortical hormones should be monitored while taking it. Oral ketoconazole at a dosage range of 400 to 2,000 mg/day has been found to result in a rate of gynecomastia of 21%. === Liver === In July 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that taking ketoconazole by mouth can cause severe liver injuries and adrenal gland problems: adrenal insufficiency and worsening of other related to the gland conditions. It recommends oral tablets should not be a first-line treatment for any fungal infection. It should be used for the treatment of certain fungal infections, known as endemic mycoses, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or not tolerated. As contraindication it should not be used in people with acute or chronic liver disease. === Hypersensitivity === Anaphylaxis after the first dose may occur. Other cases of hypersensitivity include urticaria. === Topical formulations === The topical formulations have not been associated with liver damage, adrenal problems, or drug interactions. These formulations include creams, shampoos, foams, and gels applied to the skin, unlike the ketoconazole tablets, which are taken by mouth. === Pregnancy === Ketoconazole is categorized as pregnancy category C in the US. Research in animals has shown it to cause teratogenesis when administered in high doses. A subsequent trial in Europe failed to show a risk to infants of mothers receiving ketoconazole. == Overdose == In the event of an overdose of oral ketoconazole, treatment should be supportive and based on symptoms. Activated charcoal may be administered within the first hour following overdose of oral ketoconazole. == Interactions == The concomitant use of the following medications is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone irinotecan, lurasidone, colchicine alprazolam, oral midazolam, oral triazolam felodipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin ergot alkaloids: ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, methylergometrine Others: cisapride, nisoldipine, dofetilide, pimozide And is not recommended: carbamazepine, phenytoin gastric acid suppressants: antacids, antimuscarinics, histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors sucralfate rifampin, rifabutin, isoniazid efavirenz, nevirapine Ritonavir is known for increasing activity of the ketoconazole so it is recommended to reduce dosage. There is also a list of drugs which significantly decrease systemic exposure to the ketoconazole and drugs whose systemic exposure is increased by the ketoconazole. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antifungal activity ==== As an antifungal, ketoconazole is structurally similar to imidazole, and interferes with the fungal synthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to ergosterol. Lower doses of fluconazole and itraconazole are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes. Resistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including Candida albicans. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. Multidrug-resistance (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family. ==== Antihormonal activity ==== As an antiandrogen, ketoconazole operates through at least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 40 mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels. It produces this effect through inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Second, ketoconazole is an androgen receptor antagonist, competing with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to the androgen receptor. This effect is thought to be quite weak however, even with high oral doses of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole, along with miconazole, has been found to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor. Ketoconazole is a racemic mixture consisting of cis-(2S,4R)-(−) and cis-(2R,4S)-(+) enantiomers. The cis-(2S,4R) isomer was more potent in inhibiting progesterone 17α,20-lyase than its enantiomer (IC50 values of 0.05 and 2.38 μM, respectively) and in inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase (IC50 values of 0.152 and 0.608 μM, respectively). Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental aromatase. Oral ketoconazole has been used clinically as a steroidogenesis inhibitor in men, women, and children at dosages of 200 to 1,200 mg/day. Numerous small studies have investigated the effects of oral ketoconazole on hormone levels in humans. It has been found in men to significantly decrease testosterone and estradiol levels and to significantly increase luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels, whereas levels of androstenedione, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were unaffected. The ratio of testosterone to estradiol is also decreased during oral ketoconazole therapy in men. Suppression of testosterone levels by ketoconazole is generally partial and has often been found to be transient. Better effects on suppression of testosterone levels have been observed in men when ketoconazole is combined with a GnRH agonist to suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, which prevents compensatory upregulation of luteinizing hormone secretion and consequent activation of gonadal testosterone production. In premenopausal women with polycystic ovary syndrome, ketoconazole has been found to significantly decrease levels of androstenedione and testosterone and significantly increase levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and estradiol. Studies in postmenopausal women with breast cancer have found that ketoconazole significantly decreases androstenedione levels, slightly decreases estradiol levels, and does not affect estrone levels. This indicates minimal inhibition of aromatase by ketoconazole in vivo in humans. Ketoconazole has also been found to decrease levels of endogenous corticosteroids, such as cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone, as well as vitamin D. Ketoconazole has been found to displace dihydrotestosterone and estradiol from sex hormone-binding globulin in vitro, but this was not found to be relevant in vivo. ==== Other activities ==== Ketoconazole has been found to inhibit the activity of the cation channel TRPM5. === Pharmacokinetics === When administered orally, ketoconazole is best absorbed at highly acidic levels, so antacids or other causes of decreased stomach acid levels will lower the drug's absorption. Absorption can be increased by taking it with an acidic beverage, such as cola. Ketoconazole is very lipophilic and tends to accumulate in fatty tissues. == Chemistry == Ketoconazole is a synthetic imidazole. It is a nonsteroidal compound. It is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, levoketoconazole ((2S,4R)-(−)-ketoconazole) and dextroketoconazole ((2R,4S)-(+)-ketoconazole). Levoketoconazole is under development for potential clinical use as a steroidogenesis inhibitor with better tolerability and less toxicity than ketoconazole. Other steroidogenesis inhibitors besides ketoconazole and levoketoconazole include the nonsteroidal compound aminoglutethimide and the steroidal compound abiraterone acetate. == History == Ketoconazole was discovered in 1976 at Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It was patented in 1977, followed by introduction in the United States in July 1981. Following its introduction, ketoconazole was the only systemic antifungal available for almost a decade. Ketoconazole was introduced as the prototypical medication of the imidazole group of antifungals. Oral ketoconazole has been replaced with oral fluconazole or itraconazole for many mycoses. Due to incidence of serious liver toxicity, the use of oral ketoconazole was suspended in France in July 2011, following review. This event triggered an evaluation of oral ketoconazole throughout the rest of the European Union. In 2013, oral ketoconazole was withdrawn in the European Union and Australia, and strict restrictions were placed on the use of oral ketoconazole in the United States and Canada. Oral ketoconazole is indicated for use in these countries when the indication is a severe or life-threatening systemic infection and alternatives are unavailable. However, topical ketoconazole, which does not distribute systemically, is safe and widely used still. Ketoconazole HRA was approved for use in the European Union for treatment of Cushing's syndrome in November 2013. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Ketoconazole is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Ketoconazole has been marketed under a large number of brand names. === Availability === Ketoconazole is available widely throughout the world. In 2013, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that a ban be imposed on the use of oral ketoconazole for systemic use in humans throughout the European Union, after concluding that the risk of serious liver injury from systemic ketoconazole outweighs its benefits. == Research == As of March 2019, oral levoketoconazole (developmental code name COR-003, tentative brand name Recorlev) is phase III clinical trials for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. Oral levoketoconazole may have a lower risk of liver toxicity than oral ketoconazole. == Veterinary use == Ketoconazole is sometimes prescribed as an antifungal by veterinarians for use in pets, often as unflavored tablets that may need to be cut to smaller size for correct dosage. == References ==",Panfungol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.38697710633277893), (' PERSONAL', -0.0002724217774812132), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INFO, MEDICAL', [('INFO', -0.08217193931341171), (',', -0.10621507465839386), ('ĠMED', -0.0007258402765728533), ('ICAL', -3.099436753473128e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004603027831763029)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.693147599697113)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is specifically under development for the treatment of androgen receptor-positive, estrogen receptor-negative, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Vosilasarm was also previously under development for the treatment of sarcopenia (age-related muscle atrophy), osteoporosis, and weight loss due to cancer cachexia, but development for these indications was discontinued. The drug is taken by mouth. Side effects of vosilasarm may include vomiting, dehydration, constipation, decreased appetite, weight loss, changes in sex hormone levels, elevated liver enzymes, and liver toxicity. Vosilasarm is a nonsteroidal SARM, acting as an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens and anabolic steroids like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). However, it shows dissociation of effect between tissues in preclinical studies, with agonistic and anabolic effects in muscle, agonistic effects in breast, and partially agonistic or antagonistic effects in the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. Vosilasarm was developed in 2010 and was first described in the literature in 2011. It was originally developed by Radius Health and is now under development by Ellipses Pharma. The first clinical study of vosilasarm, a small (n=22) phase 1 study in women with metastatic breast cancer, was started in 2017 and completed in 2020, with results published in 2019, 2020, and 2022. As of March 2023, vosilasarm is in phase 1/2 clinical trials for the treatment of breast cancer. Aside from its development as a potential pharmaceutical drug, vosilasarm is on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances and is sold for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by black-market Internet suppliers. Vosilasarm is often used in these contexts at doses that have not been evaluated in clinical trials, with unknown effectiveness and safety. Many products sold online that are purported to be a specific SARM either contain none or contain other unrelated substances. Social media has played an important role in facilitating the widespread non-medical use of SARMs. == Medical uses == Vosilasarm is not approved for any medical use and is not available as a licensed pharmaceutical drug as of 2023. == Side effects == Side effects of vosilasarm in preliminary clinical studies in women with metastatic breast cancer have included vomiting (27%), dehydration (27%), constipation, decreased appetite and weight loss (27%), hypophosphatemia, decreased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels (100%), increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (80%), and abnormal liver function tests, including elevated aspartate aminotransferase (59%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (46%), and elevated total blood bilirubin (27%). In gonadally intact male cynomolgus monkeys, vosilasarm suppressed testosterone levels by around 50% (from ~600–800 ng/dL to ~200–300 ng/dL) across three dose levels (0.01 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, and 1.0 mg/kg). Changes in serum lipids, including of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol were also observed. Elevated liver enzymes were minimally observed in monkeys. A number of case reports of liver toxicity with non-medical use of vosilasarm have been published. A case report of acute myocarditis with non-medical use of vosilasarm also exists. == Overdose == Vosilasarm has been assessed in clinical trials in women with breast cancer at doses ranging from 50 to 150 mg/day, with the maximum safe and tolerated dose being 100 mg/day. The drug sold via black-market Internet suppliers and used non-medically has been reported to be taken at doses of 5 to 30 mg/day, with unknown adverse effects and risks. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Vosilasarm is selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), or a tissue-selective mixed agonist or partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). This receptor is the biological target of endogenous androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and of synthetic anabolic steroids like nandrolone and oxandrolone. Vosilasarm shows high affinity for the AR, with a Ki value of 7 nM (relative to 29 nM for testosterone and 10 nM for DHT). It shows good selectivity for the AR over other steroid hormone receptors, with the closest off-target receptor being the progesterone receptor (IC50 = 750 nM versus 0.2 nM for progesterone). Vosilasarm also shows potent efficacy in terms of AR activation, with an EC50 value of 0.1 nM in the C2C12 osteoblast differentiation assay. The AR is widely expressed in tissues throughout the body, including in the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, genitals, gonads, skin, hair follicles, muscle, bone, heart, adrenal cortex, liver, kidneys, and brain, among others. Vosilasarm has been found to have varying full agonist and partial agonist AR-mediated effects in different tissues, including potent agonistic and anabolic activity in muscle and bone, potent agonistic effects in AR-expressing human breast cancer cell lines, and partial agonist or antagonist activity in the prostate gland and seminal vesicles. In castrated immature male rats, vosilasarm (at 10 mg/kg/day orally, the highest assessed dose) maximally stimulated prostate weight to 67%, seminal vesicle weight to 59%, and levator ani muscle weight to 117% compared to that induced with testosterone propionate 1 mg/kg/day. Moreover, when combined with testosterone propionate, vosilasarm partially antagonized the weight increases of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, reducing them to 84% and 78% (both from 100%), respectively. Conversely however, the combination of testosterone propionate and vosilasarm was additive in terms of levator ani muscle weight stimulation, increasing it to 124%. Vosilasarm was found to stimulate muscle at a dose much lower than that required to stimulate the prostate. A dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day stimulated levator ani muscle weight to a similar extent relative to the levator ani weight in non-castrated controls. Conversely, a 33-fold higher dose of 10 mg/kg/day was required to stimulate prostate weight to a similar extent as that in non-castrated controls. Similarly, in gonadally intact immature rats, 0.3 mg/kg/day vosilasarm stimulated levator ani muscle weight to a similar extent as testosterone propionate 0.5 mg/kg/day, but a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (100-fold higher) was required to stimulate the prostate to a similar extent as testosterone propionate 0.5 mg/kg/day. Hence, in rats, vosilasarm is a potent full agonist of the levator ani muscle but a partial agonist and antagonist of the prostate and seminal vesicles, and is strongly selective for stimulating the levator ani muscle over the prostate gland. In young male cynomolgus monkeys, vosilasarm, at oral doses of 0.01 mg/kg/day, 0.1 mg/kg/day, and 1 mg/kg/day for 28 days, dose-dependently stimulated body weight (+10% at ≥0.1 mg/kg/day) and numerically increased lean body mass. The lack of statistical significance was likely due to the small sample sizes per dosing group (n=3 each). No data on vosilasarm and lean body mass in humans have been published as of 2022. === Pharmacokinetics === Vosilasarm shows good oral bioavailability in rats (27–63%) and monkeys (65–75%) and is orally active in humans. The elimination half-life of vosilasarm is 45 to 60 hours. == Chemistry == Vosilasarm is an oxadiazole aniline derivative. Other aniline SARMs include AC-262536 and ACP-105. == History == Vosilasarm was developed by Radius Health in 2010. It was first described in in the literature in 2011 in a paper detailing its design, synthesis, and preclinical characterization in vitro and in rats and monkeys. It was stated in this paper that phase 1 clinical studies of vosilasarm for treatment of severe weight loss due to cancer cachexia were being prepared. However, these studies were never completed or published and development for this indication was discontinued. Subsequently, vosilasarm was repurposed for the treatment of breast cancer. == Society and culture == === Names === Vosilasarm is the generic name of the drug and its International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It is also known by its pharmaceutical developmental code names RAD140 (Radius Health) and EP0062 (Ellipses Pharma). Additionally, vosilasarm is known by the black-market name Testolone or Testalone. === Non-medical use === Vosilasarm and other SARMs are sold by black-market vendors on the Internet. Aside from vosilasarm, the other most commonly used SARMs include enobosarm (ostarine; GTx-024, S-22), LGD-4033 (VK5211; ""ligandrol""), and andarine (GTx-007; S-4). Social media has played an important role in facilitating the widespread non-medical use of SARMs. == Research == The first-in-human study, a phase 1 trial, was initiated in October 2017 and completed in September 2020 in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

972,"('Iloperidone', 'Hp 873', 'Zomaril', 'Fanapt', 'Fanapta')",Medical,"Iloperidone, sold under the brand name Fanapt among others, is an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. == Medical uses == Iloperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and mania or mixed episodes in bipolar I disorder. In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectivity in treating schizophrenic symptoms, iloperidone demonstrated mild effectiveness — as effective as lurasidone, and 13 to 15% less effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine. It generally appears to work better than placebo. == Side effects == Examination of the safety and tolerability of iloperidone have shown that at a 5 mg/day dose in healthy male volunteers, the drug was fairly well tolerated, although hypotension, dizziness, and somnolence were very common side effects ranging from mild to moderate in severity. A second study showed that co administration of food decreased the severity of these effects. This study also indicated that repeat administration of iloperidone could decrease the effects of hypotension. The approved dose is 12–24 mg, not 5 mg. However, claims of better tolerance have been reported. === Withdrawal === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual taper when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal symptoms or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Pharmacology == Iloperidone exerts its effects by acting upon and antagonizing specific neurotransmitters, particularly multiple dopamine and serotonin receptor subtypes. It is considered an 'atypical' antipsychotic because it displays serotonin receptor antagonism, similar to other atypical antipsychotics. The older typical antipsychotics are primarily dopamine antagonists. Iloperidone has been shown to act as an antagonist at all tested receptors except for 5-HT2A. It exhibits high (nM) affinity to serotonin 5-HT2A (Ki value of 5.6 nM) where it acts as a inverse agonist. Antagonism occurs at all other receptors following dopamine D2 (6.3 nM) and D3 (7.1 nM) and α1-adrenergic receptors (0.36 nM), moderate affinity for dopamine D4 (25 nM), serotonin 5-HT6 (43 nM), 5-HT7 (22 nM), and low affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A (168 nM), dopamine D1, and histamine H1 receptors. In addition, pharmacogenomic studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with an enhanced response to iloperidone during acute treatment of schizophrenia. == History == Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc. made initial inquiries into the drug; however, in May 1996, they discontinued research, and in June 1997 gave research rights to Titan Pharmaceuticals. Titan then handed over worldwide development, manufacturing and marketing rights to Novartis in August 1998. On June 9, 2004, Titan Pharmaceuticals announced that the Phase III development rights have been acquired by Vanda Pharmaceuticals. The original launch date was scheduled for 2002. On November 27, 2007, Vanda Pharmaceuticals announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had accepted their New Drug Application for iloperidone, confirming the application is ready for FDA review and approval. On July 28, 2008, the FDA issued a not-approvable letter to Vanda Pharmaceuticals concerning the drug, stating that further trials are required before a decision can be made concerning marketed usage of iloperidone. Iloperidone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States on May 6, 2009. and for treating bipolar I disorder in April 2024. == See also == List of investigational anxiolytics Lidanserin == References == == External links == Fanapt Prescribing Information",Fanapta,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001962522976100445), ('ICAL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005575056420639157)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0206720617134124e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu](https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/37268/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=9, title='API | iloperidone', type='url_citation', url='https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/37268/?utm_source=openai')])"

It has potential for illnesses characterized by excess 5-HT, such as diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and carcinoid diarrhea. In vitro, inhibition of TPH1 occurred in 10(-8) -10(-7) mol L(-1) range. In vivo in rodents, LX-1031 has no effect on brain 5-HT while dose-dependently reducing 5-HT, particularly in the small bowel. After oral LX1031 in humans, systemic exposure is very low, plasma concentrations are linear in dose range 250-750 mg q.i.d.; the median T(1/2) for elimination is ∼ 20 h, and repeat administration for 14 days doubles C(max) . In ascending-single-dose and multiple-dose (14 days) trials in healthy volunteers, LX-1031, 2-4 g day(-1) significantly reduced urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) starting by Day 5, and persisting over the 14 day exposure. There are no dose-limiting toxicities in healthy subjects or remarkable adverse effects in clinical trials to date. Over a 28-day treatment period, LX-1031 was associated with improved weekly global scores (2/4 weeks) and improved stool consistency with lower urinary 5-HIAA excretion. LX-1031 appears promising for chronic diarrhea associated with increased 5-HT expression including IBS-D. Optimal doses, efficacy and safety in IBS clinical trials need to be fully elucidated; low systemic exposure, selectivity for TPH1 over TPH2, and lack of effect on brain 5-HT in several species suggest that LX-1031 is unlikely to cause affective disorders. LX-1031, being developed by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, is an oral, small-molecule tryptophan 5-hydroxylase (TPH) inhibitor that reduces 5-HT synthesis peripherally. LX-1031 is being developed for the potential treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), which is characterized by excess 5-HT. In preclinical studies, LX-1031 dose-dependently reduced expression of 5-HT in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, but had no effect on brain 5-HT levels. In ascending single-dose and multiple-dose (14 day) phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers, LX-1031 significantly reduced urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA; a marker of 5-HT metabolism) levels, starting by day 5 and persisting over the duration of exposure. In a phase II clinical trial in patients with IBS-D, a 1000-mg qid dose of LX-1031 was associated with improved weekly global scores and stool consistency, and lower urinary 5-HIAA levels over a 28-day treatment period. LX-1031 was well tolerated in trials to date. In conclusion, LX-1031 appears promising for IBS-D.

We investigated the potential role of acrizanib in physiological angiogenesis using C57BL/6J newborn mice, and pathological angiogenesis using the mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) models. Moreover, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used as an in vitro model for studying the molecular mechanism underlying acrizanib's antiangiogenic effects. The intravitreal injection of acrizanib did not show a considerable impact on physiological angiogenesis and retinal thickness, indicating a potentially favorable safety profile. In the mouse models of OIR and CNV, acrizanib showed promising results in reducing pathological neovascularization, inflammation, and vascular leakage, indicating its potential efficacy against pathological angiogenesis. Consistent with in vivo results, acrizanib blunted angiogenic events in VEGF-treated HUVECs such as proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Furthermore, acrizanib inhibited the multisite phosphorylation of VEGFR2 to varying degrees and the activation of its downstream signal pathways in VEGF-treated HUVECs. This study suggested the potential efficacy and safety of acrizanib in suppressing fundus neovascularization. Acrizanib functioned through inhibiting multiple phosphorylation sites of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells to different degrees. These results indicated that acrizanib might hold promise as a potential candidate for the treatment of ocular vascular diseases. A noninvasive topical ocular therapy for the treatment of neovascular or ""wet"" age-related macular degeneration would provide a patient administered alternative to the current standard of care, which requires physician administered intravitreal injections. This manuscript describes a novel strategy for the use of in vivo models of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as the primary means of developing SAR related to efficacy from topical administration. Ultimately, this effort led to the discovery of acrizanib (LHA510), a small-molecule VEGFR-2 inhibitor with potency and efficacy in rodent CNV models, limited systemic exposure after topical ocular administration, multiple formulation options, and an acceptable rabbit ocular PK profile. To evaluate whether topical acrizanib (LHA510), a small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, could suppress the need for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy over a 12-week period in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. A phase 2 multicenter randomized double-masked, vehicle-controlled proof-of-concept study. Trial includes n = 90 patients with active choroidal neovascularization due to neovascular age-related macular degeneration and under anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. All patients received an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab at baseline and were retreated when there was evidence of disease recurrence (rescue). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive topical LHA510 or vehicle for 12 weeks. Drops were administered twice a day for 8 weeks and then 3 times a day for the last 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the number of patients requiring rescue over 84 days of topical dosing. Key secondary outcome measures were time to first rescue, total number of ranibizumab injections, changes in central subfield thickness, and changes of visual acuity from baseline to day 84. The extended per protocol set included 70 patients of whom 25 of 33 patients in the LHA510 group (75.8%) and 25 of 37 patients in the placebo group (67.6%) required rescue by day 84 (P = .8466). Secondary and subgroup analysis did not support evidence of efficacy.

It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It may be used for prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is sold both by itself and in combination as efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, nausea, headache, feeling tired, and trouble sleeping. Some of the rashes may be serious such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Other serious side effects include depression, thoughts of suicide, liver problems, and seizures. It is not safe for use during pregnancy. It is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and works by blocking the function of reverse transcriptase. Efavirenz was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998, and in the European Union in 1999. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. As of 2016, it is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == For HIV infection that has not previously been treated, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines recommends the use of efavirenz in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) as one of the preferred NNRTI-based regimens in adults and adolescents and children. Efavirenz is also used in combination with other antiretroviral agents as part of an expanded post-exposure prophylaxis regimen to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people exposed to a significant risk (e.g. needlestick injuries, certain types of unprotected sex, etc.). === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Efavirenz is safe to use during the first trimester of pregnancy. Efavirenz passes into breast milk and breast-fed infants may be exposed to efavirenz. == Contraindications == People who have taken this medication before and experienced an allergic reaction should avoid taking further efavirenz dosages. Hypersensitivity reactions include Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic skin eruptions, and erythema multiforme. == Adverse effects == Neuropsychiatric effects are the most common adverse effects, and include disturbed sleep (including nightmares, insomnia, disrupted sleep, and daytime fatigue), dizziness, headaches, vertigo, blurred vision, anxiety, and cognitive impairment (including fatigue, confusion, and memory and concentration problems), and depression, including suicidal thinking. Some people experience euphoria. Rash and nausea may occur. Use of efavirenz can produce a false positive result in some urine tests for marijuana. Efavirenz may lengthen the QT interval so should not be used in people with or at risk of torsades de pointes. Efavirenz may cause convulsions in adult and pediatric populations who have a history of seizures. == Interactions == Efavirenz is broken down in the liver by enzymes that belong to the cytochrome P450 system, which include both CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Efavirenz is a substrate of these enzymes and can decrease the metabolism of other drugs that require the same enzymes. However, efavirenz also induces these enzymes, which means the enzyme activity is enhanced and the metabolism of other drugs broken down by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 can be increased. People who are taking both efavirenz and other drugs metabolized by the same enzymes might need the dose of their drugs to be increased or decreased. One group of drugs that efavirenz affects is protease inhibitors, which are used for HIV/AIDS. Efavirenz will lower the blood levels of most protease inhibitors, including amprenavir, atazanavir, and indinavir. At lowered levels, protease inhibitors may not be effective in people taking both drugs, which means the virus that causes HIV/AIDS won't be stopped from replicating and may become resistant to the protease inhibitor. Efavirenz also affects antifungal drugs, which are used for fungal infections such as urinary tract infections. Similar to the effect seen with protease inhibitors, efavirenz lowers the blood levels of antifungal drugs like voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole. As a result of lowered levels, antifungal drugs may not be effective in people taking both drugs, which means that the fungi that cause the infection may become resistant to the antifungal. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Anti-HIV effects ==== Efavirenz falls in the NNRTI class of antiretrovirals. Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RTIs inhibit the same target, the reverse transcriptase enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Unlike nucleoside RTIs, which bind at the enzyme's active site, NNRTIs act allosterically by binding to a distinct site away from the active site known as the NNRTI pocket. Efavirenz is not effective against HIV-2, as the pocket of the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase has a different structure, which confers intrinsic resistance to the NNRTI class. As most NNRTIs bind within the same pocket, viral strains which are resistant to efavirenz are usually also resistant to the other NNRTIs, nevirapine and delavirdine. The most common mutation observed after efavirenz treatment is K103N, which is also observed with other NNRTIs. Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and efavirenz have different binding targets, so cross-resistance is unlikely; the same is true with regard to efavirenz and protease inhibitors. ==== Neuropsychiatric effects ==== Efavirenz has been found to have affinity for a variety of targets to varying degrees and appears to act as an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A (specifically Gq signaling), 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors, as an inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT6 receptor, as a dual GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator and orthosteric site antagonist, as a serotonin–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SDRI), as a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor, as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) of MAO-A, and as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M3 receptors. Efavirenz produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of serotonergic psychedelic effects, in animals, and can partially substitute for LSD and MDMA in animal drug discrimination tests. Induction of the head-twitch response and substitution for LSD by efavirenz can be abolished by serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists or serotonin 5-HT2A receptor knockout. Efavirenz does not substitute for cocaine or carisoprodol. The drug is not self-administered and does not produce conditioned place preference (CPP) in animals. As of 2016 the mechanism of efavirenz's neuropsychiatric adverse effects was not clear. It appears to produce neurotoxicity, possibly by interfering with mitochondrial function, which may in turn possibly be caused by inhibiting creatine kinase but also possibly by disrupting mitochondrial membranes or by interfering with nitric oxide signalling. Some neuropsychiatric adverse effects may be mediated through cannabinoid receptors, or through activity at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, but efavirenz interacts with many central nervous system targets, so this is not clear. The neuropsychiatric adverse effects are dose-dependent. Although efavirenz appears to act as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, it has been suggested that it might exert functional selectivity and act as an agonist of the receptor for certain signaling pathways, which could in turn explain its hallucinogenic and LSD-like effects. However, this hypothesis remains to be evaluated. Conversely, research suggests that efavirenz may actually be a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The effects of efavirenz in animals and humans are consistent with it being a serotonergic psychedelic. === Pharmacokinetics === The onset of action of efavirenz is 3 to 5 hours and its elimination half-life is 52 to 76 hours with a single dose and 40 to 55 hours with continuous administration. The shorter half-life with chronic administration may be due to induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes by efavirenz. == Chemistry == Efavirenz is chemically described as (4S)-6-chloro-4-(2-cyclopropylethynyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one. Its empirical formula is C14H9ClF3NO2. Efavirenz is a white to slightly pink crystalline powder with a molecular mass of 315.68 g/mol. It is practically insoluble in water (<10 μg/mL). == History == Efavirenz was approved by the FDA on 21 September 1998. On 17 February 2016, the FDA approved the generic tablet formulation to be produced by Mylan. In late 2018, Thailand's Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) announced that it will produce efavirenz after receiving WHO approval. Efavirenz code name is DMP 266, discovered by Du pont Pharma. European countries are set to receive the license for manufacturing of Efavirenz in May 1999. == Society and culture == === Pricing information === A one-month supply of 600 mg tablets costs approximately US$1,010 in July 2016. In 2007, Merck provided Efavirenz in certain developing countries and countries largely affected by HIV for about US$0.65 per day. Some emerging countries have opted to purchase Indian generics. In Thailand, a one-month supply of efavirenz + Truvada, as of June 2012, cost 2,900 baht (US$90), and there is a social program for patients who cannot afford the medication. As of 2018 Thailand will produce efavirenz domestically. Its Government Pharmaceutical Organization product costs 180 baht per bottle of thirty 600 mg tablets. The imported version in Thailand retails for more than 1,000 baht per bottle. GPO will devote 2.5 percent of its manufacturing capacity to make 42 million efavirenz pills in 2018, allowing it to serve export markets as well as domestic. The Philippines alone will order about 300,000 bottles of efavirenz for 51 million baht. In South Africa, a license has been granted to generics giant Aspen Pharmacare to manufacture, and distribute to sub-Saharan Africa, a cost-effective antiretroviral drug. === Recreational use === Abuse of efavirenz by crushing and smoking the tablets for supposed hallucinogenic and dissociative effects has been reported in South Africa, where it is used in a mixture known as whoonga and nyaope. Researcher Hamilton Morris described efavirenz as ""classically psychedelic."" === Brands === As of 2016, efavirenz is marketed in various jurisdictions under the brand names Adiva, Avifanz, Efamat, Efatec, Efavir, Efavirenz, Efcure, Eferven, Efrin, Erige, Estiva, Evirenz, Filginase, Stocrin, Sulfina V, Sustiva, Virorrever, and Zuletel.

Open studies of the use of azithromycin, letrazuril and paromomycin in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and confirmed cryptosporidial diarrhoea for at least a month. Azithromycin 500 mg daily was ineffective. Letrazuril 150-200 mg daily was associated with an improvement in symptoms in 40% of patients treated and cessation of excretion of cryptosporidial oocysts in the stool in 70%; however biopsies remained positive. Paromomycin therapy was associated with a complete resolution of diarrhoea in 60% of patients treated and some improvement in symptoms in a further 5% but it did not eliminate the infection. None of the drugs had any major toxicities. Dose escalation studies of azithromycin should be performed. Letrazuril should be further investigated for efficacy in double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Paromomycin appears to result in prolonged symptomatic remission of cryptosporidial diarrhoea, but has no effect on cryptosporidial cholangitis. The intestinal parasite Cryptosporidium is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in AIDS patients and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. No effective treatment is currently available for this condition. Here we aim to determine the safety, tolerance, and clinical effect of letrazuril in the treatment of AIDS-related Cryptosporidiosis. A prospective, open-label study of letrazuril was performed. The study was conducted at the Immune Deficiency Treatment Centre (IDTC) of Montreal General Hospital, a tertiary-care centre with inpatient and outpatient facilities. All HIV-positive patients presenting to the IDTC between November 1991 and January 1993 who had symptomatic intestinal Cryptosporidiosis were enrolled in this protocol. Sixteen participants entered the study and 15 were available for evaluation, having completed at least 2 weeks on the study medication. Patients received letrazuril daily in escalating doses of 50 to 100 mg orally for 6 weeks. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed weekly during the treatment phase, with a follow-up evaluation 4 weeks after the end of this phase, for a total study period of 10 weeks. Response to letrazuril was assessed by eradication of Cryptosporidial oocysts from the stool and symptomatic improvement in diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Haematological, biochemical, and electrocardiographic parameters were also studied to evaluate potential toxicities of the treatment. Fourteen evaluable patients had baseline CD4 lymphocyte counts ranging from 3 to 99 x 10(6)/l cells (mean, 30 x 10(6)/l cells). (The fifteenth evaluable patient had a CD4 count 235 x 10(6)/l.) Of these 14 patients, five showed a major response (symptomatic improvement and eradication of Cryptosporidial oocysts from the stool), two had a minor response (symptomatic improvement with persistence of oocysts in stool), and seven had no response to therapy with letrazuril. Seven patients developed a transient drug-related rash. Fifty per cent of the AIDS patients in this study experienced an improvement in their Cryptosporidial disease while receiving letrazuril. No serious dose-related toxicities were observed. Larger Phase II trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of letrazuril in AIDS-associated intestinal Cryptosporidiosis. Thirty-five AIDS patients (mean CD4 count 44 x 10(6)/L) with chronic cryptosporidiosis were treated with letrazuril at an initial oral daily dose of 50 mg in an open-label Phase I prospective trial. Treatment was continued for > or = 10 days and for as long as there was a response. The majority of subjects (91%), had previously failed paromomycin treatment. At baseline, 74% of patients had moderate (five to nine bowel movements per day) to severe (> 10 bowel movements per day) diarrhea. Twenty-three subjects (66%) had a clinical response within a mean of 1.7 weeks of treatment initiation. Twenty-two patients had a partial response (> 50% reduction in bowel movements per day for > or = 1 week), one patient had a complete response (two or fewer bowel movements per day). Of the responders, 15 (65%) had a clinical relapse with worsening diarrhea at an average of 1.2 months following initiation of letrazuril. The other eight (35%) had had symptom control for an average of 2.9 months from initiation of letrazuril to the latest follow-up. Microbiologic eradication was demonstrated in 10 (40%) of 25 patients with follow-up stool examinations. Seven patients (20%) experienced a rash, all within 1 week of starting the drug, and resolved in all patients when the drug was discontinued. In conclusion, severely immunocompromised AIDS patients with refractory cryptosporidiosis may show a modest, short-lived response to letrazuril. Microbiologic response is variable and relapse high.

In March 2000, BX-471 was undergoing phase I trials for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases [362022]; phase I trials in MS were ongoing in March 2002 [441989], [443941]. Positive results from these trials have been reported and Berlex was planning phase II trials in MS patients as of mid-March 2002 [444906].

A major challenge in the application of structure-based drug design methods to proteins belonging to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is the paucity of structural information (1). The 19 chemokine receptors, belonging to the Class A family of GPCRs, are important drug targets not only for autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis but also for the blockade of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 entry (2). Using the MembStruk computational method (3), we predicted the three-dimensional structure of the human CCR1 receptor. In addition, we predicted the binding site of the small molecule CCR1 antagonist BX 471, which is currently in Phase II clinical trials (4). Based on the predicted antagonist binding site we designed 17 point mutants of CCR1 to validate the predictions. Subsequent competitive ligand binding and chemotaxis experiments with these mutants gave an excellent correlation to these predictions. In particular, we find that Tyr-113 and Tyr-114 on transmembrane domain 3 and Ile-259 on transmembrane 6 contribute significantly to the binding of BX 471. Finally, we used the predicted and validated structure of CCR1 in a virtual screening validation of the Maybridge data base, seeded with selective CCR1 antagonists. The screen identified 63% of CCR1 antagonists in the top 5% of the hits.

982,"('Flucytosine', 'Ro 2-9915', 'Ancobon', 'Ancotil', 'Fluorocytosine')",Medical,"Flucytosine, also known as 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), is an antifungal medication. It is specifically used, together with amphotericin B, for serious Candida infections and cryptococcosis. It may be used by itself or with other antifungals for chromomycosis. Flucytosine is used by mouth and by injection into a vein. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, and psychosis. Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions occasionally occur. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Flucytosine is in the fluorinated pyrimidine analogue family of medications. It works by being converted into fluorouracil inside the fungus, which impairs its ability to make protein. Flucytosine was first made in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. As of 2016, in the United States the medication cost about US$2,000 per day while in the United Kingdom it is about US$22 per day. It is not available in much of the developing world. == Medical uses == Flucytosine by mouth is used for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida or Cryptococcus neoformans. It can also be used for the treatment of chromomycosis (chromoblastomycosis), if susceptible strains cause the infection. Flucytosine must not be used as a sole agent in life-threatening fungal infections due to relatively weak antifungal effects and fast development of resistance, but rather in combination with amphotericin B and/or azole antifungals such as fluconazole or itraconazole. Minor infections such as candidal cystitis may be treated with flucytosine alone. In some countries, treatment with slow intravenous infusions for no more than a week is also a therapeutic option, particular if the disease is life-threatening. Serious fungal infections may occur in those who are immunocompromised. These people benefit from combination therapy including flucytosine, but the incidence of side-effects of a combination therapy, particular with amphotericin B, may be higher. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === In animal models (rats), flucytosine has been found to be teratogenic. Sufficient human data does not exist. Pregnant women should be given flucytosine only if the potential benefits exceed the potential harm to the fetus. It is not known if flucytosine is distributed in human breast milk. Given the potential risk to the child, the patient should not breastfeed during treatment with flucytosine. === Children === The efficacy and safety in patients under 18 years of age has not been determined. == Side effects == Patients treated with drugs compromising bone marrow function (e.g. cytostatics) should be treated carefully. Blood cell counts should be taken very frequently. Patients with renal disease should receive flucytosine cautiously and in reduced doses. Guidelines for proper dosing exist. Serum level determinations are mandatory for these patients. All patients receiving flucytosine should be under strict medical supervision. Hematological, renal and liver function studies should be done frequently during therapy (initially daily, twice a week for the rest of treatment). Patients with preexisting bone marrow depression and liver impairment should be treated with caution. Antiproliferative actions on bone marrow and GI tissue: Due to the drug's preference for rapidly proliferating tissues, bone marrow depression (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, or even rarely agranulocytosis) may occur. Aplastic anemia has also been seen. Bone marrow toxicity can be irreversible and may cause death, particularly in immunocompromised patients. GI toxicity may be severe or rarely fatal and consists of anorexia, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, duodenal ulcer, GI hemorrhage, nausea, vomiting, and ulcerative colitis. Liver function: Elevations of liver enzymes and bilirubin, hepatic dysfunction, jaundice and, in one patient, liver necrosis have all been seen. Some fatal cases have been reported; however, the majority of cases was reversible. Renal function: Increased BUN and serum creatinine have been noted. Crystalluria (formation of crystals and excretion in the urine) and acute kidney injury have also been seen. Adverse central nervous system effects are frequent and include confusion, hallucinations, psychosis, ataxia, hearing loss, headache, paresthesia, parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, vertigo and sedation. Skin reactions: Rash, pruritus, and photosensitivity have all been noticed. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome) may also be encountered and may be life-threatening. Anaphylaxis: Sometimes cases of anaphylaxis consisting of diffuse erythema, pruritus, conjunctival injection, fever, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension and bronchospastic reactions are observed. It is not known if flucytosine is a human carcinogen. The issue has been raised because traces of 5-fluorouracil, which is a known carcinogen, are found in the colon resulting from the metabolization of flucytosine. == Interactions == Flucytosine may increase the toxicity of amphotericin B and vice versa, although the combination may be life-saving and should be used whenever indicated (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). The cytostatic cytarabine inhibits the antimycotic activity of flucytosine. == Overdose == Symptoms and their severities are unknown, because flucytosine is used under close medical supervision, but expected to be an excess of the usually encountered side effects on the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney function. Vigorous hydration and hemodialysis may be helpful in removing the drug from the body. Hemodialysis is particular useful in patients with impaired renal function. == Pharmacology == === Mechanisms of action === Two major mechanisms of action have been elucidated: Flucytosine is intrafungally converted into the cytostatic fluorouracil which undergoes further steps of activation and finally interacts as 5-fluorouridinetriphosphate with RNA biosynthesis thus disturbing the building of certain essential proteins. Flucytosine also undergoes conversion into 5-fluorodeoxyuridinemonophosphate which inhibits fungal DNA synthesis. === Spectrum of susceptible fungi and resistance === Flucytosine is active in vitro as well as in vivo against some strains of Candida and Cryptococcus. Limited studies demonstrate that flucytosine may be of value against infections with Sporothrix, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Exophiala, and Phialophora. Resistance is quite commonly seen as well in treatment-naive patients and under current treatment with flucytosine. In different strains of Candida resistance has been noted to occur in 1 to 50% of all specimens obtained from patients. === Pharmacokinetic data === Flucytosine is well absorbed (75 to 90%) from the gastrointestinal tract. Intake with meals slows the absorption, but does not decrease the amount absorbed. Following an oral dose of 2 grams peak serum levels are reached after approximately 6 hours. The time to peak level decreases with continued therapy. After 4 days peak levels are measured after 2 hours. The drug is eliminated renally. In normal patients flucytosine has reportedly a half-life of 2.5 to 6 hours. In patients with impaired renal function higher serum levels are seen and the drug tends to accumulate. The drug is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine (90% of an oral dose) and only traces are metabolized and excreted in the feces. Therapeutic serum levels range from 25 to 100 μg/ml. Serum levels in excess of 100 μg are associated with a higher incidence of side effects. Periodic measurements of serum levels are recommended for all patients and are a must in patients with renal damage. == Economics == Although a generic, off patent medication in the U.S., as of January 2016, there was only one FDA-approved pharmaceutical supplier, Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Due to this monopoly, the cost per 250 mg tablet was $70.46 per tablet for a daily treatment cost of ~$2110/day for a 75 kg adult (165 pounds) adult and $29,591 for a two-week treatment course as of December 2015. This cost of flucytosine is more than 100-fold higher in the U.S. than in the United Kingdom and Europe via Meda AB Pharmaceuticals. == Other animals == In some countries, such as Switzerland, flucytosine has been licensed to treat cats, dogs and birds (in most cases together with amphotericin B) for the same indications as in humans. == References == == External links == ""Flucytosine"".

983,"('Ex-a1828', 'Tp 3654')",Medical," Myelofibrosis (MF) is the deadliest form of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). The JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib can reduce constitutional symptoms but it does not substantially improve bone marrow fibrosis. Pim1 expression is significantly elevated in MPN/MF hematopoietic progenitors. Here, we show that genetic ablation of Pim1 blocked the development of myelofibrosis induced by Jak2V617F and MPLW515L. Pharmacologic inhibition of Pim1 with a second-generation Pim kinase inhibitor TP-3654 significantly reduced leukocytosis and splenomegaly, and attenuated bone marrow fibrosis in Jak2V617F and MPLW515L mouse models of MF. Combined treatment of TP-3654 and Ruxolitinib resulted in greater reduction of spleen size, normalization of blood leukocyte counts and abrogation of bone marrow fibrosis in murine models of MF. TP-3654 treatment also preferentially inhibited Jak2V617F mutant hematopoietic progenitors in mice. Mechanistically, we show that TP-3654 treatment significantly inhibits mTORC1, MYC and TGF-β signaling in Jak2V617F mutant hematopoietic cells and diminishes the expression of fibrotic markers in the bone marrow. Collectively, our results suggest that Pim1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MF, and inhibition of Pim1 with TP-3654 might be useful for treatment of MF. Human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) mediates the transport of a wide variety of conventional cytotoxic anticancer drugs and molecular targeted agents. Consequently, the overexpression of ABCG2 in cancer cells is linked to the development of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. TP-3654 is an experimental second-generation inhibitor of PIM kinase that is currently under investigation in clinical trials to treat advanced solid tumors and myelofibrosis. In this study, we discovered that by attenuating the drug transport function of ABCG2, TP-3654 resensitizes ABCG2-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cancer cells to cytotoxic ABCG2 substrate drugs topotecan, SN-38 and mitoxantrone. Moreover, our results indicate that ABCG2 does not mediate resistance to TP-3654 and may not play a major role in the induction of resistance to TP-3654 in cancer patients.

986,"('Amiloride (hydrochloride)', 'Amipramidin', 'Midamor', 'Guanamprazine', 'Amipramizid')",Medical,"Amiloride, sold under the trade name Midamor among others, is a medication typically used with other medications to treat high blood pressure or swelling due to heart failure or cirrhosis of the liver. Amiloride is classified as a potassium-sparing diuretic. Amiloride is often used together with another diuretic, such as a thiazide or loop diuretic. It is taken by mouth. Onset of action is about two hours and it lasts for about a day. Common side effects include high blood potassium, vomiting, loss of appetite, rash, and headache. The risk of high blood potassium is greater in those with kidney problems, diabetes, and those who are older. Amiloride blocks the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the late distal tubule, connecting tubule, and collecting duct of the nephron, which both reduces absorption of sodium ion from the lumen of the nephron and reduces excretion of potassium ion into the lumen. Amiloride was developed in 1967. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Amiloride may be used in combination with a thiazide diuretic for treatment of high blood pressure or (less commonly) in combination with a loop diuretic for treatment of heart failure. The potassium-sparing effects of amiloride offset the low blood potassium (hypokalemia) that is often induced by thiazides or loop diuretics, which is of particular importance in people for whom maintaining a normal level of potassium is critically important. For example, people that are taking Digitalis (i.e. digoxin) are at higher risk for changes in heart rhythm if their potassium levels get too high. The 2017 clinical practice guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines list amiloride as a ""secondary"" oral antihypertensive, with minimal efficacy. For people with resistant hypertension, already taking a thiazide diuretic, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and a calcium channel blocker, the addition of amiloride (or spironolactone) was better at reducing blood pressure than adding a beta-blocker (bisoprolol) or an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin). When combined with hydrochlorothiazide, the addition of amiloride had positive effects on blood pressure and blood sugar tolerance. Amiloride may therefore be useful for preventing the metabolic side effects of thiazide diuretics, allowing for the use of higher thiazide doses (in line with how they were originally studied). Amiloride is the treatment of choice for Liddle phenotype, which is characterized by high blood pressure, low blood potassium, and metabolic alkalosis in conjunction with a low plasma renin activity and a low aldosterone. Some people with the Liddle phenotype have Liddle syndrome, which involves a genetic mutation resulting in upregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), located in the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells in the late distal tubule and collecting duct of the kidney. Because Liddle phenotype usually involves an upregulation of ENaC channels, leading to retention of sodium and water and to hypokalemia, amiloride is useful as an ENaC channel inhibitor due to its promotion of sodium excretion and its potassium-sparing effects, restoring potassium to normal levels. Amiloride can be used as a monotherapy (single-drug therapy) or an adjunctive therapy alongside other diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) for the treatment of ascites and edema (swelling) due to cirrhosis of the liver. The 2012 clinical practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) states that amiloride can be used to treat ascites in place of spironolactone if it isn't tolerated (e.g. due to the side effect of gynecomastia), though amiloride isn't a preferred drug due to cost and lack of efficacy. === Specific populations === ==== Diabetics ==== People with diabetes are at higher risk for kidney problems, which increases their risk for hyperkalemia (high blood potassium). The use of amiloride in people with diabetes requires careful potassium and kidney function monitoring to prevent toxicity. Amiloride must be discontinued for at least 3 days prior to glucose tolerance testing, due to the risk for fatal hyperkalemia. ==== Poor kidney function ==== People with poor kidney function (e.g. blood urea nitrogen >30 mg/dL, or serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL) are at high risk for hyperkalemia. ==== Lactation ==== There is no data on the use of amiloride in women that are breastfeeding. While diuretics can make lactation difficult, it is unlikely that amiloride would induce this effect in the absence of other diuretics. ==== Pregnancy ==== Data from the use of amiloride in animals suggests that it does not pose a risk to the developing fetus. However, when used in combination with the drug acetazolamide during the process of organ formation, amiloride increases the risk for kidney and ureter abnormalities. Limited human data from use during pregnancy suggests an association with a specific congenital penis abnormality if taken during the first trimester, as well as a risk for mild intrauterine growth restriction if taken throughout pregnancy. == Contraindications == Amiloride is contraindicated in people with kidney problems (e.g. anuria, acute or chronic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy), elevated blood potassium (≥5.5 mEq/L), or people that are hypersensitive to amiloride or any ingredients within the specific formulation. Use is also contraindicated in people that are already taking potassium-sparing drugs (e.g. spironolactone and triamterene) or who are taking potassium supplements (e.g. potassium chloride) in most circumstances. == Adverse effects == Amiloride is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects of the use of amiloride include elevated blood potassium, mild skin rashes, headaches, and gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, flatulence, and abdominal pain). Mild symptoms of high blood potassium concentrations include unusual skin sensations, muscle weakness, or fatigue, but more severe symptoms such as flaccid paralysis of the limbs, slow heart rate, and even shock can occur. == Overdose == There exists no overdose data on amiloride in humans, though it is expected than an overdose would produce effects consistent with its therapeutic effects; e.g. dehydration due to over-diuresis, and electrolyte disturbances related to hyperkalemia. It is unknown if amiloride can be dialyzed off, and no specific antidote against it exists. Treatment is generally supportive, though hyperkalemia can be treated. == Interactions == Amiloride may have important drug-drug interactions when combined with other medications that also increase potassium levels in the blood, leading to hyperkalemia. For example, the combination of amiloride with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like lisinopril, or angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonists like losartan, may lead to high levels of potassium in the blood, requiring frequent monitoring. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === ==== Diuresis ==== Amiloride works by directly blocking the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with an IC50 around 0.1 μM, indicating potent blockade. Antagonism of ENaC thereby inhibits sodium reabsorption in the late distal convoluted tubules, connecting tubules, and collecting ducts in the nephron. This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, and reduces potassium excretion. The drug is often used in conjunction with a thiazide diuretic to counteract with a potassium-losing effect. Due to its potassium-sparing capacities, hyperkalemia (elevated potassium concentration in the blood) can occur. The risk of developing hyperkalemia is increased in patients who are also taking ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, other potassium-sparing diuretics, or any potassium-containing supplements. ==== Miscellaneous ==== A fraction of the effects of amiloride is inhibition of cyclic GMP-gated cation channels in the inner medullary collecting duct. Amiloride has a second action on the heart, blocking Na+/H+ exchangers such as sodium–hydrogen antiporter 1 (NHE-1). Amiloride also blocks the Na+/H+ antiporter on the apical surface of the proximal tubule cells in the nephron, abolishing more than 80% of the action of angiotensin II on the secretion of hydrogen ions in proximal tubule cells. Amiloride is not an angiotensin II receptor blocker (like losartan, for example). The Na-H transporter is also found in the Jejunum of the small intestine, as a result, amiloride also blocks the reabsorption of Na, and thereby water in the intestines. Amiloride is considered to be a reversible, pan-acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) inhibitor that prevents the transient flow of ions but not the sustained flow of ions. ASICs are members of the ENaC family of protein channels, and are found in the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system, and the skin. Broadly, ASICs are involved in harm detection, chemosensation (pH changes specifically), and touch. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Amiloride has an oral bioavailability of 50%, meaning that about 50% of an oral dose is absorbed into the blood stream. Coadministration with food reduces the amount of amiloride that is absorbed by the body by about 30%, though it does not affect the rate of absorption. However, taking amiloride with food helps to reduce the incidence of its gastrointestinal side effects. After being taken, amiloride's diuretic effect occurs within 2 hours, with peak diuresis within 6–10 hours. The diuretic effects of amiloride persist for about 24 hours after administration. ==== Distribution ==== Amiloride cross the placenta and distributes into breast milk in vivo. ==== Metabolism ==== Amiloride is not metabolized by the liver. In comparison, the ENaC inhibitor triamterene is metabolized by the liver. ==== Excretion ==== About 50% of amiloride is excreted unchanged by the kidneys, while around 40% is excreted in the feces (likely drug that wasn't absorbed). The half-life of amiloride in humans is between 6 and 9 hours, which may be prolonged in people with poor kidney function. === Pharmacogenomics === A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the protein NEDD4L may impact how amiloride affects a person's blood pressure in cases of hypertension (high blood pressure). == Chemistry == Amiloride is a pyrazinoylguanidine, composed of a substituted pyrazine ring structure with a carbonylguanidinium substituent. Amiloride's pKa is 8.67, which is due to the guanidinium group. In high pH (alkaline, low hydrogen concentration) environments, the guanidinium group is deprotonated and the compound is rendered neutral, depleting its activity on sodium channels. Amiloride, as a pure substance, is highly fluorescent, with excitation wavelengths at 215, 288, and 360 nm, emitting light at 420 nm. == History == Amiloride was first synthesized and discovered by the Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories in the late 1960s. The drug was discovered as part of a screening process of chemicals that reversed the effects of mineralocorticoids in vivo. Amiloride was the only drug in the screen that was capable of causing the excretion of sodium (natriuresis) without a concomitant urinary excretion of potassium (kaliuresis). Thousands of amiloride analogues have been studied since its initial discovery, which have been used to study the effects of sodium transporters. Amiloride was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 5, 1981. == Society and culture == It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Amiloride is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances, as it is considered a masking agent. Diuretics like amiloride act as masking agents by reducing the concentration of other doping agents due to promoting diuresis, increasing the total volume of the urine. The list includes other potassium-sparing diuretics, such as triamterene and spironolactone. In 2008, amiloride and the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene were found in 3% of positive diuretic doping samples. === Formulations and trade names === Amiloride hydrochloride Midamor (U.S.) Co-amilozide (amiloride hydrochloride with hydrochlorothiazide) Co-amilofruse (amiloride hydrochloride with furosemide) Amiloride hydrochloride with cyclopenthiazide Amiloride hydrochloride with bumetanide == Research == Amiloride is an inhibitor of NHE-1, which helps to maintain normal pH within cells. Cancer cells in leukemia, a type of blood cancer, have higher pH compared to normal cells. Amiloride affects the splicing and regulation of multiple genes involved in cancer, though they do not appear to be directly related to its effects on pH. Amiloride has been tested in vitro as an adjunct to the anticancer drug imatinib, which appeared to show a synergistic effect. Modified versions of amiloride, known as 5'-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), 5-N-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride (HMA), are being studied for the treatment of leukemia. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder due to a mutation in the CFTR gene, which encodes for the CFTR chloride channel. There is evidence that suggests that the molecular target of amiloride, ENaC, is also implicated in cystic fibrosis due to its effects on mucus in the lungs. Aerosolized formulations of amiloride have been tested in clinical trials, though long-term clinical trials have failed to show much utility. Due to its short duration of action, it was thought that longer-acting ENaC inhibitors may prove more effective. However, longer-acting ENaC inhibitors (i.e. benzamil) have also failed clinical trials, despite an improvement in both the solubility and potency of the drugs. A third generation amiloride analogue (N-(3,5-diamino-6-chloropyrazine-2-carbonyl)-N'-4-[4-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)phenyl]butyl-guanidine methanesulfonate, research name ""552-02""), with better pharmacokinetic properties, is being studied. Pain induced by exposure to acid is attenuated by amiloride in human trials, which may indicate a role for amiloride in the treatment of pain in the future. == References == == External links == Media related to Amiloride at Wikimedia Commons ""Amiloride"".

987,"('Flunisolide', 'Aerobid', 'Rhinalar', 'Synaclyn', 'Nasarel')",Medical,"Flunisolide (marketed as AeroBid among others) is a corticosteroid often prescribed as a treatment for allergic rhinitis. Intranasal corticosteroids are the most effective medication for controlling symptoms. Flunisolide's principal mechanism of action is to activate glucocorticoid receptors, indicating an anti-inflammatory action. The effects of topical corticosteroids are not immediate and must be used for at least a few days for noticeable relief. As-needed use is less effective than regular recommended use. Flunisolide should not be used for nasal infections. It should not be continued if symptoms are not relieved after regular use for over two to three weeks. Patented in 1958 and approved for medical use in 1978, it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Side effects == Temporary nose and throat dryness, irritation, bleeding, or unpleasant taste or smell may occur. Nasal septum perforation has been rarely reported. Rare but localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans have also been reported. Its long-term use may raise the chances of cataracts or glaucoma. Flunisolide nasal spray is absorbed into the circulatory system (blood). Corticosteroid nasal sprays may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in humans. After obtaining the desired clinical effect, the maintenance dose should be reduced to the smallest amount required to control the symptoms. The amount can be as low as one spray in each nostril daily. Utilizing the minimum effective dose reduces possibility of side effects. Recommended amounts of intranasal corticosteroids are generally not associated with systemic side effects. Corticosteroids inhibit wound healing, so corticosteroid nasal sprays should be used cautiously in patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, recurrent epistaxis, nasal surgery or trauma, until healing. In pregnancy, recommended doses of intranasal corticosteroids are safe and effective. == References ==",Nasarel,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0020779224578291178), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005306089296936989)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/nasarel.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=80, start_index=9, title='Nasarel: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/nasarel.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is uncommonly used in humans as an antipsychotic drug. Azaperone acts primarily as a dopamine antagonist but also has some antihistaminic and anticholinergic properties as seen with similar drugs such as haloperidol. Azaperone may cause hypotension and while it has minimal effects on respiration in pigs, high doses in humans can cause respiratory depression. == Veterinary use == The most common use for azaperone is in relatively small doses as a ""serenic"" (to reduce aggression) in farmed pigs, either to stop them fighting or to encourage sows to accept piglets. Higher doses are used for anesthesia in combination with other drugs such as xylazine, tiletamine and zolazepam. Azaperone is also used in combination with strong narcotics such as etorphine or carfentanil for tranquilizing large animals such as elephants. Use in horses is avoided as adverse reactions may occur. The European Medicines Agency has established a maximum residue limit for azaperone when administered to pigs. Azaperone (under the brand name Stresnil) was approved for use in pigs in the USA in 1983, under NADA 115-732. == Synthesis == The alkylation of 2-chloropyridine (1) with piperazine gives 1-(pyridin-2-yl)piperazine [67980-77-2] (2).

989,"('Canagliflozin', 'Invokana', 'Canagliflozin anhydrous', 'Canagliflozin hemihydrate', 'Canagliflozin hydrate')",Medical,"Canagliflozin, sold under the brand name Invokana among others, is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It is used together with exercise and diet. It is not recommended in type 1 diabetes. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include vaginal yeast infections, nausea, constipation, and urinary tract infections. Serious side effects may include low blood sugar, Fournier's gangrene, leg amputation, kidney problems, high blood potassium, and low blood pressure. Diabetic ketoacidosis may occur despite nearly normal blood sugar levels. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. It works by increasing the amount of glucose lost in the urine. Canagliflozin was approved for medical use in the United States, in the European Union, and in Australia in 2013. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Canagliflozin is indicated to be used with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes; to reduce the risk of major heart-related events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in people with type 2 diabetes who have known heart disease; and to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, worsening of kidney function, heart-related death, and being hospitalized for heart failure in certain people with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease. Canagliflozin is an anti-diabetic medication used to improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. It is a third-line medication to metformin. Per the British National Formulary it is also less preferred than a sulfonylurea as of 2019, while the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes consider either a SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist a reasonable second line medication in those with heart disease. Canagliflozin decreases HbA1c levels by 0.77% to 1.16% when given by itself, in combination with metformin, in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, in combination with metformin and pioglitazone, or in combination with insulin, from initial HbA1c levels of 7.8% to 8.1%. When added to metformin, canagliflozin does not appear worse than sitagliptin or glimepiride in reducing HbA1c levels, while canagliflozin maybe better than sitagliptin and glimiperide in decreasing HbA1c. It is unclear whether or not it has any unique cardiovascular benefits beyond lowering blood sugar. Although canagliflozin produces beneficial effects on HDL cholesterol, it has also been shown to increase LDL cholesterol to produce no change in total cholesterol. Evidence shows that apart from positive effects on glycemic levels, canagliflozin also reduces the risk of heart attacks and heart failures. SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin, reduce the likelihood of hospitalization for congestive heart failure or progression of renal disease in persons with diabetes mellitus type 2 and reduce the likelihood of stroke and heart attack in persons with diabetes mellitus type 2 who have known atherosclerotic vascular disease. == Contraindications == Canaglifozin is contraindicated in: Type 1 diabetes Diabetic ketoacidosis Severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), end-stage renal disease Patients on dialysis == Adverse effects == As with other SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin is associated with increased incidence of urinary tract infections, fungal infections of the genital area, thirst, elevations in LDL cholesterol, increased urination and episodes of low blood pressure. Rarely, use of canagliflozin is associated with necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, also called Fournier gangrene. There are concerns that it may also increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Possible cardiovascular problems are an ongoing issue with gliflozin drugs. The pre-specified endpoint for cardiovascular safety in the canagliflozin clinical development program was ""Major Cardiovascular Events Plus"", defined as the occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal strokes, or unstable angina leading to hospitalization. This endpoint occurred in more people in the placebo group (20.5%) than in the canagliflozin treated group (18.9%). Nonetheless, a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee expressed concern regarding the cardiovascular safety of canagliflozin. A greater number of cardiovascular events was observed during the first 30 days in study subjects who received canagliflozin (0.45%) compared those who received placebo (0.07%), suggesting an early period of increased cardiovascular risk. In addition, there was an increased risk of stroke in subjects who received canagliflozin. However, none of these effects were statistically significant. Additional cardiovascular safety data from another ongoing study are expected in 2015. On 15 May 2015, the FDA issued a warning that certain SGLT2 diabetes drugs, including canagliflozin, may lead to ketoacidosis, a condition where the body produces higher levels of ketone bodies. The FDA is continuing to investigate the issue, and cautions that patients should not stop taking canagliflozin without first talking to their doctor. On 10 September 2015, the FDA issued a drug safety communication for canagliflozin to address risks for bone fracture and decreased bone density. A label warning for fractures was already included in the Adverse Reactions section; however, the FDA made the addition to the Warnings and Precautions section to reflect new information from a placebo study. They advised that health care professionals should consider fracture risk factors before prescribing canagliflozin, and patients should disclose any bone fracture risk factors to their doctors, but that patients should not stop taking the medication without first talking to their doctor. On 4 December 2015, the FDA issued another safety communication for SGLT2 inhibitors, indicating that it would require new warnings to be added to the canagliflozin label about elevated blood acid levels and urinary tract infections. In June 2016, the FDA strengthened the warning about the risk of acute kidney injury for the type 2 diabetes medicines canagliflozin (Invokana, Invokamet) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga, Xigduo XR). A 29 June 2016, report on the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial for canagliflozin (CANVAS) revealed interim findings of new safety concerns including heightened risk of bone fracture that was found to increase with the duration of treatment. In May 2016, the FDA announced they were going to investigate a safety issue related to clinical trials that found an increase in leg and foot amputations, mostly affecting the toes, in people treated with the diabetes medicine canagliflozin (Invokana, Invokamet). In May 2017, the FDA concluded that canagliflozin causes an increased risk of leg and foot amputations. The FDA began requiring a boxed warning to be added to the canagliflozin drug labels to describe this risk. In August 2020, the FDA removed the requirement for the boxed warning. To lessen the risk of developing ketoacidosis (a serious condition in which the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones) after surgery, the FDA approved changes to the prescribing information for SGLT2 inhibitor diabetes medicines to recommend they be stopped temporarily before scheduled surgery. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should each be stopped at least three days before, and ertugliflozin should be stopped at least four days before scheduled surgery. Symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and trouble breathing. == Interactions == The drug may increase the risk of dehydration in combination with diuretic drugs. Because it increases renal excretion of glucose, treatment with canagliflozin prevents renal reabsorption of 1,5-anhydroglucitol, leading to artifactual decreases in serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol. Therefore, canagliflozin can interfere with the use of serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (assay trade name, GlycoMark) as a measure of postprandial glucose levels. Dosing adjustment is also required for concomitant therapy with UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) inducers such as rifampin, phenytoin, or phenobarbital, ritonavir. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Canagliflozin is an inhibitor of subtype 2 sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT2), which is responsible for at least 90% of renal glucose reabsorption (the remaining 10% is done by SGLT1 inhibition). Blocking this transporter causes up to 119 grams of blood glucose per day to be eliminated through the urine, corresponding to 476 kilocalories. Additional water is eliminated by osmotic diuresis, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure. This mechanism is associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia (too low blood glucose) compared to other types of anti-diabetic drugs such as sulfonylurea derivatives and insulin. === Pharmacokinetics === When taken by mouth, canagliflozin reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after one to two hours and has an absolute bioavailability of 65%, independently of food intake. When in the bloodstream, 99% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. It is metabolized mainly by O-glucuronidation via the enzymes UGT1A9 and UGT2B4, and by hydroxylation to a lesser extent. The terminal half life is 10.6 hours for a 100 mg dose and 13.1 hours for a 300 mg dose, with 43% being excreted in the faeces (mostly in unchanged form) and 33% in the urine (mostly as glucuronide). == History == It was developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma and is marketed under license by Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson. On 4 July 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a paediatric investigation plan and granted both a deferral and a waiver for canagliflozin (EMEA-001030-PIP01-10) in accordance with EC Regulation No.1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the council. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2013. Canagliflozin was approved by the FDA on 29 March 2013, and became the first SGLT2 inhibitor in the United States.

990,"('Fluticasone furoate', 'Veramyst', 'Avamys', 'Allermist', 'Furamist')",Medical,"Fluticasone furoate, sold under the brand name Flonase Sensimist among others, is a corticosteroid for the treatment of non-allergic and allergic rhinitis administered by a nasal spray. It is also available as an inhaled corticosteroid to help prevent and control symptoms of asthma. It is derived from cortisol. Unlike fluticasone propionate, which is only approved for children four years and older, fluticasone furoate is approved in children as young as two years of age when used for allergies. It was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2007, and in the European Union in November 2008. In 2021, fluticasone was the 23rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 25 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Fluticasone furoate is indicated for the treatment of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Fluticasone Furoate is a corticosteroid medication primarily used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and non-allergic (perennial) rhinitis. It is also indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps in adults. Additionally, fluticasone furoate nasal spray may be prescribed for the management of symptoms associated with sinusitis. Always consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. Fluticasone furoate nasal spray is highly effective in relieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and nasal itching. It works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages and decreasing the production of mucus. Fluticasone Furoate is used as a maintenance treatment for asthma in patients aged 12 years and older. It helps to reduce inflammation in the airways, which is a key component of asthma management. It helps to control symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing, thereby improving the overall quality of life for individuals with asthma. Regular use of Fluticasone Furoate can reduce the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations or attacks, helping to prevent serious episodes of breathing difficulty. When used as an inhaler, Fluticasone furoate helps to control asthma symptoms by reducing airway inflammation and preventing asthma attacks. It is often used as a maintenance treatment to provide long-term control of asthma symptoms and improve lung function. === Available forms === Inhalers: Fluticasone furoate is commonly available in the form of a dry powder inhaler (DPI) for inhalation. This inhaler is used for the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 12 years and older. It delivers the medication directly to the lungs, where it acts to reduce inflammation and improve asthma symptoms. Adult and Paediatric dosage for - Powder inhalation 50 mcg/actuation 100 mcg/actuation 200 mcg/actuation Nasal Spray: Fluticasone furoate is also available as a nasal spray, primarily used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) symptoms such as nasal congestion, sneezing, itching, and runny nose. It helps to reduce inflammation in the nasal passages and provides relief from allergy symptoms. Nasal Drops: In some cases, fluticasone furoate may be available as nasal drops for the treatment of nasal polyps or other specific nasal conditions. These nasal drops are applied directly into the nostrils to reduce inflammation and symptoms associated with nasal polyps. == Side effects == Common side effects of Fluticasone furoate nasal spray include nasal irritation, dryness, itching, and nosebleeds. These side effects are usually mild and transient. Some individuals may experience throat irritation or coughing when using Fluticasone furoate inhalers. Rinsing the mouth and throat with water after inhalation can help reduce these symptoms. Headache is another common side effect reported with the use of Fluticasone furoate nasal spray or inhalers. It is usually mild and resolves with continued use. In rare cases, Fluticasone furoate may cause more serious side effects, such as adrenal suppression, glaucoma, cataracts, or growth retardation in children. These side effects are more likely to occur with long-term, high-dose use, although they are still rare. Serious side effects of Fluticasone Furoate include: hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, white patches in the mouth or the tongue, fever, chills, persistent sore throat, mood changes, depression, mood swings, agitation, vision problems, increased thirst or urination, easy bruising or bleeding, bone pain, and severe wheezing It's essential to use Fluticasone furoate as directed by a healthcare professional to maximize its benefits and minimize the risk of side effects. If you experience any concerning side effects while using Fluticasone furoate, it's important to consult your doctor for further evaluation and management. == Interactions == Fluticasone Furoate has serious interactions with the following drugs: Abametapir Apalutamide Fexinidazole Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (DSC) Tucatinib Fluticasone Furoate has moderate interactions with at least 45 other drugs. == Toxicity == The toxicity of Fluticasone furoate is primarily associated with excessive or prolonged use, especially at high doses. While Fluticasone furoate is generally considered safe when used according to prescribed guidelines, long-term or improper use can lead to various adverse effects. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The mechanism of action of Fluticasone furoate, like other corticosteroids, involves its binding to glucocorticoid receptors within cells. Fluticasone furoate enters target cells and binds to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which are found in the cytoplasm of many cell types. Upon binding, the Fluticasone furoate-GR complex undergoes conformational changes, leading to its translocation into the cell nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the Fluticasone furoate-GR complex binds to specific DNA sequences known as glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) located in the promoter regions of target genes. Binding of the Fluticasone furoate-GR complex to GREs modulates the transcription of target genes, leading to the production of mRNA molecules. These mRNA molecules are then translated into proteins, which mediate the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of Fluticasone furoate. Fluticasone furoate regulates the expression of various genes involved in inflammation, such as cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory enzymes. By suppressing the production of these inflammatory mediators, Fluticasone furoate reduces inflammation and related symptoms. Fluticasone furoate also inhibits the function of immune cells, such as T lymphocytes and macrophages, by interfering with their activation and proliferation. This immunosuppressive action helps to dampen immune responses and is beneficial in conditions where excessive inflammation or immune activity is harmful, such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of Fluticasone furoate involve its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination from the body. Fluticasone furoate is typically administered via inhalation for asthma or intranasal spray for allergic rhinitis. After administration, it is absorbed through the respiratory mucosa. The bioavailability of Fluticasone furoate is relatively low due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. Fluticasone furoate has a high protein binding affinity (approximately 91%) to plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin. It distributes extensively into tissues after systemic absorption. Fluticasone furoate undergoes extensive metabolism primarily in the liver, mediated by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The major metabolic pathways include oxidation and conjugation reactions. Oxidation may occur at various sites within the molecule, leading to the formation of metabolites with reduced corticosteroid activity. Conjugation reactions, such as glucuronidation and sulfation, also contribute to the formation of metabolites that are more water-soluble and readily excreted from the body. The metabolites of Fluticasone furoate, along with a small portion of unchanged drug, are primarily eliminated via the kidneys in urine and to a lesser extent in feces via biliary excretion. The elimination half-life of Fluticasone furoate is relatively short, ranging from approximately 14 to 24 hours, depending on factors such as dose and route of administration. == History == Fluticasone furoate or (FF) was discovered by researchers at GlaxoSmithKline, also known as (GSK), and Theravance, Inc. (NASDAQ: THRX). Research first began in 2006, however, its final phases of research began conclusion from the 6th December 2013 and into 2014. Dave Allen, Head, Respiratory Therapy Area Unit, R&D said, “We are pleased to see the results delivered by FF/VI in the treatment of asthma. We have undertaken a large and comprehensive clinical programme providing data on the efficacy and safety profile for FF/VI in asthma. With these additional data we will consider our next steps in relation to an asthma filing in the US.” on 6 December 2013. Dave Allen is responsible for the identification of novel differentiated medicines and their progression to registration and launch at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). He leads a group of over 200 scientists and clinicians who exploit scientific innovations that have the potential to address the major unmet needs in diseases such as COPD, severe asthma, acute lung injury and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Also noted in the 6th of December 2013 press release from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), “There is an ongoing unmet medical need among patients with asthma,” said Rick E Winningham, Chief Executive Officer of Theravance. “This is an important outcome for FF/VI and we will continue working with GSK to determine how we can make this potential treatment available to appropriate patients who could benefit from a new asthma medicine.” Fluticasone furoate is most commonly known for its form combinations vilanterol trifenate, known as Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) for its treatment of bronchospasms for COPD ( Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ). GlaxoSmithKline announced on 20 August 2014 that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as approved Arnuity™ Ellipta® (fluticasone furoate inhalation powder) for use in The United States of America, a once-daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medicine for maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients aged 12 years and older. Arnuity is not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm. GSK Australia and Theravance, Inc. (NASDAQ: THRX) announced today that the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved BREO® ELLIPTA® (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol [FF/VI]) on the 22nd April 2014, for the treatment of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Australia. FF/VI was approved by the FDA for sale as BREO® ELLIPTA® (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol [FF/VI]) on the 30th April 2015 for use in The United States of America, for the once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older. Breo Ellipta is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. == Drug class == Fluticasone Furoate falls under the drug class of Corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones produced naturally by the adrenal cortex, which is located on top of the kidneys. They play a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes in the body, including metabolism, immune response, and inflammation. Corticosteroids can also refer to synthetic drugs that mimic the actions of these natural hormones. There are two main types of corticosteroids: glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, are involved in regulating metabolism and suppressing inflammation. They have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, making them useful in the treatment of conditions like asthma, arthritis, and autoimmune diseases. Mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, primarily regulate electrolyte and fluid balance in the body. Synthetic corticosteroids, like prednisone, dexamethasone, and fluticasone, are commonly used in medicine to reduce inflammation and suppress immune responses in conditions such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. They are available in various forms, including oral tablets, inhalers, creams, and injections, depending on the specific condition being treated and the desired route of administration. == Chemistry == Fluticasone furoate contains fluorine atoms at specific positions on the steroid nucleus. These fluorinated substituents enhance the molecule's potency and duration of action. The furoate ester group is attached at position 17 of the steroid nucleus. This ester group contributes to the molecule's lipophilicity, which affects its absorption and distribution in the body. Fluticasone furoate has a side chain attached at position 17 of the steroid nucleus. This side chain plays a crucial role in determining the molecule's selectivity and potency. Molecular Formula: C27H29F3O6S Molecular Weight : 538.6 g/mol === Reactivity === Fluticasone furoate, like other corticosteroids, exhibits specific chemical reactivity characteristics based on its structure. Based on its chemical structure, which includes a corticosteroid backbone with a fluorine substitution pattern, Fluticasone furoate might exhibit some reactivity typical of compounds with such structures, such as: Steroid Backbone Stability: The steroid backbone of fluticasone furoate is relatively stable under normal conditions, which is important for its pharmaceutical formulation and shelf-life stability. Ester Hydrolysis: The furoate ester group in fluticasone furoate is susceptible to hydrolysis under certain conditions, particularly in aqueous environments with acidic or basic pH. This hydrolysis can lead to the breakdown of the ester bond, potentially altering the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the molecule. Fluorine Reactivity: Fluticasone furoate contains fluorine atoms in its structure, which can influence its chemical reactivity. Electrophilic substitution: The presence of fluorine atoms in the molecule can make it susceptible to electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, where the fluorine atoms can be replaced by other functional groups under certain conditions. Reduction: The carbonyl group in the molecule might be reduced under appropriate conditions to yield an alcohol derivative. Acid-base reactions: The presence of functional groups such as the ketone and ester moieties can lead to acid-base reactions under appropriate conditions. Oxidation: Depending on the reaction conditions, oxidation of certain functional groups such as alcohols or aldehydes within the molecule might occur. Conjugation: The molecule may undergo conjugation reactions, such as glucuronidation or sulfation, in the liver to facilitate its elimination from the body. === Synthesis === ""a solution of Compound II in butanone with DMAP and tripropylamine is treated with furoyl chloride to obtain Compound III, which is then treated with N-methylpiperazine to de-fluoridize to obtain Compound IV. Compound IV is reacted with a fluoromethylating reagent to obtain the fluticasone furoate of Compound I"". As found in the method patent from: US8969547B2, United States. == Additional Information == Fluticasone furoate, sold under the brand name Flonase Sensimist among others, is a corticosteroid for the treatment of non-allergic and allergic rhinitis administered by a nasal spray. It is also available as an inhaled corticosteroid to help prevent and control symptoms of asthma. It is derived from cortisol. Unlike fluticasone propionate, which is only approved for children four years and older, fluticasone furoate is approved in children as young as two years of age when used for allergies. It was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2007, and in the European Union in November 2008. In 2021, fluticasone was the 23rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 25 million prescriptions. == Society and culture == === Brand names === In the US it is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline for asthma as Arnuity Ellipta and is only available with a prescription. It is sold over-the-counter for allergic rhinitis as Flonase Sensimist. The Veramyst brand name was discontinued in the US. The combination drugs fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol, marketed as Trelegy Ellipta, and fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, marketed as Breo Ellipta (US, Canada, New Zealand) and Relvar Ellipta (EU, UK), are approved for use in the United States for long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They are also approved for the treatment of asthma.

991,"('Gatifloxacin', 'Tequin', 'Gatiflo', 'Zymar', 'Zymaxid')",Medical,"Gatifloxacin (brand names Gatiflo, Tequin, and Zymar) is an antibiotic of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolone family, that like other members of that family, inhibits the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It was patented in 1986 and approved for medical use in 1999. == Side effects == A Canadian study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2006, claimed that Tequin can have significant side effects including dysglycemia. An editorial by Jerry Gurwitz in the same issue called for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider giving Tequin a black box warning. This editorial followed distribution of a letter dated February 15 by Bristol-Myers Squibb to health care providers indicating action taken with the FDA to strengthen warnings for the medication. Subsequently, Bristol-Myers Squibb reported it would stop manufacture of Tequin, end sales of the drug after existing stockpiles were exhausted, and return all rights to Kyorin. By contrast, ophthalmic gatifloxacin is generally well tolerated. The observed systemic concentration of the drug following oral administration of 400 mg (0.01 ounces) gatifloxacin is approximately 800 times higher than that of the 0.5% gatifloxacin eye drop. Given as an eye drop, gatifloxacin has very low systemic exposure. Therefore, the systemic exposures resulting from the gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution are not likely to pose any risk for systemic toxicities. == Contraindications == Hypersensitivity == Society and culture == === Availability === Gatifloxacin is currently available in the US and Canada only as an ophthalmic solution. In 2011, the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry of India banned the manufacture, sale, and distribution of gatifloxacin because of its adverse side effects. In China, gatifloxacin is sold in tablet as well as in eye drop formulations. === Brand names === Bristol-Myers Squibb introduced gatifloxacin in 1999 under the proprietary name Tequin for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, having licensed the medication from Kyorin Pharmaceutical Company of Japan. Allergan produces it in eye-drop formulation under the names Zymar, Zymaxid and Zylopred. In many countries, gatifloxacin is also available as tablets and in various aqueous solutions for intravenous therapy. == References ==",Zymaxid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00047338721924461424), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03812943026423454)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/zymaxid.html,https://www.drugs.com/pro/zymaxid.html,https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/allergan-receives-fda-approval-for-zymaxid-tm-ophthalmic-solution ', [])"

Atorvastatin competitively inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. By preventing the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, statin medications decrease cholesterol production in the liver. Atorvastatin also increases the number of LDL receptors on the surface of hepatic cells. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and mechanism of action of atorvastatin to manage coronary heart disease and familial dyslipidemias, covering the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of atorvastatin therapy. Hypercholesterolaemia is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic disease. Atorvastatin lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. The mean dose-response relationship has been shown to be log-linear for atorvastatin, but plasma concentrations of atorvastatin acid and its metabolites do not correlate with LDL-cholesterol reduction at a given dose. The clinical dosage range for atorvastatin is 10-80 mg/day, and it is given in the acid form. Atorvastatin acid is highly soluble and permeable, and the drug is completely absorbed after oral administration. However, atorvastatin acid is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism in the gut wall as well as in the liver, as oral bioavailability is 14%. The volume of distribution of atorvastatin acid is 381L, and plasma protein binding exceeds 98%. Atorvastatin acid is extensively metabolised in both the gut and liver by oxidation, lactonisation and glucuronidation, and the metabolites are eliminated by biliary secretion and direct secretion from blood to the intestine. In vitro, atorvastatin acid is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) C and H+-monocarboxylic acid cotransporter. The total plasma clearance of atorvastatin acid is 625 mL/min and the half-life is about 7 hours. The renal route is of minor importance (<1%) for the elimination of atorvastatin acid. In vivo, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is responsible for the formation of two active metabolites from the acid and the lactone forms of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin acid and its metabolites undergo glucuronidation mediated by uridinediphosphoglucuronyltransferases 1A1 and 1A3. Atorvastatin can be given either in the morning or in the evening. Food decreases the absorption rate of atorvastatin acid after oral administration, as indicated by decreased peak concentration and increased time to peak concentration. Women appear to have a slightly lower plasma exposure to atorvastatin for a given dose. Atorvastatin is subject to metabolism by CYP3A4 and cellular membrane transport by OATP C and P-glycoprotein, and drug-drug interactions with potent inhibitors of these systems, such as itraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, cyclosporin, fibrates, erythromycin and grapefruit juice, have been demonstrated. An interaction with gemfibrozil seems to be mediated by inhibition of glucuronidation. A few case studies have reported rhabdomyolysis when the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin have been affected by interacting drugs. Atorvastatin increases the bioavailability of digoxin, most probably by inhibition of P-glycoprotein, but does not affect the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir, nelfinavir or terfenadine. Atorvastatin is a commonly used cholesterol lowering agent (statin) that is associated with mild, asymptomatic and self-limited serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and rarely with clinically apparent acute liver injury.","Atorvastatin,",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010179955279454589), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004094195086508989)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;  ', [])"
