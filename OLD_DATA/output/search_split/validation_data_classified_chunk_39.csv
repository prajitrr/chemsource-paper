This study delved into the protective effects and mechanisms of  Novel genes that function in the conversion of indole-3-acetamide (IAM) into indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which were previously thought to exist only in the bacterial genome, have been isolated from plants. The finding of the AtAMI1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana and the NtAMI1 gene in Nicotiana tabacum, which encode indole-3-acetamide hydrolase, indicates the existence of a new pathway for auxin biosynthesis in plants. This review summarizes the characteristics of these genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and discusses the possibility of the AMI1 gene family being widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Its evolutionary relationship to bacterial indole-3-acetamide hydrolase, based on phylogenetic analyses, is also discussed. During the course of evolution plants have evolved a complex phytohormone-based network to regulate their growth and development. Herein auxins have a pivotal function, as they are involved in controlling virtually every aspect related to plant growth. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the major endogenous auxin of higher plants that is already known for more than 80 years. In spite of the long-standing interest in this topic, IAA biosynthesis is still only partially uncovered. Several pathways for the formation of IAA have been proposed over the past years, but none of these pathways are yet completely defined. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the indole-3-acetamide (IAM)-dependent pathway of IAA production in plants and to discuss the properties of the involved proteins and genes, respectively. Their evolutionary relationship to known bacterial IAM hydrolases and other amidases from bacteria, algae, moss, and higher plants is discussed on the basis of phylogenetic analyses.

This study investigated the therapeutic effects of acetylspiramycin and garlicin on Cryptosporidium infection in institutionalized male drug users receiving rehabilitative treatment. Examination of stool specimens from 903 drug users via modified acid-fast bacilli staining resulted in 172 positive cases. Among them 151 subjects consented to participate in a randomized trial of acetylspiramycin and garlicin in four groups: acetylspiramycin plus garlicin, acetylspiramycin only, garlicin only, and placebo control. The cryptosporidiosis rate was higher in younger subjects with longer drug use history than subjects who are older with shorter history of drug use. After two segments of treatments, 76.2% of the cases achieved negative test results, with the four groups achieving the rates of 92.1%, 76.7%, 72.2%, and 61.8%, respectively (χ(2) = 9.517, P = 0.023). These results indicate clinical potential of garlicin in conjunction with acetylspiramycin in treating cryptosporidiosis. Investigation of acetylspiramycin (ASPM) and its related substances was carried out using a reversed-phase liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. The identification of impurities in the ASPM complex was performed with a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer, with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the positive ion mode which provides MS(n) capability. A total of 83 compounds were characterized in commercial samples, among which 31 impurities that had never been reported and 31 partially characterized impurities were deduced using the collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra of major ASPM components as templates. Most of the major impurities arise from the starting materials and the synthesis process. This work provides very useful information for quality control of ASPM and evaluation of its synthesis process. The effects of the antibiotic acetylspiramycin (ASPM) on lymphocyte function were studied in vitro and in vivo. When added to lymphocyte cultures in vitro, ASPM inhibited splenic lymphocyte transformation induced by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and antigen. It also depressed production by spleen cells of the lymphokine inducing procoagulant activity in mouse macrophages. Spleen cells from mice given ASPM orally showed enhanced responses to PHA, but normal responses to LPS.

Alverine is a smooth muscle relaxant. Smooth muscle is a type of muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is the muscle present in places such as the gut and uterus. == Adverse effects == The side effects of Alverine include: Difficulties in breathing or shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the face or other parts of the body (associated with serious allergic reaction) Yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin, due to liver inflammation A feeling of nausea or dizziness Headache Minor allergic reaction (skin rash/itching) It was reported that alverine may induce toxic hepatitis. == Mechanism of action == Alverine acts directly on the muscle in the gut, causing it to relax. Alverine is a 5HT1A antagonist, which reduces rectal hypersensitivity. This prevents the muscle spasms which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Diverticular disease is a condition in which small pouches form in the gut lining. These pouches can trap particles of food and become inflamed and painful. In irritable bowel syndrome, the normal activity of the gut muscle is lost. The muscle spasms result in symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating, constipation or diarrhoea. By relaxing the gut muscle, alverine citrate relieves the symptoms of this condition. Alverine also relaxes the smooth muscle in the womb (uterus). It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by muscle spasms in the uterus (dysmenorrhea). Alverine capsules are now available in the market. There are two strengths of capsule - 60 mg and 120 mg. The common dosage for adults and children over 12 years is 60–120 mg taken one, two or three a day, either before or after meals. Alverine is not suitable for those aged under 12 years. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should follow the instruction of doctors for the drug. == Development and marketing == A combination of alverine citrate and simeticone (ACS) for irritable bowel syndrome therapy were compared with placebo in a phase IV clinical trial. At week 4, the alverine citrate and simeticone group had lower VAS scores for abdominal pain/discomfort (median: 40 mm vs. 50 mm, P = 0.047) and higher responder rate (46.8% vs. 34.3%, OR = 1.3; P = 0.01) as compared with the placebo group.

3870,"('Aprotinin', 'Antilysin', 'Aprotinin from bovine lung', 'Traskolan', 'Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor')",Medical,"The drug aprotinin (Trasylol, previously Bayer and now Nordic Group pharmaceuticals), is a small protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), or basic trypsin inhibitor of bovine pancreas, which is an antifibrinolytic molecule that inhibits trypsin and related proteolytic enzymes. Under the trade name Trasylol, aprotinin was used as a medication administered by injection to reduce bleeding during complex surgery, such as heart and liver surgery. Its main effect is the slowing down of fibrinolysis, the process that leads to the breakdown of blood clots. The aim in its use was to decrease the need for blood transfusions during surgery, as well as end-organ damage due to hypotension (low blood pressure) as a result of marked blood loss. The drug was temporarily withdrawn worldwide in 2007 after studies suggested that its use increased the risk of complications or death; this was confirmed by follow-up studies. Trasylol sales were suspended in May 2008, except for very restricted research use. In February 2012 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific committee reverted its previous standpoint regarding aprotinin, and has recommended that the suspension be lifted. Nordic became distributor of aprotinin in 2012. == Chemistry == Aprotinin is a monomeric (single-chain) globular polypeptide derived from bovine lung tissue. It has a molecular weight of 6512 Da and consists of 16 different amino acid types arranged in a chain 58 residues long that folds into a stable, compact tertiary structure of the 'small SS-rich"" type, containing 3 disulfides, a twisted β-hairpin and a C-terminal α-helix. The amino acid sequence for bovine BPTI is RPDFC LEPPY TGPCK ARIIR YFYNA KAGLC QTFVY GGCRA KRNNF KSAED CMRTC GGA. There are 10 positively charged lysine (K) and arginine (R) side chains and only 4 negative aspartate (D) and glutamates (E), making the protein strongly basic, which accounts for the basic in its name. (Because of the usual source organism, BPTI is sometimes referred to as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.) The high stability of the molecule is due to the 3 disulfide bonds linking the 6 cysteine members of the chain (Cys5-Cys55, Cys14-Cys38 and Cys30-Cys51). The long, basic lysine 15 side chain on the exposed loop (at top left in the image) binds very tightly in the specificity pocket at the active site of trypsin and inhibits its enzymatic action. BPTI is synthesized as a longer, precursor sequence, which folds up and then is cleaved into the mature sequence given above. BPTI is the classic member of the protein family of Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors. Its physiological functions include the protective inhibition of the major digestive enzyme trypsin when small amounts are produced, by cleavage of the trypsinogen precursor during storage in the pancreas. == Mechanism of drug action == Aprotinin is a competitive inhibitor of several serine proteases, specifically trypsin, chymotrypsin and plasmin at a concentration of about 125,000 IU/ml, and kallikrein at 300,000 IU/ml. Its action on kallikrein leads to the inhibition of the formation of factor XIIa. As a result, both the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and fibrinolysis are inhibited. Its action on plasmin independently slows fibrinolysis. == Drug efficacy == In cardiac surgery with a high risk of significant blood loss, aprotinin significantly reduced bleeding, mortality and hospital stay. Beneficial effects were also reported in high-risk orthopedic surgery. In liver transplantation, initial reports of benefit were overshadowed by concerns about toxicity. In a meta-analysis performed in 2004, transfusion requirements decreased by 39% in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. In orthopedic surgery, a decrease of blood transfusions was likewise confirmed. == Drug safety == There have been concerns about the safety of aprotinin. Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) occurs at a rate of 1:200 in first-time use, but serology (measuring antibodies against aprotinin in the blood) is not carried out in practice to predict anaphylaxis risk because the correct interpretation of these tests is difficult. Thrombosis, presumably from overactive inhibition of the fibrinolytic system, may occur at a higher rate, but until 2006 there was limited evidence for this association. Similarly, while biochemical measures of renal function were known to occasionally deteriorate, there was no evidence that this greatly influenced outcomes. A study performed in cardiac surgery patients reported in 2006 showed that there was indeed a risk of acute renal failure, myocardial infarction and heart failure, as well as stroke and encephalopathy. The study authors recommend older antifibrinolytics (such as tranexamic acid) in which these risks were not documented. The same group updated their data in 2007 and demonstrated similar findings. In September 2006, Bayer A.G. was faulted by the FDA for not revealing during testimony the existence of a commissioned retrospective study of 67,000 patients, 30,000 of whom received aprotinin and the rest other anti-fibrinolytics. The study concluded aprotinin carried greater risks. The FDA was alerted to the study by one of the researchers involved. Although the FDA issued a statement of concern they did not change their recommendation that the drug may benefit certain subpopulations of patients. In a Public Health Advisory Update dated October 3, 2006, the FDA recommended that ""physicians consider limiting Trasylol use to those situations in which the clinical benefit of reduced blood loss is necessary to medical management and outweighs the potential risks"" and carefully monitor patients. On October 25, 2007, the FDA issued a statement regarding the ""Blood conservation using antifibrinolytics"" (BART) randomized trial in a cardiac surgery population. The preliminary findings suggest that, compared to other antifibrinolytic drugs (epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid) aprotinin may increase the risk of death. On October 29, 2006 the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that aprotinin may have serious kidney and cardiovascular toxicity. The producer, Bayer, reported to the FDA that additional observation studies showed that it may increase the chance for death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure and strokes. FDA warned clinicians to consider limiting use to those situations where the clinical benefit of reduced blood loss is essential to medical management and outweighs the potential risks. On November 5, 2007, Bayer announced that it was withdrawing Aprotinin because of a Canadian study that showed it increased the risk of death when used to prevent bleeding during heart surgery. Two studies published in early 2008, both comparing aprotinin with aminocaproic acid, found that mortality was increased by 32 and 64%, respectively. One study found an increased risk in need for dialysis and revascularisation. No cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy transmission by aprotinin have been reported, although the drug was withdrawn in Italy due to fears of this. == In vitro use == Small amounts of aprotinin can be added to tubes of drawn blood to enable laboratory measurement of certain rapidly degraded proteins such as glucagon. In cell biology aprotinin is used as an enzyme inhibitor to prevent protein degradation during lysis or homogenization of cells and tissues. Aprotinin can be labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The conjugate retains its antiproteolytic and carbohydrate-binding properties and has been used as a fluorescent histochemical reagent for staining glycoconjugates (mucosubstances) that are rich in uronic or sialic acids. == History == Initially named ""kallikrein inactivator"", aprotinin was first isolated from cow parotid glands in 1930. and independently as a trypsin inhibitor from bovine pancreas in 1936. It was purified from bovine lung in 1964. As it inhibits pancreatic enzymes, it was initially used in the treatment for acute pancreatitis, in which destruction of the gland by its own enzymes is thought to be part of the pathogenesis. Its use in major surgery commenced in the 1960s. BPTI is one of the most thoroughly studied proteins in terms of structural biology, experimental and computational dynamics, mutagenesis, and folding pathway. It was one of the earliest protein crystal structures solved, in 1970 in the laboratory of Robert Huber, and it's substrate-like interaction mode deciphered in the context of the bovine trypsin complex in 1974. It later also became famous being the first protein to have its structure determined by NMR spectroscopy, in the laboratory of Kurt Wuthrich at the ETH in Zurich in the early 1980s. Because it is a small, stable protein whose structure had been determined at high resolution by 1975, it was the first macromolecule of scientific interest to be simulated using molecular dynamics computation, in 1977 by J. Andrew McCammon and Bruce Gelin, in the Karplus group at Harvard. That study confirmed the then-surprising fact found in the NMR work that even well-packed aromatic sidechains in the interior of a stable protein can flip over rather rapidly (microsecond to millisecond time scale). Rate constants were determined by NMR for the hydrogen exchange of individual peptide NH groups along the chain, ranging from too fast to measure on the most exposed surface to many months for the most buried hydrogen-bonded groups in the center of the β sheet, and those values also correlate fairly well with degree of motion seen in the dynamics simulations. BPTI was important in the development of knowledge about the process of protein folding, the self-assembly of a polypeptide chain into a specific arrangement in 3D. The problem of achieving the correct pairings among the 6 Cys sidechains was shown to be especially difficult for the two buried, close-together SS near the BPTI chain termini, requiring a non-native intermediate for folding the mature sequence in vitro (it was later discovered that the precursor sequence folds more easily in vivo). BPTI was the cover image on a protein folding compendium volume by Thomas Creighton in 1992. == Current findings == One scientific study in rats reported that treatment with aprotinin prevents disruption of the blood–brain barrier during the C. neoformans infection.

The resistance to antibiotics of an increasing number of bacterial pathogens necessitates a permanent search for new molecules with different mechanisms of action. Histidine biosynthesis is an ancient pathway found in bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi and plants but absent in mammals. This feature makes it very interesting for the study of new strategies aimed to develop novel classes of antibacterial agents. In particular, one of the enzymes involved in the histidine biosynthesis, i.e. L-histidinol dehydrogenase (HDH), has been demonstrated to be essential for the survival of bacteria associated to several infections, such as brucellosis and tubercolosis. HDH is a Zn2+ enzyme which catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of Lhistidine: sequential NAD-dependent oxidations of L-histidinol to L-histidinaldehyde and then to L-histidine. This review will be focused on the biochemical and structural studies performed on HDH so far with the purpose to provide a structural background for the rational drug design of potent HDH inhibitors. Human cancer chemotherapy is limited by two major problems: the failure of commonly used anticancer drugs to act against tumor cells in a specific manner and the ability of malignant cells to resist killing by antineoplastic agents. Experimentally, both of these problems can be solved by using L-histidinol in combination with conventional anticancer drugs. A structural analogue of the essential amino acid L-histidine and an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis. L-histidinol improves the selectivity and the efficacy of a variety of cancer drugs in several transplantable murine tumors. Furthermore, L-histidinol circumvents the drug-resistant traits of a variety of cancer cells, including those showing multidrug resistance. This review will summarize these properties of L-histidinol, present new evidence on its ability to increase the vulnerability of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant human leukemia cells to various anticancer drugs, and show that, in addition to inhibiting protein synthesis, L-histidinol acts as an intracellular histamine antagonist. The establishment of a connection between the latter mechanism and the capacity to modulate anticancer drug action has resulted in a clinical trial in the treatment of human cancer. Nitrogen metabolism of M. tuberculosis is critical for its survival in infected host cells. M. tuberculosis has evolved sophisticated strategies to switch between de novo synthesis and uptake of various amino acids from host cells for metabolic demands. Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent histidinol phosphate aminotransferase-HspAT enzyme is critically required for histidine biosynthesis. HspAT is involved in metabolic synthesis of histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and novobiocin. We showed that M. tuberculosis Rv2231c is a conserved enzyme with HspAT activity. Rv2231c is a monomeric globular protein that contains α-helices and β-sheets. It is a secretory and cell wall-localized protein that regulates critical pathogenic attributes. Rv2231c enhances the survival and virulence of recombinant M. smegmatis in infected RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Rv2231c is recognized by the TLR4 innate immune receptor and modulates the host immune response by suppressing the secretion of the antibacterial pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-12, and IL-6. It also inhibits the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 along with antigen presenting molecule MHC-I on macrophage and suppresses reactive nitrogen species formation, thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization. Recombinant M. smegmatis expressing Rv2231c inhibited apoptosis in macrophages, promoting efficient bacterial survival and proliferation, thereby increasing virulence. Our results indicate that Rv2231c is a moonlighting protein that regulates multiple functions of M. tuberculosis pathophysiology to increase its virulence. These mechanistic insights can be used to better understand the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis and to design strategies for tuberculosis mitigation.",Histidinol,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00225243391469121), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.6936793327331543), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6932424306869507)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -3.128163257315464e-07)])","('INFO; ([foodcomex.org](https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000646?utm_source=openai), [hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0003431?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=163, start_index=6, title='FComEx: L-Histidinol (PC000646)', type='url_citation', url='https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000646?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=163, start_index=6, title='Human Metabolome Database: Showing metabocard for L-Histidinol (HMDB0003431)', type='url_citation', url='https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0003431?utm_source=openai')])"

3874,"('Oleic acid', 'Cis-9-octadecenoic acid', '(z)-octadec-9-enoic acid', 'Oleate', 'Elaidoic acid')","Food, Medical","Oleic acid is a fatty acid that occurs naturally in various animal and vegetable fats and oils. It is an odorless, colorless oil, although commercial samples may be yellowish due to the presence of impurities. In chemical terms, oleic acid is classified as a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, abbreviated with a lipid number of 18:1 cis-9, and a main product of Δ9-desaturase. It has the formula CH3−(CH2)7−CH=CH−(CH2)7−COOH. The name derives from the Latin word oleum, which means oil. It is the most common fatty acid in nature. The salts and esters of oleic acid are called oleates. It is a common component of oils, and thus occurs in many types of food, as well as in soap. == Occurrence == Fatty acids (or their salts) often do not occur as such in biological systems. Instead fatty acids such as oleic acid occur as their esters, commonly triglycerides, which are the greasy materials in many natural oils. Oleic acid is the most common monounsaturated fatty acid in nature. It is found in fats (triglycerides), the phospholipids that make membranes, cholesteryl esters, and wax esters. Triglycerides of oleic acid comprise the majority of olive oil (about 70%). It also makes up 59–75% of pecan oil, 61% of canola oil, 36–67% of peanut oil, 60% of macadamia oil, 20–80% of sunflower oil, 15–20% of grape seed oil, sea buckthorn oil, 40% of sesame oil, and 14% of poppyseed oil. High oleic variants of plant sources such as sunflower (~80%) and canola oil (70%) also have been developed. Karuka contains 52.39% oleic acid. It is abundantly present in many animal fats, constituting 37 to 56% of chicken and turkey fat, and 44 to 47% of lard. Free oleic acid occurs in oils and fats as a product of the breakdown of triglycerides. Olive oil exceeding 2% free oleic acid is graded unfit for human consumption. See Fatty acid § Free fatty acids. It is a chemical signal use by some ants. Oleic acid is the most abundant fatty acid in human adipose tissue, and second in abundance in human tissues overall, following palmitic acid. == Production and chemical behavior == The biosynthesis of oleic acid involves the action of the enzyme stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase acting on stearoyl-CoA. In effect, stearic acid is dehydrogenated to give the monounsaturated derivative, oleic acid. Oleic acid undergoes the typical reactions of carboxylic acids and alkenes. It is soluble in aqueous base to give soaps called oleates. Iodine adds across the double bond. Hydrogenation of the double bond yields the saturated derivative stearic acid. Oxidation at the double bond occurs slowly in air, and is known as rancidification in foodstuffs and as drying in coatings. Reduction of the carboxylic acid group yields oleyl alcohol. Ozonolysis of oleic acid is an important route to azelaic acid. The coproduct is nonanoic acid: H17C8CH=CHC7H14CO2H + 4""O"" → HO2CC7H14CO2H + H17C8CO2H Esters of azelaic acid find applications in lubrication and plasticizers. Neutralizing oleic acid with ethanolamines gives the protic ionic liquid monoethanolamine oleate. == Related compounds == The trans isomer of oleic acid is called elaidic acid or trans-9-octadecenoic acid. These isomers have distinct physical properties and biochemical properties. Elaidic acid, the most abundant trans fatty acid in diet, appears to have an adverse effect on health. A reaction that converts oleic acid to elaidic acid is called elaidinization. Another naturally occurring isomer of oleic acid is petroselinic acid. In chemical analysis, fatty acids are separated by gas chromatography of their methyl ester derivatives. Alternatively, separation of unsaturated isomers is possible by argentation thin-layer chromatography. In ethenolysis, methyl oleate, the methyl ester of the acid, converts to 1-decene and methyl 9-decenoate: CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7CO2Me + CH2=CH2 → CH3(CH2)7CH=CH2 + MeO2C(CH2)7CH=CH2 == Dietary sources == == Uses == Oleic acid is used as a component in many foods, in the form of its triglycerides. It is a component of the normal human diet, being a part of animal fats and vegetable oils. Oleic acid as its sodium salt is a major component of soap as an emulsifying agent. It is also used as an emollient. Small amounts of oleic acid are used as an excipient in pharmaceuticals, and it is used as an emulsifying or solubilizing agent in aerosol products. === Niche uses === Oleic acid is used to induce lung damage in certain types of animals for the purpose of testing new drugs and other means to treat lung diseases. Specifically in sheep, intravenous administration of oleic acid causes acute lung injury with corresponding pulmonary edema. Oleic acid is used as a soldering flux in stained glass work for joining lead came. == Health effects == Oleic acid is the most common monounsaturated fat in the human diet (~90% of all monounsaturated fats). Monounsaturated fat consumption has been associated with decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and possibly with increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Oleic acid may be responsible for the hypotensive (blood pressure reducing) effects of olive oil that is considered a health benefit. A 2017 review found that diets enriched in oleic acid are beneficial for regulating body weight. The United States FDA has approved a health claim on reduced risk of coronary heart disease for high oleic (> 70% oleic acid) oils. Some oil plants have cultivars bred to increase the amount of oleic acid in the oils. In addition to providing a health claim, the heat stability and shelf life may also be improved, but only if the increase in monounsaturated oleic acid levels correspond to a substantial reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid (especially α-linolenic acid) content. When the saturated fat or trans fat in a fried food is replaced with a stable high oleic oil, consumers may be able to avoid certain health risks associated with consuming saturated fat and trans fat. == See also == Oleylamine – the corresponding amine Oleamide – the corresponding amide == References == == External links == FATTY ACIDS: STRAIGHT-CHAIN MONOENOIC (The AOCS Lipid Library) 9-octadecenoic acid (NIST Chemistry Webbook)",Oleate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.3871122896671295), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.451116051815916e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -2.5776860184123507e-06), (',', -0.0009125363430939615), (' PERSONAL', -0.020595379173755646), (' CARE', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.014210639521479607), (' INDUSTR', -0.06996166706085205), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.03632543608546257), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0040906332433223724), ('ĠEND', -0.6389599442481995), ('OG', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.31328919529914856), ('ĠINDU', -0.47669440507888794), ('ST', -4.541770613286644e-05), ('RI', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38692453503608704)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -6.749814019713085e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -5.836499985889532e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://www.lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMFA01030002,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleic_acid,https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB031070,https://comptox.epa.gov/chemexpo/chemical/DTXSID3047633/ ', [])"

It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2009. Besides being indicated in arrhythmias, it was recommended as an alternative to amiodarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in people whose hearts have either returned to normal rhythm or who undergo drug therapy or electric shock treatment i.e. direct current cardioversion (DCCV) to maintain normal rhythm. It is a class III antiarrhythmic drug. The FDA label includes a claim for reducing hospitalization, but not for reducing mortality, as a reduction in mortality was not demonstrated in the clinical development program. A trial of the drug in heart failure was stopped as an interim analysis showed a possible increase in heart failure deaths, in people with moderate to severe congestive heart failure. The FDA label for dronedarone includes a boxed warning, stating that dronedarone is contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure, NYHA Class II and III heart failure with a recent decompensation requiring hospitalization or referral to a specialized heart failure clinic, or with permanent atrial fibrillation."" Dronedarone is also associated with rare cases of severe liver damage, including liver failure. It is approved as a generic medication. == Mechanism of action == Dronedarone has been termed a ""multichannel blocker"". However, it is unclear which channel(s) play a pivotal role in its success. Thus, dronedarone's actions at the cellular level are controversial, with most studies suggesting an inhibition in multiple outward potassium currents including rapid delayed rectifier, slow delayed rectifier and ACh-activated inward rectifier. It is also believed to reduce inward rapid Na current and L-type Ca channels. The reduction in K current in some studies was shown to be due to the inhibition of the K-ACh channel or associated GTP-binding proteins. Reduction of K+ current by 69% led to increased AP duration and increased effective refractory periods, thus shown to suppress pacemaker potential of the SA node and return patients to a normal heart rhythm. In a European trial, the average time to recurrence of an arrhythmia was 41 days in the placebo group vs. 96 days in the dronedarone group (similar results obtained in the non-European trial, 59 and 158 days respectively). == Chemistry == Chemically, dronedarone is a benzofuran derivative related to amiodarone, a popular antiarrhythmic. The use of amiodarone is limited by toxicity due its high iodine content (pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid disease) as well as by liver disease. In dronedarone, the iodine moieties are not present, reducing toxic effects on the thyroid and other organs. A methylsulfonamide group is added to reduce solubility in fats (lipophobicity) and thus reduce neurotoxic effects. Dronedarone displays amiodarone-like class III antiarrhythmic activity in vitro and in clinical trials. The drug also appears to exhibit activity in each of the 4 Vaughan-Williams antiarrhythmic classes. == Pharmacokinetics == Dronedarone is less lipophilic than amiodarone, has a much smaller volume of distribution, and has an elimination half-life of 13–19 hours—this stands in contrast to amiodarone's half-life of several weeks. As a result of these pharmacokinetic characteristics, dronedarone dosing may be less complicated than amiodarone. == Contraindications == Permanent AF (patients in whom normal sinus rhythm will not or cannot be restored) Recently decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization or Class IV heart failure. Second-or third-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome (except when used in conjunction with a functioning pacemaker) Bradycardia Concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor Concomitant use of drugs or herbal products that prolong the QT interval and may induce Torsade de Pointes Liver or lung toxicity related to the previous use of amiodarone Severe hepatic impairment QTc Bazett interval ≥500 ms, or use with drugs or herbal supplements that prolong QT interval or increase risk of torsades de points (Class I or III antiarrhythmic agents, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, certain oral macrolides, ephedra). Pregnancy and nursing mothers Hypersensitivity to dronedarone Hepatic impairment. In January 2011, the FDA advised about cases of rare, but severe, liver injury, including two cases of acute liver failure leading to liver transplant in patients treated with dronedarone (Multaq). It is not known whether routine periodic monitoring of serum liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) and bilirubin in patients taking dronedarone will prevent the development of severe liver injury. PR interval exceeding 280 ms Use of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3a isoenzyme inhibitors (includes: clarithromycin, cyclosporine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) == Clinical trials == Clinical trials have compared dronedarone to placebo and to amiodarone, for its ability to reduce atrial fibrillation, to reduce mortality overall and from cardiac causes, and for its adverse effects, including excess mortality. Dronedarone is a non-iodinated class III anti-arrhythmic drug which helps patients return to normal sinus rhythm. This treatment for AF is also known to reduce associated mortality and hospitalizations compared to other similar antiarrhythmic agents. In the EURIDIS and ADONIS trials in atrial fibrillation (2007), dronedarone was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm, with no difference in lung and thyroid function in the short term. However, in the ANDROMEDA study (2007), dronedarone doubled the death rate compared to placebo, and the trial was halted early. ANDROMEDA enrolled patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure, a relatively sicker patient population. In a later atrial fibrillation trial, ATHENA, with 4628 subjects, dronedarone was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the composite endpoint of first hospitalization due to cardiovascular events or death. There was a significant reduction in the rate of cardiovascular death, but not in the rate of death from any cause. Later post-hoc analysis of the ATHENA-results showed a significant reduction in the rate of stroke. Patients randomized to dronedarone were more likely to develop bradycardia and QT-interval prolongation (but only 1 case of Torsades). Nausea, diarrhea, rash, and creatinine elevation also were more common in the dronedarone arm. The PALLAS trial (2011) was stopped for safety concerns due to the finding that ""dronedarone increased rates of heart failure, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation who were at risk for major vascular events"". A Black Box warning was subsequently added by the FDA stating that the risk of death, stroke, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure doubled in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation. === Direct current cardioversion results === Dronedarone has been tested in some trials as a way to improve the success rate of electrical cardioversion. In one such trial by the Veteran's Administration it was used prepare patients for electrical conversion to sinus rhythm. In the ATHENA study, 25% of patients were started on dronedarone before cardioversion. The results of a recently concluded randomized study (ELECTRA) may clarify the safety and ideal modalities of dronedarone use at the time of cardioversion. == Regulatory review == Originally submitted as a New Drug Application in 2005, dronedarone was reviewed and recommended for approval in March 2009, by an Advisory Committee of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA approved dronedarone in July 2009. Health Canada was the second major regulatory body to approve the drug, giving its approval in August 2009. The approval is for ""treatment of patients with a history of, or current atrial fibrillation to reduce their risk of cardiovascular hospitalization due to this condition."" The European Medicines Agency issued a Summary of Positive Opinion regarding dronedarone in September 2009, recommending to the European Commission to grant a marketing authorization within the European Union. == Research == In July 2019, a new drug called poyendarone was patented by the department of pharmacy of National University of Singapore (NUS). It was developed by modifying the dronedarone molecule to remove its tendency to cause ventricular arrhythmia. == References ==",Multaq,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.940656698541716e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00026651646476238966)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/multaq.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Multaq: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/multaq.html?utm_source=openai')])"

During analysis of aged quality-control samples, a previously unreported chromatographic response was observed at a shorter retention time than PPZHCl. Further investigation of formulations stored in trap tap devices at temperatures ranging from 5 to 40 degrees C during field trials at four different locations confirmed the degradation of the active ingredient. Further investigation using HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry revealed two to five degradates, with the major degradates being oxidation products of the active ingredient, PPZHCl. As PPZHCl formulations must be stable when stored at 5 to 40 degrees C for 6 to 12 months, reformulation with the anti-oxidant ascorbic acid was utilized to achieve the required PPZHCl stability. Propionylpromazine hydrochloride (PPZHCl) has been investigated for use with leghold traps to reduce the amount of self-inflicted trauma experienced by animals restrained by these traps. Three types of PPZHCl formulations made with Karo dark syrup, K-Y Jelly, and Vaseline were used in 2 types of tranquilizer trap devices (TTDs). A reversed-phase ion-pair liquid chromatography (LC) method using a small bore C18 column was used to: (1) determine the purity of the PPZHCl material used in these formulations, and (2) to determine the resulting PPZHCl content of each formulation. Analyte quantitation was done using UV absorption at 280 nm. Regression analysis of calibration standard solutions indicated a linear and directly proportional relationship between analyte response and PPZHCl concentration over the range evaluated.

3878,"('Guanidine (hydrochloride)', 'Guanidinium (chloride)', 'Aminoformamidine (hydrochloride)', 'Guanidine', 'Iminourea')","Endogenous, Medical","Guanidine is the compound with the formula HNC(NH2)2. It is a colourless solid that dissolves in polar solvents. It is a strong base that is used in the production of plastics and explosives. It is found in urine predominantly in patients experiencing renal failure. A guanidine moiety also appears in larger organic molecules, including on the side chain of arginine. == Structure == Guanidine can be thought of as a nitrogenous analogue of carbonic acid. That is, the C=O group in carbonic acid is replaced by a C=NH group, and each OH is replaced by a NH2 group. Isobutene can be seen as the carbon analogue in much the same way. A detailed crystallographic analysis of guanidine was elucidated 148 years after its first synthesis, despite the simplicity of the molecule. In 2013, the positions of the hydrogen atoms and their displacement parameters were accurately determined using single-crystal neutron diffraction. == Production == Guanidine can be obtained from natural sources, being first isolated in 1861 by Adolph Strecker via the oxidative degradation of an aromatic natural product, guanine, isolated from Peruvian guano. A laboratory method of producing guanidine is gentle (180-190 °C) thermal decomposition of dry ammonium thiocyanate in anhydrous conditions: 3 NH4SCN → 2 CH5N3 + H2S + CS2 The commercial route involves a two step process starting with the reaction of dicyandiamide with ammonium salts. Via the intermediacy of biguanidine, this ammonolysis step affords salts of the guanidinium cation (see below). In the second step, the salt is treated with base, such as sodium methoxide. Isothiouronium salts (S-alkylated thioureas) react with amines to give guanidinium salts: RNH2 + [CH3SC(NH2)2]+X− → [RN(H)C(NH2)2]+X− + CH3SH The resulting guanidinium ions can often be deprotonated to give the guanidine. This approach is sometimes called the Rathke synthesis, in honor of its discoverer. after Bernhard Rathke == Chemistry == === Guanidinium cation === The conjugate acid is called the guanidinium cation, (C(NH2)+3). This planar, symmetric ion consists of three amino groups each bonded to the central carbon atom with a covalent bond of order 4/3. It is a highly stable +1 cation in aqueous solution due to the efficient resonance stabilization of the charge and efficient solvation by water molecules. As a result, its pKaH is 13.6 (pKb of 0.4) meaning that guanidine is a very strong base in water; in neutral water, it exists almost exclusively as guanidinium. Due to this, most guanidine derivatives are salts containing the conjugate acid. === Testing for guanidine === Guanidine can be selectively detected using sodium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonic acid (Folin's reagent) and acidified urea. == Uses == === Industry === The main salt of commercial interest is the nitrate [C(NH2)3]NO3. It is used as a propellant, for example in air bags. === Medicine === Since the Middle Ages in Europe, guanidine has been used to treat diabetes as the active antihyperglycemic ingredient in French lilac. Due to its long-term hepatotoxicity, further research for blood sugar control was suspended at first after the discovery of insulin. Later development of nontoxic, safe biguanides led to the long-used first-line diabetes control medicine metformin, introduced to Europe in the 1950s & United States in 1995 and now prescribed to over 17 million patients per year in the US. Guanidinium chloride is a now-controversial adjuvant in treatment of botulism. Recent studies have shown some significant subsets of patients who see no improvement after the administration of this drug. === Biochemistry === Guanidine exists protonated, as guanidinium, in solution at physiological pH. Guanidinium chloride (also known as guanidine hydrochloride) has chaotropic properties and is used to denature proteins. Guanidinium chloride is known to denature proteins with a linear relationship between concentration and free energy of unfolding. In aqueous solutions containing 6 M guanidinium chloride, almost all proteins lose their entire secondary structure and become randomly coiled peptide chains. Guanidinium thiocyanate is also used for its denaturing effect on various biological samples. Recent studies suggest that guanidinium is produced by bacteria as a toxic byproduct. To alleviate the toxicity of guanidinium, bacteria have developed a class of transporters known as guanidinium exporters or Gdx proteins to expel the extra amounts of this ion to the outside of the cell. Gdx proteins, are highly selective for guanidinium and mono-substituted guanidinyl compounds and share an overlapping set of non-canonical substrates with drug exporter EmrE. === Other === Guanidinium hydroxide is the active ingredient in some non-lye hair relaxers. == Guanidine derivatives == Guanidines are a group of organic compounds sharing a common functional group with the general structure (R1R2N)(R3R4N)C=N−R5. The central bond within this group is that of an imine, and the group is related structurally to amidines and ureas. Examples of guanidines are arginine, triazabicyclodecene, saxitoxin, and creatine. Galegine is an isoamylene guanidine. == See also == Sakaguchi test Y-aromaticity Amidine == References ==",Guanidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.05467281863093376), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00043126524542458355), (' END', -0.5348182320594788), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -0.0010374527191743255), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.014182780869305134), (' MED', -0.2269650399684906), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.006726737599819899), (' PERSONAL', -0.0003812217037193477), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('IN', -0.036002930253744125), ('DU', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', 0.0), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -9.179073458653875e-06), ('ĠMED', -0.6970022320747375), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -0.005244426429271698), ('ĠEND', -0.13925780355930328), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38700297474861145)])","('ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.00025633294717408717), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -3.547789674485102e-05), (' INDUSTR', -8.180258191714529e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.drugs.com/pro/guanidine.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanidine,https://pmarketresearch.com/industrial-grade-guanidine-hydrochloride-market-analysis/ ', [])"
3879,"('Meloxicam', 'Mobic', 'Metacam', 'Movalis', 'Mobec')",Medical,"Meloxicam, sold under the brand name Mobic among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammation in rheumatic diseases and osteoarthritis. It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein. It is recommended that it be used for as short a period as possible and at a low dose. Common side effects include abdominal pain, dizziness, swelling, headache, and a rash. Serious side effects may include heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and stomach ulcers. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy. It blocks cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) more than it blocks cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). It is in the oxicam family of chemicals and is closely related to piroxicam. Meloxicam was patented in 1977 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2000. It was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 29th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 18 million prescriptions. An intravenous version of meloxicam (Anjeso) was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2020. Meloxicam is available in combination with bupivacaine as bupivacaine/meloxicam and in combination with rizatriptan as meloxicam/rizatriptan. == Medical uses == Meloxicam is indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. == Adverse effects == Meloxicam use can result in gastrointestinal toxicity and bleeding, headaches, rash, and very dark or black stool (a sign of intestinal bleeding). It has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than diclofenac, piroxicam, naproxen, and perhaps all other NSAIDs which are not COX-2 selective. In October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the prescription drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. === Cardiovascular === Like other NSAIDs, its use is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. Although meloxicam inhibits formation of thromboxane A, it does not appear to do so at levels that would interfere with platelet function. A pooled analysis of randomized, controlled studies of meloxicam therapy of up to 60 days duration found that meloxicam was associated with a statistically significantly lower number of thromboembolic complications than the NSAID diclofenac (0.2% versus 0.8% respectively) but a similar incidence of thromboembolic events to naproxen and piroxicam. People with hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes are at risk for cardiovascular side effects. People with family history of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke should tell their treating physician as the potential for serious cardiovascular side effects is significant. === Gastrointestinal === NSAIDs cause an increase in the risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events. == Mechanism of action == Meloxicam blocks cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme responsible for converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H2—the first step in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation. Meloxicam has been shown, especially at low therapeutic doses, to selectively inhibit COX-2 over COX-1. Meloxicam concentrations in synovial fluid range from 40% to 50% of those in plasma. The free fraction in synovial fluid is 2.5 times higher than in plasma, due to the lower albumin content in synovial fluid compared to plasma. The significance of this penetration is unknown, but it may account for the fact that it performs exceptionally well in treatment of arthritis in animal models. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === The bioavailability of meloxicam is decreased when administered orally compared to an equivalent IV bolus dose. Different oral formulations of meloxicam are not bioequivalent. Use of oral meloxicam following a high-fat breakfast increases the mean peak drug levels by about 22%; however, the manufacturer does not make any specific meal recommendations. In addition, the use of antacids does not show pharmacokinetic interactions. With chronic dosing, the time to maximum plasma concentration following oral administration is approximately 5–6 hours. === Distribution === The mean volume of distribution of meloxicam is approximately 10 L. It is highly protein-bound, mainly to albumin. === Metabolism === Meloxicam is extensively metabolized in the liver by the enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (minor) into four inactive metabolites. Peroxidase activity is thought to be responsible for the other two remaining metabolites. === Excretion === Meloxicam is predominantly excreted in the form of metabolites and occurs to equal extents in the urine and feces. Traces of unchanged parent drug are found in urine and feces. The mean elimination half-life ranges from 15 to 20 hours. Adverse events are dose-dependent and associated with length of treatment. == Veterinary use == Meloxicam is used in veterinary medicine mainly to treat dogs, but also sees off-label use in other animals such as cattle and exotics. In the European Union and other countries it is not considered off-label and can be used in cattle, pigs, horses, dogs, cats and guinea pigs. It has also been investigated as an alternative to diclofenac by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) to prevent deaths of vultures. Depending on the animal species, each country or union of countries applies different guidelines or legal frameworks for the use of the drug, as well as different recorded side effects. The most common side effects in dogs include gastrointestinal irritation (vomiting, diarrhea, and ulceration). As far as the perioperative administration is concerned, in healthy dogs given meloxicam, no perioperative adverse effects on the cardiovascular system have been reported at recommended dosages. Perioperative administration of meloxicam to cats did not affect postoperative respiratory rate nor heart rate. === Use of meloxicam in cats === The issue of using meloxicam in cats involves conflicting guidelines, differing legislation, and a narrow therapeutic safety margin that can easily turn the drug from cure to poison. More specifically: ==== US policy vs EU policy ==== The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the use of meloxicam in cats only in injectable form and only as a one-time injection given before surgery. It does not approve meloxicam oral suspension for cats and it does not approve meloxicam spray for cats because after reviewing numerous reports of meloxicam side effects in cats, it has identified many cases of acute renal failure and death and has added the following boxed warning to the prescription label: ""Repeated use of meloxicam in cats has been associated with acute renal failure and death. Do not administer additional injectable or oral meloxicam to cats. See Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions for detailed information."" In contrast, in the European Union and other continents or countries, the use of the drug in cats is allowed with no such warning. The product instruction leaflet for meloxicam for cats in the form of oral suspension 0.5 mg/ml states that: ""Typical adverse reactions of NSAIDs such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, faecal occult blood, apathy, and renal failure have occasionally been reported. These side effects are in most cases transient and disappear following termination of the treatment but in very rare cases may be serious or fatal."" ==== Dosage and safety margin ==== The data sheets for meloxicam products for cats also state that: ""Meloxicam has a narrow therapeutic safety margin in cats and clinical signs of overdose may be seen at relatively small overdose levels."" ==== Additional studies ==== Some additional information about giving meloxicam to cats from researchers is as follows: A peer-reviewed journal article cites NSAIDs, including meloxicam, as causing gastrointestinal upset and, at high doses, acute kidney injury and CNS signs such as seizures and comas in cats. It adds that cats have a low tolerance for NSAIDs. Also, in another scientific journal there is talk of research according to which cats that received meloxicam had greater proteinuria at 6 months than cats that received placebo. It was concluded that meloxicam should be used with caution in cats with chronic kidney disease. === Pharmacokinetics === In dogs, the absorption of meloxicam from the stomach is not affected by the presence of food, with the peak concentration (Cmax) of meloxicam occurring in the blood 7–8 hours after administration. The half-life of meloxicam is approximately 24 hours in dogs. In the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), very little meloxicam is absorbed into the blood after oral administration (that is, it has poor bioavailability). === Legal status === ==== United States ==== 2003: Meloxicam was approved in the US for use in dogs for the management of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, as an oral (liquid) formulation of meloxicam. 2003 (November): An injectable formulation for use in dogs was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 2004 (October): A formulation for use in cats was approved for use before surgery only. This is an injectable meloxicam, indicated for as a single, one-time dose only, with specific and repeated warnings not to administer a second dose. 2005 (January): The product insert added a warning in bold-face type: ""Do not use in cats."" 2005: The FDA sent a Notice of Violation to the manufacturer for its promotional materials which included promotion of the drug for off-label use. 2020 (February): A meloxicam injection was approved for use in the United States. Specifically, the FDA granted the approval of Anjeso to Baudax Bio. ==== European Union ==== In the European Union, meloxicam is licensed for other anti-inflammatory benefits including relief from both acute and chronic pain in dogs. Meloxicam is also licensed for use in horses, to relieve the pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders. 1998 (January): Meloxicam was authorised for use in cattle throughout the European Union, via a centralised marketing authorisation. 2006: The first generic meloxicam product was approved. 2024 (January): EMA issued an 'Opinion' on a change to this medicine's authorisation concerning the follow-up oral treatment after initial injectable administration in cats. This change remains as an 'Opinion', while the medication continues to be approved as usual. ==== Other countries ==== As of June 2008, meloxicam is registered for long-term use in cats in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In the United Kingdom, meloxicam is licensed for use in cats, guinea pigs, horses, and livestock including pigs and cattle. == See also == Bupivacaine/meloxicam == References ==",Mobec,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.61460001335945e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004092295654118061)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.676292231422849e-05)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3880,"('Patulin', 'Terinin', 'Clavacin', 'Clavatin', 'Expansine')","Food, Medical","Patulin is an organic compound classified as a polyketide. It is named after the fungus from which it was isolated, Penicillium patulum. It is a white powder soluble in acidic water and in organic solvents. It is a lactone that is heat-stable, so it is not destroyed by pasteurization or thermal denaturation. However, stability following fermentation is lessened. It is a mycotoxin produced by a variety of molds, in particular, Aspergillus and Penicillium and Byssochlamys. Most commonly found in rotting apples, the amount of patulin in apple products is generally viewed as a measure of the quality of the apples used in production. In addition, patulin has been found in other foods such as grains, fruits, and vegetables. Its presence is highly regulated. == Biosynthesis, synthesis, and reactivity == Patulin is biosynthesized from 6-methylsalicylic acid via multiple chemical transformations. Isoepoxydon dehydrogenase (IDH) is an important enzyme in the multi-step biosynthesis of patulin. Its gene is present in other fungi that may potentially produce the toxin. It is reactive with sulfur dioxide, so antioxidant and antimicrobial agents may be useful to destroy it. Levels of nitrogen, manganese, and pH as well as abundance of necessary enzymes regulate the biosynthetic pathway of patulin. == Uses == Patulin was originally used as an antibiotic against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but after several toxicity reports, it is no longer used for that purpose. Isolated by Nancy Atkinson in 1943, it was specifically trialed to be used against the common cold. Patulin is used as a potassium-uptake inhibitor in laboratory applications. Kashif Jilani and co-workers reported that patulin stimulates suicidal erythrocyte death under physiological concentrations. == Sources of exposure == Frequently, patulin is found in apples and apple products such as juices, jams, and ciders. It has also been detected in other fruits including cherries, blueberries, plums, bananas, strawberries, and grapes. Fungal growth leading to patulin production is most common on damaged fruits. Patulin has also been detected in grains like barley, wheat, corn and their processed products as well as in shellfish. Dietary intake of patulin from apple juice has been estimated at between 0.03 and 0.26 μg per kg body weight per day in various age groups and populations. Content of patulin in apple juice is estimated to be less than 10–15 μg/L. A number of studies have looked into comparisons of organic vs conventional harvest of apples and levels of patulin contamination. For example, one study showed 0.9% of children drinking organic apple juice exceeded the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for patulin. A recent article described detection of patulin in marine strains of Penicillium, indicating a potential risk in shellfish consumption. == Toxicity == A subacute rodent NOAEL of 43 μg/kg body weight as well as genotoxicity studies were primarily the cause for setting limits for patulin exposure, although a range of other types of toxicity also exist. While not a particularly potent toxin, patulin is genotoxic. Some theorize that it may be a carcinogen, although animal studies have remained inconclusive. Patulin has shown antimicrobial properties against some microorganisms. Several countries have instituted patulin restrictions in apple products. The World Health Organization recommends a maximum concentration of 50 μg/L in apple juice. In the European Union, the limit is also set at 50 micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg) in apple juice and cider, at 25 μg/kg in solid apple products, and at 10 μg/kg in products for infants and young children. These limits came into force on 1 November 2003. === Acute === Patulin is toxic primarily through affinity to sulfhydryl groups (SH), which results in inhibition of enzymes. Oral LD50 in rodent models have ranged between 20 and 100 mg/kg. In poultry, the oral LD50 range was reported between 50 and 170 mg/kg. Other routes of exposure are more toxic, yet less likely to occur. Major acute toxicity findings include gastrointestinal problems, neurotoxicity (i.e. convulsions), pulmonary congestion, and edema. === Subacute === Studies in rats showed decreased weight, and gastric, intestinal, and renal function changes, while repetitive doses lead to neurotoxicity. Reproductive toxicity in males was also reported. A NOAEL in rodents was observed at 43 μg/kg body weight. === Genotoxicity === WHO concluded that patulin is genotoxic based on variable genotoxicity data, however it is considered a group 3 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) since data was inconclusive. === Reproduction studies === Patulin decreased sperm count and altered sperm morphology in the rat. Also, it resulted in abortion of F1 litters in rats and mice after i.p. injection. Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were also reported in chick eggs. === Immunotoxicity === Patulin was found to be immunotoxic in a number of animal and even human studies. Reduced cytokine secretion, oxidative burst in macrophages, increased splenic T lymphocytes, and increased neutrophil numbers are a few endpoints noticed. However, dietary relevant exposure would not be likely to alter immune response. === Human health === Although there are only very few reported cases and epidemiological data, the FDA has set an action limit of 50 ppb in cider due to its potential carcinogenicity and other reported adverse effects. In humans, it was tested as an antiviral intranasally for use against the common cold with few significant adverse effects, yet also had negligible or no beneficial effect. == Risk management and regulations == Patulin exposure can be successfully managed by following good agricultural practices such as removing mold, washing, and not using rotten or damaged apples for baking, canning, or juice production. US The provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) for patulin was set at 0.43 μg/kg body weight by the FDA based on a NOAEL of 0.3 mg/kg body weight per week. Monte Carlo analysis was done on apple juice to compare exposure and the PTDI. Without controls or an action limit, the 90th percentile of consumers would not be above the PTDI. However, the concentration in children 1–2 years old would be three times as high as the PDTI, hence an action limit of 50 μg/kg. WHO The World Health Organization recommends a maximum concentration of 50 μg/L in apple juice. EU The European Union (EU) has set a maximum limit of 50 μg/kg on fruit juices and drinks, while solid apple products have a limit of 25 μg/kg. For certain foods intended for infants, an even lower limit of 10 μg/kg is observed. To test for patulin contamination, a variety of methods and sample preparation methods have been employed, including thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and capillary electrophoresis. == References == == External links == Patulin Archived 2017-12-19 at the Wayback Machine, Food Safety Watch",Expansine,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.3493087589740753), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.02325631119310856), (' INDUSTR', -0.00018911674851551652), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.7376189827919006), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.062031928449869156), ('ĠINDU', -0.24717125296592712), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -3.0278701160568744e-05), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5763670206069946)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([fr.wikipedia.org](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='Expansine', type='url_citation', url='https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansine?utm_source=openai')])"

Like other members of the gliptin class, it causes little or no weight gain, exhibits relatively little risk of hypoglycemia, and has relatively modest glucose-lowering activity. Alogliptin and other gliptins are commonly used in combination with metformin in people whose diabetes cannot adequately be controlled with metformin alone. In April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning about increased risk of heart failure. It was developed by Syrrx, a company which was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in 2005. In 2020, it was the 295th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Alogliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DDP-4) that decreases blood sugar levels similar to other DPP-4 inhibitors. == Side effects == Adverse events include hypoglycemia, pruritis (itching), nasopharyngitis, headache, and upper respiratory tract infection. It may also cause joint pain that can be severe and disabling. Like other DDP-4 inhibitors, alogliptin is weight-neutral. A 2014 letter to the editor claimed alogliptin is not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. In April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning about increased risk of heart failure. == Market access == In December 2007, Takeda submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for alogliptin to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), after positive results from Phase III clinical trials. In September 2008, the company also filed for approval in Japan, winning approval in April 2010. The company also filed a Marketing Authorization Application elsewhere outside the United States, which was withdrawn in June 2009 needing more data. The first NDA failed to gain approval and was followed by a pair of NDAs (one for alogliptin and a second for a combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone) in July 2011. In 2012, Takeda received a negative response from the FDA on both of these NDAs, citing a need for additional data.

3883,"('Sophoridine', 'Sophoridin', 'Dihydro-5-episophocarpine', '(5beta)-matridin-15-one', 'Allomatrine')",Medical,"Styphnolobium japonicum, the Japanese pagoda tree (also known as the Chinese scholar tree and pagoda tree; syn. Sophora japonica) is a species of deciduous tree in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae. It was formerly included within a broader interpretation of the genus Sophora. The species of Styphnolobium differ from Sophora in lacking the ability to form symbioses with rhizobia (nitrogen fixing bacteria) on their roots. It also differs from the related genus Calia (mescalbeans) in having deciduous leaves and flowers in axillary, not terminal, racemes. The leaves are alternate, pinnate, with nine to 21 leaflets, and the flowers in pendulous racemes similar to those of the black locust. == Distribution == Styphnolobium japonicum is native to China. Despite its Latin name, the species was introduced in Japan and not originally found there. It is a popular ornamental tree in Europe, North America and South Africa, grown for its white flowers, borne in late summer after most other flowering trees have long finished flowering. It grows to 10–20 m tall with an equal spread, and produces a fine, dark brown timber. == Uses == === History === Despite its name, the Chinese scholar tree was the official memorial tree of higher officials in Zhou dynasty China. The tombs of scholars were instead decorated with Koelreuteria paniculata. The Guilty Chinese Scholartree is a historic pagoda tree in Beijing, from which the last emperor of the Ming dynasty, Chongzhen, hung himself in 1644. === Traditional medicine === S. japonicum (Chinese: 槐; pinyin: huái; formerly Sophora japonica) is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its fruits have stress resistance and antioxidant properties. === Tea === The flowers and leaves are sometimes used for teas, such as by families in Laoshan Village, Shandong Province, China. It counts as a variety of herbal tea. === Construction uses === The wood is used to make the strong, springy curved ""enju wood"" handle used on the traditional Japanese woodworking adze, called the chouna. Pagoda wood is very hard after drying. This makes pagoda products durable and long lasting. The pagoda tree trunk is generally composed of alternating ridges of light-brown outside layers and gray brown inside layers. This makes wood carving products, for example from the Hokkaido native Ainu people, very decorative. The Ainu are famous for their carvings of the Blakiston's fish owl. == Chemistry == The dried flower buds may contain as much as 20% rutin with some quercetin. S. japonicum dried fruit contains the flavonoid glycosides sophoricoside, genistin and rutin and the flavonoid aglycones genistein, quercetin and kaempferol. Another analysis found genistein and genistein glycosides including sophorabioside, sophoricoside, genistein-7-diglucoside, genistein-7-diglucorhamnoside, and kaempferol and the kaempferol glycosides kaempferol-3-sophoroside and kaempferol-3-rhamnodiglucoside. The fruit also contain the alkaloids cytisine, N-methylcytisine, sophocarpine, matrine and stizolamine.

3884,"('Trimipramine (maleate)', 'Trimipramine', 'Trimeprimine', 'Surmontil', 'Sapilent')",Medical,"Trimipramine, sold under the brand name Surmontil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) which is used to treat depression. It has also been used for its sedative, anxiolytic, and weak antipsychotic effects in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, respectively. The drug is described as an atypical or ""second-generation"" TCA because, unlike other TCAs, it seems to be a fairly weak monoamine reuptake inhibitor. Similarly to other TCAs, however, trimipramine does have antihistamine, antiserotonergic, antiadrenergic, antidopaminergic, and anticholinergic activities. == Medical uses == Trimipramine's primary use in medicine is in the treatment of major depressive disorder, especially where sedation is helpful due to its prominent sedative effects. The drug is also an effective anxiolytic, and can be used in the treatment of anxiety. In addition to depression and anxiety, trimipramine is effective in the treatment of insomnia, and unlike most other hypnotics, does not alter the normal sleep architecture. In particular, it does not suppress REM sleep, and dreams are said to ""brighten"" during treatment. Trimipramine also has some weak antipsychotic effects with a profile of activity described as similar to that of clozapine, and may be useful in the treatment of psychotic symptoms, such as in delusional depression, schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found that trimipramine had an effect size (standardized mean difference (SMD)) against placebo for treatment of insomnia at 4 weeks of 0.55 (95% CITooltip confidence interval –0.11 to 1.21). The certainty of evidence was rated as very low, and no data were available for longer-term treatment (3 months). For comparison, the other sedating antihistamines assessed, doxepin and doxylamine, had effect sizes (SMD) at 4 weeks of 0.30 (95% CI –0.05 to 0.64) (very low certainty evidence) and 0.47 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.89) (moderate certainty evidence), respectively. The effective dosage of trimipramine in depression is 150 to 300 mg/day. Doses of trimipramine used for insomnia range from 25 to 200 mg/day. However, it has been advised that doses be kept as low as possible, and a low dose of 25 mg/day has been recommended. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Recent myocardial infarction Any degree of heart block or other cardiac arrhythmias Mania Severe liver disease During breastfeeding Hypersensitivity to trimipramine or to any of the excipients == Side effects == The side effects of trimipramine have been said to be similar to those of other tertiary amine TCAs, with a preponderance of anticholinergic and sedative effects. However, trimipramine has also been said to be associated with a different side effect profile compared to other TCAs and in general with fewer side effects, chiefly due to its lack of norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and relatively lower anticholinergic effects (although it is still a potent anticholinergic). Somnolence is the most common side effect of the drug. Dry mouth is the most common anticholinergic side effect, but others like constipation, urinary retention, and blurred vision are also present. Such effects, in any case, may be treated with bethanechol. It is described as being associated with minimal or no orthostatic hypotension, at least in comparison to clomipramine, in spite of its potent and comparable activity as an alpha-1 blocker. However, it has also been said to have a rate of orthostatic hypotension similar to that of other TCAs. Trimipramine is said to be less epileptogenic than other TCAs, although seizures have still been reported in association with it. It is also less cardiotoxic than other TCAs and cardiotoxicity is said to be minimal, with a ""very favorable profile"". Heavy exposure to any tricyclic antidepressants was associated with an elevated rate ratio for breast cancer 11–15 years later. However, on tests done on Drosophila melanogaster, nongenotoxic TCAs (amitriptyline, maprotiline, nortriptyline, and protriptyline), and genotoxic TCAs (amoxapine, clomipramine, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine) were identified. === List of side effects === Common adverse effects include: Adverse effects with an unknown incidence includes: Confusion Nausea Vomiting Extrapyramidal side effects (e.g. parkinsonism, dystonia, etc.) Tinnitus Paraesthesia ECG changes Increased liver function tests Rare adverse effects include: Seizures Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone Blood dyscrasias including: Agranulocytosis Thrombocytopenia Eosinophilia Leukopenia Myocardial infarction Heart block QTc interval prolongation Sudden cardiac death Depression worsening Suicidal ideation == Overdose == Compared to other TCAs, trimipramine is relatively safe in overdose, although it is more dangerous than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) but less dangerous than bupropion in cases of overdose. == Interactions == Trimipramine should not be given with sympathomimetic agents such as epinephrine (adrenaline), ephedrine, isoprenaline, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), phenylephrine and phenylpropanolamine. Barbiturates may increase the rate of metabolism. Trimipramine should be administered with care in patients receiving therapy for hyperthyrodism. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of trimipramine in terms of its antidepressant effects differs from that of other TCAs and is not fully clear. The mechanism of action of its anxiolytic effects is similarly unclear. Trimipramine is a very weak reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (see below), and unlike most other TCAs, has been claimed to be devoid of clinically significant monoamine reuptake inhibition. The effects of the drug are thought to be mainly due to receptor antagonism as follows: Very strong: H1 Strong: 5-HT2A, α1-adrenergic Moderate: D2, mACh Weak: 5-HT2C, D1, α2-adrenergic In spite of its atypical nature and different profile of activity, trimipramine has been shown in head-to-head clinical studies to possess equivalent effectiveness to other antidepressants, including but not limited to other TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, amineptine), tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs) (e.g., maprotiline), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., phenelzine, isocarboxazid), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine). In addition, trimipramine has been found to possess greater anxiolytic effects than other TCAs such as amitriptyline and doxepin in head-to-head comparisons. Indeed, its prominent anxiolytic effects have been said to distinguish it from most other TCAs. The atypicality of trimipramine in relation to its lack of monoamine reuptake inhibition is described as challenging the monoamine hypothesis of depression. The major metabolite of trimipramine, desmethyltrimipramine, is considered to possess pharmacological activity similar to that of other demethylated tertiary amine TCA variants. ==== Monoamine reuptake inhibition ==== Studies have generally found only very weak inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake with trimipramine, and the drug has been described by various authors as devoid of monoamine reuptake inhibition. Richelson & Pfenning (1984) found a relatively high Ki for the NET of 510 nM in rat brain synaptosomes and Tatsumi et al. (1997) found a relatively high KD of 149 nM for the SERT in human HEK293 cells, but other authors and a more recent study with an improved design have not had the same findings. In the most recent study, by Haenisch et al. (2011), the researchers suggested that the discrepant findings from the Tatsumi et al. study were due to methodological differences, in particular the use of radioligand binding in isolated membranes (KD) to study interactions as opposed to actual functional reuptake inhibition (IC50). Trimipramine is extensively metabolized, so its metabolites may contribute to its pharmacology, including potentially to monoamine reuptake inhibition. In what was the only study to date to have assessed the activity profiles of the metabolites of trimipramine, Haenisch et al. (2011) assayed desmethyltrimipramine, 2-hydroxytrimipramine, and trimipramine-N-oxide in addition to trimipramine and found that these metabolites showed IC50 values for the SERT, NET, and DAT similar to those of trimipramine (see table to the right). Like other secondary amine TCAs, desmethyltrimipramine was slightly more potent than trimipramine in its norepinephrine reuptake inhibition but less potent in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake. However, desmethyltrimipramine still showed only very weak inhibition of the NET. Therapeutic concentrations of trimipramine are between 0.5 and 1.2 μM (150–350 ng/mL) and hence significant monoamine reuptake inhibition would not be expected with it or its metabolites. However, these concentrations are nearly 2-fold higher if the active metabolites of trimipramine are also considered, and studies of other TCAs have found that they cross the blood–brain barrier and accumulate in the brain to levels of up to 10-fold those in the periphery. As such, trimipramine and its metabolites might at least partially inhibit reuptake of serotonin and/or norepinephrine, though not of dopamine, at therapeutic concentrations, and this could be hypothesized to contribute at least in part to its antidepressant effects. This is relevant as Haenisch et al. has stated that these are the only actions known at present which could explain or at least contribute to the antidepressant effects of trimipramine. That said, blockade of the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and α2-adrenergic receptors, as with mirtazapine, has also been implicated in antidepressant effects. In any case, there is also clinical and animal evidence that trimipramine does not inhibit the reuptake of monoamines. Unlike other TCAs, it does not downregulate β3-adrenergic receptors, which is likely the reason that it does not cause orthostatic hypotension. It can be safely combined with MAOIs apparently without risk of serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. Indeed, in rabbits, whereas hyperpyrexia (a symptom of serotonin syndrome) occurs with imipramine and an MAOI and to a lesser extent with amitriptyline and an MAOI, it does not occur at all with trimipramine and an MAOI, likely due to trimipramine's lack of serotonin reuptake inhibition. ==== Antihistamine activity ==== Trimipramine is a very potent antihistamine; it has the third highest affinity for the H1 receptor (Ki = 0.27 nM) after mirtazapine (Ki = 0.14 nM) and doxepin (Ki = 0.24 nM) among the TCAs and tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs). The TeCA mianserin (Ki = 0.40) and the TCA amitriptyline (Ki = 1.0) are also very potent H1 receptor antagonists, whereas other TCAs and TeCAs are less potent. These TCAs and TeCAs, including trimipramine, are far more potent than the standard antihistamine diphenhydramine (approximately 800 times for doxepin and 250 times for trimipramine), and are among the most potent antihistamines available. Trimipramine is also an antagonist of the H2 receptor with lower potency and has been found to be effective in the treatment of duodenal ulcers. ==== As a hypnotic ==== Blockade of the H1 receptor is responsible for the sedative effects of trimipramine and other TCAs and their effectiveness in the treatment of insomnia. Most antidepressants suppress REM sleep, in parallel with their alleviation of depressive symptoms (although suppression of REM sleep is not required for antidepressant effects). This includes TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline), TeCAs (e.g., mianserin, maprotiline), MAOIs (e.g., clorgiline, pargyline), and SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, zimelidine, indalpine). Trimipramine is unique in that it is an exception and produces antidepressant effects without compromising or otherwise affecting REM sleep. Even long-term treatment with trimipramine for up to 2 years has not been found to suppress REM sleep. In addition, trimipramine has been found to decrease nocturnal cortisol levels to normal and to normalize cortisol response in depressed patients; hence, it normalizes the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, whereas imipramine and other antidepressants tend to increase nocturnal cortisol secretion. In clinical studies, trimipramine has been found in doses of 50 to 200 mg/day to significantly increase sleep efficiency and total sleep time and to decrease waking time for up to 3 weeks in patients with insomnia. It also improved subjectively perceived sleep quality and well-being during daytime. Monitoring of patients upon discontinuation of trimipramine found that it did not cause rebound insomnia or worsening of sleep quality in subjective evaluations of sleep, although objective measurements found total sleep time below baseline in a subset of patients during trimipramine withdrawal. ==== Antidopaminergic activity ==== Trimipramine is a weak but significant antagonist of the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, and also binds to the D4 receptor (Ki = 275 nM). Its affinities for various monoamine receptors including the D2 and 5-HT2A receptors closely resemble those of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. In accordance, high doses of trimipramine have been found to have antipsychotic effects in schizophrenic patients, notably without causing extrapyramidal symptoms, and trimipramine has recently been found to be effective in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with delusional depression. The lack of extrapyramidal symptoms with trimipramine may be related to its affinity for the D4 receptor, these both being properties it shares with clozapine. Unlike other TCAs, but reminiscent of antipsychotics, trimipramine has been found to markedly increase plasma prolactin levels (a marker of D2 receptor antagonism) at a dose of 75 mg/day and to increase nocturnal prolactin secretion at doses of 75 and 200 mg/day. These findings are suggestive of important antidopaminergic actions of trimipramine. Unlike various other TCAs, trimipramine shows marked antagonism of presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, potentially resulting in increased dopaminergic neurotransmission. This effect has also been observed with low-potency tricyclic antipsychotics like thioridazine and chlorprothixene. Notably, these two antipsychotics have been claimed many times to also possess antidepressant effects. As such, blockade of inhibitory dopamine autoreceptors and hence facilitation of dopaminergic signaling could be involved in the antidepressant effects of trimipramine. However, other authors have attributed the claimed antidepressant effects of antipsychotics like the two previously mentioned to α2-adrenergic receptor antagonism, although trimipramine specifically has only weak affinity for this receptor. Aside from antidepressant effects, low doses of antipsychotics have been found to increase REM sleep, and so dopamine autoreceptor antagonism could be involved in the unique effects of trimipramine in terms of REM sleep and sleep architecture. === Pharmacokinetics === The time to peak concentrations following a dose is 2 to 4 hours. The typical antidepressant therapeutic range of trimipramine concentrations is 150 to 300 ng/mL. The terminal half-life of trimipramine has been variously reported to be as little as 8 hours (in plasma) and as long as 24 hours. In any case, the terminal half-life of trimipramine is described as shorter than that of other TCAs, which makes it ideal for use in the treatment of insomnia. Trimipramine is a racemic compound with two enantiomers.[1] CYP2C19 is responsible for the demethylation of (D)- and (L)-trimipramine to (D)- (L)-desmethyltrimipramine, respectively, and CYP2D6 is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation of (D)- and (L)-desmethyltrimipramine to (D)- and (L)-2-hydroxydesmethyltrimipramine, respectively. CYP2D6 also metabolizes (L)-trimipramine into (L)-2-hydroxytrimipramine. == Chemistry == Trimipramine is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, desipramine, and clomipramine. Trimipramine is a derivative of imipramine with a methyl group added to its side chain and is also known as 2'-methylimipramine or β-methylimipramine. The tri- prefix in its name may allude to the fact that its side chain features three methyl groups. Trimipramine is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desmethyltrimipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), and doxepin. The chemical name of trimipramine is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepin-5-yl)-N,N,2-trimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C20H26N2 with a molecular weight of 294.434 g/mol. The drug is used commercially as the maleate salt. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 739-71-9 and of the maleate is 521-78-8. == History == Trimipramine was developed by Rhône-Poulenc. It was patented in 1959 and first appeared in the literature in 1961. The drug was first introduced for medical use in 1966, in Europe. It was not introduced in the United States until later in 1979 or 1980. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Trimipramine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while trimipramine maleate is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Latin is trimipraminum, in German is trimipramin, and in Spanish is trimipramina. === Brand names === Trimipramine is marketed throughout the world mainly under the brand name Surmontil. Other notable brand names of trimipramine have included Herphonal, Rhotrimine, Sapilent, Stangyl, and Tydamine. === Availability === Trimipramine is no longer marketed in Australia, though it was previously. === In film === The sedative effects of Trimipramine in off-prescription, recreational use are described in the 1987 film Withnail and I where the eponymous character declares ""This is the plan. We get in there and get wrecked, then we'll eat a pork pie, then we'll drop a couple of Surmontil-50's each.

Carbapenems are highly resistant to the β-lactamase enzymes produced by many multiple drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, thus playing a key role in the treatment of infections not readily treated with other antibiotics. It is usually administered through intravenous injection. Imipenem was patented in 1975 and approved for medical use in 1985. It was developed via a lengthy trial-and-error search for a more stable version of the natural product thienamycin, which is produced by the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya. Thienamycin has antibacterial activity, but is unstable in aqueous solution, thus it is practically of no medicinal use. Imipenem has a broad spectrum of activity against aerobic and anaerobic, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is particularly important for its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus species. However, it is not active against MRSA. == Medical uses == === Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and resistance === Acinetobacter anitratus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides uniformis, and Clostridium perfringens are generally susceptible to imipenem, while Acinetobacter baumannii, some Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Enterococcus faecalis have developed resistance to imipenem to varying degrees. Not many species are resistant to imipenem except Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Oman) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. === Coadministration with cilastatin === Imipenem is rapidly degraded by the renal enzyme dehydropeptidase 1 when administered alone, and is almost always coadministered with cilastatin to prevent this inactivation. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions are nausea and vomiting. People who are allergic to penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics should take caution if taking imipenem, as cross-reactivity rates are high. At high doses, imipenem is seizurogenic. == Mechanism of action == Imipenem acts as an antimicrobial through inhibiting cell wall synthesis of various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It remains very stable in the presence of β-lactamase (both penicillinase and cephalosporinase) produced by some bacteria, and is a strong inhibitor of β-lactamases from some Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Imipenem"".

Since 1948, this antioxidant has been added to foods containing oils and fats to prevent oxidation. As a food additive, it is used under the E number E310. == Description == Propyl gallate is an antioxidant. It protects against oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and oxygen free radicals. It appears as a white to creamy-white crystalline odorless solid. Propyl gallate (PG) is a white to nearly white odorless crystalline powder that has slightly bitter taste and darkens in the presence of iron salts. It is an irritant that can cause skin dryness, dermatitis, and sensitization. Inhalation may cause chemical pneumonia == Production == Propyl gallate does not occur naturally, and is prepared either from reactions with gallic acid and 1-propanol, or by enzyme catalysis of tannic acid. Syntheses with gallic acid have been the most prominent methods of production, and include Steglich esterification with N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, anhydrous addition of thionyl chloride, and Fischer esterification with various catalysts. == Uses == Propyl gallate is used to protect oils and fats in products from oxidation; it is used in foods, cosmetics, hair products, adhesives, biodiesel, and lubricants. It is often used interchangeably with octyl gallate and dodecyl gallate in these applications. Propyl gallate is an antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can damage cells, proteins, and DNA. It is used as a triplet state quencher and an antioxidant in fluorescence microscopy. == Biological effects == A 1993 study in fat rodents found little or no effect on carcinogenesis by propyl gallate. A 2009 study found that propyl gallate acts as an estrogen antagonist. Propyl gallate has many biological activities, including: Enzyme inhibition Antimicrobial activity Inhibition of nitrosamine formation Anticarcinogenesis Antitumorigenesis Anesthesia Anti-nociceptive Inhibition of biosynthetic processes Ionizing/ultraviolet (UV) radiation protection == Safety == Propyl gallate is an irritant to the skin and eyes, and it can be inhaled. Some studies have reported that propyl gallate is toxic, while others have reported therapeutic benefits. The FDA recognizes propyl gallate as being generally safe, but in other countries, it's either been used on a very limited basis or completely banned. This is because some preliminary studies have suggested that propyl gallate may cause cancer (in several organs) in rats and be an endocrine disrupter. == References ==",N-propyl gallate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0001158211671281606), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -2.176947600673884e-05), (' PERSONAL', -0.061973292380571365), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.0007118358626030385), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.005930091254413128), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00025662468397058547), ('ĠPERSON', -0.3869549036026001), ('AL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ĠCARE', -7.867782187531702e-06), (',', -0.07891100645065308), ('ĠINDU', -0.0022389839868992567), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -3.2186455882765586e-06), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01117023266851902)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0001234428636962548), (' INDUSTR', -0.3868842124938965), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.01416350994259119), (' PERSONAL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([acs.org](https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/p/n-propyl-gallate.html?utm_source=openai), [cspinet.org](https://www.cspinet.org/article/propyl-gallate?utm_source=openai), [cosmeticsinfo.org](https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/propyl-gallate/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=314, start_index=33, title='n-Propyl gallate - American Chemical Society', type='url_citation', url='https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/p/n-propyl-gallate.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=314, start_index=33, title='Propyl gallate | Center for Science in the Public Interest', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cspinet.org/article/propyl-gallate?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=314, start_index=33, title='Propyl Gallate - Cosmetics Info', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/propyl-gallate/?utm_source=openai')])"

3895,"('Ei 275', 'Pp 1', 'Kinome_2004', 'Biomolki_000024', 'Biomolki2_000032')","Endogenous, Medical","The proton–proton chain, also commonly referred to as the p–p chain, is one of two known sets of nuclear fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium. It dominates in stars with masses less than or equal to that of the Sun, whereas the CNO cycle, the other known reaction, is suggested by theoretical models to dominate in stars with masses greater than about 1.3 solar masses. In general, proton–proton fusion can occur only if the kinetic energy (temperature) of the protons is high enough to overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion. In the Sun, deuteron-producing events are rare. Diprotons are the much more common result of proton–proton reactions within the star, and diprotons almost immediately decay back into two protons. Since the conversion of hydrogen to helium is slow, the complete conversion of the hydrogen initially in the core of the Sun is calculated to take more than ten billion years. Although sometimes called the ""proton–proton chain reaction"", it is not a chain reaction in the normal sense. In most nuclear reactions, a chain reaction designates a reaction that produces a product, such as neutrons given off during fission, that quickly induces another such reaction. The proton–proton chain is, like a decay chain, a series of reactions. The product of one reaction is the starting material of the next reaction. There are two main chains leading from hydrogen to helium in the Sun. One chain has five reactions, the other chain has six. == History of the theory == The theory that proton–proton reactions are the basic principle by which the Sun and other stars burn was advocated by Arthur Eddington in the 1920s. At the time, the temperature of the Sun was considered to be too low to overcome the Coulomb barrier. After the development of quantum mechanics, it was discovered that tunneling of the wavefunctions of the protons through the repulsive barrier allows for fusion at a lower temperature than the classical prediction. In 1939, Hans Bethe attempted to calculate the rates of various reactions in stars. Starting with two protons combining to give a deuterium nucleus and a positron he found what we now call Branch II of the proton–proton chain. But he did not consider the reaction of two 3He nuclei (Branch I) which we now know to be important. This was part of the body of work in stellar nucleosynthesis for which Bethe won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967. == The proton–proton chain == The first step in all the branches is the fusion of two protons into a deuteron. As the protons fuse, one of them undergoes beta plus decay, converting into a neutron by emitting a positron and an electron neutrino (though a small amount of deuterium nuclei is produced by the ""pep"" reaction, see below): The positron will annihilate with an electron from the environment into two gamma rays. Including this annihilation and the energy of the neutrino, the net reaction has a Q value (released energy) of 1.442 MeV: The relative amounts of energy going to the neutrino and to the other products is variable. This is the rate-limiting reaction and is extremely slow due to it being initiated by the weak nuclear force. The average proton in the core of the Sun waits 9 billion years before it successfully fuses with another proton. It has not been possible to measure the cross-section of this reaction experimentally because it is so low but it can be calculated from theory. After it is formed, the deuteron produced in the first stage can fuse with another proton to produce the stable, light isotope of helium, 3He: This process, mediated by the strong nuclear force rather than the weak force, is extremely fast by comparison to the first step. It is estimated that, under the conditions in the Sun's core, each newly created deuterium nucleus exists for only about one second before it is converted into helium-3. In the Sun, each helium-3 nucleus produced in these reactions exists for only about 400 years before it is converted into helium-4. Once the helium-3 has been produced, there are four possible paths to generate 4He. In p–p I, helium-4 is produced by fusing two helium-3 nuclei; the p–p II and p–p III branches fuse 3He with pre-existing 4He to form beryllium-7, which undergoes further reactions to produce two helium-4 nuclei. About 99% of the energy output of the sun comes from the various p–p chains, with the other 1% coming from the CNO cycle. According to one model of the sun, 83.3 percent of the 4He produced by the various p–p branches is produced via branch I while p–p II produces 16.68 percent and p–p III 0.02 percent. Since half the neutrinos produced in branches II and III are produced in the first step (synthesis of a deuteron), only about 8.35 percent of neutrinos come from the later steps (see below), and about 91.65 percent are from deuteron synthesis. However, another solar model from around the same time gives only 7.14 percent of neutrinos from the later steps and 92.86 percent from the synthesis of deuterium nuclei. The difference is apparently due to slightly different assumptions about the composition and metallicity of the sun. There is also the extremely rare p–p IV branch. Other even rarer reactions may occur. The rate of these reactions is very low due to very small cross-sections, or because the number of reacting particles is so low that any reactions that might happen are statistically insignificant. The overall reaction is: 4 1H+ + 2 e- → 4He2+ + 2 νe releasing 26.73 MeV of energy, some of which is lost to the neutrinos. === The p–p I branch === The complete chain releases a net energy of 26.732 MeV but 2.2 percent of this energy (0.59 MeV) is lost to the neutrinos that are produced. The p–p I branch is dominant at temperatures of 10 to 18 MK. Below 10 MK, the p–p chain proceeds at slow rate, resulting in a low production of 4He. === The p–p II branch === The p–p II branch is dominant at temperatures of 18 to 25 MK. Note that the energies in the second reaction above are the energies of the neutrinos that are produced by the reaction. 90 percent of the neutrinos produced in the reaction of 7Be to 7Li carry an energy of 0.861 MeV, while the remaining 10 percent carry 0.383 MeV. The difference is whether the lithium-7 produced is in the ground state or an excited (metastable) state, respectively. The total energy released going from 7Be to stable 7Li is about 0.862 MeV, almost all of which is lost to the neutrino if the decay goes directly to the stable lithium. === The p–p III branch === The last three stages of this chain, plus the positron annihilation, contribute a total of 18.209 MeV, though much of this is lost to the neutrino. The p–p III chain is dominant if the temperature exceeds 25 MK. The p–p III chain is not a major source of energy in the Sun, but it was very important in the solar neutrino problem because it generates very high energy neutrinos (up to 14.06 MeV). === The p–p IV (Hep) branch === This reaction is predicted theoretically, but it has never been observed due to its rarity (about 0.3 ppm in the Sun). In this reaction, helium-3 captures a proton directly to give helium-4, with an even higher possible neutrino energy (up to 18.8 MeV). The mass–energy relationship gives 19.795 MeV for the energy released by this reaction plus the ensuing annihilation, some of which is lost to the neutrino. === Energy release === Comparing the mass of the final helium-4 nucleus with the masses of the four protons reveals that 0.7 percent of the mass of the original protons has been lost. This mass has been converted into energy, in the form of kinetic energy of produced particles, gamma rays, and neutrinos released during each of the individual reactions. The total energy yield of one whole chain is 26.73 MeV. Energy released as gamma rays will interact with electrons and protons and heat the interior of the Sun. Also kinetic energy of fusion products (e.g. of the two protons and the 42He from the p–p I reaction) adds energy to the plasma in the Sun. This heating keeps the core of the Sun hot and prevents it from collapsing under its own weight as it would if the sun were to cool down. Neutrinos do not interact significantly with matter and therefore do not heat the interior and thereby help support the Sun against gravitational collapse. Their energy is lost: the neutrinos in the p–p I, p–p II, and p–p III chains carry away 2.0%, 4.0%, and 28.3% of the energy in those reactions, respectively. The following table calculates the amount of energy lost to neutrinos and the amount of ""solar luminosity"" coming from the three branches. ""Luminosity"" here means the amount of energy given off by the Sun as electromagnetic radiation rather than as neutrinos. The starting figures used are the ones mentioned higher in this article. The table concerns only the 99% of the power and neutrinos that come from the p–p reactions, not the 1% coming from the CNO cycle. == The PEP reaction == A deuteron can also be produced by the rare pep (proton–electron–proton) reaction (electron capture): In the Sun, the frequency ratio of the pep reaction versus the p–p reaction is 1:400. However, the neutrinos released by the pep reaction are far more energetic: while neutrinos produced in the first step of the p–p reaction range in energy up to 0.42 MeV, the pep reaction produces sharp-energy-line neutrinos of 1.44 MeV. Detection of solar neutrinos from this reaction were reported by the Borexino collaboration in 2012. Both the pep and p–p reactions can be seen as two different Feynman representations of the same basic interaction, where the electron passes to the right side of the reaction as a positron. This is represented in the figure of proton–proton and electron-capture reactions in a star, available at the NDM'06 web site. == See also == CNO cycle Triple-alpha process == References == == External links == Media related to Proton-proton chain reaction at Wikimedia Commons",Pp 1,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.001967162825167179), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001524715917184949)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://hellobio.com/pp-1.html,https://www.glpbio.com/pp-1.html,https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/pp-1-tocris/139710,https://www.tocris.com/products/pp-1_1397,https://www.apexbt.com/pp-1.html ', [])"

However, topical antiseptics are less likely to induce resistance, owing to their unspecific mode of action and the high concentrations in which they can be used. One such antiseptic, octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT), can be used either prophylactically or therapeutically on the skin, mucosa and wounds. Evidence to support its use comes from in-vitro, animal and clinical studies on its safety, tolerability and efficacy. This article summarises the physical, chemical and antimicrobial properties of OCT in the context of wound care. Octenidine dihydrochloride is an effective antiseptic compound which mode of action is based on destabilization plasma membrane of microorganisms. This ensures that microorganisms cannot develop the drug resistance in a straightforward way, as the entire cellular structure, rather than specific molecular target is affected. Since the octenidine is a hydrophobic compound, it requires organic solvent such as phenoxyethanol in order to be effectively administered. However, the presence of phenoxyethanol has strong irritating effect, particularly when applied on open wounds and mucous membranes. Phospholipids are known as neutral excipients free of side effects and in their aggregated form may serve as solvent for octenidine. In this article, we propose a new antiseptic formulation composed of equimolar ratio of lipids and octenidine. The resulting particles are ∼4 nm in diameter showing that their topology is different from that known for liposomes. The new formulation has proven to be equally effective as octenidine dihydrochloride formulation marketed under the name of Octenisept®. The main advantage of the new formulation is that it does not contain phenoxyethanol, which opens new possibilities for broader application spectrum of octenidine, including treatments of mucous membranes and open wounds. Octenidine dihydrochloride (octenidine) was introduced for skin, mucous membrane and wound antisepsis more than 20 years ago. Until now, a wealth of knowledge has been gained, including in vitro and animal studies on efficacy, tolerance, safety and clinical experience both from case reports and prospective controlled trials. Nowadays, octenidine is an established antiseptic in a large field of applications and represents an alternative to older substances such as chlorhexidine, polyvidone-iodine or triclosan.

Alternatives to traditional loop-diuretics, including vasopressin and adenosine A(1) receptor antagonists are now in development. The pathophysiologic rationale for the use of tonapofylline, an intravenous and oral adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist, in patients with heart failure and/or the cardiorenal syndrome are reviewed. A comprehensive review of published literature describing its medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and tolerability are provided. We searched the Medline/PubMed and Embase databases for the terms 'BG9928', 'tonapofylline', 'Adentri', 'adenosine', 'heart failure', 'renal failure' and 'cardiorenal syndrome' from 1 January 1992 to the present. References from pertinent manuscripts were also reviewed for additional relevant content. The reader will better appreciate the potential role of tonapofylline in patients with heart failure and/or the cardiorenal syndrome. Additionally, the reader will gain an understanding of the current state of drug development and the rationale for the need for continued research. Tonapofylline promotes natriuresis and diuresis, and may preserve glomerular filtration rate in patients with heart failure. Additionally, pilot data indicate that tonapofylline may be renoprotective in the setting of concomitant treatment with a loop-diuretic. Adverse effects were generally mild. The study was conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tonapofylline in subjects with severe renal impairment and in elderly subjects. Subjects with severe renal impairment were matched demographically with healthy subjects. Elderly subjects with normal renal function for their ages were also enrolled. All subjects (n = 8 per group) received a single intravenous administration of tonapofylline at 1 mg/kg. The pharmacokinetics of tonapofylline was not significantly different in subjects with severe renal impairment, or in elderly subjects, as compared to healthy subjects. Among all pharmacokinetic parameters, the only statistically significant difference was observed for Cmax between the healthy and the severe renal impairment groups, which was 21% and considered clinically insignificant. Pharmacodynamic assessment demonstrated the natriuretic effects of tonapofylline across groups, with little accompanying kaliuresis. No change in renal function occurred after single dose of tonapofylline, despite substantial increases in excretion of urinary sodium. Single 1 mg/kg intravenous administration of tonapofylline was generally safe. The pharmacokinetics of tonapofylline in subjects with severe renal impairment and elderly subjects with normal renal function for age is similar to that in healthy subjects. It has been demonstrated in all groups that tonapofylline has natriuretic effects and is able to maintain renal function, which can be beneficial to patients with congestive heart failure. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tonapofylline. Patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment were enrolled in parallel with demographically matched healthy subjects. All study participants received a single 75-mg oral tonapofylline capsule. The pharmacokinetic parameters for both tonapofylline and its active metabolite, acyl-glucuronide (tonapofylline-AG), were affected by hepatic impairment significantly (P < .1) except for time to peak plasma concentration (t(max)), terminal half-life (t(½)), and apparent volume of distribution based on the terminal phase (Vdz/F). In the mild group, peak plasma concentration (C(max)), area under the time-concentration curve from time 0 to 48 hours postdose (AUC(48 h)), and from time 0 to infinity (AU(Cinf)) of tonapofylline modestly increased as compared with the control healthy subjects (GMR 1.62, 1.57, and 1.53, respectively). The extent of increase of these parameters for tonapofylline-AG was more profound than tonapofylline with geometric mean ratio (GMR) ranging from 2.02 to 2.08. Moderate hepatic impairment was also associated with modest increases of C(max), AUC(48 h), and AUC(inf) of tonapofylline (GMR 1.41, 1.98, and 2.08, respectively). Similar to the mild group, the increase of these parameters were higher for tonapofylline-AG with GMR ranging from 2.80 to 3.86.

None of the currently approved angiogenesis inhibitors have been reported to inhibit EphB4, and therefore, JI-101 has a novel mechanism of action. We conducted a pilot trial to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability, and efficacy of JI-101 in combination with everolimus in advanced cancers, and pharmacodynamics (PD), tolerability, and efficacy of JI-101 in ovarian cancer. This was the first clinical study assessing anti-tumor activity of JI-101 in a combinatorial regimen. In the PK cohort, four patients received single agent 10 mg everolimus on day 1, 10 mg everolimus and 200 mg JI-101 combination on day 8, and single agent 200 mg JI-101 on day 15. In the PD cohort, eleven patients received single agent JI-101 at 200 mg twice daily for 28 day treatment cycles. JI-101 was well tolerated as a single agent and in combination with everolimus. No serious adverse events were observed. Common adverse events were hypertension, nausea, and abdominal pain. JI-101 increased exposure of everolimus by approximately 22%, suggestive of drug-drug interaction. The majority of patients had stable disease at their first set of restaging scans (two months), although no patients demonstrated a response to the drug per RECIST criteria. The novel mechanism of action of JI-101 is promising in ovarian cancer treatment and further prospective studies of this agent may be pursued in a less refractory patient population or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. JI-101, chemically 1-[1-(2-amino-pyridin-4-ylmethyl)-1H-indol-4-yl]-3-(5-bromo-2-methoxy-phenyl)-urea hydrochloride, is a novel orally active kinase inhibitor, which has shown potent in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity against a variety of cancer cell lines and xenografts. It is currently entering Phase II clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors. The aim of the study is to assess the metabolic stability of JI-101 in various pre-clinical and human liver microsomes, to identify the major CYPs (cytochrome β450) involved in the metabolism of JI-101 and identification of putative metabolites. We have also studied the pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and excretion of JI-101 in Sprague Dawley rats. JI-101 was found to be stable in various liver microsomes tested. JI-101 is highly permeable and not a substrate for P-gp (permeability glycoprotein). JI-101 excreted through bile along with its mono- and di-hydroxy metabolites. Following oral administration, JI-101 was rapidly absorbed, reaching Cmax within 2 h. The t½ of JI-101 with intravenous and oral route was found to be 1.75 ± 0.79 and 2.66 ± 0.13 h, respectively. The Cl and Vd by intravenous route for JI-101 were found to be 13.0 ± 2.62 mL/min/kg and 2.11 ± 1.42 L/kg, respectively. The tissue distribution of JI-101 was extensive with rapid and preferred uptake into lung tissue. Overall, the oral bioavailability of JI-101 is 55% and the primary route of elimination for JI-101 is feces. A general practice in bioanalysis is that, whatever the biological matrix the analyte is being quantified in, the validation is performed in the same matrix as per regulatory guidelines. In this paper, we are presenting the applicability of a validated LC-MS/MS method in rat plasma for JI-101, to estimate the concentrations of JI-101 in various tissues that were harvested in a rat tissue distribution study. A simple protein precipitation technique was used to extract JI-101 and internal standard from the tissue homogenates. The recovery of JI-101 in all the matrices was found to be >70%. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a binary gradient using mobile phase A (acetonitrile) and B (0.2% formic acid in water) at a flow rate of 0.30 mL/min on a Prodigy ODS column with a total run time of 4.0 min. The MS/MS ion transitions monitored were 466.1 → 265 for JI-101 and 180.1 → 110.1 for internal standard. The linearity range was 5.02-4017 ng/mL. The JI-101 levels were quantifiable in the various tissue samples harvested in this study. Therefore, the use of a previously validated JI-101 assay in plasma circumvented the tedious process of method development/validation in various tissue matrices.",Ji 101,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00012356207298580557), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008081507403403521), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006722808815538883)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -4.5491004129871726e-05)])","('INFO; https://www.invivochem.com/ji-101.html,https://www.glpbio.com/ji-101.html,https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/70/8_Supplement/17/562009/Abstract-17-Preclinical-and-phase-1-trial-results ', [])"

A series of alkylated bile acid analogues were designed, studied and patented by Roberto Pellicciari and colleagues at the University of Perugia, with 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid emerging as the most highly potent FXR agonist. FXR-dependent processes in liver and intestine were proposed as therapeutic targets in human diseases. Obeticholic acid is the first FXR agonist to be used in human drug studies. The FDA has flagged cases of serious liver injury associated with the use of obeticholic acid. The agency stated that Intercept Pharmaceuticals’ liver disease medication, Ocaliva (obeticholic acid), is under scrutiny for causing liver damage in patients without advanced scarring. This follows the FDA’s 2021 decision to restrict the drug’s use in patients with advanced cirrhosis. On Thursday, the FDA revealed its findings of severe liver injury in individuals treated for primary biliary cholangitis based on post-market clinical trial data. == Clinical studies == Obeticholic acid is undergoing development in phase II and III studies for specific liver and gastrointestinal conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved obeticholic acid on 27 May 2016, for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. It was approved as an orphan drug based on its reduction in the level of the biomarker alkaline phosphatase as a surrogate endpoint for clinical benefit. It is indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. Additional studies are being required to prove its clinical benefit. === Primary biliary cholangitis === Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), also known as primary biliary cirrhosis, is an auto-immune, inflammatory liver disease which produces bile duct injury, fibrosis, cholestasis and eventual cirrhosis. It is much more common in women than men and can cause jaundice, itching (pruritus) and fatigue. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy is beneficial, but the disease often progresses and may require liver transplantation. Animal studies suggested that treatment with FXR agonists should be beneficial in cholestatic diseases such as PBC. OCA at doses between 10 mg and 50 mg was shown to provide significant biochemical benefit, but pruritus was more frequent with higher doses. The results of a randomized, double-blind phase III study of OCA, 5 mg or 10 mg, compared to placebo (POISE) were presented in April 2014, and showed that the drug met the trial's primary endpoint of a significant reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker predictive of disease progression, liver transplantation or death. === Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) === Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is a common cause of abnormal liver function with histological features of fatty liver, inflammation and fibrosis. It may progress to cirrhosis and is becoming an increasing indication for liver transplantation. It is increasing in prevalence. OCA is proposed to treat NASH. A phase II trial published in 2013, showed that administration of OCA at 25 mg or 50 mg daily for six weeks reduced markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis and increased insulin sensitivity. The Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic Acid in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial, sponsored by NIDDK, was halted early in January 2014, after about half of the 283 subjects had completed the study, when a planned interim analysis showed that a) the primary endpoint had been met and b) lipid abnormalities were detected and arose safety concerns. Treatment with OCA (25 mg/day for 72 weeks) resulted in a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary histological endpoint, defined as a decrease in the NAFLD Activity Score of at least two points, with no worsening of fibrosis. 45% (50 of 110) of the treated group had this improvement compared with 21% (23 of 109) of the placebo-treated controls. However concerns about longterm safety issues such as increased cholesterol and adverse cardiovascular events may warrant the concomitant use of statins in OCA-treated patients. In 2023, a FDA panel voted against approval of obeticholic acid for NASH, citing a lack of evidence that the benefits of the drug outweighed the risks. === Portal hypertension === Animal studies suggest that OCA improves intrahepatic vascular resistance and so may be of therapeutic benefit in portal hypertension. An open label phase IIa clinical study is under way. === Bile acid diarrhea === Bile acid diarrhea (also called bile acid malabsorption) can be secondary to Crohn's disease or be a primary condition. Reduced median levels of FGF19, an ileal hormone that regulates increased hepatic bile acid synthesis, have been found in this condition. FGF19 is potently stimulated by bile acids and especially by OCA. A proof of concept study of OCA (25 mg/d) has shown clinical and biochemical benefit. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In June 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency concluded its review of the medicine Ocaliva (obeticholic acid) and recommended that the medicine's marketing authorization be revoked, because its benefits are no longer considered to outweigh its risks. Ocaliva is used to treat adults with primary biliary cholangitis, an autoimmune condition that causes gradual destruction of the bile ducts in the liver, which can lead to liver failure and increase the risk of liver cancer. == Research == A systematic review and meta-analysis of obeticholic acid, published in 2024, found that its effects on lipid parameters and its other adverse effects warrant further investigation. == References ==",Ocaliva,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.490105023549404e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019367048516869545)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-declines-full-approval-intercepts-liver-disease-drug-2024-11-12/,https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-says-intercepts-drug-can-cause-liver-injury-patients-without-scarring-2024-12-12/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obeticholic_acid ', [])"

In 2006, its manufacturer AstraZeneca announced that it would withdraw pending applications for marketing approval after reports of hepatotoxicity (liver damage) during trials, and discontinue its distribution in countries where the drug had been approved (Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Austria, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Argentina and Brazil). == Method of action == Ximelagatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, was the first member of this class that can be taken orally. It acts solely by inhibiting the actions of thrombin. It is taken orally twice daily, and rapidly absorbed by the small intestine. Ximelagatran is a prodrug, being converted in vivo to the active agent melagatran. This conversion takes place in the liver and many other tissues through hydrolysis and dehydroxylation (replacing the ethyl and hydroxyl groups with hydrogen). == Uses == Ximelagatran was expected to replace warfarin and sometimes aspirin and heparin in many therapeutic settings, including deep venous thrombosis, prevention of secondary venous thromboembolism and complications of atrial fibrillation such as stroke. The efficacy of ximelagatran for these indications had been well documented, except for non valvular atrial fibrillation. An advantage, according to early reports by its manufacturer, was that it could be taken orally without any monitoring of its anticoagulant properties. This would have set it apart from warfarin and heparin, which require monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), respectively. A disadvantage recognised early was the absence of an antidote in case acute bleeding develops, while warfarin can be antagonised by prothrombin complex concentrate and/or vitamin K and heparin by protamine sulfate. == Side effects == Ximelagatran was generally well tolerated in the trial populations, but a small proportion (5–6%) developed elevated liver enzyme levels, which prompted the FDA to reject an initial application for approval in 2004. The further development was discontinued in 2006 following reports of hepatotoxicity. Subsequent analysis of Phase 2 clinical study data using extreme value modelling showed that the elevated liver enzyme levels observed in Phase 3 clinical studies could have been predicted; if this had been known at the time, it might have affected decisions on future development of the compound. A chemically different but pharmacologically similar substance, AZD-0837, was developed by AstraZeneca for similar indications. It is a prodrug of a potent, competitive, reversible inhibitor of free and fibrin-bound thrombin called ARH0637. The development of AZD-0837 has been discontinued. Due to a limitation identified in long-term stability of the extended-release AZD-0837 drug product, a follow-up study from ASSURE on stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, was prematurely closed in 2010 after 2 years. There was also a numerically higher mortality against warfarin. In a Phase 2 trial for AF the mean serum creatinine concentration increased by about 10% from baseline in patients treated with AZD-0837, which returned to baseline after cessation of therapy. == References == == External links == ""Ximelagatran"".

3907,"('Aniracetam', 'Ro 13-5057', 'Draganon', 'Sarpul', 'Ampamet')",Medical,"Aniracetam (brand names Draganon, Sarpul, Ampamet, Memodrin, Referan), also known as N-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone, is a racetam which is sold in Europe as a prescription drug. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States as a prescription medication or dietary supplement. Despite the FDA's lack of approval, the drug is readily available over-the-counter in misbranded dietary supplements. == Medical uses == Aniracetam has been used to treat dementia following stroke and in Alzheimer's disease. Results from human clinical trials were published in 1991 (one multi-center placebo-controlled study and a follow-up) and in 2011 (one open-label study). It has undergone a larger number of experiments in rodents; in a 1982 experiment on rats and mice it was found to have a variety of psychoactive effects, improving learning and memory that was otherwise impaired experimentally. It has been identified as a nootropic drug due to these memory effects. A 2001 study reported that in mice it has modest effects similar to an anxiolytic. == Pharmacology == Aniracetam has been shown to positively modulate the AMPA receptor. When ingested orally aniracetam is quickly broken down via first pass hepatic metabolism. The primary metabolites of aniracetam are N-anisoyl-GABA, (70–80%), 2-Pyrrolidinone and p-anisic acid (20–30%). There is some preliminary research suggesting that N-anisoyl-GABA and to a lesser degree p-ansic acid may contribute to the stimulatory effects of aniracetam in rats. Further work in rats suggests that N-anisoyl-GABA may contribute more to increasing acetylcholine release than aniracetam itself. For instance, a study using the forced swim test in rats found that the two metabolites 2-pyrrolidinone and N-anisoyl-GABA alone yielded similar anti-depressant effects as aniracetam itself. The authors of the aforementioned study hypothesized that the metabolites work by increasing levels of dopamine and by stimulating the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Plasma concentrations are generally in the 5–15 μg/L range for aniracetam and 5–15 mg/L range for N-anisoyl-GABA, a pharmacologically active metabolite, during the first few hours after oral administration of the drug. These two plasma species may be measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. == Synthesis == The drug was first made in the 1970s by Hoffmann-La Roche. Synthesis can be accomplished by reacting 2-pyrrolidone with anisoyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine. Alternatively, gamma-aminobutyric acid can react with anisoyl chloride. Ring closure can be accomplished in the presence of thionyl chloride. == Legality == === Europe === Aniracetam is available by prescription in Greece (brand names Memodrin and Referan) and Italy (brand name Ampamet), where it is indicated for mental function disorders. === Australia === Aniracetam is a schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A schedule 4 substance is classified as ""Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by state or territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription."" == See also == AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator == References ==",Sarpul,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008037435472942889), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12699198722839355)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([ecplaza.net](https://www.ecplaza.net/products/aniracetam-cas-72432-10-1-ampamet-4983868?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=115, start_index=6, title='Aniracetam CAS 72432-10-1 Ampamet Ro-13-5057 Ro135057 Draganon Sarpul - Huizhihan Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ecplaza.net/products/aniracetam-cas-72432-10-1-ampamet-4983868?utm_source=openai')])"
3908,"('Gaboxadol (hydrochloride)', 'Lu 02-030 (hydrochloride)', 'Gaboxadol', 'Gaboxadolum', 'Gaboxadolum [latin]')",Medical,"Gaboxadol, also known as 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP), is a conformationally constrained derivative of the alkaloid muscimol (a constituent of Amanita muscaria) that was first synthesized in 1977 by the Danish chemist Povl Krogsgaard-Larsen. In the early 1980s, gaboxadol was the subject of a series of pilot studies that tested its efficacy as an analgesic and anxiolytic, as well as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and spasticity. It was not until 1996 that researchers attempted to harness gaboxadol's frequently reported sedative ""adverse effect"" for the treatment of insomnia, resulting in a series of clinical trials sponsored by Lundbeck and Merck. In March 2007, Merck and Lundbeck cancelled work on the drug, citing safety concerns and the failure of an effectiveness trial. The drug acts on the GABA system, but in a different way from benzodiazepines, Z-Drugs, and barbiturates. More specifically, gaboxadol acts as a direct GABAA receptor agonist. Lundbeck states that gaboxadol also increases deep sleep (stage 4). Unlike benzodiazepines, gaboxadol does not demonstrate reinforcement in mice or baboons despite activation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area. In 2015, Lundbeck sold its rights to the molecule to Ovid Therapeutics, whose plan is to develop it for fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Angelman syndrome. It is known internally in Ovid as OV101. By March 2023, development of gaboxadol for FXS and Angelman syndrome was discontinued. The drug is no longer under development for any indication. == Pharmacology == Gaboxadol acts as a GABAA receptor agonist. It is specifically a supra-maximal agonist at α4β3δ, low-potency agonist at α1β3γ2, partial agonist at α4β3γ, and antagonist at ρ1 GABAA receptors. Its affinity for extrasynaptic α4β3δ GABAA receptors is 10-fold greater than for other subtypes. Gaboxadol has a unique affinity for extrasynaptic α4β3δ GABAA receptors, which mediate tonic inhibition and are typically activated by ambient, low levels of GABA in the extrasynaptic space. Compared to muscimol, gaboxadol binds less potently to α4β3δ GABAA receptors (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 0.2 μM vs. 13 μM), but is capable of evoking a greater maximum response (EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy = 120% vs. 224%). The supra-maximial efficacy of gabaxadol at α4β3δ GABAA receptors has been attributed to an increase in the duration and frequency of channel openings relative to the endogenous agonist GABA. == Clinical studies == Gaboxadol produced effects in clinical studies including sedation, euphoria, and dissociation or perceptual changes. It showed less euphoria and misuse potential, more negative and dissociative effects, and fewer sedative effects than zolpidem at the assessed doses. According to Hamilton Morris, gaboxadol can produce powerful hallucinogenic effects at high doses. == See also == Progabide == References == == External links == 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Medical News Today article Report of cancellation of development",Gaboxadol,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00016825977945700288)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006550743710249662), ('ICAL', -3.933898824470816e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6931922435760498)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaboxadol,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06554,https://en.psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gaboxadol ', [])"
3909,"('Coumarin', 'Cumarin', 'Chromen-2-one', 'Rattex', 'Tonka bean camphor')","Food, Medical","Coumarin () or 2H-chromen-2-one is an aromatic organic chemical compound with formula C9H6O2. Its molecule can be described as a benzene molecule with two adjacent hydrogen atoms replaced by an unsaturated lactone ring −(CH)=(CH)−(C=O)−O−, forming a second six-membered heterocycle that shares two carbons with the benzene ring. It belongs to the benzopyrone chemical class and is considered a lactone. Coumarin is a colorless crystalline solid with a sweet odor resembling the scent of vanilla and a bitter taste. It is found in many plants, where it may serve as a chemical defense against predators. While coumarin is not an anticoagulant, its 3-alkyl-4-hydroxy derivatives, such as the fungal metabolite dicoumarol, inhibit synthesis of vitamin K, a key component in blood clotting. A related compound, the prescription drug anticoagulant warfarin, is used to inhibit formation of blood clots, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. == Etymology == Coumarin is derived from coumarou, the French word for the tonka bean, from the Old Tupi word for its tree, kumarú. == History == Coumarin was first isolated from tonka beans in 1820 by A. Vogel of Munich, who initially mistook it for benzoic acid. Also in 1820, Nicholas Jean Baptiste Gaston Guibourt (1790–1867) of France independently isolated coumarin, but he realized that it was not benzoic acid. In a subsequent essay he presented to the pharmacy section of the Académie Royale de Médecine, Guibourt named the new substance coumarine. In 1835, the French pharmacist A. Guillemette proved that Vogel and Guibourt had isolated the same substance. Coumarin was first synthesized in 1868 by the English chemist William Henry Perkin. Coumarin has been an integral part of the fougère genre of perfume since it was first used in Houbigant's Fougère Royale in 1882. == Synthesis == Coumarin can be prepared by a number of name reactions, with the Perkin reaction between salicylaldehyde and acetic anhydride being a popular example. The Pechmann condensation provides another route to coumarin and its derivatives starting from phenol, as does the Kostanecki acylation, which can also be used to produce chromones. == Biosynthesis == From lactonization of ortho-hydroxylated cis-hydroxycinnamic acid. == Natural occurrence == Coumarin is found naturally in many plants. Freshly ground plant parts contain higher amount of desired and undesired phytochemicals than powder. In addition, whole plant parts are harder to counterfeit; for example, one study showed that authentic Ceylon cinnamon bark contained 0.012 to 0.143 mg/g coumarin, but samples purchased at markets contained up to 3.462 mg/g, possibly because those were mixed with other cinnamon varieties. Vanilla grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) Sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum) Sweet grass (Hierochloe odorata) Sweet-clover (genus Melilotus) Meranti trees (genus Shorea) Tonka bean (Dipteryx odorata) Cinnamon; a 2013 study showed different varieties containing different levels of coumarin: Ceylon cinnamon or true cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum): 0.005 to 0.090 mg/g Chinese cinnamon or Chinese cassia (C. cassia): 0.085 to 0.310 mg/g Indonesian cinnamon or Padang cassia (C. burmannii): 2.14 to 9.30 mg/g Saigon cinnamon or Vietnamese cassia (C. loureiroi): 1.06 to 6.97 mg/g Deertongue (Carphephorus odoratissimus), Tilo (Justicia pectoralis), Mullein (genus Verbascum) Many cherry blossom tree varieties (of the genus Prunus). Related compounds are found in some but not all specimens of genus Glycyrrhiza, from which the root and flavour licorice derives. Coumarin is found naturally also in many edible plants such as strawberries, black currants, apricots, and cherries. Coumarins were found to be uncommon but occasional components of propolis by Santos-Buelga and Gonzalez-Paramas 2017. === Biological function === Coumarin has appetite-suppressing properties, which may discourage animals from eating plants that contain it. Though the compound has a pleasant sweet odor, it has a bitter taste, and animals tend to avoid it. === Metabolism === The biosynthesis of coumarin in plants is via hydroxylation, glycolysis, and cyclization of cinnamic acid. In humans, the enzyme encoded by the gene UGT1A8 has glucuronidase activity with many substrates, including coumarins. == Derivatives == Coumarin is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a precursor reagent in the synthesis of a number of synthetic anticoagulant pharmaceuticals similar to dicoumarol. 4-hydroxycoumarins are a type of vitamin K antagonist. They block the regeneration and recycling of vitamin K. These chemicals are sometimes also incorrectly referred to as ""coumadins"" rather than 4-hydroxycoumarins. Some of the 4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant class of chemicals are designed to have high potency and long residence times in the body, and these are used specifically as rodenticides (""rat poison""). Death occurs after a period of several days to two weeks, usually from internal hemorrhaging. == Uses == Coumarin is often found in artificial vanilla substitutes, despite having been banned as a food additive in numerous countries since the mid-20th century. It is still used as a legal flavorant in soaps, rubber products, and the tobacco industry, particularly for sweet pipe tobacco and certain alcoholic drinks. == Toxicity == Coumarin is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys of rodents, with a median lethal dose (LD50) of 293 mg/kg in the rat, a low toxicity compared to related compounds. Coumarin is hepatotoxic in rats, but less so in mice. Rodents metabolize it mostly to 3,4-coumarin epoxide, a toxic, unstable compound that on further differential metabolism may cause liver cancer in rats and lung tumors in mice. Humans metabolize it mainly to 7-hydroxycoumarin, a compound of lower toxicity, and no adverse affect has been directly measured in humans. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.1 mg coumarin per kg body weight, but also advises that higher intake for a short time is not dangerous. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States does not classify coumarin as a carcinogen for humans. European health agencies have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia bark, one of the four main species of cinnamon, because of its coumarin content. According to the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BFR), 1 kg of (cassia) cinnamon powder contains about 2.1 to 4.4 g of coumarin. Powdered cassia cinnamon weighs 0.56 g/cm3, so a kilogram of cassia cinnamon powder equals 362.29 teaspoons. One teaspoon of cassia cinnamon powder therefore contains 5.8 to 12.1 mg of coumarin, which may be above the tolerable daily intake value for smaller individuals. However, the BFR only cautions against high daily intake of foods containing coumarin. Its report specifically states that Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) contains ""hardly any"" coumarin. The European Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 describes the following maximum limits for coumarin: 50 mg/kg in traditional and/or seasonal bakery ware containing a reference to cinnamon in the labeling, 20 mg/kg in breakfast cereals including muesli, 15 mg/kg in fine bakery ware, with the exception of traditional and/or seasonal bakery ware containing a reference to cinnamon in the labeling, and 5 mg/kg in desserts. An investigation from the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration in 2013 shows that bakery goods characterized as fine bakery ware exceeds the European limit (15 mg/kg) in almost 50% of the cases. The paper also mentions tea as an additional important contributor to the overall coumarin intake, especially for children with a sweet habit. Coumarin was banned as a food additive in the United States in 1954, largely because of the hepatotoxicity results in rodents. Coumarin is currently listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States among ""Substances Generally Prohibited From Direct Addition or Use as Human Food,"" according to 21 CFR 189.130, but some natural additives containing coumarin, such as the flavorant sweet woodruff are allowed ""in alcoholic beverages only"" under 21 CFR 172.510. In Europe, popular examples of such beverages are Maiwein, white wine with woodruff, and Żubrówka, vodka flavoured with bison grass. Coumarin is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery, as some people may become sensitized to it, however the evidence that coumarin can cause an allergic reaction in humans is disputed. Minor neurological dysfunction was found in children exposed to the anticoagulants acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon during pregnancy. A group of 306 children were tested at ages 7–15 years to determine subtle neurological effects from anticoagulant exposure. Results showed a dose–response relationship between anticoagulant exposure and minor neurological dysfunction. Overall, a 1.9 (90%) increase in minor neurological dysfunction was observed for children exposed to these anticoagulants, which are collectively referred to as ""coumarins."" In conclusion, researchers stated, ""The results suggest that coumarins have an influence on the development of the brain which can lead to mild neurologic dysfunctions in children of school age."" Coumarin's addition to cigarette tobacco by Brown & Williamson caused executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand to contact CBS's news show 60 Minutes in 1995, charging that a ""form of rat poison"" was being used as an additive. He held that from a chemist’s point of view, coumarin is an ""immediate precursor"" to the rodenticide (and prescription drug) coumadin. Dr. Wigand later stated that coumarin itself is dangerous, pointing out that the FDA had banned its addition to human food in 1954. Under his later testimony, he would repeatedly classify coumarin as a ""lung-specific carcinogen."" In Germany, coumarin is banned as an additive in tobacco.

It is taken by mouth. It is a dual atypical glucocorticoid and antimineralocorticoid. The most common adverse reactions include cushingoid features, psychiatric disorders, vomiting, increased weight, and vitamin D deficiency. Vamorolone was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2023, and in the European Union in December 2023. == Medical uses == Vamorolone is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. === Available forms === Vamorolone is provided in the form of an oral suspension at a concentration of 40 mg/mL. == Side effects == Side effects of vamorolone in clinical trials that occurred at a rate of 10% or greater included development of cushingoid features, psychiatric disorders, vomiting, weight gain, vitamin D deficiency, and cough. The psychiatric disorders that occurred more frequently than with placebo included abnormal behavior, aggression, agitation, anxiety, irritability, altered mood, sleep disorder, and stereotypy. In addition to the preceding side effects, vamorolone shows dose-dependent suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) and hence has potential risks of adrenal suppression and adrenal insufficiency with discontinuation. Vamorolone also shows immunosuppression and is expected to increase the risk of infection, among various other potential adverse effects. Adverse events observed more frequently in the treated cohort in clinical studies included adrenal suppression, cushingoid features, psychiatric disorders, vomiting, weight gain, and vitamin D deficiency, among others. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Vamorolone is a partial agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor with relative loss of transactivation activities, but retention of transrepression activities, compared to other glucocorticoids. As a result, it is described as possessing ""dissociative"" glucocorticoid properties. In contrast to other corticosteroids, vamorolone is a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor and hence has antimineralocorticoid activity. Vamorolone has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects as well as other glucocorticoid effects but is thought to lack certain other effects typical of glucocorticoids. == Chemistry == Vamorolone is a synthetic corticosteroid and is also known by the chemical name 17α,21-dihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4,9(11)-triene-3,20-dione or as 16α-methyl-9,11-dehydroprednisolone. It is a derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and prednisolone (1,2-dehydrocortisol). Anti-inflammatory drugs of the corticosteroid class show a carbonyl (=O) or hydroxyl (-OH) group on the C11 carbon of the steroid backbone. In contrast, vamorolone contains a Δ9,11 double bond between the C9 and C11 carbons. This change in structure has been shown to remove a molecular contact site with the glucocorticoid receptor, and leads to dissociative properties. == History == In phase I clinical trials of adult volunteers, vamorolone was shown to be safe and well tolerated, with blood biomarker data suggesting possible loss of safety concerns of the corticosteroid class. In phase IIa dose-ranging clinical trial of 48 children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (2 weeks on drug, 2 weeks off drug), vamorolone was shown to be safe and well tolerated, and showed blood biomarker data consistent with a myofiber membrane stabilization and anti-inflammatory effects, and possible loss of safety concerns. These children continued on to a 24-week open-label extension study at the same doses, and this showed dose-dependent improvement of motor outcomes, with 2.0 and 6.0 mg/kg/day suggesting benefit. These same children continued on a long-term extension study with dose escalations, and this suggested continued clinical improvement through 18-months treatment. Population pharmacokinetics (PK) of vamorolone was shown to fit to a 1-compartment model with zero-order absorption, with both adult men and young boys showing dose-linearity of PK parameters for the doses examined, and no accumulation of the drug during daily dosing. Apparent clearance averaged 2.0 L/h/kg in men and 1.7 L/h/kg in boys. Overall, vamorolone exhibited well-behaved linear PK, with similar profiles in healthy men and boys with DMD, moderate variability in PK parameters, and absorption and disposition profiles similar to those of classical glucocorticoids. Exposure/response analyses have suggested that the motor outcome of time to stand from supine velocity showed the highest sensitivity to vamorolone, with the lowest AUC value providing 50% of maximum effect (E50 = 186 ng·h/mL), followed by time to climb 4 stairs (E50 = 478 ng·h/mL), time to run/walk 10 m (E50 = 1220 ng·h/mL), and 6-minute walk test (E50 = 1770 ng·h/mL). Week 2 changes of proinflammatory PD biomarkers showed exposure-dependent decreases. The E50 was 260 ng·h/mL for insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2, 1200 ng·h/mL for matrix metalloproteinase 12, 1260 ng·h/mL for lymphotoxin α1/β2, 1340 ng·h/mL for CD23, 1420 ng·h/mL for interleukin-22-binding protein, and 1600 ng·h/mL for macrophage-derived chemokine/C-C motif chemokine 22. A trial titled “Efficacy and Safety of Vamorolone Over 48 Weeks in Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy” published in March 2024 found vamorolone (Agamree) at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d showed maintenance of improvement for all motor outcomes to week 48. There was also significant improvement in linear growth after crossover in the prednisone to vamorolone 6 mg/kg/d group, and quick reversal of prednisone-induced decline in bone turnover biomarkers in each crossover group. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vamorolone based on evidence from a single clinical trial of 121 boys with DMD who were 4 to <7 years of age. The trial (Study 1) was conducted at 33 sites in 11 countries in Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Spain, the United Kingdom, Greece, Israel, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. In addition to Study 1, safety was also evaluated in a separate, open-label study of children with DMD aged 2 to <4 years (N=16) and children with DMD aged 7 to <18 years (N=16). == Society and culture == === Legal status === Santhera Pharmaceuticals signed an agreement with Catalyst Pharmaceuticals for the North American commercialization of vamorolone in July 2023. In October 2023, the FDA approved vamorolone (Agamree; Catalyst Pharmaceuticals) for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In October 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Agamree, intended for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The applicant for this medicinal product is Santhera Pharmaceuticals (Deutschland) GmbH. Vamorolone was approved for medical use in the European Union in December 2023. === Brand names === Vamorolone is the international nonproprietary name. Vamorolone is sold under the brand name Agamree. Agamree (vamorolone) is a dissociative steroid that selectively binds to the glucocorticoid receptor to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Vamorolone also inhibits mineralocorticoid receptor activation by aldosterone. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT03439670 for ""A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Vamorolone in Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Vamorolone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.649054244509898e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002079985715681687)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vamorolone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Vamorolone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vamorolone?utm_source=openai')])"

This phase Ib study investigated retifanlimab, INCB001158, and their combination in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients received retifanlimab (500 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W] i.v.) or escalating doses of INCB001158 (75 or 100 mg twice daily [BID]) monotherapy in Part 1 and combination of retifanlimab (500 mg Q4W) and INCB001158 (100 mg BID) in Part 2. Primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and determination of recommended phase II doses in Japanese patients. Eighteen patients (retifanlimab or INCB001158 monotherapy and combination; n = 6 each) were enrolled at 2 sites in Japan. There were no DLTs, fatal adverse events (AEs), or discontinuations due to AEs. Rash (all grade 1) was the most common treatment-emergent AE with retifanlimab (n = 6). Treatment-related AEs were reported with retifanlimab (n = 4) or INCB001158 (n = 2) monotherapy and with combination (n = 4); an immune-related AE (thyroid disorder, grade 2) was reported with combination. Two responses were observed with retifanlimab monotherapy (1 complete, 1 partial) and 1 stable disease (SD), for an overall response rate of 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3-77.7) and disease control rate (DCR) of 50% (95% CI, 11.8-88.2). Three patients had SD with INCB001158 monotherapy (DCR 50%; 95% CI, 11.8-88.2). No responses or SD were observed with combination therapy. Retifanlimab, INCB001158, and their combination had acceptable safety profiles. Promising retifanlimab antitumor activity warrants further investigation in Japanese patients. The arginase inhibitor INCB001158 was evaluated for safety (primary endpoint) in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours; pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy were also assessed. In this non-randomised, open-label, three-part phase 1 study, INCB001158 was orally administered two times per day as monotherapy or in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. Dose expansion was conducted in tumour-type cohorts (with or without prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (programmed death protein 1/programmed death ligand 1) therapy). A total of 107 patients received INCB001158 50-150 mg two times per day as monotherapy, and 153 patients, including 6 with moderate renal impairment, received INCB001158 50-100 mg two times per day combined with pembrolizumab. INCB001158 exposure was similar between groups (median, 56 days (monotherapy); 84 days (combination)). 49 patients (45.8%) on monotherapy and 76 (51.7%) on combination therapy experienced grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). The most common INCB001158-related AEs were fatigue (n=10/107 (9.3%)) and nausea (n=10/107 (9.3%)) with monotherapy and diarrhoea (n=24/147 (16.3%)) and fatigue (n=22/147 (15.0%)) with combination therapy. The highest response rate was seen in the anti-PD-1/PD-L1-naive combination therapy group with head/neck squamous cell carcinoma (overall response rate, 19.2%; 4/26 partial responses, 1/26 complete response). Consistent with arginase inhibition activity, plasma arginine dose-dependently increased. Arginase 1 expression in the tumour microenvironment did not correlate with response. INCB001158 was generally well tolerated. Response rates did not exceed background for given tumour types despite demonstrable pharmacodynamic activity. Overall, the limited antitumour activity of arginase inhibition observed suggests that the role of arginine depletion in cancer is multifaceted.

3916,"('Sulfadimethoxine', 'Sulphadimethoxine', 'Sulfadimethoxin', 'Sulfadimethoxydiazine', 'Sulfadimetoxin')",Medical,"Sulfadimethoxine (or sulphadimethoxine, trade names Di-Methox or Albon) is a long-lasting sulfonamide antimicrobial medication used in veterinary medicine. It is used to treat many infections, including respiratory, urinary tract, enteric, and soft tissue infections and can be given as a standalone or combined with ormetoprim to broaden the target range. Like all sulfamides, sulfadimethoxine inhibits bacterial synthesis of folic acid by acting as a competitive inhibitor against PABA. It is the most common drug prescribed to dogs who have coccidiosis. == Mechanism == Like other sulfonamides, sulfadimethoxine is a dihydropteroate synthase inhibitor. Bacteria and some protozoa are unable to obtain folic acid from the environment, and must instead synthesize it by converting PABA (para-aminobenzoate) to dihydropteroate using the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. Sulfonamides act as a competitive inhibitor; being structurally similar to PABA, they are able to bind to the enzyme's active site and prevent the synthesis of folic acid from progressing. Folic acid is necessary for these organisms to produce nucleic acids (i.e. DNA and RNA), which are required for cell division. Thus, it has a microbiostatic effect rather than a microbiocidal one (it prevents pathogen growth rather than killing them), and has the strongest effect in the beginning stages of an infection, when the pathogen is rapidly dividing. Since it is microbiostatic, sulfadimethoxine still requires the animal to still be able to mount an immune response to kill the pathogen. === With ormetoprim === Sulfadimethoxine can either be given alone (such as under the commercial name Albon) or in combination with ormetoprim to as a ""potentiated sulfonamide"" to increase antimicrobial activity. Ormetoprim is a diaminopyridine, inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, which is further along the pathway for synthesizing folic acid. Though the optimum ratio of sulfadimethoxine to ormetoprim has been found to be 20:1, it is sold pharmaceutically as a 5:1 mixture. == Pharmacokinetics == Sulfadimethoxine, like all sulfonamides, diffuses easily when it is in its unionized, lipid-soluble form, and easily reaches many tissues. The relative amounts are determined by both its pKa and by the pH of each tissue. Therefore, levels tend to be higher in less acidic tissue and body fluids or in diseased tissues having high concentrations of leucocytes. Its ability to bind to plasma proteins is very high, leading sulfadimethoxine to maintain higher blood levels than most other long-acting sulfonamides. Comparatively low doses can give rapid and sustained therapeutic blood levels. Most animals for which sulfadimethoxine is marketed acetylate sulfadimethoxine in the liver to form acetylsulfadimethoxine, which is secreted in the bile. Dogs are the exception; since they are unable to acetylate sulfonamides, they excrete sulfadimethoxine mostly unchanged in the urine. Their inability to transform sulfadimethoxine also makes dogs more susceptible to negative side effects. Sulfadimethoxine has a relatively high solubility at the pH normally occurring in the kidneys, and is easily reabsorbed into the renal tubules, adding to its long half-life. The use of sulfadimethoxine raises concerns that it will precipitate in the kidneys, leading to crystalluria. Though crystallization is not actually a common occurrence in veterinary medicine, it can be avoided entirely by adding a diaminopyrimidine such as ormetoprim. Having the animal stay well-hydrated also is advised. == Use & Dosage == Sulfadimethoxine is the only FDA-approved drug for treating intestinal coccidioisis in cats and dogs. It is also used for: Treating skin and soft-tissue infections in dogs caused by Staphylococcus aureus or E. coli Treating cattle for bovine respiratory disease complex (""shipping fever complex""), necrotic pododermatitis (foot rot), pneumonia when caused by Pasteurella, and calf diphtheria caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum When combined with ormetoprim: Treating soft tissue infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and intestinal coccidia infections in dogs Prevention of fowl cholera and coccidioisis by Eimeria in poultry Treating salmon and trout for furunculosis It is also one of the only sulfonamides allowed for treating lactating dairy cattle (the others being sulfabromethazine and sulfathoxypyridazine). The proper dosage of sulfadimethoxine depends on the animal species, the medical condition being treated, and the specific formulation of the medication. Using a tool like Sulfadimethoxine dosage calculator is important to determine the right dosage based on the animal's weight and species. == Notes == This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine (ALBON sulfadimethoxine suspension), which is in the public domain.",Sulfadimethoxine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.009236755780875683), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.2841305434703827), ('ICAL', -1.07287787614041e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20144520699977875)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3917,"('Phenoxodiol', 'Idronoxil', 'Dehydroequol', 'Haginin e', 'Idronoxil;dehydroequol;haginin e')",Medical," Phenoxodiol is a synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring plant isoflavone genistein. The observation that an inverse relationship exists between dietary intake of isoflavones and cancer incidence has led to the evaluation of these compounds in cancer therapy. This article reviews the mechanisms of action of phenoxodiol and the completed and ongoing clinical studies evaluating this drug. By altering the chemical structure of genistein, the new compound phenoxodiol showed increased anticancer activity without any increase in toxicity. In addition to its direct cytotoxic activity against different cancers, phenoxodiol sensitizes chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells to platinum and taxane drugs, as well as gemcitabine and topotecan. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted 'fast track' status to the development of phenoxodiol as chemosensitizer for platinum and taxane drugs used in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. Flavonoids, in particular the isoflavones, are naturally occurring compounds found in soy and textured vegetables that have antiproliferative effects on a variety of cancer types. Phenoxodiol is a derivative of the isoflavone genisten that is 5-20 times more potent than genisten. Triphendiol is a derivative of phenoxodiol that has superior anticancer activity against pancreatic and bile duct cancers. This review will focus on the mechanisms of action and activity of two isoflavone derivatives, phenoxodiol and triphendiol, in various tumor types, especially pancreaticobiliary cancers. Triphendiol induces apoptosis in pancreatic cell lines by both caspase-mediated and caspase-independent mechanisms. The addition of triphendiol to gemcitabine is synergistic in in vitro and in vivo models of pancreatic cancer and represents a novel combination of drugs for pancreatic cancer patients. Phenoxodiol, an isoflavene anti-tumor agent, was conjugated on the polysaccharide dextran using immobilized laccase as biocatalyst. The success of the enzymatic conjugation was determined by UV-vis spectrophotometry and its functionalization degree was assessed by ",Phenoxodiol,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010998018842656165), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.005712967365980148), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.16025874018669128), ('ĠINDU', -0.2740500867366791), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', 0.0), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011167285963892937)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16507219/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19364253/?utm_source=openai), [medicine.yale.edu](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/experimental-drug-used-to-treat-recurrent-ovarian-cancer-shows-promising-results/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=346, start_index=9, title='Phenoxodiol: isoflavone analog with antineoplastic activity', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16507219/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=346, start_index=9, title='Phenoxodiol: pharmacology and clinical experience in cancer monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19364253/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=346, start_index=9, title='Experimental Drug Used to Treat Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Shows Promising Results < Yale School of Medicine', type='url_citation', url='https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/experimental-drug-used-to-treat-recurrent-ovarian-cancer-shows-promising-results/?utm_source=openai')])"
3918,"('Dimenhydrinate', 'Diphenhydramine', 'Benadryl', 'Benzhydramine', 'Alledryl')",Medical,"Diphenhydramine, sold under the brand name Benadryl among others, is an antihistamine and sedative. It is a first-generation H1-antihistamine and it works by blocking certain effects of histamine, which produces its antihistamine and sedative effects. Diphenhydramine is also a potent anticholinergic. It is mainly used to treat allergies, insomnia, and symptoms of the common cold. It is also less commonly used for tremors in parkinsonism, and nausea. It is taken by mouth, injected into a vein, injected into a muscle, or applied to the skin. Maximal effect is typically around two hours after a dose, and effects can last for up to seven hours. Common side effects include sleepiness, poor coordination, and upset stomach. There is no clear risk of harm when used during pregnancy; however, use during breastfeeding is not recommended. It was developed by George Rieveschl and put into commercial use in 1946. It is available as a generic medication, In 2022, it was the 258th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. Its sedative and deliriant effects have led to some cases of recreational use. == Medical uses == Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine used to treat several conditions including allergic symptoms and itchiness, the common cold, insomnia, motion sickness, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Diphenhydramine also has local anesthetic properties, and has been used as such in people allergic to common local anesthetics such as lidocaine. === Allergies === Diphenhydramine is effective in the treatment of allergies. As of 2007, it was the most commonly used antihistamine for acute allergic reactions in the emergency department. By injection, it is often used in addition to epinephrine for anaphylaxis, although as of 2007 its use for this purpose had not been properly studied. Its use is only recommended once acute symptoms have improved. Topical formulations of diphenhydramine are available, including creams, lotions, gels, sprays, and eye drops. These are used to relieve itching and have the advantage of causing fewer systemic effects (e.g., drowsiness) than oral forms. === Movement disorders === Diphenhydramine is used to treat akathisia and parkinsonism caused by antipsychotics. It is also used to treat acute dystonia including torticollis and oculogyric crisis caused by typical antipsychotics. === Sleep === Because of its sedative properties, diphenhydramine is widely used in nonprescription sleep aids for insomnia. The drug is an ingredient in several products sold as sleep aids, either alone or in combination with other ingredients such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) in Tylenol PM and ibuprofen in Advil PM. Diphenhydramine can cause minor psychological dependence. Diphenhydramine has also been used as an anxiolytic. Diphenhydramine has also been used off-prescription by parents in an attempt to make their children sleep and to sedate them on long-distance flights. This has been met with criticism, both by doctors and by members of the airline industry, because sedating passengers may put them at risk if they cannot react efficiently to emergencies, and because the drug's side effects, especially the chance of a paradoxical reaction, may make some users hyperactive. Addressing such use, the Seattle Children's Hospital argued, in a 2009 article, ""Using a medication for your convenience is never an indication for medication in a child."" The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of diphenhydramine in the treatment of insomnia, because of poor effectiveness and low quality of evidence. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of diphenhydramine for insomnia. === Nausea === Diphenhydramine also has antiemetic properties, which make it useful in treating the nausea that occurs in vertigo and motion sickness. However, when taken above recommended doses, it can cause nausea (especially above 200 mg). === Special populations === Diphenhydramine is secreted in breast milk. It is expected that low doses of diphenhydramine taken occasionally will cause no adverse effects in breastfed infants. Large doses and long-term use may affect the baby or reduce breast milk supply, especially when combined with sympathomimetic drugs, such as pseudoephedrine, or before the establishment of lactation. A single bedtime dose after the last feeding of the day may minimize the harmful effects of the medication on the baby and the milk supply. Still, non-sedating antihistamines are preferred. Paradoxical reactions to diphenhydramine have been documented, particularly in children, and it may cause excitation instead of sedation. Topical diphenhydramine is sometimes used especially for people in hospice. This use is without indication and topical diphenhydramine should not be used as treatment for nausea because research has not shown that this therapy is more effective than others. === Anxiety === Diphenhydramine (as Benadryl) is not typically used to treat anxiety because its long-term use may cause adverse effects, such as memory loss, especially in the elderly. Benadryl is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating anxiety. On the other hand, hydroxyzine, a first generation antihistamine that lacks significant anticholinergic effects may be used to treat anxiety, although benzodiazepines and antidepressants are considered more effective by most clinicians. The mild anxiolytic effects of hydroxyzine are mostly due to its weak but significant activity as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, a common target of most antidepressant drugs (as well as certain other antihistamines like cyproheptadine and promethazine). Diphenhydramine is not known to bind to the 5-HT2A receptor, though it is a weak antagonist of the related 5-HT2C receptor, which is another target of antidepressant drugs and has a significant role in mood and anxiety. == Adverse effects == The most prominent side effects are dizziness and sleepiness. Diphenhydramine is a potent anticholinergic agent and potential deliriant in higher doses. This activity is responsible for the side effects of dry mouth and throat, increased heart rate, pupil dilation, urinary retention, constipation, and, at high doses, hallucinations or delirium. Other side effects include motor impairment (ataxia), flushed skin, blurred vision at nearpoint owing to lack of accommodation (cycloplegia), abnormal sensitivity to bright light (photophobia), sedation, difficulty concentrating, short-term memory loss, visual disturbances, irregular breathing, dizziness, irritability, itchy skin, confusion, increased body temperature (in general, in the hands and/or feet), temporary erectile dysfunction, and excitability, and although it can be used to treat nausea, higher doses may cause vomiting. Diphenhydramine in overdose may occasionally result in QT prolongation. Some individuals experience an allergic reaction to diphenhydramine in the form of hives. Conditions such as restlessness or akathisia can worsen from increased levels of diphenhydramine, especially with recreational dosages. Normal doses of diphenhydramine, like other first generation antihistamines, can also make symptoms of restless legs syndrome worse. As diphenhydramine is extensively metabolized by the liver, caution should be exercised when giving the drug to individuals with hepatic impairment. Anticholinergic use later in life is associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia among older people. Drowsiness, memory loss, confusion, dry mouth or constipation may also occur in elderly people. == Contraindications == Diphenhydramine is contraindicated in premature infants and neonates, as well as people who are breastfeeding. It is a pregnancy Category B drug. Diphenhydramine has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effect of antihistamines. == Overdose == Diphenhydramine is one of the most commonly misused over-the-counter drugs in the United States. Overdose symptoms may include Acute poisoning can be fatal, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death in 2–18 hours, and in general, is treated using a symptomatic and supportive approach. Diagnosis of toxicity is based on history and clinical presentation, and in general precise plasma levels do not appear to provide useful relevant clinical information. Several levels of evidence strongly indicate diphenhydramine (similar to chlorpheniramine) can block the delayed rectifier potassium channel and, as a consequence, prolong the QT interval, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known, but the anticholinergic syndrome has been treated with physostigmine for severe delirium or tachycardia. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the likelihood of psychosis, agitation, and seizures in people who are prone to these symptoms. == Interactions == Alcohol may increase the drowsiness caused by diphenhydramine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Diphenhydramine, while traditionally known as an antagonist, acts primarily as an inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. It is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistaminergic agents. By reversing the effects of histamine on the capillaries, it can reduce the intensity of allergic symptoms. It also crosses the blood–brain barrier and inversely agonizes the H1 receptors centrally. Its effects on central H1 receptors cause drowsiness. Diphenhydramine is a potent antimuscarinic (a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) and, as such, at high doses can cause anticholinergic syndrome. The utility of diphenhydramine as an antiparkinson agent is the result of its blocking properties on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. Diphenhydramine also acts as an intracellular sodium channel blocker, which is responsible for its actions as a local anesthetic. Diphenhydramine has also been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. It has been shown to be a potentiator of analgesia induced by morphine, but not by endogenous opioids, in rats. The drug has also been found to act as an inhibitor of histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT). === Pharmacokinetics === Oral bioavailability of diphenhydramine is in the range of 40% to 60%, and peak plasma concentration occurs about 2 to 3 hours after administration. Diphenhydramine, available in various salt forms, such as citrate, hydrochloride, and salicylate, exhibits distinct molecular weights and pharmacokinetic properties. Specifically, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and diphenhydramine citrate possess molecular weights of 291.8 g/mol and 447.5 g/mol, respectively. These variations in molecular weight influence the dissolution rates and absorption characteristics of each salt form. The primary route of metabolism is two successive demethylations of the tertiary amine. The resulting primary amine is further oxidized to the carboxylic acid. Diphenhydramine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The elimination half-life of diphenhydramine has not been fully elucidated, but appears to range between 2.4 and 9.3 hours in healthy adults. A 1985 review of antihistamine pharmacokinetics found that the elimination half-life of diphenhydramine ranged between 3.4 and 9.3 hours across five studies, with a median elimination half-life of 4.3 hours. A subsequent 1990 study found that the elimination half-life of diphenhydramine was 5.4 hours in children, 9.2 hours in young adults, and 13.5 hours in the elderly. A 1998 study found a half-life of 4.1 ± 0.3 hours in young men, 7.4 ± 3.0 hours in elderly men, 4.4 ± 0.3 hours in young women, and 4.9 ± 0.6 hours in elderly women. In a 2018 study in children and adolescents, the half-life of diphenhydramine was 8 to 9 hours. == Chemistry == === Detection in body fluids === Diphenhydramine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can be used with electron ionization on full scan mode as a screening test. GC-MS or GC-NDP can be used for quantification. Rapid urine drug screens using immunoassays based on the principle of competitive binding may show false-positive methadone results for people having ingested diphenhydramine. Quantification can be used to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in people who are hospitalized, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or assist in a death investigation. == History == In 1943, diphenhydramine was discovered by chemist George Rieveschl and one of his students, Fred Huber, while they were conducting research into muscle relaxants at the University of Cincinnati. Huber first synthesized diphenhydramine. Rieveschl then worked with Parke-Davis to test the compound, and the company licensed the patent from him. In 1946, it became the first prescription antihistamine approved by the US FDA. In the 1960s, diphenhydramine was found to weakly inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This discovery led to a search for viable antidepressants with similar structures and fewer side effects, culminating in the invention of fluoxetine (Prozac), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). A similar search had previously led to the synthesis of the first SSRI, zimelidine, from brompheniramine, also an antihistamine. In 1975, diphenhydramine was still available only by prescription in the US and required medical supervision. == Society and culture == === Marketing === Diphenhydramine is sold under the brand name Benadryl by McNeil Consumer Healthcare in the US, UK, Canada, and South Africa. Trade names in other countries include Dimedrol, Daedalon, Nytol, and Vivinox. It is also available as a generic medication. Procter & Gamble markets an over-the-counter formulation of diphenhydramine as a sleep aid under the brand ZzzQuil. Prestige Brands markets an over-the-counter formulation of diphenhydramine as a sleep aid in the US under the name Sominex. === Cultural impact === Diphenhydramine is deemed to have limited abuse potential in the United States owing to its potentially serious side-effect profile and limited euphoric effects and is not a controlled substance. Since 2002, the US FDA has required special labeling warning against the use of multiple products that contain diphenhydramine. In some jurisdictions, diphenhydramine is often present in postmortem specimens collected during investigation of sudden infant deaths; the drug may play a role in these events. Diphenhydramine is among prohibited and controlled substances in the Republic of Zambia, and travelers are advised not to bring the drug into the country. Several Americans have been detained by the Zambian Drug Enforcement Commission for possession of Benadryl and other over-the-counter medications containing diphenhydramine. ==== Recreational use ==== Although diphenhydramine is widely used and generally considered to be safe for occasional usage, multiple cases of abuse and addiction have been documented. Because the drug is cheap and sold over the counter in most countries, adolescents without access to more sought-after illicit drugs are particularly at risk. People with mental health problems—especially those with schizophrenia—are also prone to abuse the drug, which is self-administered in large doses to treat extrapyramidal symptoms caused by the use of antipsychotics. Recreational users report calming effects, mild euphoria, and hallucinations as the desired effects of the drug. Research has shown that antimuscarinic agents, including diphenhydramine, ""may have antidepressant and mood-elevating properties"". A study conducted on adult males with a history of sedative abuse found that subjects who were administered a high dose (400 mg) of diphenhydramine reported a desire to take the drug again, despite also reporting negative effects, such as difficulty concentrating, confusion, tremors, and blurred vision. In 2020, an Internet challenge emerged on the social media platform TikTok involving deliberately overdosing on diphenhydramine; dubbed the Benadryl challenge, the challenge encourages participants to consume dangerous amounts of Benadryl to film the resultant psychoactive effects and has been implicated in several hospitalisations and at least two deaths. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Media related to Diphenhydramine at Wikimedia Commons",Alledryl,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.895480277715251e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0037716934457421303), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023286210373044014)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -4.5491004129871726e-05)])","('MEDICAL; ([medicamentosplm.com](https://www.medicamentosplm.com/chile/Home/productos/alledryl_tabletas/2620/101/50806/210?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=141, start_index=9, title='ALLEDRYL - PLM', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicamentosplm.com/chile/Home/productos/alledryl_tabletas/2620/101/50806/210?utm_source=openai')])"

3920,"('Erlotinib hydrochloride', 'Erlotinib hcl', 'Tarceva', 'N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-amine hydrochloride', 'Erlotinib (hydrochloride)')",Medical,"Erlotinib, sold under the brand name Tarceva among others, is a medication used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. Specifically it is used for NSCLC with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) — either an exon 19 deletion (del19) or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation — which has spread to other parts of the body. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain, and cough. Serious side effects may include lung problems, kidney problems, liver failure, gastrointestinal perforation, stroke, and corneal ulceration. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which acts on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Erlotinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Lung cancer === Erlotinib in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer when added to chemotherapy improves overall survival by 19%, and improved progression-free survival (PFS) by 29%, when compared to chemotherapy alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erlotinib for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that has failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In lung cancer, erlotinib has been shown to be effective in patients with or without EGFR mutations, but appears to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations. Overall survival, progression-free survival and one-year survival are similar to standard second-line therapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed). Overall response rate is about 50% better than standard second-line chemotherapy. Patients who are non-smokers, and light former smokers, with adenocarcinoma or subtypes like BAC are more likely to have EGFR mutations, but mutations can occur in all types of patients. A test for the EGFR mutation has been developed by Genzyme. === Pancreatic cancer === In November 2005, the FDA approved erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine for treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. === Resistance to treatment === As with other ATP competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib in CML, patients rapidly develop resistance. In the case of erlotinib this typically occurs 8–12 months from the start of treatment. Over 50% of resistance is caused by a mutation in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR kinase domain involving substitution of a small polar threonine residue with a large nonpolar methionine residue (T790M). Approximately 20% of drug resistance is caused by amplification of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, which drives ERBB3 dependent activation of PI3K. == Side effects == === Common === Rash occurs in the majority of patients. This resembles acne and primarily involves the face and neck. It is self-limited and resolves in the majority of cases, even with continued use. Some clinical studies have indicated a correlation between the severity of the skin reactions and increased survival though this has not been quantitatively assessed. The Journal of Clinical Oncology reported in 2004 that ""cutaneous [skin] rash seems to be a surrogate marker of clinical benefit, but this finding should be confirmed in ongoing and future studies."" The newsletter Lung Cancer Frontiers reported in its October 2003 issue, ""Patients with moderate to severe cutaneous reactions [rashes] have a far better survival, than those with only mild reactions and much better than those with no cutaneous manifestations of drug effects."" Diarrhea Loss of appetite Fatigue Partial hair loss (by strands, not typically in clumps) === Rare === interstitial pneumonitis, which is characterized by cough and increased dyspnea. This may be severe and must be considered among those patients whose breathing acutely worsens. ingrown hairs, such as eyelashes gastrointestinal tract toxicity serious or fatal gastrointestinal tract perforations skin toxicity bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin conditions (some fatal) Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ocular disorders corneal lesions Pulmonary toxicity interstitial pneumonitis bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) pulmonary fibrosis fatal asymmetric interstitial lung disease == Interactions == Erlotinib is not a substrate for either of hepatic OATPs (OATP1B1 or OATP1B3). Also, erlotinib is not an inhibitor of OATP-1B1 or OATP-1B3 transporter. Erlotinib is mainly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Compounds which induce this enzyme (i.e. stimulate its production), such as St John's wort, can lower erlotinib concentrations, while inhibitors can increase concentrations. == Mechanism == Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFR inhibitor). The drug follows Iressa (gefitinib), which was the first drug of this type. Erlotinib specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various forms of cancer. It binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. For the signal to be transmitted, two EGFR molecules need to come together to form a homodimer. These then use the molecule of ATP to trans-phosphorylate each other on tyrosine residues, which generates phosphotyrosine residues, recruiting the phosphotyrosine-binding proteins to EGFR to assemble protein complexes that transduce signal cascades to the nucleus or activate other cellular biochemical processes. When erlotinib binds to EGFR, formation of phosphotyrosine residues in EGFR is not possible and the signal cascades are not initiated. == Society and culture == It is marketed in the United States by Genentech and OSI Pharmaceuticals and elsewhere by Roche. The drug's U.S. patent expired in 2020. In May 2012, the US District Court of Delaware passed an order in favor of OSI Pharmaceutical LLC against Mylan Pharmaceuticals upholding the validity of the patent for Erlotinib. In India, generic pharmaceutical firm Cipla is battling with Roche against the Indian patent for this drug. == References == == External links == ""Erlotinib"".

3921,"('Diazepam', 'Valium', 'Ansiolisina', 'Diazemuls', 'Apaurin')",Medical,"Diazepam, sold under the brand name Valium among others, is a medicine of the benzodiazepine family that acts as an anxiolytic. It is used to treat a range of conditions, including anxiety, seizures, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome. It may also be used to cause memory loss during certain medical procedures. It can be taken orally (by mouth), as a suppository inserted into the rectum, intramuscularly (injected into muscle), intravenously (injection into a vein) or used as a nasal spray. When injected intravenously, effects begin in one to five minutes and last up to an hour. When taken by mouth, effects begin after 15 to 60 minutes. Common side effects include sleepiness and trouble with coordination. Serious side effects are rare. They include increased risk of suicide, decreased breathing, and a paradoxical increased risk of seizures if used too frequently in those with epilepsy. Occasionally, excitement or agitation may occur. Long-term use can result in tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms on dose reduction. Abrupt stopping after long-term use can be potentially dangerous. After stopping, cognitive problems may persist for six months or longer. It is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Its mechanism of action works by increasing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Diazepam was patented in 1959 by Hoffmann-La Roche. It has been one of the most frequently prescribed medications in the world since its launch in 1963. In the United States it was the best-selling medication between 1968 and 1982, selling more than 2 billion tablets in 1978 alone. In 2022, it was the 169th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. In 1985, the patent ended, and there are more than 500 brands available on the market. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Structure, physical and chemical properties == Diazepam does not possess any chiral centers in its structure, but it does have two conformers. The two conformers mentioned were the 'P'-conformer and 'M'-conformer. Diazepam is an equimolar mixture and it was shown through CD spectra in serum protein solutions, that the 'P'-conformer is preferred by α1-acid glycoprotein binding. The drug diazepam occurs as a pale yellow-white crystalline powder without a distinctive smell and has a low molecular weight (MW = 284.74 g/mol). This classic aryl 1,4-benzodiazepine possesses three acceptors and no hydrogen bond donors. Diazepam is moderately lipophilic with LogP (Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient) value of 2,82 and hydrophilic with a TPSA (Topological Polar Surface Area) value of 32.7 Å². The LogP value indicates that diazepam tends to dissolve more readily in lipid-based environments, such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol and ether, compared to water. The TPSA value implies that a segment of the molecule exhibits a degree of polarity or hydrophilicity and represents the collective surface area of polar atoms, like oxygen or nitrogen, along with their connected hydrogen atoms. A TPSA value of 32,7 Å² signifies a moderate level of polarity within the compound. TPSA is especially useful in medical chemistry as it shows the ability of a molecule to permeate cells. Molecules with PSA value smaller than 60-70 Å² have a better ability to permeate cells. The balance between its lipophilic and hydrophilic characteristics can impact various aspects of the molecule’s behavior, including its solubility, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and potential interactions within the biological system. Diazepam is overall a stable molecule. The British Pharmacopoeia lists it as being very slightly soluble in water, soluble in alcohol, and freely soluble in chloroform. The United States Pharmacopoeia lists diazepam as soluble 1 in 16 ethyl alcohol, 1 in 2 of chloroform, 1 in 39 ether, and practically insoluble in water. The pH of diazepam is neutral (i.e., pH = 7). Diazepam has a shelf life of five years for oral tablets and three years for IV/IM solutions. Diazepam is stored at room temperature (15–30 °C). The solution for parenteral injection is kept so that it is protected from light and kept from freezing. The oral forms are stored in air-tight containers and protected from light. Diazepam can be absorbed into plastics, so liquid preparations are not kept in plastic bottles or syringes, etc. As such, it can leach into the plastic bags and tubing used for intravenous infusions. Absorption appears to depend on several factors, such as temperature, concentration, flow rates, and tube length. Diazepam should not be administered if a precipitate has formed and does not dissolve. == Medical uses == Diazepam is mainly used to treat anxiety, insomnia, panic attacks, and symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal. It is also used as a premedication for inducing sedation, anxiolysis, or amnesia before certain medical procedures (e.g., endoscopy). In 2020, it was approved for use in the United States as a nasal spray to interrupt seizure activity in people with epilepsy. Diazepam is the most commonly used benzodiazepine for ""tapering"" benzodiazepine dependence due to the drug's comparatively long half-life, allowing for more efficient dose reduction. Benzodiazepines have a relatively low toxicity in overdose. Diazepam has several uses, including: Treatment of anxiety, panic attacks, and states of agitation Treatment of neurovegetative symptoms associated with vertigo Treatment of the symptoms of alcohol, opiate, and benzodiazepine withdrawal Short-term treatment of insomnia Treatment of muscle spasms Treatment of tetanus, together with other measures of intensive treatment Adjunctive treatment of spastic muscular paresis (paraplegia/tetraplegia) caused by cerebral or spinal cord conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury (long-term treatment is coupled with other rehabilitative measures) Palliative treatment of stiff person syndrome Pre- or postoperative sedation, anxiolysis or amnesia (e.g., before endoscopic or surgical procedures) Treatment of complications with stimulant overdoses and psychosis, such as cocaine or methamphetamine Used in the treatment of organophosphate poisoning and reduces the risk of seizure-induced brain and cardiac damage. Preventive treatment of oxygen toxicity during hyperbaric oxygen therapy Dosages are typically determined on an individual basis, depending on the condition being treated, severity of symptoms, patient body weight, and any other conditions the person may have. === Seizures === Intravenous diazepam or lorazepam are first-line treatments for status epilepticus. However, intravenous lorazepam has advantages over intravenous diazepam, including a higher rate of terminating seizures and a more prolonged anticonvulsant effect. Diazepam gel was better than placebo gel in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures. Diazepam is rarely used for the long-term treatment of epilepsy because tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects usually develops within six to twelve months of treatment, effectively rendering it useless for that purpose. The anticonvulsant effects of diazepam can help in the treatment of seizures due to a drug overdose or chemical toxicity as a result of exposure to sarin, VX, or soman (or other organophosphate poisons), lindane, chloroquine, physostigmine, or pyrethroids. Diazepam is sometimes used intermittently for the prevention of febrile seizures that may occur in children under five years of age. Recurrence rates are reduced, but side effects are common and the decision to treat febrile seizures (which are benign in nature) with medication uses these factors as part of the evaluation. Long-term use of diazepam for the management of epilepsy is not recommended; however, a subgroup of individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy benefit from long-term benzodiazepines, and for such individuals, clorazepate has been recommended due to its slower onset of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects. === Alcohol withdrawal === Because of its relatively long duration of action, and evidence of safety and efficacy, diazepam is preferred over other benzodiazepines for the treatment of persons experiencing moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal. An exception to this is when a medication is required intramuscular in which case either lorazepam or midazolam is recommended. === Other === Diazepam is used for the emergency treatment of eclampsia when IV magnesium sulfate and blood-pressure control measures have failed. Benzodiazepines do not have any pain-relieving properties themselves and are generally recommended to be avoided in individuals with pain. However, benzodiazepines such as diazepam can be used for their muscle-relaxant properties to alleviate pain caused by muscle spasms and various dystonias, including blepharospasm. Tolerance often develops to the muscle relaxant effects of benzodiazepines such as diazepam. Baclofen is sometimes used as an alternative to diazepam. === Availability === Diazepam is marketed in over 500 brands throughout the world. It is supplied in oral, injectable, inhalation, and rectal forms. The United States military employs a specialized diazepam preparation known as Convulsive Antidote, Nerve Agent (CANA), which contains diazepam. One CANA kit is typically issued to service members, along with three Mark I NAAK kits, when operating in circumstances where chemical weapons in the form of nerve agents are considered a potential hazard. Both of these kits deliver drugs using autoinjectors. They are intended for use in ""buddy aid"" or ""self-aid"" administration of the drugs in the field before decontamination and delivery of the patient to definitive medical care. == Contraindications == Use of diazepam is avoided, when possible, in individuals with: Ataxia Severe hypoventilation Acute narrow-angle glaucoma Severe hepatic deficiencies (hepatitis and liver cirrhosis decrease elimination by a factor of two) Severe renal deficiencies (for example, patients on dialysis) Liver disorders Severe sleep apnea Severe depression, particularly when accompanied by suicidal tendencies Psychosis Pregnancy or breast feeding Caution required in elderly or debilitated patients Coma or shock Abrupt discontinuation of therapy Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances (with the exception of hallucinogens or some stimulants, where it is occasionally used as a treatment for overdose) History of alcohol or drug dependence Myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder causing marked fatiguability Hypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the benzodiazepine class === Abuse and special populations === Benzodiazepine abuse and misuse is guarded against when prescribed to those with alcohol or drug dependencies or who have psychiatric disorders. Pediatric patients For less than 18 years of age, this treatment is usually not indicated, except for treatment of epilepsy, and pre-or postoperative treatment. The smallest possible effective dose is typically used for this group of patients. Under 6 months of age, safety and effectiveness have not been established; diazepam is not given to those in this age group. Elderly and very ill patients can experience apnea or cardiac arrest. Concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants increases this risk. The smallest possible effective dose is generally used for this group of people. The elderly metabolise benzodiazepines much more slowly than younger adults, and are also more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines, even at similar blood plasma levels. Doses of diazepam are recommended to be about half of those given to younger people, and treatment is limited to a maximum of two weeks. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as diazepam are not recommended for the elderly. Diazepam can also be dangerous in geriatric patients owing to a significantly increased risk of falls. Intravenous or intramuscular injections in hypotensive people or those in shock is administered carefully and vital signs are closely monitored. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam are lipophilic and rapidly penetrate membranes, thus rapidly cross over into the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines including diazepam in late pregnancy, especially high doses, can result in floppy infant syndrome. Diazepam when taken late in pregnancy, during the third trimester, causes a definite risk of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate with symptoms including hypotonia, and reluctance to suck, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. == Adverse effects == Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, can cause anterograde amnesia, confusion, and sedation. The elderly are more prone to diazepam's confusion, amnesia, ataxia, hangover symptoms, and falls. Long-term use of benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, induces tolerance, dependency, and withdrawal syndrome. Like other benzodiazepines, diazepam impairs short-term memory and learning new information. Diazepam and other benzodiazepines can produce anterograde amnesia, but not retrograde amnesia, which means information learned before using benzodiazepines is not impaired. Short-term benzodiazepine use does not lead to tolerance, and the elderly are more sensitive to them. Additionally, after stopping benzodiazepines, cognitive problems may last at least six months; it is unclear if these problems last for longer than six months or are permanent. Benzodiazepines may also cause or worsen depression. Infusions or repeated intravenous injections of diazepam when managing seizures, for example, may lead to drug toxicity, including respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. Drug tolerance may also develop to infusions of diazepam if it is given for longer than 24 hours. Sedatives and sleeping pills, including diazepam, have been associated with an increased risk of death. In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. Diazepam has a range of side effects common to most benzodiazepines, including: Suppression of REM sleep and slow wave sleep Impaired motor function Impaired coordination Impaired balance Dizziness Reflex tachycardia Less commonly, paradoxical reactions can occur, including nervousness, irritability, excitement, worsening of seizures, insomnia, muscle cramps, changes in libido, and in some cases, rage and violence. These adverse reactions are more likely to occur in children, the elderly, and individuals with a history of a substance use disorder, such as an alcohol use disorder, or a history of aggressive behavior. In some people, diazepam may increase the propensity toward self-harming behavior and, in extreme cases, may provoke suicidal tendencies or acts. Very rarely dystonia can occur. Diazepam may impair the ability to drive vehicles or operate machinery. The impairment is worsened by the consumption of alcohol because both act as central nervous system depressants. During therapy, tolerance to the sedative effects usually develops, but not to the anxiolytic and myorelaxant effects. Patients with severe attacks of apnea during sleep may experience respiratory depression (hypoventilation), leading to respiratory arrest and death. Diazepam in doses of 5 mg or more causes significant deterioration in alertness performance combined with increased feelings of sleepiness. === Tolerance and withdrawal === Diazepam, as with other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause tolerance, physical dependence, substance use disorder, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from diazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms similar to those seen during barbiturate or alcohol withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use, and can range from insomnia and anxiety to more serious symptoms, including seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble pre-existing conditions and be misdiagnosed. Diazepam may produce less intense withdrawal symptoms due to its long elimination half-life. Benzodiazepine treatment is recommended to be discontinued as soon as possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. Tolerance develops to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines; for example, tolerance occurs to the anticonvulsant effects and as a result benzodiazepines are not generally recommended for the long-term management of epilepsy. Dose increases may overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may increase. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines includes uncoupling of receptor sites, alterations in gene expression, down-regulation of receptor sites, and desensitisation of receptor sites to the effect of GABA. About one-third of individuals who take benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks become dependent and experience withdrawal syndrome on cessation. Differences in rates of withdrawal (50–100%) vary depending on the patient sample. For example, a random sample of long-term benzodiazepine users typically finds around 50% experience few or no withdrawal symptoms, with the other 50% experiencing notable withdrawal symptoms. Certain select patient groups show a higher rate of notable withdrawal symptoms, up to 100%. Rebound anxiety, more severe than baseline anxiety, is also a common withdrawal symptom when discontinuing diazepam or other benzodiazepines. Diazepam is therefore only recommended for short-term therapy at the lowest possible dose owing to risks of severe withdrawal problems from low doses even after gradual reduction. The risk of pharmacological dependence on diazepam is significant, and patients experience symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome if it is taken for six weeks or longer. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam occurs frequently. === Dependence === Improper or excessive use of diazepam can lead to dependence. At a particularly high risk for diazepam misuse, substance use disorder, or dependence are: People with a history of a substance use disorder or substance dependence. Research suggests that diazepam may increase motivation for alcohol consumption and cravings in some individuals with a history of problematic drinking. People with severe personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder. Patients from the aforementioned groups are monitored very closely during therapy for signs of abuse and development of dependence. Therapy is recommended to be discontinued if any of these signs are noted. If dependence has developed, therapy is still discontinued gradually to avoid severe withdrawal symptoms. Long-term therapy in such instances is not recommended. People suspected of being dependent on benzodiazepine drugs are very gradually tapered off the drug. Withdrawals can be life-threatening, particularly when excessive doses have been taken for extended periods. Therefore, equal prudence is used whether dependence has occurred in therapeutic or recreational contexts. Diazepam is seen as a good choice for tapering for those using high doses of other benzodiazepines since it has a long half-life thus withdrawal symptoms are tolerable. The process is very slow (usually from 14 to 28 weeks) but is considered safe when done appropriately. == Overdose == An individual who has consumed too much diazepam typically displays one or more of these symptoms in approximately four hours immediately following a suspected overdose: Drowsiness Mental confusion Hypotension Impaired motor function Impaired reflexes Impaired coordination Impaired balance Dizziness Coma Although not usually fatal when taken alone, a diazepam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The antidote for an overdose of diazepam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil (Anexate). This drug is used only in cases with severe respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications. Because flumazenil is a short-acting drug, and the effects of diazepam can last for days, several doses of flumazenil may be necessary. Artificial respiration and stabilization of cardiovascular functions may also be necessary. Though not routinely indicated, activated charcoal can be used for decontamination of the stomach following a diazepam overdose. Emesis is contraindicated. Dialysis is minimally effective. Hypotension may be treated with levarterenol or metaraminol. The oral LD50 (lethal dose in 50% of the population) of diazepam is 720 mg/kg in mice and 1240 mg/kg in rats. D. J. Greenblatt and colleagues reported in 1978 on two patients who had taken 500 mg and 2000 mg of diazepam, respectively, went into moderately-deep comas, and were discharged within 48 hours without having experienced any important complications, despite having high concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, according to samples taken in the hospital and as follow-up. Overdoses of diazepam with alcohol, opiates, or other depressants may be fatal. == Interactions == If diazepam is administered concomitantly with other drugs, it is recommended that attention be paid to the possible pharmacological interactions. Particular care is taken with drugs that potentiate the effects of diazepam, such as barbiturates, phenothiazines, opioids, and antidepressants. Diazepam does not increase or decrease hepatic enzyme activity and does not alter the metabolism of other compounds. No evidence has suggested that diazepam alters its metabolism with chronic administration. Agents with an effect on hepatic cytochrome P450 pathways or conjugation can alter the rate of diazepam metabolism. These interactions would be expected to be most significant with long-term diazepam therapy, and their clinical significance is variable. Diazepam increases the central depressive effects of alcohol, other hypnotics/sedatives (e.g., barbiturates), other muscle relaxants, certain antidepressants, sedative antihistamines, opioids, and antipsychotics, as well as anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. The euphoriant effects of opioids may be increased, leading to an increased risk of psychological dependence. Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and valproic acid prolong the action of diazepam by inhibiting its elimination. Alcohol in combination with diazepam may cause a synergistic enhancement of the hypotensive properties of benzodiazepines and alcohol. Oral contraceptives significantly decrease the elimination of desmethyldiazepam, a major metabolite of diazepam. Rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital increase the metabolism of diazepam, thus decreasing drug levels and effects. Dexamethasone and St John's wort also increase the metabolism of diazepam. Diazepam increases the serum levels of phenobarbital. Nefazodone can cause increased blood levels of benzodiazepines. Cisapride may enhance the absorption, and therefore the sedative activity, of diazepam. Small doses of theophylline may inhibit the action of diazepam. Diazepam may block the action of levodopa (used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease). Diazepam may alter digoxin serum concentrations. Other drugs that may have interactions with diazepam include antipsychotics (e.g. chlorpromazine), MAO inhibitors, and ranitidine. Because it acts on the GABA receptor, the herb valerian may produce an adverse effect. Foods that acidify the urine can lead to faster absorption and elimination of diazepam, reducing drug levels and activity. Foods that alkalinize the urine can lead to slower absorption and elimination of diazepam, increasing drug levels and activity. Reports conflict as to whether food in general has any effects on the absorption and activity of orally administered diazepam. == Pharmacology == Diazepam is a long-acting ""classical"" benzodiazepine. Other classical benzodiazepines include chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, flurazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. Diazepam has anticonvulsant properties. Benzodiazepines act via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as calcium channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive calcium uptake in rat nerve cell preparations. Diazepam inhibits acetylcholine release in mouse hippocampal synaptosomes. This has been found by measuring sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake in mouse brain cells in vitro, after pretreatment of the mice with diazepam in vivo. This may play a role in explaining diazepam's anticonvulsant properties. Diazepam binds with high affinity to glial cells in animal cell cultures. Diazepam at high doses has been found to decrease histamine turnover in mouse brain via diazepam's action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex. Diazepam also decreases prolactin release in rats. === Mechanism of action === Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of the GABA type A receptors (GABAA). The GABAA receptors are ligand-gated chloride-selective ion channels that are activated by GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. The binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes the binding of GABA, which in turn increases the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between resting potential and threshold potential is increased and firing is less likely. As a result, the arousal of the cortical and limbic systems in the central nervous system is reduced. The GABAA receptor is a heteromer composed of five subunits, the most common ones being two αs, two βs, and one γ (α2β2γ). For each subunit, many subtypes exist (α1–6, β1–3, and γ1–3). GABAA receptors containing the α1 subunit mediate the sedative, the anterograde amnesic, and partly the anticonvulsive effects of diazepam. GABAA receptors containing α2 mediate the anxiolytic actions and to a large degree the myorelaxant effects. GABAA receptors containing α3 and α5 also contribute to benzodiazepines myorelaxant actions, whereas GABAA receptors comprising the α5 subunit were shown to modulate the temporal and spatial memory effects of benzodiazepines. Diazepam is not the only drug to target these GABAA receptors. Drugs such as flumazenil also bind to GABAA to induce their effects. Diazepam appears to act on areas of the limbic system, thalamus, and hypothalamus, inducing anxiolytic effects. Benzodiazepine drugs including diazepam increase the inhibitory processes in the cerebral cortex. The anticonvulsant properties of diazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than GABAA receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems limited by benzodiazepines' effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation. The muscle relaxant properties of diazepam are produced via inhibition of polysynaptic pathways in the spinal cord. === Pharmacokinetics === Diazepam can be administered orally, intravenously (it is always diluted, as it is painful and damaging to veins), intramuscularly (IM), or as a suppository. The onset of action is one to five minutes for IV administration and 15–30 minutes for IM administration. The duration of diazepam's peak pharmacological effects is 15 minutes to one hour for both routes of administration. The half-life of diazepam, in general, is 30–56 hours. Peak plasma levels occur between 30 and 90 minutes after oral administration and between 30 and 60 minutes after intramuscular administration; after rectal administration, peak plasma levels occur after 10 to 45 minutes. Diazepam is highly plasma protein-bound, with 96–99% of the absorbed drug being protein-bound. The distribution half-life of diazepam is two to 13 minutes. Diazepam is highly lipid-soluble and is widely distributed throughout the body after administration. It easily crosses both the blood–brain barrier and the placenta, and is excreted into breast milk. After absorption, diazepam is redistributed into muscle and adipose tissue. Continual daily doses of diazepam quickly build to a high concentration in the body (mainly in adipose tissue), far above the actual dose for any given day. Diazepam is stored preferentially in some organs, including the heart. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the neonate, and withdrawal of diazepam during pregnancy and breastfeeding is clinically justified. Diazepam undergoes oxidative metabolism by demethylation (CYP2C9, 2C19, 2B6, 3A4, and 3A5), hydroxylation (CYP3A4 and 2C19) and glucuronidation in the liver as part of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. It has several pharmacologically active metabolites. The main active metabolite of diazepam is desmethyldiazepam (also known as nordazepam or nordiazepam). Its other active metabolites include the minor active metabolites temazepam and oxazepam. These metabolites are conjugated with glucuronide and are excreted primarily in the urine. Because of these active metabolites, the serum values of diazepam alone are not useful in predicting the effects of the drug. Diazepam has a biphasic half-life of about one to three days and two to seven days for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. Most of the drug is metabolized; very little diazepam is excreted unchanged. The elimination half-life of diazepam and also the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action, as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration. === Synthesis === The synthesis of Diazepam was first achieved through a reaction pathway developed by Leo Sternbach and his team at Hoffmann-La Roche in the late 1950s. Sternbach's method commenced with 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone, which undergoes cyclocondensation with glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride to construct the benzodiazepine core. This core is subsequently alkylated at the nitrogen in the 1-position using dimethyl sulfate in the presence of sodium methoxide and methanol under reflux conditions. Although the direct transformation from 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone to Nordazepam is conceptually straightforward, an alternative approach involving the treatment of 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenon with chloroacetyl chloride, succeeded by ammoniation and heating, culminates in Nordazepam with enhanced yield and facilitates easier purification processes. === Detection in body fluids === Diazepam may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma diazepam concentrations are usually in a range of 0.1–1.0 mg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically. Most commercial immunoassays for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with diazepam, but confirmation and quantitation are usually performed using chromatographic techniques. === Environmental === Diazepam is a common environmental contamination finding near human settlements. == History == Diazepam was the second benzodiazepine invented by Leo Sternbach of Hoffmann-La Roche at the company's Nutley, New Jersey, facility following chlordiazepoxide (Librium), which was approved for use in 1960. Released in 1963 as an improved version of Librium, diazepam became incredibly popular, helping Roche to become a pharmaceutical industry giant. It is 2.5 times more potent than its predecessor, which it quickly surpassed in terms of sales. After this initial success, other pharmaceutical companies began to introduce other benzodiazepine derivatives. The benzodiazepines gained popularity among medical professionals as an improvement over barbiturates, which have a comparatively narrow therapeutic index, and are far more sedative at therapeutic doses. The benzodiazepines are also far less dangerous; death rarely results from diazepam overdose, except in cases where it is consumed with large amounts of other depressants (such as alcohol or opioids). Benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam initially had widespread public support, but with time the view changed to one of growing criticism and calls for restrictions on their prescription. Marketed by Roche using an advertising campaign conceived by the William Douglas McAdams Agency under the leadership of Arthur Sackler, diazepam was the top-selling pharmaceutical in the United States from 1969 to 1982, with peak annual sales in 1978 of 2.3 billion tablets. Diazepam, along with oxazepam, nitrazepam and temazepam, represents 82% of the benzodiazepine market in Australia. While psychiatrists continue to prescribe diazepam for the short-term relief of anxiety, neurology has taken the lead in prescribing diazepam for the palliative treatment of certain types of epilepsy and spastic activity, for example, forms of paresis. It is also the first line of defense for a rare disorder called stiff-person syndrome. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Diazepam is a medication with a high risk of misuse and can cause drug dependence. Urgent action by national governments has been recommended to improve prescribing patterns of benzodiazepines such as diazepam. A single dose of diazepam modulates the dopamine system in similar ways to how morphine and alcohol modulate the dopaminergic pathways. Between 50 and 64% of rats will self-administer diazepam. Diazepam can substitute for the behavioral effects of barbiturates in a primate study. Diazepam has been found as an adulterant in heroin. Diazepam drug misuse can occur either through recreational misuse where the drug is taken to achieve a high or when the drug is continued long term against medical advice. Sometimes, it is used by stimulant users to ""come down"" and sleep and to help control the urge to binge. These users often escalate dosage from 2 to 25 times the therapeutic dose of 5 mg to 10 mg. A large-scale study in the US, conducted by SAMHSA, using data from 2011, determined benzodiazepines were present in 28.7% of emergency department visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. In this regard, benzodiazepines are second only to opiates, the study found in 39.2% of visits. About 29.3% of drug-related suicide attempts involve benzodiazepines, making them the most frequently represented class in drug-related suicide attempts. Males misuse benzodiazepines as commonly as females. Diazepam was detected in 26% of cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs in Sweden and its active metabolite nordazepam was detected in 28% of cases. Other benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone also were found in high numbers. Many drivers had blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting a high degree of potential for misuse of benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone. In Northern Ireland, in cases where drugs were detected in samples from impaired drivers who were not impaired by alcohol, benzodiazepines were found in 87% of cases. Diazepam was the most commonly detected benzodiazepine. === Legal status === Diazepam is regulated as a prescription medication: ==== International ==== Diazepam is a Schedule IV controlled drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. ==== UK ==== Classified as a controlled drug, listed under Schedule IV, Part I (CD Benz POM) of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, allowing possession with a valid prescription. The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 makes it illegal to possess the drug without a prescription, and for such purposes, it is classified as a Class C drug. ==== Germany ==== Classified as a prescription drug, or in high dosage as a restricted drug (Betäubungsmittelgesetz, Anlage III). ==== Australia ==== Diazepam is a Schedule 4 substance under the Poisons Standard (June 2018). A Schedule 4 drug is outlined in the Poisons Act 1964 as, ""Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription"". ==== United States ==== Diazepam is controlled as a Schedule IV substance. ===== Judicial executions ===== The states of California and Florida offer diazepam to condemned inmates as a pre-execution sedative as part of their lethal injection program, although the state of California has not executed a prisoner since 2006. In August 2018, Nebraska used diazepam as part of the drug combination used to execute Carey Dean Moore, the first death row inmate executed in Nebraska in over 21 years. == Veterinary uses == Diazepam is used as a short-term sedative and anxiolytic for cats and dogs, sometimes used as an appetite stimulant. It can also be used to stop seizures in dogs and cats. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2016). ""Diazepam Therapy and CYP2C19 Genotype"". In Pratt VM, McLeod HL, Rubinstein WS, et al.

3922,"('Butenafine hydrochloride', 'Butenafine hcl', 'Mentax', 'Butenafine (hydrochloride)', 'N-(p-tert-butylbenzyl)-n-methyl-1-naphthalenemethylamine hydrochloride')",Medical,"Butenafine, sold under the brand names Lotrimin Ultra, Mentax, and Butop (In India only), is a synthetic benzylamine derived antifungal drug. It is structurally related to the allylamine antifungals terbinafine & naftifine. == Medical uses == Butenafine is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur, as well as athlete's foot (Tinea pedis), ringworm (Tinea corporis) and jock itch (Tinea cruris) due to Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton tonsurans. It also displays superior activity against Candida albicans than terbinafine and naftifine. Butenafine demonstrates low minimum inhibitory concentrations against Cryptococcus and Aspergillus. There is some evidence that it is effective against dermatophyte infections of the toenails, but needs to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year). === Available forms === Butenafine is typically available as a 1% topical cream. == Pharmacology == Like the allylamine antifungals (e.g terbinafine), butenafine works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol by binding to and inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme in the pathway used for creation of the sterols needed in fungal cell membranes. Lacking ergosterol, the cell membranes increase in permeability, allowing their contents to leak out. Furthermore, inhibition of squalene epoxidase leads to a toxic buildup of squalene. This double action of butenafine (increased membrane permeability and toxic buildup of squalene) makes butenafine fungicidal rather than merely fungistatic. In addition to being an antifungal, butenafine is an anti inflammatory. Because fungal skin infections are often accompanied by significant inflammation, this is a desirable property. The fact that butenafine has intrinsic anti inflammatory properties is also desirable since it is not necessary to add topical glucocorticoids, which often come with undesired side effects. == Chemistry == Butenafine hydrochloride is an odorless white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, and chloroform, yet is only slightly soluble in water. == Synthesis == Reductive amination of 1-naphthaldehyde (1) with methylamine (2) gives the intermediate secondary amine (3). Alkylation of this with p-tert-butyl benzyl bromide (4) yields the tertiary amine butenafine. == References ==",Mentax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.475421054754406e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024953915271908045)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.029750484973192215), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14345/mentax-topical/details,https://www.rxlist.com/mentax-drug.htm,https://www.akamai.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/butenafine-topical-route/description/drg-20062392 ', [])"
3923,"('Hexachlorophene', 'Hexachlorofen', 'Hexachlorophen', 'Nabac', 'Phisohex')",Medical,"Hexachlorophene, also known as Nabac, is an organochlorine compound that was once widely used as a disinfectant. The compound occurs as a white odorless solid, although commercial samples can be off-white and possess a slightly phenolic odor. It is insoluble in water but dissolves in acetone, ethanol, diethyl ether, and chloroform. In medicine, hexachlorophene is useful as a topical anti-infective and anti-bacterial agent. It is also used in agriculture as a soil fungicide, plant bactericide, and acaricide. == Production == Hexacholorophene is produced by alkylation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol with formaldehyde. Related antiseptics are prepared similarly, e.g., bromochlorophene and dichlorophene. == Safety == The LD50 (oral, rat) is 59 mg/kg, indicating that the compound is relatively toxic. It is not mutagenic nor teratogenic according to Ullmann's Encyclopedia, but ""embryotoxic and produces some teratogenic effects"" according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) is always a contaminant in this compound's production. Several accidents releasing many kilograms of TCDD have been reported. The reaction between 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and formaldehyde is exothermic. If the reaction occurs without adequate cooling, TCDD is produced in significant quantities as a byproduct and contaminant. The Seveso disaster and the Times Beach, Missouri, contamination incident exemplify the industrial hazards of hexachlorophene production. == Selective removal from market == === France === In 1972, the ""Bébé"" brand of baby powder in France killed 39 babies. It also did great damage to the central nervous systems of several hundred other babies. The batch of toxic ""Bébé"" brand of powder was mistakenly manufactured with 6% hexachlorophene. This industrial accident directly led to the removal of hexachlorophene from consumer products worldwide. === United States === In 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) halted production and distribution of products containing more than 1% hexachlorophene. After that change, most products containing hexachlorophene were available only with a doctor's prescription. The restrictions were enacted after 15 deaths in the United States, and the 39 deaths in France mentioned above, were reported following brain damage caused by hexachlorophene. Several companies manufactured over-the-counter preparations which utilised hexachlorophene in their formulations. One product, Baby Magic Bath by The Mennen Company, was recalled in 1971, and removed from retail distribution. Two commercial preparations using hexachlorophene, pHisoDerm and pHisoHex, were widely used as antibacterial skin cleansers in the treatment of acne, (with pHisoDerm developed for those allergic to the active ingredients in pHisoHex). During the 1960s, both were available over the counter in the US. After the ban, pHisoDerm was reformulated without hexachlorophene, and continued to be sold over-the-counter, while pHisoHex, (which contained 3% hexachlorophene - 3 times the legal limit imposed in 1972), became available as a prescription body wash. In the European Community countries during the 1970s and 1980s, pHisoHex remained available over the counter. A related product, pHisoAc, was used as a skin mask to dry and peel away acne lesions whilst pHiso-Scrub, a hexachlorophene-impregnated sponge for scrubbing, has since been discontinued. Several substitute products (including triclosan) were developed, but none had the germ-killing capability of hexachlorophene. (Sanofi-Aventis became the sole European manufacturer of pHisoHex, while The Mentholatum Company owns the pHisoDerm brand today. Sanofi-Aventis discontinued production of several forms of pHisoHex in August 2009 and discontinued all production of pHisoHex in September 2013). The formula for Dial soap was modified to remove hexachlorophene after the FDA ended over-the-counter availability in 1972. Bristol-Myers' discontinued Ipana toothpaste brand at one time contained hexachlorophene. Another U.S.A. brand of toothpaste containing hexachlorophene in the early 1960's was Stripe. === Germany === In Germany, cosmetics containing hexachlorophene have been banned since 1985. === Austria === In Austria, the sale of drugs containing the substance has been banned since 1990. == Trade names == Trade names for hexachlorophene include: Acigena, Almederm, AT7 (dial soap), AT17, Bilevon, Exofene, Fostril, Gamophen, G-11, Germa-Medica, Hexosan, K-34, Septisol, Surofene, M3. == References ==",Phisohex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.018354563042521477), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -2.15310683415737e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.20142608880996704), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.05461449176073074), ('ICAL', -2.9802276912960224e-06), (',', -0.011256992816925049), ('ĠPERSON', -0.6935991048812866), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -4.887569048150908e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3132999837398529)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.1002068892121315), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0019287518225610256), (' PERSONAL', -0.011047814972698689), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/phisohex.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=24, title='Phisohex: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/phisohex.html?utm_source=openai')])"

The oral bioavailability of the reduced form of CoQ10, ubiquinol-10, has been reported to be greater than that of the oxidized form of CoQ10, ubiquinone-10, in some studies. In contrast, it has also been highlighted that the oral bioavailability of ubiquinol-10 is not superior to that of ubiquinone-10 because ubiquinol-10 may be oxidized during digestion. In fact, it has not been shown which form of CoQ10 exists in the process from oral intake to absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, the amounts of ubiquinol-10 and ubiquinone-10 were measured in the gastrointestinal content and small intestine tissue after oral administration of ubiquinol-10 or ubiquinone-10 to C57BL/6J mice. The form of CoQ10 detected in the gastrointestinal content and small intestine tissue was almost the same as that when administered orally. The results of our study suggested that the orally administered ubiquinol-10 and ubiquinone-10 mostly reached the small intestine without oxidizing to ubiquinone-10 and reducing to ubiquinol-10, and both were absorbed by the small intestine tissue in almost their original forms. Among the bacterial strains known to contain ubiquinone-10, three strains, Agrobacterium tumefaciens KY-3085 (ATCC4452), Paracoccus denitrificans KY-3940 (ATCC19367) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides KY-4113 (FERM-P4675), were selected as excellent producers of this ubiquinone. The ubiquinone-10 production by the Agrobacterium and Rhodobacter strains was affected by aeration. An ethionine-resistant mutant (M-37) derived from A. tumefaciens KY-3085 promoted increased production of ubiquinone-10 (20% higher than the parent). Another Agrobacterium mutant (AU-55), which was induced by the successive addition of four genetic markers, showed a tolerance to the suppression of ubiquinone-10 production caused by aeration, and the fermentation time for production was remarkably shortened. The amount of ubiquinone-10 produced by this Agrobacterium mutant reached 180 mg/l in a 58 h culture. A green mutant (carotenoid-deficient mutant, Co-22-11) derived from R. sphaeroides KY-4113 produced 350 mg/l of ubiquinone-10 under culturing conditions with a limited supply of air, the ubiquinone-10 content being 8.7 mg/g-dry cell. In this case, the amount and content corresponded to 2.8 and 3.6 times larger than those given by the wild-type strain, respectively. A multiple-layer structure of cell membrane was observed in the highly ubiquinone-10 accumulating cell of the green mutant by electron microscopy. The amount of ubiquinone-10 produced by P. denitrificans was much lower than those of the other two strains.

3926,"('Coenzyme q10', 'Ubidecarenone', 'Ubiquinone-10', 'Coq10', 'Ubiquinone 50')","Endogenous, Medical","Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10 ), also known as ubiquinone, is a naturally occurring biochemical cofactor (coenzyme) and an antioxidant produced by the human body. It can also be obtained from dietary sources, such as meat, fish, seed oils, vegetables, and dietary supplements. CoQ10 is found in many organisms, including animals and bacteria. CoQ10 plays a role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, aiding in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is involved in energy transfer within cells. The structure of CoQ10 consists of a benzoquinone moiety and an isoprenoid side chain, with the ""10"" referring to the number of isoprenyl chemical subunits in its tail. Although a ubiquitous molecule in human tissues, CoQ10 is not a dietary nutrient and does not have a recommended intake level, and its use as a supplement is not approved in the United States for any health or anti-disease effect. == Biological functions == CoQ10 is a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), where it plays a role in oxidative phosphorylation, a process required for the biosynthesis of adenosine triphosphate, the primary energy source of cells. CoQ10 is a lipophilic molecule that is located in all biological membranes of human body and serves as a component for the synthesis of ATP and is a life-sustaining cofactor for the three complexes (complex I, complex II, and complex III) of the ETC in the mitochondria. CoQ10 has a role in the transport of protons across lysosomal membranes to regulate pH in lysosome functions. The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation process occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotic cells. This membrane is highly folded into structures called cristae, which increase the surface area available for oxidative phosphorylation. CoQ10 plays a role in this process as an essential cofactor of the ETC located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and serves the following functions: electron transport in the mitochondrial ETC, by shuttling electrons from mitochondrial complexes like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), ubiquinone reductase (complex I), and succinate ubiquinone reductase (complex II), the fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids oxidation (through flavin-linked dehydrogenases) to ubiquinol–cytochrome-c reductase (complex III) of the ETC: CoQ10 participates in fatty acid and glucose metabolism by transferring electrons generated from the reduction of fatty acids and glucose to electron acceptors; antioxidant activity as a lipid-soluble antioxidant together with vitamin E, scavenging reactive oxygen species and protecting cells against oxidative stress, inhibiting the oxidation of proteins, DNA, and use of vitamin E. == Biochemistry == Coenzymes Q is a coenzyme family that is ubiquitous in animals and many Pseudomonadota, a group of gram-negative bacteria. The fact that the coenzyme is ubiquitous gives the origin of its other name, ubiquinone. In humans, the most common form of coenzymes Q is coenzyme Q10, also called CoQ10 () or ubiquinone-10. Coenzyme Q10 is a 1,4-benzoquinone, in which ""Q"" refers to the quinone chemical group and ""10"" refers to the number of isoprenyl chemical subunits (shown enclosed in brackets in the diagram) in its tail. In natural ubiquinones, there are from six to ten subunits in the tail, with humans having a tail of 10 isoprene units (50 carbon atoms) connected to its benzoquinone ""head"". This family of fat-soluble substances is present in all respiring eukaryotic cells, primarily in the mitochondria. Ninety-five percent of the human body's energy is generated this way. Organs with the highest energy requirements—such as the heart, liver, and kidney—have the highest CoQ10 concentrations. There are three redox states of CoQ: fully oxidized (ubiquinone), semiquinone (ubisemiquinone), and fully reduced (ubiquinol). The capacity of this molecule to act as a two-electron carrier (moving between the quinone and quinol form) and a one-electron carrier (moving between the semiquinone and one of these other forms) is central to its role in the electron transport chain due to the iron–sulfur clusters that can only accept one electron at a time and as a free radical–scavenging antioxidant. == Deficiency == There are two major pathways of deficiency of CoQ10 in humans: reduced biosynthesis, and increased use by the body. Biosynthesis is the major source of CoQ10. Biosynthesis requires at least 15 genes, and mutations in any of them can cause CoQ deficiency. CoQ10 levels also may be affected by other genetic defects (such as mutations of mitochondrial DNA, ETFDH, APTX, FXN, and BRAF, genes that are not directly related to the CoQ10 biosynthetic process). Some of these, such as mutations in COQ6, can lead to serious diseases such as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with sensorineural deafness. === Assessment === Although CoQ10 may be measured in blood plasma, these measurements reflect dietary intake rather than tissue status. Currently, most clinical centers measure CoQ10 levels in cultured skin fibroblasts, muscle biopsies, and blood mononuclear cells. Culture fibroblasts can be used also to evaluate the rate of endogenous CoQ10 biosynthesis, by measuring the uptake of 14C-labeled p-hydroxybenzoate. CoQ10 is studied as an adjunctive therapy to reduce inflammation in periodontitis. === Statins === Although statins may reduce CoQ10 in the blood it is unclear if they reduce CoQ10 in muscle. Evidence does not support that supplementation improves statin side effects. == Chemical properties == The oxidized structure of CoQ10 is shown below. The various kinds of coenzyme Q may be distinguished by the number of isoprenoid subunits in their side-chains. The most common coenzyme Q in human mitochondria is CoQ10. Q refers to the quinone head and ""10"" refers to the number of isoprene repeats in the tail. The molecule below has three isoprenoid units and would be called Q3. In its pure state, it is an orange-colored lipophile powder and has no taste or odor. == Biosynthesis == Biosynthesis occurs in most human tissue. There are three major steps: Creation of the benzoquinone structure (using phenylalanine or tyrosine, via 4-hydroxybenzoate) Creation of the isoprene side chain (using acetyl-CoA) The joining or condensation of the above two structures The initial two reactions occur in mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes, indicating multiple sites of synthesis in animal cells. An important enzyme in this pathway is HMG-CoA reductase, usually a target for intervention in cardiovascular complications. The ""statin"" family of cholesterol-reducing medications inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. One possible side effect of statins is decreased production of CoQ10, which may be connected to the development of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. However, the role statins play in CoQ deficiency is controversial. Although statins reduce blood levels of CoQ, studies on the effects of muscle levels of CoQ are yet to come. CoQ supplementation also does not reduce side effects of statin medications. Genes involved include PDSS1, PDSS2, COQ2, and ADCK3 (COQ8, CABC1). Organisms other than humans produce the benzoquinone and isoprene structures from somewhat different source chemicals. For example, the bacteria E. coli produces the former from chorismate and the latter from a non-mevalonate source. The common yeast S. cerevisiae, however, derives the former from either chorismate or tyrosine and the latter from mevalonate. Most organisms share the common 4-hydroxybenzoate intermediate, yet again uses different steps to arrive at the ""Q"" structure. == Dietary supplement == Although neither a prescription drug nor an essential nutrient, CoQ10 is commonly used as a dietary supplement with the intent to prevent or improve disease conditions, such as cardiovascular disorders. CoQ10 is naturally produced by the body and plays a crucial role in cell growth and protection. Despite its significant role in the body, it is not used as a drug to treat any specific disease. Nevertheless, CoQ10 is widely available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement and is recommended by some healthcare professionals, despite a lack of definitive scientific evidence supporting these recommendations, especially when it comes to cardiovascular diseases. == Regulation and composition == CoQ10 is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of any medical condition. However, it is sold as a dietary supplement not subject to the same regulations as medicinal drugs, and is an ingredient in some cosmetics. The manufacture of CoQ10 is not regulated, and different batches and brands may vary significantly. == Research == A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to make a conclusion about its use for the prevention of heart disease. A 2016 Cochrane review concluded that CoQ10 had no effect on blood pressure. A 2021 Cochrane review found ""no convincing evidence to support or refute"" the use of CoQ10 for the treatment of heart failure. A 2017 meta-analysis of people with heart failure taking 30–100 mg/d of CoQ10 found a 31% lower mortality and increased exercise capacity, with no significant difference in the endpoints of left heart ejection fraction. A 2021 meta-analysis found that coenzyme Q10 was associated with a 31% lower all-cause mortality in HF patients. In a 2023 meta-analysis of older people, ubiquinone had evidence of a cardiovascular effect, but ubiquinol did not. Although CoQ10 has been studied as a potential remedy to treat purported muscle-related side effects of statin medications, the results were mixed. Although a 2018 meta-analysis concluded that there was preliminary evidence for oral CoQ10 reducing statin-associated muscle symptoms, including muscle pain, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and muscle tiredness, 2015 and 2024 meta-analysis found that CoQ10 had no effect on statin myopathy. CoQ10 is studied as an adjunctive therapy to reduce inflammation in periodontitis. == Pharmacology == === Absorption === CoQ10 in the pure form is a crystalline powder insoluble in water. Absorption as a pharmacological substance follows the same process as that of lipids; the uptake mechanism appears to be similar to that of vitamin E, another lipid-soluble nutrient. This process in the human body involves secretion into the small intestine of pancreatic enzymes and bile, which facilitates emulsification and micelle formation required for absorption of lipophilic substances. Food intake (and the presence of lipids) stimulates bodily biliary excretion of bile acids and greatly enhances absorption of CoQ10. Exogenous CoQ10 is absorbed from the small intestine and is best absorbed if taken with a meal. Serum concentration of CoQ10 in fed condition is higher than in fasting conditions. === Metabolism === CoQ10 is metabolized in all tissues, with the metabolites phosphorylated in cells. CoQ10 is reduced to ubiquinol during or after absorption in the small intestine. It is absorbed by chylomicrons, and redistributed in the blood within lipoproteins. Its elimination occurs via biliary and fecal excretion. === Pharmacokinetics === Some reports have been published on the pharmacokinetics of CoQ10. The plasma peak can be observed 6–8 hours after oral administration when taken as a pharmacological substance. In some studies, a second plasma peak was observed approximately 24 hours after administration, probably due to enterohepatic recycling and redistribution from the liver to circulation. Deuterium-labeled crystalline CoQ10 was used to investigate pharmacokinetics in humans to determine an elimination half-time of 33 hours. === Bioavailability === In contrast to the intake of CoQ10 as a constituent of food, such as nuts or meat, from which CoQ10 is normally absorbed, there is a concern about CoQ10 bioavailability when it is taken as a dietary supplement. Bioavailability of CoQ10 supplements may be reduced due to the lipophilic nature of its molecule and large molecular weight. ==== Reduction of particle size ==== Nanoparticles have been explored as a delivery system for various drugs, such as improving the oral bioavailability of drugs with poor absorption characteristics. However, this has not proved successful with CoQ10, although reports have differed widely. The use of aqueous suspension of finely powdered CoQ10 in pure water also reveals only a minor effect. ==== Water-solubility ==== Facilitating drug absorption by increasing its solubility in water is a common pharmaceutical strategy and also is successful for CoQ10. Various approaches have been developed to achieve this goal, with many of them producing significantly better results over oil-based soft gel capsules despite the many attempts to optimize their composition. Examples of such approaches are use of the aqueous dispersion of solid CoQ10 with the polymer tyloxapol, formulations based on various solubilising agents, such as hydrogenated lecithin, and complexation with cyclodextrins; among the latter, the complex with β-cyclodextrin has been found to have highly increased bioavailability and also is used in pharmaceutical and food industries for CoQ10-fortification. == Adverse effects and precautions == Generally, oral CoQ10 supplementation is well tolerated. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, appetite suppression, and abdominal pain), rashes, and headaches. Some adverse effects, largely gastrointestinal, are reported with intakes. Doses of 100–300 mg per day may induce insomnia or elevate liver enzymes. The observed safe level risk assessment method indicated that the evidence of safety is acceptable at intakes up to 1200 mg per day. Caution should be observed in the use of CoQ10 supplementation in people with bile duct obstruction and during pregnancy or breastfeeding. == Potential drug interactions == CoQ10 taken as a pharmacological substance has potential to inhibit the effects of theophylline as well as the anticoagulant warfarin; CoQ10 may interfere with warfarin's actions by interacting with cytochrome p450 enzymes thereby reducing the INR, a measure of blood clotting. The structure of CoQ10 is similar to that of vitamin K, which competes with and counteracts warfarin's anticoagulation effects. CoQ10 is not recommended in people taking warfarin due to the increased risk of clotting. == Dietary concentrations == Detailed reviews on occurrence of CoQ10 and dietary intake were published in 2010. Besides the endogenous synthesis within organisms, CoQ10 also is supplied by various foods. CoQ10 concentrations in various foods are: Vegetable oils, meat, and fish are rich in CoQ10. Dairy products are much poorer sources of CoQ10 than animal tissues. Among vegetables, broccoli and cauliflower are good sources of CoQ10. Most fruits and berries are poor sources of CoQ10, except avocados, which have relatively high oil and CoQ10 content. === Intake === In the developed world, the estimated daily intake of CoQ10 has been determined at 3–6 mg per day, derived primarily from meat. South Koreans have an estimated average daily CoQ (Q9 + Q10) intake of 11.6 mg/d, derived primarily from kimchi. === Effect of heat and processing === Cooking by frying reduces CoQ10 content by 14–32%. == History == In 1950, a small amount of CoQ10 was isolated from the lining of a horse's gut, a compound initially called substance SA, but later deemed to be quinone found in many animal tissues. In 1957, the same compound was isolated from mitochondrial membranes of beef heart, with research showing that it transported electrons within mitochondria. It was called Q-275 as a quinone. The Q-275/substance SA was later renamed ubiquinone as it was a ubiquitous quinone found in all animal tissues. In 1958, its full chemical structure was reported. Ubiquinone was later called either mitoquinone or coenzyme Q due to its participation to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In 1966, a study reported that reduced CoQ6 was an effective antioxidant in cells. == See also == Idebenone – synthetic analog with reduced oxidant-generating properties Mitoquinone mesylate – synthetic analog with improved mitochondrial permeability == References ==",Coq10,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.0012657057959586382), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.00020389800192788243), (' FOOD', -0.00018089536752086133), (',', -0.07892845571041107), (' PERSONAL', -0.0011777279432862997), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.037284404039382935), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -8.702239938429557e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0002703301142901182), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4741535782814026)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD', [('END', -1.6405310816480778e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -0.49907368421554565), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -0.023245712742209435)])","('ENDOGENOUS,FOOD,PERSONAL CARE;https://cosmetics.specialchem.com/inci-ingredients/ubiquinone,https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/coenzyme-q10,https://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Article/2014/12/03/CoQ10-market-growth-through-2020-will-be-driven-by-the-personal-care-industry ', [])"
3927,"('Donepezil hydrochloride', 'Donepezil hcl', 'Aricept', 'Aricept odt', 'E 2020')",Medical,"Donepezil, sold under the brand name Aricept among others, is a medication used to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type. It appears to result in a small benefit in mental function and ability to function. Use, however, has not been shown to change the progression of the disease. Treatment should be stopped if no benefit is seen. It is taken by mouth or via a transdermal patch. Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and structurally unrelated to other anticholinesterase agents. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, aggression, diarrhea, feeling tired, and muscle cramps. Serious side effects may include abnormal heart rhythms, urinary incontinence, and seizures. Donepezil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 146th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Alzheimer's disease === There is no evidence that donepezil or other similar agents alter the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease. Six-to-twelve-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition or behavior. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends donepezil as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved donepezil for treatment of mild, moderate and severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease. === Other === Lewy body dementia: Some studies have shown benefits of donepezil for the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Lewy body dementia. Traumatic brain injury: Some research suggests an improvement in memory dysfunction in patients with traumatic brain injury with donepezil use. Vascular dementia: Studies have shown that donepezil may improve cognition in patients with vascular dementia but not overall global functioning. Dementia associated with Parkinson disease: Some evidence suggests that donepezil can improve cognition, executive function, and global status in Parkinson disease dementia. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other side effects included difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps and loss of appetite. Most side effects were observed in patients taking the 23 mg dose compared to 10 mg or lower doses. Side effects are mild and transient in most patients, lasting up to three weeks and usually improved even with continued use. Donepezil, like other cholinesterase inhibitors, can cause nightmares due to enhanced activation of the visual association cortex during REM sleep. Dosing donepezil in the morning can reduce the frequency of nightmares. === Precautions === Donepezil should be used with caution in people with heart disease, cardiac conduction disturbances, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, severe cardiac arrhythmia and sick sinus syndrome. People with peptic ulcer disease or taking NSAIDs should use with caution because increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was noted. Slow heart beat and fainting in people with heart problems were also seen. These symptoms may appear more frequent when initiating treatment or increasing the donepezil dose. Although occurrence of seizures is rare, people who have a predisposition to seizures should be treated with caution. If daily donepezil has suspended for 7 days or less, restarting at the same dose is recommended, while if the suspension lasts longer than 7 days, retitrate from 5 mg daily is suggested. == Mechanism of action == Donepezil binds and reversibly inhibits enzymes called cholinesterases, especially acetylcholinesterase, thus inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine. This increases acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses. The precise mechanism of action of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. Certainly, Alzheimer's disease involves a substantial loss of the elements of the cholinergic system and it is generally accepted that the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are related to this cholinergic deficit, particularly in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain. In addition to its actions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil has been found to act as a potent agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 14.6 nM), and has been shown to produce specific antiamnestic effects in animals mainly via this action. Some noncholinergic mechanisms have also been proposed. Donepezil upregulates the nicotinic receptors in the cortical neurons, adding to neuroprotective activity. It inhibits voltage-activated sodium currents reversibly and delays rectifier potassium currents and fast transient potassium currents, although this action is unlikely to contribute to clinical effects. == Synergy == Donepezil was claimed to act synergistically with an agent called FK962 [283167-06-6] & FK960 [133920-70-4]. {potential activation of somatostatinergic neurotransmission} However, the development was discontinued after Phase II ""since the data reviewed did not indicate clear efficacy of the compound for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."" == Stereochemistry == Donepezil medications are racemates. == History == Research leading to the development of donepezil began in 1983, at Eisai, and in 1996, Eisai received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donepezil under the brand Aricept, which it co-marketed with Pfizer. The team at Eisai was led by Hachiro Sugimoto. As of 2011, Aricept was the world's best-selling Alzheimer's disease treatment. The first generic donepezil became available in November 2010, with the US FDA approval of a formulation prepared by Ranbaxy Labs. == Research == Donepezil has been tested in other cognitive disorders, including Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia, but it is not currently approved for these indications. Donepezil has also been found to improve sleep apnea in people with Alzheimer's. It also improves gait in people with mild Alzheimer's. Donepezil has also been studied in people with mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, post-coronary artery bypass surgery cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with multiple sclerosis, CADASIL syndrome, and Down syndrome. A three-year National Institutes of Health trial in people with mild cognitive impairment reported donepezil was superior to placebo in delaying rate of progression to dementia during the initial 18 months of the study, but this was not sustained at 36 months. In a secondary analysis, a subgroup of individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype showed sustained benefits with donepezil throughout the study. At this time, though, donepezil is not indicated for prevention of dementia. === Cognitive enhancement === Donepezil has shown mixed results for improving cognitive abilities in healthy individuals. A 2009 double-blind, placebo controlled study (n=24) investigating donepezil's effects across a variety of memory tests in reported an improvement in spatial memory accuracy both before (90 minutes after dosing) and at theoretical Tmax (210 minutes after dosing). However, a later 2011 paper featuring two study double-blind, placebo controlled experiments evaluating donepezil's effects in older but healthy subjects reported impairment after acute (5 hours after dose) and chronic (4 weeks) donepezil administration. === ADHD === The addition of donepezil with existing ADHD medications has shown mixed results. In those with Tourette syndrome and ADHD, donepezil may reduce tics while it had no effect on ADHD's symptoms. === Pervasive developmental disorder === Donepezil, along with other cholinesterase inhibitors, is suggested as having potential for trouble behaviors: irritability, hyperactivity, and difficulty in social communication which are typically seen in those with pervasive developmental disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and autism-spectrum disorder. === Anorexia nervosa === Donepezil is furthermore suggested as a feasible therapeutic option for anorexia nervosa. Emerging literature reports that a subset of patients suffering from restrictive anorexia nervosa have enhanced habit formation compared with healthy controls. Habit formation is modulated by striatal cholinergic interneurons. Based on the physiopathology of anorexia nervosa, namely in terms of cholinergic deficiencies, the effects of donepezil and other drugs that act as cholinesterase inhibitors could thus be effective in the treatment of the disorder. However, no trial to date supports this hypothesis. == References == == Further reading == Brenner GD, Brenner GM (2000). Pharmacology. Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders. ISBN 978-0-7216-7757-6.

3928,"('Oxazepam', 'Tazepam', 'Serax', 'Adumbran', 'Droxacepam')",Medical,"Oxazepam is a short-to-intermediate-acting benzodiazepine. Oxazepam is used for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and to control symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It is a metabolite of diazepam, prazepam, and temazepam, and has moderate amnesic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties compared to other benzodiazepines. It was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964. == Medical uses == Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine with a slow onset of action, so it is usually prescribed to individuals who have trouble staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. It is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders with associated tension, irritability, and agitation. It is also prescribed for drug and alcohol withdrawal, and for anxiety associated with depression. Oxazepam is sometimes prescribed off-label to treat social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and other conditions. == Side effects == The side effects of oxazepam are similar to those of other benzodiazepines, and may include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, memory impairment, paradoxical excitement, and anterograde amnesia, but does not affect transient global amnesia. Withdrawal effects due to rapid decreases in dosage or abrupt discontinuation of oxazepam may include abdominal and muscle cramps, seizures, depression, insomnia, sweating, tremors, or nausea and vomiting. In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. === Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal === Oxazepam, as with other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause tolerance, physical dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from oxazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can occur, though, at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen. == Contraindications == Oxazepam is contraindicated in myasthenia gravis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and limited pulmonary reserve, as well as severe hepatic disease. == Special precautions == Benzodiazepines require special precautions if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Benzodiazepines including oxazepam are lipophilic drugs and rapidly penetrate membranes, so rapidly crosses over into the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in floppy infant syndrome. === Pregnancy === Oxazepam, when taken during the third trimester, causes a definite risk to the neonate, including a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including hypotonia, reluctance to suck, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. == Interactions == As oxazepam is an active metabolite of diazepam, an overlap in possible interactions is likely with other drugs or food, with exception of the pharmacokinetic CYP450 interactions (e.g. with cimetidine). Precautions and following the prescription are required when taking oxazepam (or other benzodiazepines) in combinations with antidepressants or opioids. Concurrent use of these medications can interact in a way that is difficult to predict. Drinking alcohol when taking oxazepam is not recommended. Concomitant use of oxazepam and alcohol can lead to increased sedation, memory impairment, ataxia, decreased muscle tone, and, in severe cases or in predisposed patients, respiratory depression and coma. == Overdose == Oxazepam is generally less toxic in overdose than other benzodiazepines. Important factors which affect the severity of a benzodiazepine overdose include the dose ingested, the age of the patient, and health status prior to overdose. Benzodiazepine overdoses can be much more dangerous if a coingestion of other CNS depressants such as opiates or alcohol has occurred. Symptoms of an oxazepam overdose include: Respiratory depression Excessive somnolence Altered consciousness Central nervous system depression Occasionally cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity Rarely, deep coma == Pharmacology == Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine of the 3-hydroxy family; it acts on benzodiazepine receptors, resulting in increased effect of GABA to the GABAA receptor which results in inhibitory effects on the central nervous system. The half-life of oxazepam is between 6 and 9 hours. It has been shown to suppress cortisol levels. Oxazepam is the most slowly absorbed and has the slowest onset of action of all the common benzodiazepines according to one British study. Oxazepam is an active metabolite formed during the breakdown of diazepam, nordazepam, and certain similar drugs. It may be safer than many other benzodiazepines in patients with impaired liver function because it does not require hepatic oxidation, but rather, it is simply metabolized by glucuronidation, so oxazepam is less likely to accumulate and cause adverse reactions in the elderly or people with liver disease. Oxazepam is similar to lorazepam in this respect. Preferential storage of oxazepam occurs in some organs, including the heart of the neonate. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the neonate, and withdrawal of oxazepam during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as oxazepam is excreted in breast milk. Two milligrams of oxazepam equates to 1 mg of diazepam according to the benzodiazepine equivalency converter, therefore 20 mg of oxazepam according to BZD equivalency equates to 10 mg of diazepam and 15 mg oxazepam to 7.5 mg diazepam (rounded up to 8 mg of diazepam). Some BZD equivalency converters use 3 to 1 (oxazepam to diazepam), 1 to 3 (diazepam to oxazepam) as the ratio (3:1 and 1:3), so 15 mg of oxazepam would equate to 5 mg of diazepam. == Chemistry == Oxazepam exists as a racemic mixture. Early attempts to isolate enantiomers were unsuccessful; the corresponding acetate has been isolated as a single enantiomer. Given the different rates of epimerization that occur at different pH levels, it was determined that there would be no therapeutic benefit to the administration of a single enantiomer over the racemic mixture. == Frequency of use == Oxazepam, along with diazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam, were the four benzodiazepines listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and represented 82% of the benzodiazepine prescriptions in Australia in 1990–1991. It is in several countries the benzodiazepine of choice for novice users, due to a low chance of accumulation and a relatively slow absorption speed. == Society and culture == === Misuse === Oxazepam has the potential for misuse, defined as taking the drug to achieve a high, or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice. Benzodiazepines, including diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam, accounted for the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in Sweden from 1982 to 1986. During this time, a total of 52% of drug forgeries were for benzodiazepines, suggesting they were a major prescription drug class of abuse. However, due to its slow rate of absorption and its slow onset of action, oxazepam has a relatively low potential for abuse compared to some other benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, flunitrazepam, or triazolam. This is similar to the varied potential for abuse between different drugs of the barbiturate class. === Legal status === Oxazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. === Brand names === Oxazepam is marketed under many brand names worldwide, including: Alepam, Alepan, Anoxa, Anxiolit, Comedormir, durazepam, Murelax, Nozepam, Oksazepam, Opamox, Ox-Pam, Oxa-CT, Oxabenz, Oxamin, Oxapam, Oxapax, Oxascand, Oxaze, Oxazepam, Oxazépam, Oxazin, Oxepam, Praxiten, Purata, Selars, Serax, Serepax, Seresta, Séresta, Serpax, Sobril, Tazepam, Vaben, and Youfei. It is also marketed in combination with hyoscine as Novalona and in combination with alanine as Pausafrent T. === In popular culture === In Scrabble, ""Oxazepam"" is considered the third-highest scoring word, scoring 392 points when played in the ideal spot. == Environmental concerns == In 2013, a laboratory study which exposed European perch to oxazepam concentrations equivalent to those present in European rivers (1.8 μg/L) found that they exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate. In 2016, a follow-up study which exposed salmon smolt to oxazepam for seven days before letting them migrate observed increased intensity of migratory behaviour compared to controls. A 2019 study associated this faster, bolder behaviour in exposed smolt to increased mortality due to a higher likelihood of being predated on. On the other hand, a 2018 study from the same authors, which kept 480 European perch and 12 northern pikes in 12 ponds over 70 days, half of them control and half spiked with oxazepam, found no significant difference in either perch growth or mortality. However, it suggested that the latter could be explained by the exposed perch and pike being equally hampered by oxazepam, rather than the lack of an overall effect. Lastly, a 2021 study built on these results by comparing two whole lakes filled with perch and pikes - one control while the other was exposed to oxazepam 11 days into experiment, at concentrations between 11 and 24 μg/L, which is 200 times greater than the reported concentrations in the European rivers. Even so, there were no measurable effects on pike behaviour after the addition of oxazepam, while the effects on perch behaviour were found to be negligible. The authors concluded that the effects previously attributed to oxazepam were instead likely caused by a combination of fish being stressed by human handling and small aquaria, followed by being exposed to a novel environment. == References == == External links == Inchem - Oxazepam",Droxacepam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.12698721885681152), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.6939655542373657), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0235280804336071)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([minclinic.eu](https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/D/Droxacepam.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=9, title='MIN — what is Droxacepam used for, medicine in english, dosing, side effects, generic, general information, pharmacology, interactions, contraindications, precautions, overdose, medication, treatment.', type='url_citation', url='https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/D/Droxacepam.html?utm_source=openai')])"
3929,"('Pectin', 'Beta-d-galacturonic acid', '(2s,3r,4s,5r,6r)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyoxane-2-carboxylic acid', 'Oligogalacturonide', 'Galactopyranuronic acid, beta-d-')","Food, Medical","Pectin (Ancient Greek: πηκτικός pēktikós: ""congealed"" and ""curdled"") is a heteropolysaccharide, a structural polymer contained in the primary lamella, in the middle lamella, and in the cell walls of terrestrial plants. The principal chemical component of pectin is galacturonic acid (a sugar acid derived from galactose) which was isolated and described by Henri Braconnot in 1825. Commercially produced pectin is a white-to-light-brown powder, produced from citrus fruits for use as an edible gelling agent, especially in jams and jellies, dessert fillings, medications, and sweets; as a food stabiliser in fruit juices and milk drinks, and as a source of dietary fiber. == Biology == Pectin is composed of complex polysaccharides that are present in the primary cell walls of a plant, and are abundant in the green parts of terrestrial plants. Pectin is the principal component of the middle lamella, where it binds cells. Pectin is deposited by exocytosis into the cell wall via vesicles produced in the Golgi apparatus. The amount, structure and chemical composition of pectin is different among plants, within a plant over time, and in various parts of a plant. Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase, in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other. A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall. Pectin is a natural part of the human diet, but does not contribute significantly to nutrition. The daily intake of pectin from fruits and vegetables can be estimated to be around 5 g if approximately 500 g of fruits and vegetables are consumed per day. In human digestion, pectin binds to cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract and slows glucose absorption by trapping carbohydrates. Pectin is thus a soluble dietary fiber. In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice pectin has been shown to increase the incidence of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. A study found that after consumption of fruit the concentration of methanol in the human body increased by as much as an order of magnitude due to the degradation of natural pectin (which is esterified with methanol) in the colon. Pectin has been observed to have some function in repairing the DNA of some types of plant seeds, usually desert plants. Pectinaceous surface pellicles, which are rich in pectin, create a mucilage layer that holds in dew that helps the cell repair its DNA. Consumption of pectin has been shown to slightly (3–7%) reduce blood LDL cholesterol levels. The effect depends upon the source of pectin; apple and citrus pectins were more effective than orange pulp fibre pectin. The mechanism appears to be an increase of viscosity in the intestinal tract, leading to a reduced absorption of cholesterol from bile or food. In the large intestine and colon, microorganisms degrade pectin and liberate short-chain fatty acids that have a positive prebiotic effect. == Chemistry == Pectins, also known as pectic polysaccharides, are rich in galacturonic acid. Several distinct polysaccharides have been identified and characterised within the pectic group. Homogalacturonans are linear chains of α-(1–4)-linked D-galacturonic acid. Substituted galacturonans are characterised by the presence of saccharide appendant residues (such as D-xylose or D-apiose in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan) branching from a backbone of D-galacturonic acid residues. Rhamnogalacturonan I pectins (RG-I) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide: 4)-α-D-galacturonic acid-(1,2)-α-L-rhamnose-(1. From many of the rhamnose residues, sidechains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D-galactose, L-arabinose and D-xylose, with the types and proportions of neutral sugars varying with the origin of pectin. Another structural type of pectin is rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), which is a less frequent, complex, highly branched polysaccharide. Rhamnogalacturonan II is classified by some authors within the group of substituted galacturonans since the rhamnogalacturonan II backbone is made exclusively of D-galacturonic acid units. The molecular weight of isolated pectine greatly varies by the source and the method of isolation. Values have been reported as low as 28 kDa for apple pomace up to 753 kDa for sweet potato peels. In nature, around 80 percent of carboxyl groups of galacturonic acid are esterified with methanol. This proportion is decreased to a varying degree during pectin extraction. Pectins are classified as high- versus low-methoxy pectins (short HM-pectins versus LM-pectins), with more or less than half of all the galacturonic acid esterified. The ratio of esterified to non-esterified galacturonic acid determines the behaviour of pectin in food applications – HM-pectins can form a gel under acidic conditions in the presence of high sugar concentrations, while LM-pectins form gels by interaction with divalent cations, particularly Ca2+, according to the idealized 'egg box' model, in which ionic bridges are formed between calcium ions and the ionised carboxyl groups of the galacturonic acid. In high-methoxy pectins at soluble solids content above 60% and a pH value between 2.8 and 3.6, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions bind the individual pectin chains together. These bonds form as water is bound by sugar and forces pectin strands to stick together. These form a three-dimensional molecular net that creates the macromolecular gel. The gelling-mechanism is called a low-water-activity gel or sugar-acid-pectin gel. While low-methoxy pectins need calcium to form a gel, they can do so at lower soluble solids and higher pH than high-methoxy pectins. Normally low-methoxy pectins form gels with a range of pH from 2.6 to 7.0 and with a soluble solids content between 10 and 70%. The non-esterified galacturonic acid units can be either free acids (carboxyl groups) or salts with sodium, potassium, or calcium. The salts of partially esterified pectins are called pectinates, if the degree of esterification is below 5 percent the salts are called pectates, the insoluble acid form, pectic acid. Some plants, such as sugar beet, potatoes and pears, contain pectins with acetylated galacturonic acid in addition to methyl esters. Acetylation prevents gel-formation but increases the stabilising and emulsifying effects of pectin. Amidated pectin is a modified form of pectin. Here, some of the galacturonic acid is converted with ammonia to carboxylic acid amide. These pectins are more tolerant of varying calcium concentrations that occur in use. Thiolated pectin exhibits substantially improved gelling properties since this thiomer is able to crosslink via disulfide bond formation. These high gelling properties are advantageous for various pharmaceutical applications and applications in food industry. To prepare a pectin-gel, the ingredients are heated, dissolving the pectin. Upon cooling below gelling temperature, a gel starts to form. If gel formation is too strong, syneresis or a granular texture are the result, while weak gelling leads to excessively soft gels. Amidated pectins behave like low-ester pectins but need less calcium and are more tolerant of excess calcium. Also, gels from amidated pectin are thermoreversible; they can be heated and after cooling solidify again, whereas conventional pectin-gels will afterwards remain liquid. High-ester pectins set at higher temperatures than low-ester pectins. However, gelling reactions with calcium increase as the degree of esterification falls. Similarly, lower pH-values or higher soluble solids (normally sugars) increase gelling speeds. Suitable pectins can therefore be selected for jams and jellies, or for higher-sugar confectionery jellies. == Sources and production == Pears, apples, guavas, quince, plums, gooseberries, and oranges and other citrus fruits contain large amounts of pectin, while soft fruits, like cherries, grapes, and strawberries, contain small amounts of pectin. Typical levels of pectin in fresh fruits and vegetables are: Apples, 1–1.5% Apricots, 1% Cherries, 0.4% Oranges, 0.5–3.5% Carrots 1.4% Citrus peels, 30% Rose hips, 15% The main raw materials for pectin production are dried citrus peels or apple pomace, both by-products of juice production. Pomace from sugar beets is also used to a small extent. From these materials, pectin is extracted by adding hot dilute acid at pH values from 1.5 to 3.5. During several hours of extraction, the protopectin loses some of its branching and chain length and goes into solution. After filtering, the extract is concentrated in a vacuum and the pectin is then precipitated by adding ethanol or isopropanol. An old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used (apart from alcohols and polyvalent cations, pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents). Alcohol-precipitated pectin is then separated, washed, and dried. Treating the initial pectin with dilute acid leads to low-esterified pectins. When this process includes ammonium hydroxide (NH3(aq)), amidated pectins are obtained. After drying and milling, pectin is usually standardised with sugar, and sometimes calcium salts or organic acids, to optimise performance in a particular application. == Uses == The main use for pectin is as a gelling agent, thickening agent and stabiliser in food. In some countries, pectin is also available as a solution or an extract, or as a blended powder, for home jam making. The classical application is giving the jelly-like consistency to jams or marmalades, which would otherwise be sweet juices. Pectin also reduces syneresis in jams and marmalades and increases the gel strength of low-calorie jams. For household use, pectin is an ingredient in gelling sugar (also known as ""jam sugar"") where it is diluted to the right concentration with sugar and some citric acid to adjust pH. For various food applications, different kinds of pectins can be distinguished by their properties, such as acidity, degree of esterification, relative number of methoxyl groups in the molecules, etc. For instance, the term ""high methoxyl"" refers to pectins that have a large proportion of the carboxyl groups in the pectin molecule that are esterified with methanol, compared to low methoxyl pectins: high methoxyl pectins are defined as those with a degree of esterification equal to or above 50, are typically used in traditional jam and jelly making; such pectins require high sugar concentrations and acidic conditions to form gels, and provide a smooth texture and suitable to be used in bakery fillings and confectionery applications; low methoxyl pectins have a degree of esterification of less than 50, can be either amidated or non-amidated: the percentage level of substitution of the amide group, defined as the degree of amidation, defines the efficacy of a pectin; low methoxyl pectins can provide a range of textures and rheological properties, depending on the calcium concentration and the calcium reactivity of the pectin chosen—amidated low methoxyl pectins are generally thermoreversible, meaning they can form gels that can melt and reform, whereas non-amidated low methoxyl pectins can form thermostable gels that withstand high temperatures; these properties make low methoxyl pectins suitable for low sugar and sugar-free applications, dairy products, and stabilizing acidic protein drinks. For conventional jams and marmalades that contain above 60% sugar and soluble fruit solids, high-ester (high methoxyl) pectins are used. With low-ester (low methoxyl) pectins and amidated pectins, less sugar is needed, so that diet products can be made. Water extract of aiyu seeds is traditionally used in Taiwan to make aiyu jelly, where the extract gels without heating due to low-ester pectins from the seeds and the bivalent cations from the water. Pectin is used in confectionery jellies to give a good gel structure, a clean bite and to confer a good flavour release. Pectin can also be used to stabilise acidic protein drinks, such as drinking yogurt, to improve the mouth-feel and the pulp stability in juice based drinks and as a fat substitute in baked goods. Typical levels of pectin used as a food additive are between 0.5 and 1.0% – this is about the same amount of pectin as in fresh fruit. In medicine, pectin increases viscosity and volume of stool so that it is used against constipation and diarrhea. Until 2002, it was one of the main ingredients used in Kaopectate – a medication to combat diarrhea – along with kaolinite. It has been used in gentle heavy metal removal from biological systems. Pectin is also used in throat lozenges as a demulcent. In cosmetic products, pectin acts as a stabiliser. Pectin is also used in wound healing preparations and speciality medical adhesives, such as colostomy devices. Sriamornsak revealed that pectin could be used in various oral drug delivery platforms, e.g., controlled release systems, gastro-retentive systems, colon-specific delivery systems and mucoadhesive delivery systems, according to its intoxicity and low cost. It was found that pectin from different sources provides different gelling abilities, due to variations in molecular size and chemical composition. Like other natural polymers, a major problem with pectin is inconsistency in reproducibility between samples, which may result in poor reproducibility in drug delivery characteristics. In ruminant nutrition, depending on the extent of lignification of the cell wall, pectin is up to 90% digestible by bacterial enzymes. Ruminant nutritionists recommend that the digestibility and energy concentration in forages be improved by increasing pectin concentration in the forage. In cigars, pectin is considered an excellent substitute for vegetable glue and many cigar smokers and collectors use pectin for repairing damaged tobacco leaves on their cigars. Yablokov et al., writing in Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment, quote research conducted by the Ukrainian Center of Radiation Medicine and the Belarusian Institute of Radiation Medicine and Endocrinology, concluded, regarding pectin's radioprotective effects, that ""adding pectin preparations to the food of inhabitants of the Chernobyl-contaminated regions promotes an effective excretion of incorporated radionuclides"" such as cesium-137. The authors reported on the positive results of using pectin food additive preparations in a number of clinical studies conducted on children in severely polluted areas, with up to 50% improvement over control groups. During the Second World War, Allied pilots were provided with maps printed on silk, for navigation in escape and evasion efforts. The printing process at first proved nearly impossible because the several layers of ink immediately ran, blurring outlines and rendering place names illegible until the inventor of the maps, Clayton Hutton, mixed a little pectin with the ink and at once the pectin coagulated the ink and prevented it from running, allowing small topographic features to be clearly visible. == Legal status == At the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee Report on Food Additives and in the European Union, no numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) has been set, as pectin is considered safe. The European Union (EU) has not set a daily intake limit for two types of pectin, known as E440(i) and Amidated Pectin E440(ii). The EU has established purity standards for these additives in the EU Commission Regulation (EU)/231/2012. Pectin can be used as needed in most food categories, a concept referred to as ""quantum satis"". The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) conducted a re-evaluation of Pectin E440(i) and Amidated Pectin E440(ii) in 2017. The EFSA concluded that the use of these food additives poses no safety concern for the general population. Furthermore, the agency stated that it is not necessary to establish a numerical value for the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). In the United States, pectin is generally recognised as safe for human consumption. In the International Numbering System (INS), pectin has the number 440. In Europe, pectins are differentiated into the E numbers E440(i) for non-amidated pectins and E440(ii) for amidated pectins. There are specifications in all national and international legislation defining its quality and regulating its use. == History == Pectin was first isolated and described in 1825 by Henri Braconnot, though the action of pectin to make jams and marmalades was known long before. To obtain well-set jams from fruits that had little or only poor quality pectin, pectin-rich fruits or their extracts were mixed into the recipe. During the Industrial Revolution, the makers of fruit preserves turned to producers of apple juice to obtain dried apple pomace that was cooked to extract pectin. Later, in the 1920s and 1930s, factories were built that commercially extracted pectin from dried apple pomace, and later citrus peel, in regions that produced apple juice in both the US and Europe. Pectin was first sold as a liquid extract, but is now most often used as dried powder, which is easier than a liquid to store and handle. == See also == Fruit snacks == References == == External links == Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA) Online Database; A list of permitted uses of pectin, further link to the JECFA (...) specification of pectin.

3930,"('Ethionamide', 'Ethioniamide', 'Ethyonomide', 'Amidazine', 'Ethinamide')",Medical,"Ethionamide is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, to treat active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It is no longer recommended for leprosy. It is taken by mouth. Ethionamide has a high rate of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Serious side effects may include liver inflammation and depression. It should not be used in people with significant liver problems. Use in pregnancy is not recommended as safety is unclear. Ethionamide is in the thioamides family of medications. It is believed to work by interfering with the use of mycolic acid. Ethionamide was discovered in 1956 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Ethionamide is used in combination with other antituberculosis agents as part of a second-line regimen for active tuberculosis. Ethionamide is well absorbed orally with or without food, but is often administered with food to improve tolerance. It crosses the blood brain barrier to achieve concentrations in the cerebral-spinal fluid equivalent to plasma. The antimicrobial spectrum of ethionamide includes M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. smegmatis. It also is used rarely against infections with M. leprae and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as M. avium and M. kansasii. While working in a similar manner to isoniazid, cross resistance is only seen in 13% of strains, since they are both prodrugs but activated by different pathways. Resistance can emerge from mutations in ethA, which is needed to activate the drug, or ethR, which can be overexpressed to repress ethA. Mutations in inhA or the promoter of inhA can also lead to resistance through changing the binding site or overexpression. The FDA has placed it in pregnancy category C, because it has caused birth defects in animal studies. It is not known whether ethionamide is excreted into breast milk. == Adverse effects == Ethionamide frequently causes gastrointestinal distress with nausea and vomiting which can lead patients to stop taking it. This can sometimes be improved by taking it with food. Ethionamide can cause hepatocellular toxicity and is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment. Patients on ethionamide should have regular monitoring of their liver function tests. Liver toxicity occurs in up to 5% of patients and follows a pattern similar to isoniazid, usually arising in the first 1 to 3 months of therapy, but can occur even after more than 6 months of therapy. The pattern of liver function test derangement is often a rise in the ALT and AST. Both central neurological side effects such as psychiatric disturbances and encephalopathy, along with peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Administering pyridoxine along with ethionamide may reduce these effects and is recommended. Ethionamide is structurally similar to methimazole, which is used to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, and has been linked to hypothyroidism in several TB patients. Periodic monitoring of thyroid function while on ethionamide is recommended. === Interactions === Ethionamide may worsen the adverse effects of other antituberculous drugs being taken at the same time. It boosts levels of isoniazid when taken together and can lead to increased rates of peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. When taken with cycloserine, seizures have been reported. High rates of hepatotoxicty have been reported when taken with rifampicin. The drug's labeling cautions against excessive alcohol ingestion as it may provoke a psychotic reaction. == Mechanism of action == Ethionamide is a prodrug which is activated by the enzyme ethA, a mono-oxygenase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then binds NAD+ to form an adduct which inhibits InhA in the same way as isoniazid. The mechanism of action is thought to be through disruption of mycolic acid. Expression of the ethA gene is controlled by ethR, a transcriptional repressor. It is thought that improving ethA expression will increase the efficacy of ethionamide and prompting interest by drug developers in EthR inhibitors as a co-drug. == Other names == 1314 2-ethylisothionicotinamide amidazine thioamide iridocin It is sold under the brand name Trecator by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals which was purchased by Pfizer in 2009. == References == == External links == ""Ethionamide"".

3931,"('Etambutol', 'Tibutol', 'Diambutol', 'Ethambutol, racemic mixture', 'Purderal')",Medical,"Ethambutol (EMB, E) is a medication primarily used to treat tuberculosis. It is usually given in combination with other tuberculosis medications, such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. It may also be used to treat Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include problems with vision, joint pain, nausea, headaches, and feeling tired. Other side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people with optic neuritis, significant kidney problems, or under the age of five. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been found to cause harm. In the United States the FDA has raised concerns about eye issues in the baby if used during pregnancy. Ethambutol is believed to work by interfering with the bacteria's metabolism. Ethambutol was discovered in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and is available as a generic medication. == Chirality and biological activity == (S,S)-(+)-Ethambutol is powerful and selective antitubercular drug. It is a typical example of an old drug that was introduced for clinical use in its unichiral form. Ethambutol contains two constitutionally symmetrical chiral centers in its structure and exists in three stereoisomeric forms, the enantiomeric pair (+)-(S,S)- and (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol, along with the achiral stereoisomer called meso-form. The (+)-(S,S)-enantiomer harbors the antitubercular activity. This enantiomer is 500 and 12 fold more potent than (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol and the meso-form respectively. On the other hand, all the three isomers are equipotent in terms of the major side-effect of the drug, optic neuritis. Toxicity is associated to both dose and duration of treatment. Hence the use of (S,S)-enantiomer greatly improved the risk/benefit balance. == Medical uses == Ethambutol is used along with other medications to treat a number of infections including: tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. == Adverse effects == Optic neuritis (hence contraindicated in children below six years of age) Red–green color blindness People taking ethambutol should be monitored for changes in visual acuity and color discrimination. Arthralgia Hyperuricaemia Vertical nystagmus Skin rash == Mechanism of action == Ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing TB bacilli. It works by obstructing the formation of cell wall. Mycolic acids attach to the 5'-hydroxyl groups of D-arabinose residues of arabinogalactan and form mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the cell wall. It disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. Disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads to increased permeability of the cell wall. == Pharmacokinetics == It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and well distributed in body tissues and fluids. 50% is excreted unchanged in urine. == References ==",Diambutol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.7894584491150454e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007161913090385497)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.676292231422849e-05)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682550.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Ethambutol: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682550.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Unconfirmed epidemiologic evidence indicates that the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis might be increased by maternal use of macrolide antibiotics during the first two weeks of breastfeeding, but others have questioned this relationship. Clarithromycin is a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic used for a wide variety of mild-to-moderate bacterial infections. Clarithromycin has been linked to rare instances of acute liver injury that can be severe and even fatal.

She had a background of previous cataract removal with good visual resolution and no significant deficits in visual acuity. Notably, she had been taking sertraline and quinine concurrently. Her symptoms fully resolved 72 hours following cessation of clarithromycin therapy. Visual hallucinations associated with clarithromycin could be explained by recent research demonstrating clarithromycin increases neuronal excitability by inhibiting gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic signalling. Case reports of similar nature are rare, and we believe this report adds to a currently growing body of literature of visual hallucinations as a side effect of clarithromycin.","Clarithromycin-[13c,d3]",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007711059297434986), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018177354708313942)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.12692810595035553), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([szabo-scandic.com](https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/clarithromycin-13c-d3-cay26678-500?utm_source=openai), [bertin-bioreagent.com](https://www.bertin-bioreagent.com/clarithromycin-13c-d3/?utm_source=openai), [invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/product/V77147?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=294, start_index=6, title='Clarithromycin-13C-d3, CAS 2699608-30-3 (26678-500) | Szabo-Scandic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.szabo-scandic.com/en/clarithromycin-13c-d3-cay26678-500?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=294, start_index=6, title='Clarithromycin-13C-d3 - Antibiotics - CAT N°: 26678', type='url_citation', url='https://www.bertin-bioreagent.com/clarithromycin-13c-d3/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=294, start_index=6, title='Clarithromycin-13C,d3 (clarithromycin 13C-d3) | Bacterial | | Invivochem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/product/V77147?utm_source=openai')])"
3937,"('Paroxetine hydrochloride', 'Paroxetine hcl', 'Paroxat', 'Paxil', 'Seroxat')",Medical,"Paroxetine, sold under the brand name Paxil among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It has also been used in the treatment of premature ejaculation, and hot flashes due to menopause. It is taken orally (by mouth). Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, trouble sleeping, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. It is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of the chemical serotonin by neurons in the brain. Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. In 2018, it was in the top 10 of most prescribed antidepressants in the United States. == Medical uses == Paroxetine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It is also occasionally used for agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and menopausal hot flashes. === Depression === A variety of meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of paroxetine in depression. They have variously concluded that paroxetine is superior or equivalent to placebo and that it is equivalent to other antidepressants. Despite this, there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any point in time. === Anxiety disorders === Paroxetine was the first antidepressant approved in the United States for the treatment of panic disorder. Several studies have concluded that paroxetine is superior to placebo in the treatment of panic disorder. Paroxetine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults and children. It is also beneficial for people with co-occurring social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. It appears to be similar to a number of other SSRIs. Paroxetine is used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparative efficacy of paroxetine is equivalent to that of clomipramine and venlafaxine. Paroxetine is also effective for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Paroxetine is approved for the treatment of PTSD in the United States, Japan, and Europe. In the United States, it is approved for short-term use. Paroxetine is also FDA-approved for generalized anxiety disorder. === Menopausal hot flashes === In 2013, low-dose paroxetine was approved in the US for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause. At the low dose used for menopausal hot flashes, side effects are similar to placebo and dose tapering is not required for discontinuation. === Fibromyalgia === Studies have also shown paroxetine ""appears to be well-tolerated and improve the overall symptomatology in patients with fibromyalgia"", but is less robust in helping with the pain involved. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndromes may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. Paroxetine shares many of the common adverse effects of SSRIs, including (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%) diarrhea 12% (8%) constipation 14% (9%) dry mouth 18% (12%) somnolence 23% (9%) insomnia 13% (6%) headache 18% (17%) hypomania 1% (0.3%) blurred vision 4% (1%) loss of appetite 6% (2%) nervousness 5% (3%) paraesthesia 4% (2%) dizziness 13% (6%) asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)) tremor 8% (2%) sweating 11% (2%) sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, but a higher incidence of anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain. Due to reports of adverse withdrawal reactions upon terminating treatment, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use at the European Medicines Agency recommends gradually reducing over several weeks or months if the decision to withdraw is made. See also Discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal). Mania or hypomania may occur in 1% of patients with depression and up to 12% of patients with bipolar disorder. This side effect can occur in individuals with no history of mania, but it may be more likely to occur in those with bipolar disorder or with a family history of mania. Paroxetine is described as a 'hepatoxic agent' and has been associated with hepatoxicity and jaundice. === Suicide === Like other antidepressants, paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in people under the age of 25. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 and found an increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. In 2015, a paper published in The BMJ that reanalysed the original case notes argued that in Study 329, assessing paroxetine and imipramine against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for paroxetine. === Sexual dysfunction === Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, anorgasmia, lack of vaginal lubrication, and erectile dysfunction, is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with paroxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is higher than 70%. Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional. === Pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including paroxetine) is associated with shorter duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g or 2.6 oz), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that for pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, paroxetine ""be avoided, if possible"", as it may be associated with increased risk of birth defects. Babies born to women who used paroxetine during the first trimester have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations, primarily ventricular and atrial septal defects. Unless the benefits of paroxetine justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to stopping or switching to another antidepressant. Paroxetine use during pregnancy is associated with about 1.5– to 1.7-fold increase in congenital birth defects, in particular, heart defects, cleft lip and palate, clubbed feet, or any birth defects. === Discontinuation syndrome === Many psychoactive medications can cause withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation from administration. Paroxetine has among the highest incidence rates and severity of withdrawal syndrome of any medication of its class. Common withdrawal symptoms for paroxetine include nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo; insomnia, nightmares, and vivid dreams; feelings of electricity in the body, as well as rebound depression and anxiety. A liquid formulation of paroxetine is available and allows a very gradual decrease of the dose, which may prevent discontinuation syndrome. Another recommendation is to temporarily switch to fluoxetine, which has a longer half-life and thus decreases the severity of discontinuation syndrome. In 2002, the U.S. FDA published a warning regarding ""severe"" discontinuation symptoms among those terminating paroxetine treatment, including paraesthesia, nightmares, and dizziness. The agency also warned of case reports describing agitation, sweating, and nausea. In connection with a Glaxo spokesperson's statement that withdrawal reactions occur only in 0.2% of patients and are ""mild and short-lived"", the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations said GSK had breached two of the federation's codes of practice. Paroxetine prescribing information posted at GlaxoSmithKline has been updated related to the occurrence of a discontinuation syndrome, including serious discontinuation symptoms. == Overdose == Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia, and seizures. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of paroxetine may be measured to monitor therapeutic administration, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Plasma paroxetine concentrations are generally in a range of 40–400 μg/L in persons receiving daily therapeutic doses and 200–2,000 μg/L in poisoned patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 1–4 mg/L in acute lethal overdose situations. Along with the other SSRIs, sertraline and fluoxetine, paroxetine is considered a low-risk drug in cases of overdose. == Interactions == Interactions with other drugs acting on the serotonin system or impairing the metabolism of serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reaction. Such reactions have been observed with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, but particularly with concurrent use of triptans, MAO inhibitors, antipsychotics, or other dopamine antagonists. The prescribing information states that paroxetine should ""not be used in combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI"", and should not be used in combination with pimozide, thioridazine, tryptophan, or warfarin. Paroxetine interacts with the following cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP2D6 for which it is both a substrate and a potent inhibitor. CYP2B6 (strong) inhibitor. CYP3A4 (weak) inhibitor. CYP1A2 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C9 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C19 (weak) inhibitor. Paroxetine has been shown to be an inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Paroxetine is the most potent and one of the most specific selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It also binds to the allosteric site of the serotonin transporter, similarly to escitalopram, though less potently so. Paroxetine also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine to a lesser extent (<50 nmol/L). Based on evidence from four weeks of administration in rats, the equivalent of 20 mg paroxetine taken once daily occupies approximately 88% of serotonin transporters in the prefrontal cortex. Paroxetine is a phenylpiperidine and might have some affinity for opioid receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Paroxetine is well-absorbed following oral administration. It has an absolute bioavailability of about 50%, with evidence of a saturable first pass effect. When taken orally, it achieves maximum concentration in about 6–10 hours and reaches steady-state in 7–14 days. Paroxetine exhibits significant interindividual variations in volume of distribution and clearance. Less than 2% of an oral dose is excreted in urine unchanged. Paroxetine is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2D6. == Society and culture == Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. GlaxoSmithKline has paid substantial fines, paid settlements in class-action lawsuits, and become the subject of several highly critical books about its marketing of paroxetine, in particular, the off-label marketing of paroxetine for children, the suppression of negative research results relating to its use in children, and allegations that it failed to warn consumers of substantial withdrawal effects associated with the use of the drug. === Marketing === In 2004, GSK agreed to settle charges of consumer fraud for $2.5 million. The legal discovery process also uncovered evidence of deliberate, systematic suppression of unfavorable Paxil research results. One of GSK's internal documents read, ""It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy [in children] had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine"". In 2012, the United States Department of Justice fined GlaxoSmithKline $3 billion for withholding data, unlawfully promoting use in those under 18, and preparing an article that misleadingly reported the effects of paroxetine in adolescents with depression following its clinical trial study 329. In February 2016, the UK Competition and Markets Authority imposed record fines of £45 million on companies that were found to have infringed European Union and UK Competition law by entering into agreements to delay the market entry of generic versions of the drug in the UK. GlaxoSmithKline received the bulk of the fines, being fined £37,600,757. Other companies that produce generics were issued fines which collectively total £7,384,146. UK public health services are likely to claim damages for being overcharged in the period where the generic versions of the drug were illegally blocked from the market, as the generics are over 70% less expensive. GlaxoSmithKline may also face actions from other generic manufacturers who incurred losses as a result of the anticompetitive conduct. In April 2016, appeals were lodged with the Competition Appeal Tribunal by the companies which were fined. GSK marketed paroxetine through television advertisements in the 1990s and 2000s. Commercials also aired for the CR version of the drug beginning in 2003. === Economics === In 2007, paroxetine was ranked 94th on the list of bestselling drugs, with over $1 billion in sales. In 2006, paroxetine was the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. retail market, with more than 19.7 million prescriptions. In 2007, sales had dropped slightly to 18.1 million but paroxetine remained the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. === Brand names === Brand names include Aropax, Paretin, Brisdelle, Deroxat, Paxil, Pexeva, Paxtine, Paxetin, Paroxat, Paraxyl, Sereupin, Daparox and Seroxat. == Research == Several studies have suggested that paroxetine can be used in the treatment of premature ejaculation. In particular, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was found to increase 6- to 13-fold, which was somewhat longer than the delay achieved by the treatment with other SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram). However, paroxetine taken acutely (""on demand"") 3–10 hours before coitus resulted only in a ""clinically irrelevant and sexually unsatisfactory"" 1.5-fold delay of ejaculation and was inferior to clomipramine, which induced a fourfold delay. There is also evidence that paroxetine may be effective in the treatment of compulsive gambling and hot flashes. Benefits of paroxetine prescription for diabetic neuropathy or chronic tension headache are uncertain. Although the evidence is conflicting, paroxetine may be effective for the treatment of dysthymia, a chronic disorder involving depressive symptoms for most days of the year. There is evidence to support that paroxetine selectively binds to and inhibits G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in mice with heart failure. Since GRK2 regulates the activity of the beta adrenergic receptor, which becomes desensitized in cases of heart failure, paroxetine (or a paroxetine derivative) could be used as a heart failure treatment in the future. Paroxetine has been identified as a potential disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug. == Veterinary use == Paroxetine may be useful in the treatment of canine or feline behavioral diagnoses and is effective in the treatment of social anxiety, depression, and agitation associated with depression. == Other organisms == Paroxetine is a common finding in wastewater. It is highly toxic to the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (syn. Raphidocelis subcapitata). It also is toxic to the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Alberca et al., 2016 found that paroxetine acts as a trypanocide against T. cruzi. Alberca et al., 2016 finds a leishmanicide effect. Alberca finds that paroxetine produces cell death of the promastigotes of L. infantum. The mechanism of action remains unknown. Various types of bacteria can break down paroxetine in the environment. These include, for example Pseudomonas sp., Bosea sp., Shewanella sp., Species of Chitinophagaceae and Acinetobacter sp. == References == == External links == Media related to Paroxetine at Wikimedia Commons",Seroxat,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.688703772146255e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004374024283606559)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is sold as a racemate by Pfizer under the tradenames Petinutin (Switzerland) and Celontin (United States).

3939,"('Gnoscopine', '(s,r)-noscapine', 'Narcotine', 'Alpha-gnoscopine', 'Narcotine alkaloid')",Medical,"Noscapine, also known as narcotine, nectodon, nospen, anarcotine and (archaic) opiane, is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid of the phthalideisoquinoline structural subgroup, which has been isolated from numerous species of the family Papaveraceae (poppy family). It lacks effects associated with opioids such as sedation, euphoria, or analgesia (pain-relief) and lacks addictive potential. Noscapine is primarily used for its antitussive (cough-suppressing) effects. == Medical uses == Noscapine is often used as an antitussive medication. A 2012 Dutch guideline, however, does not recommend its use for acute coughing. == Side effects == Nausea Vomiting Loss of coordination Hallucinations (auditory and visual) Loss of sexual drive Swelling of prostate Loss of appetite Dilated pupils Increased heart rate Shaking and muscle spasms Chest pain Increased alertness Increased wakefulness Loss of stereoscopic vision == Interactions == Noscapine can increase the effects of centrally sedating substances such as alcohol and hypnotics. The drug should not be taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as unknown and potentially fatal effects may occur. Noscapine should not be taken in conjunction with warfarin as the anticoagulant effects of warfarin may be increased. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of noscapine in P. somniferum begins with chorismic acid, which is synthesized via the shikimate pathway from erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate. Chorismic acid is a precursor to the amino acid tyrosine, the source of nitrogen in benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Tyrosine can undergo a PLP-mediated transamination to form 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (4-HPP), followed by a TPP-mediated decarboxylation to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). Tyrosine can also be hydroxylated to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), followed by a PLP-mediated decarboxylation to form dopamine. Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) catalyzes a Pictet-Spengler reaction between 4-HPAA and dopamine to synthesize (S)-norcoclaurine, providing the characteristic benzylisoquinoline scaffold. (S)-Norcoclaurine is sequentially 6-O-methylated (6OMT), N-methylated (CNMT), 3-hydroxylated (NMCH), and 4′-O-methylated (4′OMT), with the use of cofactors S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) and NADP+ for methylations and hydroxylations, respectively. These reactions produce (S)-reticuline, a key branchpoint intermediate in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. The remainder of the noscapine biosynthetic pathway is largely governed by a single biosynthetic 10-gene cluster. Genes comprising the cluster encode enzymes responsible for nine of the eleven remaining chemical transformations. First, berberine bridge enzyme (BBE), an enzyme not encoded by the cluster, forms the fused four-ring structure in (S)-scoulerine. BBE uses O2 as an oxidant and is aided by cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Next, an O-methyltransferase (SOMT) methylates the 9-hydroxyl group. Canadine synthase (CAS) catalyzes the formation of a unique C2-C3 methylenedioxy bridge in (S)-canadine. An N-methylation (TNMT) and two hydroxylations (CYP82Y1, CYP82X2) follow, aided by SAM and O2/NADPH, respectively. The C13 alcohol is then acetylated by an acetyltransferase (AT1) using acetyl-CoA. Another cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP82X1) catalyzes the hydroxylation of C8, and the newly formed hemiaminal spontaneously cleaves, yielding a tertiary amine and aldehyde. A methyltransferase heterodimer (OMT2:OMT3) catalyzes a SAM-mediated O-methylation on C4′. The O-acetyl group is then cleaved by a carboxylesterase (CXE1), yielding an alcohol which immediately reacts with the neighboring C1 aldehyde to form a hemiacetal in a new five-membered ring. The apparent counteractivity between AT1 and CXE1 suggests that acetylation in this context is employed as a protective group, preventing hemiacetal formation until the ester is enzymatically cleaved. Finally, an NAD+-dependent short-chain dehydrogenase (NOS) oxidizes the hemiacetal to a lactone, completing noscapine biosynthesis. == Mechanism of action == Noscapine's antitussive effects appear to be primarily mediated by its σ–receptor agonist activity. Evidence for this mechanism is suggested by experimental evidence in rats. Pretreatment with rimcazole, a σ-specific antagonist, causes a dose-dependent reduction in antitussive activity of noscapine. Noscapine, and its synthetic derivatives called noscapinoids, are known to interact with microtubules and inhibit cancer cell proliferation == Structure analysis == The lactone ring is unstable and opens in basic media. The opposite reaction is presented in acidic media. The bond (C1−C3′) connecting the two optically active carbon atoms is also unstable. In aqueous solution of sulfuric acid and heating it dissociates into cotarnine (4-methoxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]isoquinoline) and opic acid (6-formyl-2,3-dimethoxybenzoic acid). When noscapine is reduced with zinc/HCl, the bond C1−C3′ saturates and the molecule dissociates into hydrocotarnine (2-hydroxycotarnine) and meconine (6,7-dimethoxyisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one). == History == Noscapine was first isolated and characterized in chemical breakdown and properties in 1803 under the denomination of ""Narcotine"" by Jean-Francois Derosne, a French chemist in Paris. Then Pierre-Jean Robiquet, another French chemist, proved narcotine and morphine to be distinct alkaloids in 1831. Finally, Pierre-Jean Robiquet conducted over 20 years between 1815 and 1835 a series of studies in the enhancement of methods for the isolation of morphine, and also isolated in 1832 another very important component of raw opium, that he called codeine, currently a widely used opium-derived compound. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === There are anecdotal reports of the recreational use of over-the-counter drugs in several countries, being readily available from local pharmacies without a prescription. The effects, beginning around 45 to 120 minutes after consumption, are similar to dextromethorphan and alcohol intoxication. Unlike dextromethorphan, noscapine is not an NMDA receptor antagonist. === Noscapine in heroin === Noscapine can survive the manufacturing processes of heroin and can be found in street heroin. This is useful for law enforcement agencies, as the amounts of contaminants can identify the source of seized drugs. In 2005 in Liège, Belgium, the average noscapine concentration was around 8%. Noscapine has also been used to identify drug users who are taking street heroin at the same time as prescribed diamorphine. Since the diamorphine in street heroin is the same as the pharmaceutical diamorphine, examination of the contaminants is the only way to test whether street heroin has been used. Other contaminants used in urine samples alongside noscapine include papaverine and acetylcodeine. Noscapine is metabolised by the body, and is itself rarely found in urine, instead being present as the primary metabolites, cotarnine and meconine. Detection is performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) but can also use a variety of other analytical techniques. == Research == === Clinical trials === The efficacy of noscapine in the treatment of certain hematological malignancies has been explored in the clinic. Polyploidy induction by noscapine has been observed in vitro in human lymphocytes at high dose levels (>30 μM); however, low-level systemic exposure, e.g. with cough medications, does not appear to present a genotoxic hazard. The mechanism of polyploidy induction by noscapine is suggested to involve either chromosome spindle apparatus damage or cell fusion. === Noscapine biosynthesis reconstitution === Many of the enzymes in the noscapine biosynthetic pathway was elucidated by the discovery of a 10 gene ""operon-like cluster"" named HN1. In 2016, the biosynthetic pathway of noscapine was reconstituted in yeast cells, allowing the drug to be synthesised without the requirement of harvest and purification from plant material. In 2018, the entire noscapine pathway was reconstituted and produced in yeast from simple molecules. In addition, protein expression was optimised in yeast, allowing production of noscapine to be improved 18,000 fold. It is hoped that this technology could be used to produce pharmaceutical alkaloids such as noscapine which are currently expressed at too low a yield in plantae to be mass-produced, allowing them to become marketable therapeutic drugs. === Anticancer derivatives === Noscapine is itself an antimitotic agent, therefore its analogs have great potential as novel anti-cancer drugs. Analogs having significant cytotoxic effects through modified 1,3-benzodioxole moiety have been developed. Similarly, N-alkyl amine, 1,3-diynyl, 9-vinyl-phenyl and 9-arylimino derivatives of noscapine have also been developed. Their mechanism of action is through tubulin inhibition. === Anti-inflammatory effects === Various studies have indicated that noscapine has anti-inflammatory effects and significantly reduces the levels of proinflammatory factors such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IFN-c, and IL-6. In this regard, in another study, Khakpour et al. examined the effect of noscapine against carrageenan-induced inflammation in rats. They found that noscapine at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight in three hours after the injection has the most anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, they showed that the amount of inflammation reduction at this dose of noscapine is approximately equal to indomethacin, a standard anti-inflammatory medication. Furthermore, Shiri et al. concluded that noscapine prevented the progression of bradykinin-induced inflammation in the rat's foot by antagonising bradykinin receptors. In addition, Zughaier et al. evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of brominated noscapine. The brominated form of noscapine has been shown to inhibit the secretion of the cytokine TNF-α and the chemokine CXCL10 from macrophages, thereby reducing inflammation without affecting macrophage survival. Furthermore, the bromated derivative of noscapine has about 5 to 40 times more potent effects than noscapine. Again, this brominated derivative also inhibits toll-like receptors (TLR), TNF-α, and nitric oxide (NO) in human and mouse macrophages without causing toxicity. == See also == Cough syrup Codeine; Pholcodine Dextromethorphan; Dimemorfan Racemorphan; Dextrorphan; Levorphanol Butamirate Pentoxyverine Tipepidine Cloperastine Levocloperastine Narceine, a related opium alkaloid. == References ==",Narcotine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -1.4617256056226324e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.4741181433200836), (' FOOD', -0.007432223297655582)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0005615564878098667), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.313319593667984), ('ĠEND', -0.8027280569076538), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.9802276912960224e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07894372940063477)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.31467270851135254), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.023246292024850845), (' FOOD', -0.0011703446507453918)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noscapine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Noscapine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noscapine?utm_source=openai')])"

Noscapine hydrochloride showed faster absorption and gave a higher peak concentration than the embonate. The average bioavailability of the embonates was 71% of that of the noscapine solution (p less than 0.05). No significant difference was observed when the embonate was administered with water, polyvidone and flavouring agents. Noscapine, an alkaloid from Papaver somniferum, widely used as an antitussive, is being clinically studied in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and a few other cancers primarily because of its anti-angiogenesis properties. With the advent of diverse application of noscapine, we sought to determine whether the radiolabeling method can be useful in studying uptake and kinetics of the molecule in-vivo. Specific objectives of this study were to radiolabel noscapine with Technetium-99m (Tc-99m), to determine its organ biodistribution in rat model and study its uptake kinetics in PCOS model. A method for radiolabeling noscapine with Tc-99m was standardized using stannous reduction method and its in vitro and in vivo stability parameters were studied. The radiopharmaceutical was also evaluated for blood kinetics and biodistribution profile. An animal model of PCOS was created by using antiprogesterone RU486 and uptake of 99mTc-noscapine in normal and PCOS ovaries was compared using gamma scintigraphy. Noscapine hydrochloride was successfully radiolabeled with Tc-99m with high labeling efficiency and in vitro stability. Most of the blood clearance of the drug (80%) took place in first hour after intravascular injection with maximum accumulation being observed in liver, spleen, kidney followed by the ovary. At 4 hours post injection, radiolabeled complex accumulation doubled in PCOS ovaries in rats (0.9 +/- 0.03% ID/whole organ) compared to normal cyclic rats (0.53 +/- 0.01% ID/whole organ). This observation was further strengthened by scintigraphic images of rats taken at different time intervals (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 24 h) where SPECT images suggested discrete accumulation in the PCOS ovaries. Through our study we report direct radiolabeling of noscapine and its biodistribution in various organs and specific uptake in PCOS that may show its utility for imaging ovarian pathology. The increased ovarian uptake in PCOS may be related to its receptor binding suggesting possible role of 99mTc-noscapine in PCOS diagnostics and therapeutics.",Noscapine (hydrochloride),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.173704271830502e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0009355935617350042), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.47428011894226074), ('ĠEND', -0.77072674036026), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038169361650943756)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.872261317563243e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noscapine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Noscapine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noscapine?utm_source=openai')])"
3941,"('Nordazepam', 'Nordiazepam', 'Desmethyldiazepam', 'Dealkylprazepam', 'Norprazepam')",Medical,"Nordazepam (INN; marketed under brand names Nordaz, Stilny, Madar, Vegesan, and Calmday; also known as nordiazepam, desoxydemoxepam, and desmethyldiazepam) is a 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative. Like other benzodiazepine derivatives, it has amnesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. However, it is used primarily in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It is an active metabolite of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, prazepam, pinazepam, and medazepam. Nordazepam is among the longest lasting (longest half-life) benzodiazepines, and its occurrence as a metabolite is responsible for most cumulative side-effects of its myriad of pro-drugs when they are used repeatedly at moderate-high doses; the nordazepam metabolite oxazepam is also active (and is a more potent, full BZD-site agonist), which contributes to nordazepam cumulative side-effects but occur too minutely to contribute to the cumulative side-effects of nordazepam pro-drugs (except when they are abused chronically in extremely supra-therapeutic doses). == Side effects == Common side effects of nordazepam include somnolence, which is more common in elderly patients and/or people on high-dose regimens. Hypotonia, which is much less common, is also associated with high doses and/or old age. == Contraindications and special caution == Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. As with many other drugs, changes in liver function associated with aging or diseases such as cirrhosis, may lead to impaired clearance of nordazepam. == Pharmacology == Nordazepam is a partial agonist at the GABAA receptor, which makes it less potent than other benzodiazepines, particularly in its amnesic and muscle-relaxing effects. Its elimination half life is between 36 and 200 hours, with wide variation among individuals; factors such as age and sex are known to impact it. The variation of reported half-lives are attributed to differences in nordazepam metabolism and that of its metabolites as nordazepam is hydroxylated to active metabolites such as oxazepam, before finally being glucuronidated and excreted in the urine. This can be attributed to extremely variable hepatic and renal metabolic functions among individuals depending upon a number of factors (including age, ethnicity, disease, and current or previous use/abuse of other drugs/medicines). == Chemistry == Nordazepam is similar to diazepam, except that the methyl group at the R1 position has been replaced with a hydrogen. Nordazepam can be synthesized with 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone and chloroacetyl chloride. Nordazepam itself can also be used in the synthesis of diazepam by methylating the R1 position using dimethyl sulfate. == Pregnancy and nursing mothers == Nordazepam, like other benzodiazepines, easily crosses the placental barrier, so the drug should not be administered during the first trimester of pregnancy. In case of serious medical reasons, nordazepam can be given in late pregnancy, but the fetus, due to the pharmacological action of the drug, may experience side effects such as hypothermia, hypotonia, and sometimes mild respiratory depression. Since nordazepam and other benzodiazepines are excreted in breast milk, the substance should not be administered to mothers who are breastfeeding. Discontinuing of breast-feeding is indicated for regular intake by the mother. == Recreational use == Nordazepam and other sedative-hypnotic drugs are detected frequently in cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting benzodiazepines are commonly used in doses higher than the recommended doses. == See also == Benzodiazepine Benzodiazepine dependence Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome Long-term effects of benzodiazepines == References == == External links == Inchem - Nordazepam",Desmethyldiazepam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5776860184123507e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00028725311858579516), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16026441752910614)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005530327325686812), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordazepam,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2960780/ ', [])"

Dex-21-Ac was administered twice weekly in three groups: bilateral injections, monocular injections, and a control group receiving the vehicle solution bilateral. After 21 days, enucleated eyes were examined using immunocytochemistry (ICC), and organ histology was performed. All groups receiving Dex-21-Ac injections had a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). Monocular injections also resulted in a significant increase in IOP in the fellow eye. The Dex-21-Ac-treated groups showed a bilateral increase in IOP of approximately 8 mmHg, accompanied by elevated expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and fibronectin in the anterior chamber angle. There were no significant changes in weight progression. Hepatic steatosis was observed in all Dex-21-Ac-treated animals, and some suffered from residual neuromuscular blockade under fentanyl anesthesia. Bilateral injections of Dex-21-Ac twice a week lead to a significant increase in daytime IOP and fibrotic changes in the trabecular meshwork. Unilateral application has a significant impact on the fellow eye. Local dexamethasone leads to notable systemic effects independent of changes in animal weight. Considering liver damage and associated influence on metabolization, hepatically eliminated injection anesthetics may lead to overdosing and are not recommended. They should be replaced by inhalation anesthesia. Intra-articular drug delivery systems still suffer from too short-lasting effects. Magnetic particles retained in the joint using an external magnetic field might prolong the local release of an anti-inflammatory drug. For the purpose, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and dexamethasone 21-acetate (DXM) were co-encapsulated into biodegradable microparticles. Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles embedding both SPIONs and DXM were prepared by a double emulsion technique. The formulation was optimized in two steps, a screening design and a full factorial design, aiming at 10-microm particle diameter and high DXM encapsulation efficacy. The most significant parameters were the polymer concentration, the stirring speed during solvent extraction and the extractive volume. Increasing the polymer concentration from 200 to 300 mg ml(-1), both the microparticle mean diameter and the DXM encapsulation efficacy increased up to 12 microm and 90%, respectively. The microparticles could be retained with an external magnet of 0.8 T placed at 3 mm. Faster DXM release was obtained for smaller microparticles. The experimental set-up offered the tools for tailoring a formulation with magnetic retention properties and DXM release patterns corresponding to the required specifications for intra-articular administration. Rapid fall in the amount of glucocorticoid cytosol receptor in target tissues is considered to be a consequence of the receptor translocation to nuclei. The effect of single injection of synthetic (dexamethasone 21-acetate) and natural (corticosterone) glucocorticoid on the depletion and replenishment of cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor in rat liver was compared. The effect of 20 micrograms dexamethasone 21-acetate on the extent and duration of the decrease of 3H-dexamethasone binding in cytosol was significantly higher than that of 100 micrograms corticosterone.

3945,"('Neostigmine bromide', 'Eustigmin bromide', 'Neoserine bromide', 'Kirkstigmine bromide', 'Neo-proserin')",Medical,"Neostigmine, sold under the brand name Bloxiverz, among others, is a medication used to treat myasthenia gravis, Ogilvie syndrome, and urinary retention without the presence of a blockage. It is also used in anaesthesia to end the effects of non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking medication. It is given by injection either into a vein, muscle, or under the skin. After injection effects are generally greatest within 30 minutes and last up to 4 hours. Common side effects include nausea, increased saliva, crampy abdominal pain, and slow heart rate. More severe side effects include low blood pressure, weakness, and allergic reactions. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Neostigmine is in the cholinergic family of medications. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholinesterase and therefore increases the levels of acetylcholine. Neostigmine was patented in 1931. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The term is from Greek neos, meaning ""new"", and ""-stigmine"", in reference to the alkaloid, physostigmine, which inspired its design. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == It is used to improve muscle tone in people with myasthenia gravis, and also to reverse the effects of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants such as rocuronium and vecuronium at the end of an operation. Another indication for use is the conservative management of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, or Ogilvie's syndrome, in which patients get massive colonic dilatation in the absence of a true mechanical obstruction. Neostigmine is often prescribed for underactive urinary bladder. Hospitals sometimes administer a solution containing neostigmine intravenously to delay the effects of envenomation through snakebite. Some promising research results have also been reported for administering the drug nasally in order to buy time if anti-venom is not immediately available. == Side effects == Neostigmine has a wide variety of side-effects due to its action that increases acetylcholine (ACh) binding muscarinic receptors on exocrine glandular cells throughout the body, cardiac muscle cells, and smooth muscle cells. These effects include: salivation, lacrimation, diarrhea, bradycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur earliest.: 109 For this reason, it is usually given along with an anti-cholinergic drug such as atropine or glycopyrrolate which act only on muscarinic receptors while permitting neostigmine action at nicotinic receptors. Neostigmine can also induce generic ocular side effects including: headache, brow pain, blurred vision, phacodonesis, pericorneal injection, congestive iritis, various allergic reactions, and rarely, retinal detachment.: 114 == Pharmacology == Acetylcholine is metabolized by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase that cleaves acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction into acetate and choline. Neostigmine is an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Neostigmine binds to the anionic and ester site of acetylcholinesterase, which blocks the enzyme from breaking down the acetylcholine molecules before they reach the postsynaptic membrane receptors. Its action leads to the accumulation of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction that compete with the non-depolarizing blocker agent bound to the acetylcholine receptors. By interfering with the breakdown of acetylcholine, neostigmine indirectly stimulates both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. Unlike physostigmine, neostigmine has a quaternary nitrogen; hence, it is more polar. It does not cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the CNS. Neostigmine is administered intravenously. The drug should be administered when a peripheral nerve stimulator shows a second twitch is present or when the first twitch response is considerably above 10% of baseline. Peak effect is at 7 to 10 minutes. Neostigmine has moderate duration of action – usually two to four hours. It is metabolized by enzymes in the liver and excreted in the urine. == Chemistry == Neostigmine, which can be viewed as a simplified analog of physostigmine, is made by reacting 3-dimethylaminophenol with N-dimethylcarbamoyl chloride, which forms the dimethylcarbamate, and its subsequent alkylation using dimethyl sulfate forming the desired compound. === Spectral data === Neostigmine shows notable UV/VIS absorption at 261 nm, 267 nm, and 225 nm. Neostigmine's 1H NMR Spectroscopy reveals shifts at: 7.8, 7.7, 7.4, 7.4, 3.8, and 3.1 parts per million. The higher shifts are due to the aromatic hydrogens. The lower shifts at 3.8 ppm and 3.1 ppm are due to the electronic withdrawing nature of the tertiary and quaternary nitrogen, respectively. == History == Neostigmine was first synthesized by Aeschlimann and Reinert in 1931 and was patented by Aeschlimann in 1933. Neostigmine is made by first reacting 3-dimethylaminophenol with N-dimethylcarbamoyl chloride, which forms a dimethylcarbamate. Next, that product is alkylated using dimethyl sulfate, which forms neostigmine.: 103 == References == == External links == ""Neostigmine"". Drug Information Portal.

It is a selective 5-HT1 receptor subtype agonist. It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 1997. == Medical uses == Naratriptan is used for the treatment of the acute migraine attacks and the symptoms of migraine, including severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound or light. === Efficacy === A meta-analysis of 53 clinical trials has shown that all triptans are effective for treating migraine at marketed doses and that naratriptan, although less effective than sumatriptan and rizatriptan was more effective than placebo in reducing migraine symptoms at two hours and efficacy was demonstrated in almost two thirds of subjects after four hours of treatment. == Side effects == Side effects are similar to other triptan medications, with the incidence of side effects reportedly being lower than sumatriptan, and side effects occurring rarely except when above 2.5mg. The risk of triptan side effects is also in general low, according to a systematic review. Side effects include: sensations of warmth/heat, dizziness, drowsiness, tingling of the hands or feet, nausea, dry mouth and unsteadiness, chest pain/pressure, throat pain/pressure, unusually fast/slow/irregular pulse, and mental/mood changes. The tingling and heaviness and sensation of warmth/heat is characteristic of selective 5-HT1 agonists. == Mechanism of action == The causes of migraine are not clearly understood; however, the efficacy of naratriptans and other triptans is believed to be due to their activity as 5-HT (serotonin) agonists. The biological and pharmacokinetic profile of naratriptan differs significantly from sumatriptan. == Society and culture == In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved naratriptan on February 11, 1998. It was covered by U.S. Patent no. 4997841; the FDA lists the patent as expiring on July 7, 2010. In July 2010, in the wake of the patent expiration, several drug manufacturers, including Roxane Labs, Sandoz and Teva Pharmaceuticals, announced that they were launching generic Naratriptan medications. The drug continued to be covered by European patent 0303507 in Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom through March 10, 2012, and by Australian patent 611469 in Australia through June 17, 2013. It had previously been covered by Canadian patent 1210968; but both Sandoz and Teva (formerly Novopharm) have offered generic equivalents in Canada since that patent's expiration December 1, 2009. On December 23, 2014, in response to a request from Health Canada, importers in Canada agreed to quarantine the importation of health products, including generic Naratriptan manufactured for both Sandoz and Teva, from Dr. Reddy's Laboratories in Srikakulam, India. Because Teva and Sandoz are the only approved suppliers of generic Naratriptan in Canada, the quarantine resulted in Naratriptan being placed on the Canadian drug shortage list.

The antiviral activity of MND is specific for HCMV over different both DNA and RNA viruses. Further experiments in HCMV-infected cells testing the effects of MND on viral DNA synthesis and viral proteins expression revealed that it halts the progression of the virus cycle prior to viral DNA replication and E genes expression, but after IE proteins expression. According to these results, we observed that the overall antiviral activity of MND involves a specific interference with the transactivating functions of the viral Immediate-Early 2 (IE-2) protein, an essential viral transcription factor required for the progression of HCMV replication. Given that the inhibitory concentration against HCMV is in the range of clinically relevant concentrations of MND in humans, and the mechanism of action differs from that of the other available therapeutics, this already approved drug is an attractive candidate for repurposing in alternative anti-HCMV therapeutic protocols. Microparticles of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) containing manidipine dihydrochloride (MAN) were successfully prepared by the simple emulsion/solvent evaporation method. All formulations showed loading efficiency rates greater than 80% and average particle size less than 8 μm. Formulations had spherical shape with smooth and porous surface for PCL and PHBV, respectively. According to Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, initial components were not chemically modified during microencapsulation. X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that this process led to drug amorphization. In vitro dissolution studies showed that all microparticles prolonged MAN release, mainly which one obtained using PCL that contained 5% of drug loaded (PCL-M5). Animal studies demonstrated that formulation PCL-M5 was able to keep the variation of mean arterial pressure after phenylephrine administration up to 24 hours. These data confirmed the sustained antihypertensive effect of the investigated microparticles. Results provided an experimental basis for using formulation PCL-M5 as a feasible carrier for oral controlled release of MAN intended for treating high blood pressure. Enantiomeric (+)- and (-)-manidipine (1) dihydrochlorides were synthesized by the esterification of the optically active monocarboxylic acids (-)-6 and (+)-6, respectively. The absolute configurations, (S)-(+)-1 and (R)-(-)-1, were unambiguously determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis of (+)-7 derived from (-)-6. The (S)-(+)-1 was about 30 and 80 times as potent as the (R)-(-)-isomer in antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and in the radioligand binding assay using [3H]nitrendipine, respectively.",Manidipine dihydrochloride,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2664456789934775e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008998635457828641), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.126964271068573)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D01553?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=72, start_index=9, title='KEGG DRUG: Manidipine hydrochloride', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D01553?utm_source=openai')])"

In this study, we synthesized the first Ni-based MX-Chain compound having hydroxy groups, i.e., [Ni(dabdOH) The kinetics and mechanisms of the oxidation of I (-) and Br (-) by trans-[Ru (VI)(N 2O 2)(O) 2] (2+) have been investigated in aqueous solutions. The reactions have the following stoichiometry: trans-[Ru (VI)(N 2O 2)(O) 2] (2+) + 3X (-) + 2H (+) --> trans-[Ru (IV)(N 2O 2)(O)(OH 2)] (2+) + X 3 (-) (X = Br, I). In the oxidation of I (-) the I 3 (-)is produced in two distinct phases. The first phase produces 45% of I 3 (-) with the rate law d[I 3 (-)]/dt = ( k a + k b[H (+)])[Ru (VI)][I (-)]. The remaining I 3 (-) is produced in the second phase which is much slower, and it follows first-order kinetics but the rate constant is independent of [I (-)], [H (+)], and ionic strength. In the proposed mechanism the first phase involves formation of a charge-transfer complex between Ru (VI) and I (-), which then undergoes a parallel acid-catalyzed oxygen atom transfer to produce [Ru (IV)(N 2O 2)(O)(OHI)] (2+), and a one electron transfer to give [Ru (V)(N 2O 2)(O)(OH)] (2+) and I (*). [Ru (V)(N 2O 2)(O)(OH)] (2+) is a stronger oxidant than [Ru (VI)(N 2O 2)(O) 2] (2+) and will rapidly oxidize another I (-) to I (*). In the second phase the [Ru (IV)(N 2O 2)(O)(OHI)] (2+) undergoes rate-limiting aquation to produce HOI which reacts rapidly with I (-) to produce I 2.

3949,"('Glycopyrrolate bromide', 'Glycopyrronium bromide', 'Robinul', 'Gastrodyn', 'Nodapton')",Medical,"Glycopyrronium bromide is a medication of the muscarinic anticholinergic group. It does not cross the blood–brain barrier and consequently has few to no central effects. It is given by mouth, via intravenous injection, on the skin, and via inhalation. It is a synthetic quaternary ammonium compound. The cation, which is the active moiety, is called glycopyrronium (INN) or glycopyrrolate (USAN). The most common side effects include irritability, flushing, nasal congestion, reduced secretions in the airways, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and urinary retention. In September 2012, glycopyrronium was approved for medical use in the European Union. In June 2018, glycopyrronium was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat excessive underarm sweating, becoming the first drug developed specifically to reduce excessive sweating. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Glycopyrronium was first used in 1961 to treat peptic ulcers. Since 1975, intravenous glycopyrronium has been used before surgery to reduce salivary, tracheobronchial, and pharyngeal secretions. It is also used in conjunction with neostigmine, a neuromuscular blocking reversal agent, to prevent neostigmine's muscarinic effects such as bradycardia. It can be administered to raise the heart rate in reflex bradycardia as a result of a vasovagal reaction, which often will also increase the blood pressure. It is also used to reduce excessive saliva (sialorrhea), and to treat Ménière's disease. It has been used topically and orally to treat hyperhidrosis, in particular, gustatory hyperhidrosis and generalized hyperhidrosis. When inhaled, it is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Doses for inhalation are much lower than oral ones, so that swallowing a dose will not have an effect. == Side effects == Dry mouth, urinary retention, headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and blurry vision are possible side effects of the medication. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Glycopyrronium competitively blocks muscarinic receptors, thus inhibiting cholinergic transmission. === Pharmacokinetics === Glycopyrronium bromide affects the gastrointestinal tracts, liver and kidney but has a very limited effect on the brain and the central nervous system. In horse studies, after a single intravenous infusion, the observed tendencies of glycopyrronium followed a tri-exponential equation, by rapid disappearance from the blood followed by a prolonged terminal phase. Excretion was mainly in urine and in the form of an unchanged drug. Glycopyrronium has a relatively slow diffusion rate, and in a standard comparison to atropine, is more resistant to penetration through the blood-brain barrier and placenta. == Research == It has been studied in asthma. == References ==",Nodapton,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.127333340875339e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01907002180814743), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005312255118042231)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
3950,"('Chlordiazepoxide', 'Methaminodiazepoxide', 'Librium', 'Chlordiazepoxid', 'Clopoxide')",Medical,"Chlordiazepoxide, sold under the brand name Librium among others, is a sedative and hypnotic medication of the benzodiazepine class. It is used to treat anxiety, insomnia and symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other drugs. Chlordiazepoxide has a medium to long half-life, while its active metabolite has a very long half-life. The drug has amnesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, hypnotic, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Chlordiazepoxide was patented in 1958 and approved for medical use in 1960. It was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized and the discovery of chlordiazepoxide was by pure chance. Chlordiazepoxide and other benzodiazepines were initially accepted with widespread public approval, but were followed with widespread public disapproval and recommendations for more restrictive medical guidelines for its use. == Medical uses == Chlordiazepoxide is indicated for the short-term (2–4 weeks) treatment of anxiety that is severe and disabling or subjecting the person to uncomfortable distress. It is also indicated as a treatment for the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It can sometimes be prescribed to ease symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) combined with clidinium bromide as a fixed dose medication, Librax. == Contraindications == Use of chlordiazepoxide should be avoided in individuals with the following conditions: Myasthenia gravis Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances Ataxia Severe hypoventilation Acute narrow-angle glaucoma Severe liver deficiencies (hepatitis and liver cirrhosis decrease elimination by a factor of 2) Severe sleep apnea Hypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the benzodiazepine class Chlordiazepoxide is generally considered an inappropriate benzodiazepine for the elderly due to its long elimination half-life and the risks of accumulation. Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, pregnancy, children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. === Pregnancy === The research into the safety of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is limited and it is recommended that use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy should be based on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. If chlordiazepoxide is used during pregnancy, the risks can be reduced via using the lowest effective dose and for the shortest time possible. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are considered to be among the safer benzodiazepines to use during pregnancy in comparison to other benzodiazepines. Possible adverse effects from benzodiazepine use during pregnancy include miscarriage, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, functional deficits, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Caution is also advised during breast feeding as chlordiazepoxide passes into breast milk. == Adverse effects == Sedative drugs and sleeping pills, including chlordiazepoxide, have been associated with an increased risk of death. The studies had many limitations, such as possible tendency to overestimate risk, possible confounding by indication with other risk factors and confusing hypnotics with drugs having other indications. Common side-effects of chlordiazepoxide include: Confusion Constipation Drowsiness Fainting Altered sex drive Liver problems Lack of muscle coordination Minor menstrual irregularities Nausea Skin rash or eruptions Swelling due to fluid retention Yellow eyes and skin Chlordiazepoxide in laboratory mice studies impairs latent learning. Benzodiazepines impair learning and memory via their action on benzodiazepine receptors, which causes a dysfunction in the cholinergic neuronal system in mice. It was later found that impairment in learning was caused by an increase in benzodiazepine/GABA activity (and that benzodiazepines were not associated with the cholinergic system). In tests of various benzodiazepine compounds, chlordiazepoxide was found to cause the most profound reduction in the turnover of 5HT (serotonin) in rats. Serotonin is closely involved in regulating mood and may be one of the causes of feelings of depression in rats using chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines. In September 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning for all benzodiazepine medicines to be updated to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. === Tolerance and dependence === ==== Tolerance ==== Chronic use of benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide, leads to the development of tolerance, with a decrease in number of benzodiazepine binding sites in mice forebrains. The Committee of Review of Medicines, who carried out an extensive review of benzodiazepines including chlordiazepoxide, found—and were in agreement with the US Institute of Medicine and the conclusions of a study carried out by the White House Office of Drug Policy and the US National Institute on Drug Abuse—that there was little evidence that long-term use of benzodiazepines was beneficial in the treatment of insomnia due to the development of tolerance. Benzodiazepines tended to lose their sleep-promoting properties within 3 to 14 days of continuous use, and in the treatment of anxiety the committee found that there was little convincing evidence that benzodiazepines retained efficacy in the treatment of anxiety after four months' continuous use due to the development of tolerance. ==== Dependence ==== Chlordiazepoxide can cause physical dependence and what is known as the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those seen with alcohol and barbiturates. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms becomes greater. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible through a slow and gradual dose-reduction regime. Chlordiazepoxide taken during pregnancy can cause a postnatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. === Overdose === An individual who has consumed excess chlordiazepoxide may display some of the following symptoms: Somnolence (difficulty staying awake) Mental confusion Hypotension Hypoventilation Impaired motor functions Impaired reflexes Impaired coordination Impaired balance Dizziness Muscle weakness Coma Chlordiazepoxide is typically used under controlled conditions for specific syndromes and sees far less frequent usage when compared to newer drugs of the same class and thus is unlikely to be encountered in a clinical emergency setting as a stand-alone drug causing life-threatening concern. Like other drugs in its class, chlordiazepoxide alongside benzodiazepines as a whole have a lowered potential to cause life-threatening injury - though this does not preclude their common co-contaminant discovery with other depressant drugs of abuse, nor their ability to contribute to an already potentially fatal episode of drug-induced respiratory depression. In cases of suspected overdose, supportive care and observation are most often indicated and provided incrementally in relation to severity and duration of symptoms. Flumazenil is uniquely poised as an ""antidote"" that specifically counteracts damaging central nervous system affect induced via benzodiazepine mechanism of action - though is not generally indicated in relation to the severity of symptoms where other treatment options exist, and often has numerous damaging consequences that must be carefully weighted before any potential administration. == Pharmacology == Chlordiazepoxide acts on benzodiazepine allosteric sites that are part of the GABAA receptor/ion-channel complex and this results in an increased binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the GABAA receptor thereby producing inhibitory effects on the central nervous system and body similar to the effects of other benzodiazepines. Chlordiazepoxide is an anticonvulsant. Chlordiazepoxide is preferentially stored in some organs including the hearts of neonates. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly higher in neonates. The withdrawal of chlordiazepoxide during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as chlordiazepoxide rapidly crosses the placenta and also is excreted in breast milk. Chlordiazepoxide also decreases prolactin release in rats. Benzodiazepines act via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive Calcium uptake in animal nerve terminal preparations. Chlordiazepoxide inhibits acetylcholine release in mouse hippocampal synaptosomes in vivo. This has been found by measuring sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake in vitro after pretreatment of the mice in vivo with chlordiazepoxide. This may play a role in chlordiazepoxide's anticonvulsant properties. == Pharmacokinetics == Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine drug. The half-life of chlordiazepoxide is from 5 to 30 hours but has an active benzodiazepine metabolite, nordiazepam, which has a half-life of 36 to 200 hours. The half-life of chlordiazepoxide increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration. Delayed body clearance of the long half-life active metabolite also occurs in those over 60 years of age, which further prolongs the effects of the drugs with additional accumulation after repeated dosing. Despite its name, chlordiazepoxide is not an epoxide. == History == Chlordiazepoxide (initially called methaminodiazepoxide) was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized in the mid-1950s. The synthesis was derived from work on a class of dyes, quinazoline-3-oxides. It was discovered by accident when in 1957 tests revealed that the compound had hypnotic, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects. ""The story of the chemical development of Librium and Valium was told by Sternbach. The serendipity involved in the invention of this class of compounds was matched by the trials and errors of the pharmacologists in the discovery of the tranquilizing activity of the benzodiazepines. The discovery of Librium in 1957 was due largely to the dedicated work and observational ability of a gifted technician, Beryl Kappell. For some seven years she had been screening compounds by simple animal tests for muscle relaxant activity using myanesin as a standard and then meprobamate and chlorpromazine when they became available. All compounds submitted by the chemical staff for central nervous activity were screened. It was this battery of tests that picked out RO 5-0690 (Librium, chlordiazepoxide) as being similar but more potent than meprobamate."" Three years later chlordiazepoxide was marketed as a therapeutic benzodiazepine medication under the brand name Librium. Following chlordiazepoxide, in 1963 diazepam hit the market under the brand name Valium—and was followed by many further benzodiazepine compounds over the subsequent years and decades. In 1959 it was used by over 2,000 physicians and more than 20,000 patients. It was described as ""chemically and clinically different from any of the tranquilizers, psychic energizers or other psychotherapeutic drugs now available."" During studies, chlordiazepoxide induced muscle relaxation and a quieting effect on laboratory animals like mice, rats, cats, and dogs. Fear and aggression were eliminated in much smaller doses than those necessary to produce hypnosis. Chlordiazepoxide is similar to phenobarbital in its anticonvulsant properties. However, it lacks the hypnotic effects of barbiturates. Animal tests were conducted in the Boston Zoo and the San Diego Zoo. Forty-two hospital patients admitted for acute and chronic alcoholism, and various psychoses and neuroses were treated with chlordiazepoxide. In a majority of the patients, anxiety, tension, and motor excitement were ""effectively reduced."" The most positive results were observed among alcoholic patients. It was reported that ulcers and dermatologic problems, both of which involved emotional factors, were reduced by chlordiazepoxide. In 1963, approval for use was given to diazepam (Valium), a ""simplified"" version of chlordiazepoxide, primarily to counteract anxiety symptoms. Sleep-related problems were treated with nitrazepam (Mogadon), which was introduced in 1972, temazepam (Restoril), which was introduced in 1979, and flurazepam (Dalmane), which was introduced in 1975. == Recreational use == In 1963, Carl F. Essig of the Addiction Research Center of the National Institute of Mental Health stated that meprobamate, glutethimide, ethinamate, ethchlorvynol, methyprylon and chlordiazepoxide were drugs whose usefulness “can hardly be questioned.” However, Essig labeled these “newer products” as “drugs of addiction,” like barbiturates, whose habit-forming qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of chlordiazepoxide, which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams. Chlordiazepoxide is a drug of potential misuse and is frequently detected in urine samples of drug users who have not been prescribed the drug. === Legal status === Internationally, chlordiazepoxide is a Schedule IV controlled drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. == Toxicity == === Animal === Laboratory tests assessing the toxicity of chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam and diazepam on mice spermatozoa found that chlordiazepoxide produced toxicities in sperm including abnormalities involving both the shape and size of the sperm head. Nitrazepam, however, caused more profound abnormalities than chlordiazepoxide. == Availability == Chlordiazepoxide is available in various dosage forms, alone or in combination with other drugs, worldwide. In combination with Clidinium as NORMAXIN-CC and in combination with dicyclomine as NORMAXIN for IBS, and with the anti-depressant amitriptyline as Limbitrol. == See also == Alcohol withdrawal syndrome Benzodiazepine Benzodiazepine dependence Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome Effects of long-term benzodiazepine use == References == == External links == Rx-List.com - Chlordiazepoxide Inchem.org - Chlordiazepoxide U.S. National Library of Medicine: Drug Information Portal - Chlordiazepoxide",Clopoxide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.292907877039397e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00048494499060325325), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003194113029167056)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0024756586644798517)])","('MEDICAL; https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/C/Clopoxide.html ', [])"

In the first method, the first derivative spectrum was determined. Montelukast sodium showed zero crossing point at 209.5 nm and Bambuterol hydrochloride showed zero crossing point at 238.5 nm. The dA/dlambda was measured at 209.5 nm for Bambuterol hydrochloride and 238.5 nm for Montelukast sodium and calibration curves were plotted as dA/dlambda versus concentration respectively. Quantitative determination of Montelukast sodium and Bambuterol hydrochloride in tablets was carried out using calibration curve by interpolation method. In the second method, Multicomponent mode of analysis was used and the measurement of absorbances at two wavelengths, 283.6 nm (lambda-max of MKST) and 211.8 nm (working wavelength selected for BHC) in 95% methanol, was carried out. These methods were validated statistically as per ICH guidelines. The recovery studies confirm the accuracy of the proposed method. A rapid, simple, sensitive and selective analytical method was developed by using reverse phase ultra performance liquid chromatographic technique for the simultaneous estimation of bambuterol hydrochloride and montelukast sodium in combined tablet dosage form. The developed method is superior in technology to conventional high performance liquid chromatography with respect to speed, resolution, solvent consumption, time, and cost of analysis. Elution time for the separation was 6 min and ultra violet detection was carried out at 210 nm. Efficient separation was achieved on BEH C18 sub-2-μm Acquity UPLC column using 0.025% (v/v) trifluoro acetic acid in water and acetonitrile as organic solvent in a linear gradient program. Resolutions between bambuterol hydrochloride and montelukast sodium were found to be more than 31. The active pharmaceutical ingredient was extracted from tablet dosage from using a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and water as diluent. The calibration graphs were linear for bambuterol hydrochloride and montelukast sodium in the range of 6.25-37.5 μg/ml. The percentage recoveries for bambuterol hydrochloride and montelukast sodium were found to be in the range of 99.1-100.0% and 98.0-101.6%, respectively. The test solution was found to be stable for 7 days when stored in the refrigerator between 2-8°. Developed UPLC method was validated as per International Conference on Harmonization specifications for method validation. This method can be successfully employed for simultaneous estimation of bambuterol hydrochloride and montelukast sodium in bulk drugs and formulations.

A protocol is presented for quantification of BHC in a formulation in lactose, together with TBS, relative to a reference peak from magnesium stearate. This protocol compares the intensity of an aromatic signal of BHC with that of the main-chain methylene carbons of the stearate. It is shown that the limit of detection (LOD) of BHC in this system under the conditions described is 0.5% with an effective limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.0%.

3952,"('Doxorubicin (adriamycin)',)",Medical," Despite its vast utility in clinical oncology, the use of doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin) is limited by a potentially fatal cardiomyopathy. The following critical review, which examines the natural course, histopathologic effects, risk factors and monitoring indicators of this toxicity, also analyzes recent research of proposed mechanisms, including free radical formation with depletion of detoxifying enzymes, inhibition of vital enzyme systems and alterations in relative calcium concentrations. Prevention of the adverse reaction has been attempted by using such agents as alpha-tocopherol, selenium sulfide, coenzyme Q(10), sulfhydryl donors, nucleosides and razoxane, and via liposomal carriage and alternative methods of administration. The antineoplastic drug doxorubicin is capable of generating a variety of free radical species in subcellular systems and this capacity has been considered critical for its antitumor action. However, for most tumor cell lines this mechanism of cytotoxicity does not appear to play a major role. Free radical-independent cytotoxicity mechanisms, taking place in the nuclear compartment of the cell, may more likely be involved in the antitumor effect of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin/Adriamycin (ADM) alone or combined with ifosfamide (IFO) (AI) is available for previously untreated advanced soft tissue sarcoma (ASTS). However, the clinical choice between them remains controversial. In this pooled analysis, we comprehensively compared the efficacy and tolerability of AI versus ADM in patients with ASTS. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to April 14, 2021. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials comparing AI to ADM. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR).

3953,"('Adriblastin', 'Hydroxydaunorubicin hydrochloride', 'Epirubicin hcl', 'Fi 6804', 'Epirubicinhcl')",Medical,"Doxorubicin, sold under the brand name Adriamycin among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer. This includes breast cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is often used together with other chemotherapy agents. Doxorubicin is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and inflammation of the mouth. Other serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage at the site of injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA. Doxorubicin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Versions that are pegylated and in liposomes are also available; however, they are more expensive. Doxorubicin was originally made from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius. == Medical uses == In the EU doxorubicin pegylated liposomal (as Caelyx) is indicated to treat breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. It is indicated to treat multiple myeloma in combination with bortezomib. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (as Myocet liposomal) is indicated to treat breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide. Doxorubicin is commonly used to treat some leukemias and lymphomas, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma as well as aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor), multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide). Its activity is inhibited by certain antioxidant plant extracts, for example Tragia volubilis aqueous extract. Doxil (see below) is used primarily for the treatment of ovarian cancer where the disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy, or for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. == Side effects == === Cardiotoxicity === The most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550 mg/m2, 18% when the dose is 551–600 mg/m2 and 36% when the dose exceeds 600 mg/m2. There are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy, including oxidative stress due to iron accumulation, downregulation of genes for contractile proteins, and p53-mediated apoptosis. Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy typically results in dilated cardiomyopathy, with all four cardiac chambers being enlarged. This results in both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Eventually, heart failure can result, which carries a 50% mortality rate. There is no effective treatment against established cardiomyopathy caused by the drug as of 2010. The drug dexrazoxane, which is an iron chelator may be used to decrease the risk of doxorubicin's cardiotoxicity in certain cases. === Other === Another common and potentially fatal complication of doxorubicin is typhlitis, an acute life-threatening inflammation of the bowel. Additionally, some people may develop palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), characterized by skin eruptions on the palms of the hand or soles of the feet, swelling, pain, and erythema. Due to these side effects and its red color, doxorubicin has earned the nickname ""red devil"" or ""red death."" Chemotherapy can cause reactivation of hepatitis B, and doxorubicin-containing regimens are no exception. Doxorubicin and several chemotherapeutic drugs (including cyclophosphamide) can cause a loss of skin pigmentation. === Liposomal formulations === There is a pegylated (polyethylene glycol coated) liposome-encapsulated form of doxorubicin, developed to treat Kaposi's sarcoma. The polyethylene glycol coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin. However, this also results in a side effect called palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome. Following administration of this form of doxorubicin, small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The result of this leakage is redness, tenderness, and peeling of the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful. In clinical testing at 50 mg/m2 dosing every four weeks, half of people developed hand-foot syndrome. The rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby limiting potential substitution. Substitution would be desirable because liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than unencapsulated doxorubicin. This liposome-encapsulated form is also approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma. A non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, called Myocet, is approved in the European Union and in Canada for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but it has not been approved by the FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of PPE. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA boxed warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval. == Biosynthesis == Doxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-hydroxylated version of daunorubicin, the immediate precursor of DXR in its biosynthetic pathway. Daunorubicin is more abundantly found as a natural product because it is produced by a number of different wild type strains of Streptomyces. In contrast, only one known non-wild type species, Streptomyces peucetius subspecies cesius ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin. This strain was created by Arcamone et al. in 1969 by mutating a strain producing daunorubicin, but not DXR, at least in detectable quantities. Subsequently, Hutchinson's group showed that under special environmental conditions, or by the introduction of genetic modifications, other strains of Streptomyces can produce doxorubicin. His group also cloned many of the genes required for DXR production, although not all of them have been fully characterized. In 1996, Strohl's group discovered, isolated and characterized dox A, the gene encoding the enzyme that converts daunorubicin into DXR. By 1999, they produced recombinant dox A, a cytochrome P450 oxidase, and found that it catalyzes multiple steps in DXR biosynthesis, including steps leading to daunorubicin. This was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicin-producing strains have the necessary genes to produce DXR, the much more therapeutically important of the two. Hutchinson's group went on to develop methods to improve the yield of DXR, from the fermentation process used in its commercial production, not only by introducing dox A encoding plasmids, but also by introducing mutations to deactivate enzymes that shunt DXR precursors to less useful products, for example baumycin-like glycosides. Some triple mutants, that also over-expressed dox A, were able to double the yield of DXR. This is of more than academic interest, because at that time DXR cost about $1.37 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225 kg per annum. More efficient production techniques have brought the price down to $1.1 million per kg for the nonliposomal formulation. Although DXR can be produced semi-synthetically from daunorubicin, the process involves electrophilic bromination and multiple steps, and the yield is poor. Since daunorubicin is produced by fermentation, it would be ideal if the bacteria could complete DXR synthesis more effectively. == Mechanism of action == Doxorubicin interacts with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits the progression of topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being released and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity. The planar aromatic chromophore portion of the molecule intercalates between two base pairs of the DNA, while the six-membered daunosamine sugar sits in the minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the intercalation site, as evidenced by several crystal structures. By intercalation, doxorubicin can also induce histone eviction from transcriptionally active chromatin. As a result, the DNA damage response, epigenome and transcriptome are deregulated in doxorubicin-exposed cells. == History == In the 1950s, an Italian research company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to find anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle. A new strain of Streptomyces peucetius, which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug was successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could lead to fatal cardiac toxicity. Researchers at Farmitalia soon discovered that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes in the structure of the compound. A strain of Streptomyces was mutated using N-nitroso-N-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention. Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin together can be thought of as prototype compounds for the anthracyclines. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin. By 1991, 553 of them had been evaluated in the screening program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2016 GPX-150 was granted orphan drug designation by US FDA. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 24 March 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Zolsketil pegylated liposomal, intended for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, advanced ovarian cancer, progressive multiple myeloma and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare S.L.U. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is a hybrid medicine of Adriamycin. It contains the same active substance as Adriamycin, but is available in a pegylated liposomal formulation. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2022. On 21 July 2022, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Celdoxome pegylated liposomal, intended for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, advanced ovarian cancer, progressive multiple myeloma and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. The applicant for this medicinal product is YES Pharmaceutical Development Services GmbH. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is a hybrid medicine of Adriamycin which has been authorized in the EU since 24 October 1979. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal contains the same active substance as Adriamycin, but is available in a pegylated liposomal formulation. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal was approved for medical use in the European Union in September 2022. === Names === It is also known as hydroxydaunorubicin and hydroxydaunomycin. It is sold under a number of different brand names, including Adriamycin PFS, Adriamycin RDF, or Rubex. === Formulations === Doxorubicin is photosensitive, and containers are often covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it. Doxorubicin is also available in liposome-encapsulated forms as Doxil (pegylated form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, which are also given by intravenous injection. The FDA approved the first generic version of Doxil, made by Sun, in February 2013. == Research == Combination therapy experiments with sirolimus (rapamycin) and doxorubicin have shown promise in treating Akt-positive lymphomas in mice. Further, the release of photo-activated adriamycin with the aid of nanoporous optical antenna resulted in significant anti-cancer effect in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In 2006, animal research coupling a murine monoclonal antibody with doxorubicin created an immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice. === Antimalarial activity === There is some evidence for antimalarial activity for doxorubicin and similar compounds. In 2009, a compound similar in structure to doxorubicin was found to inhibit plasmepsin II, an enzyme unique to the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) later identified doxorubicin in a set of compounds that inhibit parasite growth. === Fluorescence === Doxorubicin is also known to be fluorescent. This has often been used to characterize doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened the possibility of using the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It is also known to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence. == References == == External links == Media related to Doxorubicin at Wikimedia Commons ""Doxorubicin"". Drug Information Portal.

This study aimed at improving the systemic bioavailability of propranolol-HCl by the design of transdermal drug delivery system based on chitosan nanoparticles dispersed into gels. Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by ionic gelation technique using tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking agent. Characterization of the nanoparticles was focused on particle size, zeta potential, surface texture and morphology, and drug encapsulation efficiency. The prepared freeze dried chitosan nanoparticles were dispersed into gels made of poloxamer and carbopol and the rheological behaviour and the adhesiveness of the gels were investigated. The results showed that smallest propranolol loaded chitosan nanoparticles were achieved with 0.2% chitosan and 0.05% TPP. Nanoparticles were stable in suspension with a zeta potential (ZP) above ±30mV to prevent aggregation of the colloid. Zeta potential was found to increase with increasing chitosan concentration due to its cationic nature. At least 70% of entrapment efficiency and drug loading were achieved for all prepared nanoparticles. When chitosan nanoparticles dispersed into gel consisting of poloxamer and carbopol, the resultant formulation exhibited thixotropic behaviour with a prolonged drug release properties as shown by the permeation studies through pig ear skin. Our study demonstrated that the designed nanoparticles-gel transdermal delivery system has a potential to improve the systemic bioavailability and the therapeutic efficacy of propranolol-HCl.

3958,"('Propranolol hydrochloride', 'Propranolol hcl', 'Inderal', 'Anaprilin', 'Avlocardyl')",Medical,"Propranolol is a medication of the beta blocker class. It is used to treat high blood pressure, some types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, akathisia, performance anxiety, and essential tremors, as well to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken orally or by intravenous injection. The formulation that is taken orally comes in short-acting and long-acting versions. Propranolol appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken orally. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. It may worsen the symptoms of asthma. Propranolol may cause harmful effects for the baby if taken during pregnancy; however, its use during breastfeeding is generally considered to be safe. It is a non-selective beta blocker which works by blocking β-adrenergic receptors. Propranolol was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Propranolol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 77th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Propranolol is used for treating various conditions, including: === Cardiovascular === Hypertension Angina pectoris (with the exception of variant angina) Myocardial infarction Tachycardia (and other sympathetic nervous system symptoms, such as muscle tremor) associated with various conditions, including anxiety, panic, hyperthyroidism, and lithium therapy Portal hypertension, to lower portal vein pressure Prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding and ascites Anxiety Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy While once a first-line treatment for hypertension, the role of beta blockers was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line, as they do not perform as well as other drugs, particularly in the elderly, and evidence is increasing that the most frequently used beta blockers at usual doses carry an unacceptable risk of provoking type 2 diabetes. Propranolol is not recommended for the treatment of high blood pressure by the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) because a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to an angiotensin receptor blocker was noted in one study. === Psychiatric === Propranolol is occasionally used to treat performance anxiety, although evidence to support its use in any anxiety disorders is poor. Its efficacy in managing panic disorder appears similar to benzodiazepines, while carrying lower risks for addiction or abuse. Although beta-blockers such as propranolol have been suggested to be beneficial in managing physical symptoms of anxiety, its efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder remain unestablished. Some experimentation has been conducted in other psychiatric areas: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobias Aggressive behavior of patients with brain injuries Treating the excessive drinking of fluids in psychogenic polydipsia ==== PTSD and phobias ==== Propranolol is being investigated as a potential treatment for PTSD. Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. In one small study, individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due to the fact that memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia. It has also been found to be helpful for some individuals with misophonia. Ethical and legal questions have been raised surrounding the use of propranolol-based medications for use as a ""memory damper"", including altering memory-recalled evidence during an investigation, modifying the behavioral response to past (albeit traumatic) experiences, the regulation of these drugs, and others. However, Hall and Carter have argued that many such objections are ""based on wildly exaggerated and unrealistic scenarios that ignore the limited action of propranolol in affecting memory, underplay the debilitating impact that PTSD has on those who suffer from it, and fail to acknowledge the extent to which drugs like alcohol are already used for this purpose"". === Other uses === Essential tremor. Evidence for use for akathisia however is insufficient Migraine and cluster headache prevention and in primary exertional headache Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) Infantile hemangioma Glaucoma Thyrotoxicosis by deiodinase inhibition Propranolol may be used to treat severe infantile hemangiomas (IHs). This treatment shows promise as being superior to corticosteroids when treating IHs. Extensive clinical case evidence and a small controlled trial support its efficacy. == Contraindications == Propranolol may be contraindicated in people with: Reversible airway diseases, particularly asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Slow heart rate (bradycardia) (<60 beats/minute) Sick sinus syndrome Atrioventricular block (second- or third-degree) Shock Severe low blood pressure == Adverse effects == Propranolol should be used with caution in people with: Diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism, since signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked Peripheral artery disease and Raynaud syndrome, which may be exacerbated Phaeochromocytoma, as hypertension may be aggravated without prior alpha blocker therapy Myasthenia gravis, which may be worsened Other drugs with bradycardic effects === Pregnancy and lactation === Propranolol, like other beta-blockers, is classified as pregnancy category C in the United States and ADEC category C in Australia. β-blocking agents in general reduce perfusion of the placenta, which may lead to adverse outcomes for the neonate, including lung or heart complications, or premature birth. The newborn may experience additional adverse effects such as low blood sugar and a slower than normal heart rate. Most β-blocking agents appear in the milk of lactating women. However, propranolol is highly bound to proteins in the bloodstream and is distributed into breast milk at very low levels. These low levels are not expected to pose any risk to the breastfeeding infant, and the American Academy of Pediatrics considers propranolol therapy ""generally compatible with breastfeeding."" == Overdose == In overdose, propranolol is associated with seizures. Cardiac arrest may occur in propranolol overdose due to sudden ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock which may ultimately culminate in bradycardic PEA. == Interactions == Since beta blockers are known to relax the cardiac muscle and constrict the smooth muscle, beta-adrenergic antagonists, including propranolol, have an additive effect with other drugs that decrease blood pressure or decrease cardiac contractility or conductivity. Clinically significant interactions particularly occur with: Verapamil Epinephrine (adrenaline) β2-adrenergic receptor agonists Salbutamol (albuterol), levosalbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, clenbuterol, others Clonidine Ergot alkaloids Isoprenaline (isoproterenol) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Quinidine Cimetidine Lidocaine Phenobarbital Rifampicin Fluvoxamine (slows down the metabolism of propranolol significantly, leading to increased blood levels of propranolol) == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Propranolol is classified as a competitive non-cardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel-blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose). Propranolol can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects in the central nervous system in addition to its peripheral activity. In addition to blockade of adrenergic receptors, propranolol has very weak inhibitory effects on the norepinephrine transporter and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the synapse). Since propranolol blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the α1-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α1-adrenoceptor agonist in addition to potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, there is evidence that indicates that propranolol may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of propranolol in the treatment of migraine at high doses. Both enantiomers of propranolol have a local anesthetic (topical) effect, which is normally mediated by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Studies have demonstrated propranolol's ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal voltage-gated sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other central nervous system effects. === Mechanism of action === Propranolol is a non-selective beta receptor antagonist. This means that it does not have preference to β1 or β2 receptors. It competes with sympathomimetic neurotransmitters for binding to receptors, which inhibits sympathetic stimulation of the heart. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β1 receptors on cardiac myocytes inhibits activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn inhibits cAMP synthesis leading to reduced Protein kinase A (PKA) activation. This results in less calcium influx to cardiac myocytes through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels meaning there is a decreased sympathetic effect on cardiac cells, resulting in antihypertensive effects including reduced heart rate and lower arterial blood pressure. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β2 receptors on smooth muscle cells will increase contraction, which will increase hypertension. === Pharmacokinetics === Propranolol is rapidly and completely absorbed, with peak plasma levels achieved about 1–3 hours after ingestion. More than 90% of the drug is found bound to plasma protein in the blood. Coadministration with food appears to enhance bioavailability. Despite complete absorption, propranolol has a variable bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Hepatic impairment therefore increases its bioavailability. Propranolol can be absorbed along the whole intestine with the main absorption site being the colon, which means people who have lost their colon due to surgery may absorb relatively less percentage of propranolol. The main metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol, with a longer half-life (5.2–7.5 hours) than the parent compound (3–4 hours), is also pharmacologically active. Most of the metabolites are excreted in the urine. Propranolol is a highly lipophilic drug achieving high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80 mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100 mg/L. Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000 mg/L. == History == Scottish scientist James W. Black developed propranolol in the 1960s. It was the first beta-blocker effectively used in the treatment of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Newer, more cardio-selective beta blockers (such as bisoprolol, nebivolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol) are used preferentially in the treatment of hypertension. == Society and culture == In a 1987 study by the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, it was reported that 27% of interviewed members said they used beta blockers such as propranolol for musical performances. For about 10–16% of performers, their degree of stage fright is considered pathological. Propranolol is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers for its ability to treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system. It has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug in sports where high accuracy is required, including archery, shooting, golf, and snooker. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, 50-metre pistol silver medalist and 10-metre air pistol bronze medalist Kim Jong-su tested positive for propranolol and was stripped of his medals. === Brand names === Propranolol was first marketed under the brand name Inderal, manufactured by ICI Pharmaceuticals (now AstraZeneca), in 1965. ""Inderal"" is a quasi-anagram of ""Alderlin"", the trade name of pronethalol (which propranolol replaced); both names are an homage to Alderley Park, the ICI headquarters where the drugs were first developed. Propranolol is also marketed under brand names Avlocardyl, Deralin, Dociton, Inderalici, InnoPran XL, Indoblok, Sumial, Anaprilin, and Bedranol SR (Sandoz). In India, it is marketed under brand names such as Ciplar and Ciplar LA by Cipla. Hemangeol, a 4.28 mg/mL solution of propranolol, is indicated for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma. == References == == Further reading == Stapleton MP (1997).

3959,"('Galanthamine hydrobromide', 'Galantamine hydrobromide', 'Reminyl', 'Nivalin', 'Galanthamine (hydrobromide)')",Medical,"Galantamine is a type of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It is an alkaloid extracted from the bulbs and flowers of Galanthus nivalis (common snowdrop), Galanthus caucasicus (Caucasian snowdrop), Galanthus woronowii (Voronov's snowdrop), and other members of the family Amaryllidaceae, such as Narcissus (daffodil), Leucojum aestivum (snowflake), and Lycoris including Lycoris radiata (red spider lily). It can also be produced synthetically. Galantamine is primarily known for its potential to slow cognitive decline. It is used clinically for treating early-stage Alzheimer's disease and memory impairments, although it has had limited success with the more advanced condition of dementia. It works by increasing the amount of a type of neurotransmitter named acetylcholine by the inhibiting activity of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase known for breaking down acetylcholine. This elevates and prolongs acetylcholine levels boosting acetylcholine's neuromodulatory functionality, subsequently enhancing functionality of the various cognitions that acetylcholine is involved in, such as memory processing, reasoning, and thinking. Galantamine may cause serious adverse effects, such as stomach bleeding, liver injury or chest pain. Galantamine was isolated for the first time from bulbs of Galanthus nivalis (common snowdrop) in the Soviet Union in the 1940s. The active ingredient was extracted, identified, and studied, in particular in relation to acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibiting properties. The first industrial process was developed in 1959. However, it was not until the 1990s when full-scale synthesis was upscaled and optimized. == Medical uses == Galantamine, sold under the brand name Razadyne among others, is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The first person to extract galantamine and theorize its usefulness in medicine, was the Bulgarian chemist Dimitar Paskov in 1959. In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia. Galantamine may not be effective for treating mild cognitive impairment. === Alzheimer's disease === Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the impairment of cholinergic function. One hypothesis is that this impairment contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by the disease. This hypothesis forms the basis for use of galantamine as a cholinergic enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's. Galantamine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes acetylcholine. As a result of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, galantamine increases the availability of acetylcholine for synaptic transmission. Additionally, galantamine binds to the allosteric sites of nicotinic receptors, which causes a conformational change. This allosteric modulation increases the nicotinic receptor's response to acetylcholine. The activation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors increases the release of acetylcholine, further increasing the availability of acetylcholine. Galantamine's competitive inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and allosteric nicotinic modulation serves as a dual mechanism of action. To reduce the prevalence of negative side effects associated with galantamine, such as nausea and vomiting, a dose-escalation scheme may be used. The use of a dose-escalation scheme has been well accepted in countries where galantamine is used. A dose-escalation scheme for Alzheimer's treatment involves a recommended starting dosage of 4 mg galantamine tablets given twice a day (8 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks, the dosage may then be increased to 8 mg given twice a day (16 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks at 16 mg/day, the treatment may be increased to 12 mg given twice a day (24 mg/day). Dosage increases are based upon the assessment of clinical benefit as well as tolerability of the previous dosage. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, the process is usually restarted, beginning at the starting dosage, and re-escalating to the current dose. It has been found that a dosage between 16–24 mg/day is the optimal dosage. In December 2023, the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for a pro-drug of galantamine called ALPHA-1062. In July 2024, The FDA approved benzgalantamine (Zunveyl, a derivative of galantamine), previously known as ALPHA-1062, to treat mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. == Side effects == The adverse effect profile of galantamine includes potential for allergic reaction, including hives, swelling of the face or throat, and skin rash. Using galantamine may cause chest pain, bloody urine, stomach bleeding, and liver injury, among other side effects. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and headache are considered common side effects. A gradual titration over more than three months may enable long-term tolerability in some people. Galantamine has a wide spectrum of interactions with other medications and medical disorders, requiring close assessment between the physician and patient. == Pharmacology == Galantamine's chemical structure contains a tertiary amine. At a neutral pH, this tertiary amine will often bond to a hydrogen, and appear mostly as an ammonium ion. Galantamine is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) α4β2, α3β4, and α6β4, and chicken/mouse nAChRs α7/5-HT3 in certain areas of the brain. By binding to the allosteric site of the nAChRs, a conformational change occurs which increases the receptors response to acetylcholine. This modulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors on cholinergic neurons in turn causes an increase in the amount of acetylcholine released. However, recent studies suggest that Galantamine does not functionally act at human nAChRs α4β2 or α7 as a positive allosteric modulator. Galantamine also works as a weak competitive and reversible cholinesterase inhibitor in all areas of the body. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, it increases the concentration and thereby action of acetylcholine in certain parts of the brain. Galantamine's effects on nAChRs and complementary acetylcholinesterase inhibition make up a dual mechanism of action. It is hypothesized that this action might relieve some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's. Galantamine in its pure form is a white powder. The atomic resolution 3D structure of the complex of galantamine and its target, acetylcholinesterase, was determined by X-ray crystallography in 1999 (PDB code: 1DX6; see complex). There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process. == Pharmacokinetics == Absorption of galantamine is rapid and complete and shows linear pharmacokinetics. It is well absorbed with absolute oral bioavailability between 80 and 100%. It has a terminal elimination half-life of seven hours. Peak effect of inhibiting acetylcholinesterase was achieved about one hour after a single oral dose of 8 mg in some healthy volunteers. The coadministration of food delays the rate of galantamine absorption, but does not affect the extent of absorption. Plasma protein binding of galantamine is about 18%, which is relatively low. == Metabolism == Approximately 75% of a dose of galantamine is metabolised in the liver. In vitro studies have shown that hepatic CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are involved in galantamine metabolism. Within 24 hours of intravenous or oral administration approximately 20% of a dose of galantamine will be excreted unreacted in the urine. In humans, several metabolic pathways for galantamine exist. These pathways lead to the formation of a number of different metabolites. One of the metabolites that may result can be formed through the glucuronidation of galantamine. Additionally, galantamine may undergo oxidation or demethylation at its nitrogen atom, forming two other possible metabolites. Galantamine can undergo demethylation at its oxygen atom, forming an intermediate which can then undergo glucuronidation or sulfate conjugation. Lastly, galantamine may be oxidized and then reduced before finally undergoing demethylation or oxidation at its nitrogen atom, or demethylation and subsequent glucuronidation at its oxygen atom. == Drug interactions == Since galantamine is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, inhibiting either of these isoenzymes will increase the cholinergic effects of galantamine. Inhibiting these enzymes may lead to adverse effects. It was found that paroxetine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the bioavailability of galantamine by 40%. The CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and erythromycin increased the bioavailability of galantamine by 30% and 12%, respectively. == Extraction and synthesis == Since the alkaloid is isolated from botanical sources containing low amounts (0.1%) by weight, extraction yields are low. Although galantamine can be produced from natural resources, it also has many industrial syntheses, such as by Janssen, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Shire, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. == Research == === Organophosphate poisoning === The toxicity of organophosphates results primarily from their action as irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase causes an increase in acetylcholine, as the enzyme is no longer available to catalyze its breakdown. In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine accumulation can cause an overstimulation of muscarinic receptors followed by a desensitization of nicotinic receptors. This leads to severe skeletal muscle fasciculations (involuntary contractions). The effects on the central nervous system include anxiety, restlessness, confusion, ataxia, tremors, seizures, cardiorespiratory paralysis, and coma. As a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine has the potential to serve as an effective organophosphate poisoning treatment by preventing irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Additionally, galantamine has anticonvulsant properties which may make it even more desirable as an antidote. Research supported in part by the US Army has led to a US patent application for the use of galantamine and/or its derivatives for treatment of organophosphate poisoning. The indications for use of galantamine in the patent application include poisoning by nerve agents ""including but not limited to soman, sarin, and VX, tabun, and Novichok agents"". Galantamine was studied in the research cited in the patent application for use along with the well-recognized nerve agent antidote atropine. According to the investigators, an unexpected synergistic interaction occurred between galantamine and atropine in an amount of 6 mg/kg or higher. Increasing the dose of galantamine from 5 to 8 mg/kg decreased the dose of atropine needed to protect experimental animals from the toxicity of soman in dosages 1.5 times the dose generally required to kill half the experimental animals. === Autism === Galantamine given in addition to risperidone to autistic children has been shown to improve some of the symptoms of autism such as irritability, lethargy, and social withdrawal. Additionally, the cholinergic and nicotinic receptors are believed to play a role in attentional processes. Some studies have noted that cholinergic and nicotinic treatments have improved attention in autistic children. As such, it is hypothesized that galantamine's dual action mechanism might have a similar effect in treating autistic children and adolescents. === Anesthesia === Galantamine may have some limited use in reducing the side-effects of anesthetics ketamine and diazepam. In one study, a control group of patients were given ketamine and diazepam and underwent anesthesia and surgery. The experimental group was given ketamine, diazepam, and nivalin (of which the active ingredient is galantamine). The degree of drowsiness and disorientation of the two groups was then assessed 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after surgery. The group that had taken nivalin were found to be more alert 5, 10, and 15 minutes after the surgery. === Oneirogen === Galantamine is known to have oneirogenic properties. Research has demonstrated its potential to increase dream recall, dream self-awareness and dream vividness. The enhancement of such dream properties can facilitate the induction of lucid dreams. == References ==",Nivalin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2233183042553719e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007103541865944862), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2014637142419815)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00033546582562848926), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/nivalin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='NIVALIN - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/nivalin?utm_source=openai')])"
3960,"('Galantamin', 'Epigalanthamin', 'Ent-galantamine', 'Epigalanthamine', 'Galanthamine #')",Medical,"Galantamine is a type of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It is an alkaloid extracted from the bulbs and flowers of Galanthus nivalis (common snowdrop), Galanthus caucasicus (Caucasian snowdrop), Galanthus woronowii (Voronov's snowdrop), and other members of the family Amaryllidaceae, such as Narcissus (daffodil), Leucojum aestivum (snowflake), and Lycoris including Lycoris radiata (red spider lily). It can also be produced synthetically. Galantamine is primarily known for its potential to slow cognitive decline. It is used clinically for treating early-stage Alzheimer's disease and memory impairments, although it has had limited success with the more advanced condition of dementia. It works by increasing the amount of a type of neurotransmitter named acetylcholine by the inhibiting activity of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase known for breaking down acetylcholine. This elevates and prolongs acetylcholine levels boosting acetylcholine's neuromodulatory functionality, subsequently enhancing functionality of the various cognitions that acetylcholine is involved in, such as memory processing, reasoning, and thinking. Galantamine may cause serious adverse effects, such as stomach bleeding, liver injury or chest pain. Galantamine was isolated for the first time from bulbs of Galanthus nivalis (common snowdrop) in the Soviet Union in the 1940s. The active ingredient was extracted, identified, and studied, in particular in relation to acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibiting properties. The first industrial process was developed in 1959. However, it was not until the 1990s when full-scale synthesis was upscaled and optimized. == Medical uses == Galantamine, sold under the brand name Razadyne among others, is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The first person to extract galantamine and theorize its usefulness in medicine, was the Bulgarian chemist Dimitar Paskov in 1959. In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia. Galantamine may not be effective for treating mild cognitive impairment. === Alzheimer's disease === Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the impairment of cholinergic function. One hypothesis is that this impairment contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by the disease. This hypothesis forms the basis for use of galantamine as a cholinergic enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's. Galantamine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes acetylcholine. As a result of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, galantamine increases the availability of acetylcholine for synaptic transmission. Additionally, galantamine binds to the allosteric sites of nicotinic receptors, which causes a conformational change. This allosteric modulation increases the nicotinic receptor's response to acetylcholine. The activation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors increases the release of acetylcholine, further increasing the availability of acetylcholine. Galantamine's competitive inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and allosteric nicotinic modulation serves as a dual mechanism of action. To reduce the prevalence of negative side effects associated with galantamine, such as nausea and vomiting, a dose-escalation scheme may be used. The use of a dose-escalation scheme has been well accepted in countries where galantamine is used. A dose-escalation scheme for Alzheimer's treatment involves a recommended starting dosage of 4 mg galantamine tablets given twice a day (8 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks, the dosage may then be increased to 8 mg given twice a day (16 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks at 16 mg/day, the treatment may be increased to 12 mg given twice a day (24 mg/day). Dosage increases are based upon the assessment of clinical benefit as well as tolerability of the previous dosage. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, the process is usually restarted, beginning at the starting dosage, and re-escalating to the current dose. It has been found that a dosage between 16–24 mg/day is the optimal dosage. In December 2023, the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for a pro-drug of galantamine called ALPHA-1062. In July 2024, The FDA approved benzgalantamine (Zunveyl, a derivative of galantamine), previously known as ALPHA-1062, to treat mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. == Side effects == The adverse effect profile of galantamine includes potential for allergic reaction, including hives, swelling of the face or throat, and skin rash. Using galantamine may cause chest pain, bloody urine, stomach bleeding, and liver injury, among other side effects. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and headache are considered common side effects. A gradual titration over more than three months may enable long-term tolerability in some people. Galantamine has a wide spectrum of interactions with other medications and medical disorders, requiring close assessment between the physician and patient. == Pharmacology == Galantamine's chemical structure contains a tertiary amine. At a neutral pH, this tertiary amine will often bond to a hydrogen, and appear mostly as an ammonium ion. Galantamine is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) α4β2, α3β4, and α6β4, and chicken/mouse nAChRs α7/5-HT3 in certain areas of the brain. By binding to the allosteric site of the nAChRs, a conformational change occurs which increases the receptors response to acetylcholine. This modulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors on cholinergic neurons in turn causes an increase in the amount of acetylcholine released. However, recent studies suggest that Galantamine does not functionally act at human nAChRs α4β2 or α7 as a positive allosteric modulator. Galantamine also works as a weak competitive and reversible cholinesterase inhibitor in all areas of the body. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, it increases the concentration and thereby action of acetylcholine in certain parts of the brain. Galantamine's effects on nAChRs and complementary acetylcholinesterase inhibition make up a dual mechanism of action. It is hypothesized that this action might relieve some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's. Galantamine in its pure form is a white powder. The atomic resolution 3D structure of the complex of galantamine and its target, acetylcholinesterase, was determined by X-ray crystallography in 1999 (PDB code: 1DX6; see complex). There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process. == Pharmacokinetics == Absorption of galantamine is rapid and complete and shows linear pharmacokinetics. It is well absorbed with absolute oral bioavailability between 80 and 100%. It has a terminal elimination half-life of seven hours. Peak effect of inhibiting acetylcholinesterase was achieved about one hour after a single oral dose of 8 mg in some healthy volunteers. The coadministration of food delays the rate of galantamine absorption, but does not affect the extent of absorption. Plasma protein binding of galantamine is about 18%, which is relatively low. == Metabolism == Approximately 75% of a dose of galantamine is metabolised in the liver. In vitro studies have shown that hepatic CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are involved in galantamine metabolism. Within 24 hours of intravenous or oral administration approximately 20% of a dose of galantamine will be excreted unreacted in the urine. In humans, several metabolic pathways for galantamine exist.
