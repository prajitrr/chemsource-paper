1690,"('Lactose', '.beta.-lactose', 'Beta-d-glucopyranose, 4-o-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-', 'Beta-d-lactose', 'Beta-lactose')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Lactose, or milk sugar, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose and has the molecular formula C12H22O11. Lactose makes up around 2–8% of milk (by mass). The name comes from lact (gen. lactis), the Latin word for milk, plus the suffix -ose used to name sugars. The compound is a white, water-soluble, non-hygroscopic solid with a mildly sweet taste. It is used in the food industry. == Structure and reactions == Lactose is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, which form a β-1→4 glycosidic linkage. Its systematic name is β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucose. The glucose can be in either the α-pyranose form or the β-pyranose form, whereas the galactose can have only the β-pyranose form: hence α-lactose and β-lactose refer to the anomeric form of the glucopyranose ring alone. Detection reactions for lactose are the Wöhlk- and Fearon's test. They can be used to detect the different lactose content of dairy products such as whole milk, lactose free milk, yogurt, buttermilk, coffee creamer, sour cream, kefir, etc. Lactose is hydrolysed to glucose and galactose, isomerised in alkaline solution to lactulose, and catalytically hydrogenated to the corresponding polyhydric alcohol, lactitol. Lactulose is a commercial product, used for treatment of constipation. == Occurrence and isolation == Lactose comprises about 2–8% of milk by weight. Several million tons are produced annually as a by-product of the dairy industry. Whey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after milk is curdled and strained, for example in the production of cheese. Whey is made up of 6.5% solids, of which 4.8% is lactose, which is purified by crystallisation. Industrially, lactose is produced from whey permeate – whey filtrated for all major proteins. The protein fraction is used in infant nutrition and sports nutrition while the permeate can be evaporated to 60–65% solids and crystallized while cooling. Lactose can also be isolated by dilution of whey with ethanol. == Metabolism == Infant mammals nurse on their mothers to drink milk, which is rich in lactose. The intestinal villi secrete the enzyme lactase (β-D-galactosidase) to digest it. This enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits, the simple sugars glucose and galactose, which can be absorbed. Since lactose occurs mostly in milk, in most mammals, the production of lactase gradually decreases with maturity due to weaning; the removal of lactose from the diet removes the metabolic pressure to continue to produce lactase for its digestion. Many people with ancestry in Europe, West Asia, South Asia, the Sahel belt in West Africa, East Africa and a few other parts of Central Africa maintain lactase production into adulthood due to selection for genes that continue lactase production. In many of these areas, milk from mammals such as cattle, goats, and sheep is used as a large source of food. It was in these regions that genes for lifelong lactase production first evolved. The genes of adult lactose tolerance have evolved independently in various ethnic groups. By descent, more than 70% of western Europeans can digest lactose as adults, compared with less than 30% of people from areas of Africa, eastern and south-eastern Asia and Oceania. In people who are lactose intolerant, lactose is not broken down and provides food for gas-producing gut flora, which can lead to diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. == Biological properties == The sweetness of lactose is 0.2 to 0.4, relative to 1.0 for sucrose. For comparison, the sweetness of glucose is 0.6 to 0.7, of fructose is 1.3, of galactose is 0.5 to 0.7, of maltose is 0.4 to 0.5, of sorbose is 0.4, and of xylose is 0.6 to 0.7. When lactose is completely digested in the small intestine, its caloric value is 4 kcal/g, or the same as that of other carbohydrates. However, lactose is not always fully digested in the small intestine. Depending on ingested dose, combination with meals (either solid or liquid), and lactase activity in the intestines, the caloric value of lactose ranges from 2 to 4 kcal/g. Undigested lactose acts as dietary fiber. It also has positive effects on absorption of minerals, such as calcium and magnesium. The glycemic index of lactose is 46 to 65. For comparison, the glycemic index of glucose is 100 to 138, of sucrose is 68 to 92, of maltose is 105, and of fructose is 19 to 27. Lactose has relatively low cariogenicity among sugars. This is because it is not a substrate for dental plaque formation and it is not rapidly fermented by oral bacteria. The buffering capacity of milk also reduces the cariogenicity of lactose. == Applications == Its mild flavor and easy handling properties have led to its use as a carrier and stabiliser of aromas and pharmaceutical products. Lactose is not commonly added directly to food, because its low solubility can lead to a gritty mouthfeel. Infant formula is a notable exception, where lactose is added to match the composition of human milk. However, lactose-reduced formulas are increasing in popularity. One of the undesirable properties of lactose utilization is its low solubility, which can result in crystallization, giving a gritty and sandy mouthfeel in the final product. Usually, in supersaturated solution, sugars tend to crystallize, also forming big agglomerates, depending on the process condition. Lactose is not fermented by most yeast during brewing, which may be used to advantage. For example, lactose may be used to sweeten stout beer; the resulting beer is usually called a milk stout or a cream stout. Yeast belonging to the genus Kluyveromyces have a unique industrial application, as they are capable of fermenting lactose for ethanol production. Surplus lactose from the whey by-product of dairy operations is a potential source of alternative energy. Another significant lactose use is in the pharmaceutical industry. Lactose is added to tablet and capsule drug products as an ingredient because of its physical and functional properties (examples are atorvastatin, levocetirizine or thiamazole among many others). For similar reasons, it can be used to dilute illicit drugs such as cocaine or heroin. == History == The first crude isolation of lactose, by Italian physician Fabrizio Bartoletti (1576–1630), was published in 1633. In 1700, the Venetian pharmacist Lodovico Testi (1640–1707) published a booklet of testimonials to the power of milk sugar (saccharum lactis) to relieve, among other ailments, the symptoms of arthritis. In 1715, Testi's procedure for making milk sugar was published by Antonio Vallisneri. Lactose was identified as a sugar in 1780 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. In 1812, Heinrich Vogel (1778–1867) recognized that glucose was a product of hydrolyzing lactose. In 1856, Louis Pasteur crystallized the other component of lactose, galactose. By 1894, Emil Fischer had established the configurations of the component sugars. Lactose was named by the French chemist Jean Baptiste André Dumas (1800–1884) in 1843. In 1856, Pasteur named galactose ""lactose"". In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot renamed it ""galactose"", and transferred the name ""lactose"" to what is now called lactose. It has a formula of C12H22O11 and the hydrate formula C12H22O11·H2O, making it an isomer of sucrose. == See also == Lac operon Lactic acid Lactose intolerance Nectar Sugars in wine == References == == External links == Media related to Lactose at Wikimedia Commons",Lactose,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.0006302326801232994), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.16026149690151215), (' INDUSTR', -0.24615265429019928), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.25205445289611816), (' MED', -0.5759821534156799), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.0005305789527483284), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.20149101316928864), ('ĠINDU', -0.2269967794418335), ('ST', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('RI', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.5759781002998352), ('ĠMED', -0.0036732361186295748), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0025346316397190094)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD,MEDICAL,PERSONAL CARE,INDUSTRIAL; ([thinkusadairy.org](https://www.thinkusadairy.org/products/lactose/using-lactose?utm_source=openai), [pharmaexcipients.com](https://www.pharmaexcipients.com/binder/lactose-in-pharma/?utm_source=openai), [foodcom.pl](https://foodcom.pl/en/lactose-a-key-ingredient-in-dairy-products/?utm_source=openai), [verywellhealth.com](https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-lactose-5076054?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=437, start_index=39, title='Using Lactose | ThinkUSAdairy by the U.S. Dairy Export Council', type='url_citation', url='https://www.thinkusadairy.org/products/lactose/using-lactose?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=437, start_index=39, title='Application of lactose in the pharmaceutical industry - Pharma Excipients', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmaexcipients.com/binder/lactose-in-pharma/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=437, start_index=39, title='What is lactose?

1691,"('Maltose', 'Beta-maltose', 'Maltobiose', 'Cextromaltose', 'Finetose')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Maltose ( or ), also known as maltobiose or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed from two units of glucose joined with an α(1→4) bond. In the isomer isomaltose, the two glucose molecules are joined with an α(1→6) bond. Maltose is the two-unit member of the amylose homologous series, the key structural motif of starch. When beta-amylase breaks down starch, it removes two glucose units at a time, producing maltose. An example of this reaction is found in germinating seeds, which is why it was named after malt. Unlike sucrose, it is a reducing sugar. == History == Maltose was discovered by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut, although this discovery was not widely accepted until it was confirmed in 1872 by Irish chemist and brewer Cornelius O'Sullivan. Its name comes from malt, combined with the suffix '-ose' which is used in names of sugars. == Structure and nomenclature == Carbohydrates are generally divided into monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides depending on the number of sugar subunits. Maltose, with two sugar units, is a disaccharide, which falls under oligosaccharides. Glucose is a hexose: a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms. The two glucose units are in the pyranose form and are joined by an O-glycosidic bond, with the first carbon (C1) of the first glucose linked to the fourth carbon (C4) of the second glucose, indicated as (1→4). The link is characterized as α because the glycosidic bond to the anomeric carbon (C1) is in the opposite plane from the CH2OH substituent in the same ring (C6 of the first glucose). If the glycosidic bond to the anomeric carbon (C1) were in the same plane as the CH2OH substituent, it would be classified as a β(1→4) bond, and the resulting molecule would be cellobiose. The anomeric carbon (C1) of the second glucose molecule, which is not involved in a glycosidic bond, could be either an α- or β-anomer depending on the bond direction of the attached hydroxyl group relative to the CH2OH substituent of the same ring, resulting in either α-maltose or β-maltose. An isomer of maltose is isomaltose. This is similar to maltose but instead of a bond in the α(1→4) position, it is in the α(1→6) position, the same bond that is found at the branch points of glycogen and amylopectin. == Properties == Like glucose, maltose is a reducing sugar, because the ring of one of the two glucose units can open to present a free aldehyde group; the other one cannot because of the nature of the glycosidic bond. Maltose can be broken down to glucose by the maltase enzyme, which catalyses the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond. Maltose in aqueous solution exhibits mutarotation, because the α and β isomers that are formed by the different conformations of the anomeric carbon have different specific rotations, and in aqueous solutions, these two forms are in equilibrium. Maltose can easily be detected by the Woehlk test or Fearon's test on methylamine. It has a sweet taste, but is only about 30–60% as sweet as sugar, depending on the concentration. A 10% solution of maltose is 35% as sweet as sucrose. == Sources and absorption == Maltose is a malt component, a substance obtained when the grain is softened in water and germinates. It is also present in highly variable quantities in partially hydrolyzed starch products like maltodextrin, corn syrup and acid-thinned starch. Outside of plants, maltose is also (likely) found in honey. In humans, maltose is broken down by various maltase enzymes, providing two glucose molecules that can be further processed: either broken down to provide energy, or stored as glycogen. The lack of the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme in humans causes sucrose intolerance, but complete maltose intolerance is extremely rare because there are four different maltase enzymes. == References == == External links == Media related to Maltose at Wikimedia Commons Maltose, Elmhurst College Virtual Chembook.",Maltobiose,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -7.994086627149954e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.000824230897706002), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.2519829571247101), ('ĠEND', -0.015470264479517937), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003657863999251276)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.029750484973192215), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltose,https://asbe.org/article/maltose/,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Maltose ', [])"
1692,"('Œ±-lactose', 'Œ±-d-lactose', 'Alpha-lactose', 'A-lactose', 'Anhydrous lactose')","Endogenous, Food, Medical"," The disaccharide lactose is an excipient commonly used in pharmaceutical products. The two anomers, α- and β-lactose (α-L/β-L), differ by the orientation of the C-1 hydroxyl group on the glucose unit. In aqueous solution, a mutarotation process leads to an equilibrium of about 40% α-L and 60% β-L at room temperature. Beyond a pharmaceutical excipient in solid products, α-L has immuno-modulatory effects and functions as a major regulator of TIM-3/Gal-9 immune checkpoint, through direct binding to the β-galactoside-binding lectin galectin-9. The blockade of the co-inhibitory checkpoint TIM-3 expressed on T cells with anti-TIM-3 antibodies represents a promising approach to combat different onco-hematological diseases, in particular myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. In parallel, the discovery and development of anti-TIM-3 small molecule ligands is emerging, including peptides, RNA aptamers and a few specifically designed heterocyclic molecules. An alternative option consists of targeting the different ligands of TIM-3, notably Gal-9 recognized by α-lactose. Modulation of the TIM-3/Gal-9 checkpoint can be achieved with both α- and β-lactose. Moreover, lactose is a quasi-pan-galectin ligand, capable of modulating the functions of most of the 16 galectin molecules. The present review provides a complete analysis of the pharmaceutical and galectin-related biological functions of (α/β)-lactose. A focus is made on the capacity of lactose and Gal-9 to modulate both the TIM-3/Gal-9 and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoints in oncology. Modulation of the TIM-3/Gal-9 checkpoint is a promising approach for the treatment of cancers and the role of lactose in this context is discussed. The review highlights the immuno-regulatory functions of lactose, and the benefit of the molecule well beyond its use as a pharmaceutical excipient. It is common to find that some of the lactose in dairy powders and pharmaceutical tablets is present in the unstable amorphous state. Therefore, their crystallization thermodynamics in different solvents are particularly important. In this paper, the solubility of α-lactose monohydrate (α-LM) in 15 mono-solvents such as ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, 1-pentanol, isoamylol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, propanoic acid, acetonitrile, and cyclohexanone was evaluated by using the gravimetric method in the temperature ranges from 274.05 K to 323.05 K at constant pressure (1 atm). In the given temperature range, the solubility of α-LM in these solvents increased with the rising of temperature, the highest solubility of α-LM was found in methanol (2.37 × 104), and the lowest was found in 1-hexanol (0.80 × 105). In addition, the increase of α-LM solubility in isopropanol was the largest. The sequence at 298.15 K was: methanol > 1-butanol > isopropanol > ethanol > 1-propanol > 1-heptanol > isobutanol > propionic acid > 1-pentanol > 1-octanol > acetonitrile > isoamylol > 2-butanol > cyclohexanone > 1-hexanol. Solvent effect analysis shows that the properties of α-LM are more important than those of solvents. The Apelblat equation, λh equation, Wilson model, and NRTL model were used to correlate the experimental values. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and relative average deviation (RAD) of all models were less than 2.68 × 10−2 and 1.41 × 10−6, respectively, implying that the fitted values of four thermodynamic models all agreed well with the experimental values. Moreover, the thermodynamic properties of the dissolution process (i.e., dissolution Gibbs free energy (ΔdisG), molar enthalpy (ΔdisH), and molar entropy (ΔdisS)) for α-LM in selected solvents were determined. The results indicate that ΔdisH/(J/mol) (from 0.2551 to 6.0575) and ΔdisS/(J/mol/K) (from 0.0010 to 0.0207) of α-LM in these solvents are all positive, and the values of ΔdisH and ΔdisS. ΔdisG/(J/mol) (from −0.0184 to −0.6380) are all negative. The values were observed to decrease with rising temperatures, implying that α-LM dissolution is an endothermic, entropy-driven, and spontaneous process. The solid−liquid equilibrium data and dissolution thermodynamics of α-LM were obtained, which provide a basis for industrial production. Lactose is present as an excipient in nearly half of all solid medicines. Despite the assumption of chemical stability, in aqueous solution, the chiral composition of lactose is prone to change. It is not known whether such epimerisation could also occur as solid crystalline α-lactose undergoes thermal desorption of its hydrated water. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the anomeric composition of lactose powders after heating in a differential scanning calorimeter. During thermal analysis, the heating cycles were interrupted to allow anomer-composition analysis by NMR. The onset for monohydrate desorption occurred at 143.8 ± 0.3 °C. Post water-loss, at 160 °C for example, α-lactose suffered partial conversion (11.6 ± 0.9%) to the β-anomer. When held at 160 °C for 60 min this increased to 29.7 ± 0.8% β-anomer (p < 0.05).

1693,"('Terfenadine', '(¬±)-terfenadine', 'Seldane', 'Ternadin', 'Triludan')",Medical,"Terfenadine is an antihistamine formerly used for the treatment of allergic conditions. It was brought to market by Hoechst Marion Roussel (now Sanofi) and was marketed under various brand names, including Seldane in the United States, Triludan in the United Kingdom, and Teldane in Australia. It was superseded by fexofenadine in the 1990s due to the risk of a particular type of disruption of the electrical rhythms of the heart (specifically cardiac arrhythmia caused by QT interval prolongation) and has been withdrawn from markets worldwide.: 53 == Pharmacology == Terfenadine acts as a peripherally-selective antihistamine, or antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor. It is a prodrug, generally completely metabolized to the active form fexofenadine in the liver by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4. Due to its near complete metabolism by the liver immediately after leaving the gut, terfenadine normally is not measurable in the plasma. Terfenadine itself, however, is cardiotoxic at higher doses, while its major active metabolite is not. Terfenadine, in addition to its antihistamine effects, also acts as a potassium channel blocker (Kv11.1 encoded by the gene hERG). Since its active metabolite is not a potassium channel blocker, no cardiotoxicity is associated with fexofenadine. Sudden toxicity is possible even after years of use without problems as a result of an interaction with other medications such as erythromycin, or foods such as grapefruit. The addition of, or a dosage increase in, these CYP3A4 inhibitors makes it harder for the body to metabolize and remove terfenadine. In larger plasma concentrations, it may lead to toxic effects on the heart's rhythm (e.g. ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes). == History == Terfenadine was synthesized by chemists at Richardson–Merrell in 1973 as a potential tranquilizer. However, it was found to be inactive for such purposes as it did not cross the blood–brain barrier or enter the central nervous system. Pharmacologist Richard Kinsolving noticed that terfenadine showed a structural resemblance to the antihistamine diphenhydramine, so terfenadine was tested as an antihistamine. It was found to be a non-sedating antihistamine and was the first such drug to be discovered. In the United States, terfenadine as Seldane was brought to market in 1985 as the first non-sedating antihistamine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In June 1990, evidence of serious ventricular arrhythmias among those taking Seldane prompted the FDA to issue a report on the risk factors associated with concomitant use of the drug with macrolide antibiotics and ketoconazole. Two months later, the FDA required the manufacturer to send a letter to all physicians, alerting them to the problem; in July 1992, the existing precautions were elevated to a black box warning and the issue attracted mass media attention in reports that people with liver disease or who took ketoconazole, an antifungal agent, or the antibiotic erythromycin, could suffer cardiac arrhythmia if they also took Seldane. In January 1997, the same month when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had earlier approved a generic version of Seldane made by IVAX Corporation of Miami, the FDA recommended terfenadine-containing drugs be removed from the market and physicians consider alternative medications for their patients. Seldane (and Seldane-D, terfenadine combined with the decongestant pseudoephedrine) were removed from the U.S. market by their manufacturer in late 1997 after the FDA approval of Allegra-D (fexofenadine/pseudoephedrine). Terfenadine-containing drugs were subsequently removed from the Canadian market in 1999, and are no longer available for prescription in the UK. == References ==",Triludan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00045081099960952997), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005332001601345837), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01417543739080429)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.676292231422849e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terfenadine,https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co8002126/packet-of-10-triludan-terfenadine-60mg-antihista-triludan,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/triludan ', [])"

1695,"('Pancuronium (dibromide)', 'Pancuronium', 'Pavulon', 'Pancuronium dibromide', 'Bromure de pancuronium [inn-french]')",Medical,"Pancuronium (trademarked as Pavulon) is an aminosteroid muscle relaxant with various medical uses. It is used in euthanasia and is used in some states as the second of three drugs administered during lethal injections in the United States. == Mechanism of action == Pancuronium is a typical non-depolarizing curare-mimetic muscle relaxant. It competitively inhibits the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction by blocking the binding of acetylcholine. It has slight vagolytic activity, causing an increase in heart rate, but no ganglioplegic (i.e., blocking ganglions) activity. It is a very potent muscle relaxant drug, with an ED95 (i.e., the dose that causes 95% depression of muscle twitch response) of only 60 μg/kg body weight. Onset of action is relatively slow compared to other similar drugs, in part due to its low dose: an intubating dose takes 3–6 minutes for full effect. Clinical effects (muscle activity lower than 25% of physiological) last for about 100 minutes. The time needed for full (over 90% muscle activity) recovery after single administration is about 120–180 minutes in healthy adults. The effects of pancuronium can be at least partially reversed by anticholinesterasics, such as neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and edrophonium. == Development == Workers at Organon were inspired by the structure of the aminosteroid alkaloid malouetine to develop a series of aminosteroid neuromuscular blockers based on an androstane nucleus, culminating in the development of pancuronium bromide. Pancuronium is designed to mimic the action of two molecules of acetylcholine with the quaternary nitrogen atoms spaced rigidly apart by the steroid rings at a distance of ten atoms (interonium distance). Decamethonium and suxamethonium also have this same interonium distance. == Uses in medicine == Pancuronium is used with general anesthesia in surgery for muscle relaxation and as an aid to intubation or ventilation. It does not have sedative or analgesic effects. Side-effects include moderately raised heart rate and thereby arterial pressure and cardiac output, excessive salivation, apnea and respiratory depression, rashes, flushing, and sweating. The muscular relaxation can be dangerous in the seriously ill and it can accumulate leading to extended weakness. Pancuronium is not preferable in long-term use in ICU-ventilated patients. In Belgium and the Netherlands, pancuronium is recommended in the protocol for euthanasia. After administering sodium thiopental to induce coma, pancuronium is delivered in order to stop breathing. == Uses in execution and suicide == === Procedure === Pancuronium is also used as one component of a lethal injection in administration of the death penalty in some parts of the United States. === Controversy === Like all non-depolarising muscle relaxants, pancuronium has no effect on level of consciousness. Therefore, if the anaesthetic used is insufficient, the individual may be awake but unable to cry out or move due to the effect of the pancuronium. There have been several civil lawsuits alleging similar failures of adequate anaesthesia during general surgical procedures. These have been largely due to improper or insufficient dosages of anaesthetic in concert with normal dosages of muscle relaxants such as pancuronium. In 2007, Michael Munro, a Scottish neonatologist at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, was cleared of malpractice by the General Medical Council Fitness to Practice panel after giving 23 times the standard dose of pancuronium to two dying neonates. Terminally ill, both dying babies were suffering from agonal gasping and violent body spasms, which was highly distressing for the parents to witness. Munro then administered pancuronium to the babies after advising the parents that this would ease their suffering and could also hasten death. It was on record that neither of the children's parents were unhappy with Munro's treatment. Amnesty International has objected to its use in lethal injections on the grounds that it ""may mask the condemned prisoner's suffering during the execution,"" thereby leading observers to conclude that lethal injection is painless, or less cruel than other forms of execution. === Export limitations === The United Kingdom bans the export of pancuronium bromide to the United States due to its use in lethal injections, but not to the Netherlands or Belgium. == Uses in crime == Pancuronium was used in Efren Saldivar's killing spree. It was also used by the Skin Hunters to kill patients in the Polish city of Łódź. Pavulon was also used by Richard Angelo in 1987 to kill at least ten patients under his care at the Good Samaritan Hospital in New York. == See also == Malouetine == References ==",Pavulon,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000276765669696033), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20142610371112823)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancuronium_bromide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Pancuronium bromide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancuronium_bromide?utm_source=openai')])"

Its E number is ""E307"". Vitamin E exists in eight different forms, four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. All feature a chromane ring, with a hydroxyl group that can donate a hydrogen atom to reduce free radicals and a hydrophobic side chain, along with an aromatic ring is situated near the carbonyls in the fatty acyl chains of the phospholipid bilayer, allows for penetration into biological membranes. It is found most in the membrane's non-raft domains, associated with omega-3 and 6 fatty acids, to partially prevent oxidation. The most prevalent form, α-tocopherol, is involved in molecular, cellular, biochemical processes closely related to overall lipoprotein and lipid homeostasis. Compared to the others, α-tocopherol is preferentially absorbed and accumulated in humans. Vitamin E is found in a variety of tissues, being lipid-soluble, and taken up by the body in a wide variety of ways. Ongoing research is believed to be ""critical for manipulation of vitamin E homeostasis in a variety of oxidative stress-related disease conditions in humans."" One of these disease conditions is the α-tocopherol role in the use by malaria parasites to protect themselves from the highly oxidative environment in erythrocytes. A second of these disease conditions is the α-tocopherol antioxidant properties' role cardiovascular heart disease. In preventing LDL (low-density lipoprotein) oxidation, it is able to decrease chances of atherosclerosis and arterial build-up. == Synthesis == To synthesize the ⍺-diastereomer selectively, tocol acetate is transformed to the naturally occurring, kinetically favored α-tocopherol after being catalyzed by the lipase enzyme. This reaction occurs under biological conditions, commonly in the digestive system. == Stereoisomers == α-Tocopherol has three stereocenters, so it is a chiral molecule. The eight stereoisomers of α-tocopherol differ in the configuration of these stereocenters. RRR-α-tocopherol is the natural one. The older name of RRR-α-tocopherol is d-α-tocopherol, but this d/l naming should no longer be used, because whether l-α-tocopherol should mean SSS enantiomer or the SRR diastereomer is not clear, from historical reasons. The SRR may be named 2-epi-α-tocopherol, the diastereomeric mixture of RRR-α-tocopherol and 2-epi-α-tocopherol may be called 2-ambo-α-tocopherol (formerly named dl-α-tocopherol). The mixture of all eight diastereomers is called all-rac-α-tocopherol. The α-Tocopherol is the most active diastereomer biologically, while being maintained at a high level in plasma and tissues of many different animal species. One IU of tocopherol is defined as 2⁄3 milligram of RRR-α-tocopherol (formerly named d-α-tocopherol). 1 IU is also defined as 0.9 mg of an equal mix of the eight stereoisomers, which is a racemic mixture, all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate. This mix of stereoisomers is often called dl-α-tocopheryl acetate. Starting with May 2016, the IU unit is made obsolete, such that 1 mg of ""Vitamin E"" is 1 mg of d-alpha-tocopherol or 2 mg of dl-alpha-tocopherol. == References ==",Alpha-tocopherol,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.7990442514419556), ('OG', -5.796184723294573e-06), ('ENO', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -0.0005532711511477828)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.03593519702553749), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00118900160305202), ('ĠEND', -0.5773072242736816), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.07891817390918732), ('ĠMED', -0.00022968991834204644), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00015746307326480746)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.0019323242595419288), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -2.8206473871250637e-05), (',', -0.0031777136027812958), (' PERSONAL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD,PERSONAL CARE,INDUSTRIAL;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocopherol,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_E ', [])"

It is mostly no longer available. The medication is taken by mouth. Side effects of cyclofenil include liver toxicity among others. It is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and hence is a mixed agonist–antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It has antiestrogenic effects on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and hence can increase sex hormone production and stimulate ovulation. Cyclofenil was introduced for medical use in 1970. It has been mostly discontinued, but remains available in a few countries, including Brazil, Italy, and Japan. It has been used as a doping agent by male athletes. == Medical use == Cyclofenil is used to treat menstrual disturbances and anovulatory infertility caused by insufficiency of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis in women. It has also been used to treat menopausal symptoms. The medication is generally used at a dosage of 400 to 600 mg per day. === Available forms === Cyclofenil has been available in the form of 100, 200, and 400 mg oral tablets. == Non-medical use == Cyclofenil has been used by male athletes to increase testosterone levels. It is not effective for this purpose in women. == Contraindications == Cyclofenil is contraindicated during pregnancy and in those with severe liver disease and unexplained uterine bleeding. == Side effects == Cyclofenil is associated with a relatively high incidence of hepatotoxicity. Biochemical signs of undesirable liver changes have been observed in 35% or more of individuals and 1% of individuals experience overt hepatitis. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Cyclofenil is a SERM, or a mixed agonist and antagonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It is described as a relatively weak/mild SERM. The medication is generally less effective than other SERMs. The medication is an ""impeded estrogen"" and is thought to work as a progonadotropin by blocking the actions of estrogens in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, thereby disinhibiting release of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. In men, cyclofenil can increase testosterone levels due its progonadotropic effects. === Pharmacokinetics === In terms of distribution, cyclofenil acts both centrally and peripherally. The elimination half-life of cyclofenil after a single 200 mg dose is 18 to 29 hours. == Chemistry == Cyclofenil is a nonsteroidal SERM and is closely related structurally to triphenylethylene SERMs like clomifene and tamoxifen. It has been referred to as a diphenylethylene derivative, differing from triphenylethylenes only by the replacement of one of the phenyl rings with a cyclohexane ring. == History == Cyclofenil was first introduced for medical use in 1970 under the brand name Ondogyne in France. Subsequently, it was introduced throughout the world under a variety of other brand names, including its most well-known brand name Sexovid. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Cyclofenil is the English generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, and BANTooltip British Approved Name. === Brand names === Cyclofenil has been marketed under a variety of brand names including Ciclifen, Fertodur, Gyneuro, Klofenil, Menoferil, Menopax, Neoclym, Oginex, Ondonid, Ondogyne, Rehibin, Sexadieno, Sexovar, and Sexovid. === Availability === Cyclofenil remains available today only in Brazil, Italy, and Japan.

Given the limited number of drugs approved by the FDA, there is a need for new therapeutic options. Ezatiostat is a novel agent targeting oxidative stress via inhibition of glutathione S-transferase 1. Herein, the authors summarize the standard of care in order to build the framework for therapeutic advancements. The purpose of this paper is to review the body of preclinical and clinical research literature on the investigational agent ezatiostat hydrochloride (TLK199) for the treatment of MDSs. The article includes details of the pathophysiology, pharmacology, toxicity and efficacy of ezatiostat hydrochloride from controlled studies in patients with myelodysplasia. MDS clonal heterogeneity and clonal architecture complexity has presented a significant technical challenge in developing effective therapies. Ezatiostat offers a unique and specific mechanism to improve the transfusion burden associated with myelodysplasia. Since it is tolerable as a monotherapy, combining ezatiostat with agents such as lenalidomide may have the most potential benefit. Approximately 70% of all patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) present with lower-risk disease. Some of these patients will initially respond to treatment with growth factors to improve anemia but will eventually cease to respond, while others will be resistant to growth factor therapy. Eventually, all lower-risk MDS patients require multiple transfusions and long-term therapy. While some patients may respond briefly to hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, the majority will not, and new therapeutic options are needed for these lower-risk patients. Our previous clinical trials with ezatiostat (ezatiostat hydrochloride, Telentra®, TLK199), a glutathione S-transferase P1-1 inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of low- to intermediate-risk MDS, have shown significant clinical activity, including multilineage responses as well as durable red-blood-cell transfusion independence. It would be of significant clinical benefit to be able to identify patients most likely to respond to ezatiostat before therapy is initiated. We have previously shown that by using gene expression profiling and grouping by response, it is possible to construct a predictive score that indicates the likelihood that patients without deletion 5q will respond to lenalidomide. The success of that study was based in part on the fact that the profile for response was linked to the biology of the disease. RNA was available on 30 patients enrolled in the trial and analyzed for gene expression on the Illumina HT12v4 whole genome array according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene marker analysis was performed. The selection of genes associated with the responders (R) vs. non-responders (NR) phenotype was obtained using a normalized and rescaled mutual information score (NMI). We have shown that an ezatiostat response profile contains two miRNAs that regulate expression of genes known to be implicated in MDS disease pathology. Remarkably, pathway analysis of the response profile revealed that the genes comprising the jun-N-terminal kinase/c-Jun molecular pathway, which is known to be activated by ezatiostat, are under-expressed in patients who respond and over-expressed in patients who were non-responders to the drug, suggesting that both the biology of the disease and the molecular mechanism of action of the drug are positively correlated. Phase 1 testing of ezatiostat, a glutathione S-transferase P1-1 inhibitor, for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome was conducted in a multidose-escalation study. Patients received 10 dose levels (200, 400, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2400, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000 mg) of ezatiostat tablets in divided doses on days 1 to 7 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum of 8 cycles. The safety and pharmacokinetics of ezatiostat were evaluated. Forty-five patients with low to intermediate-2 International Prognostic Scoring System risk myelodysplastic syndrome were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most common grade 1 or 2, respectively, treatment-related adverse events were nonhematologic: nausea (56%, 9%), diarrhea (36%, 7%), vomiting (24%, 7%), abdominal pain (9%, 0%), constipation (4%, 9%), anorexia (3%, 7%), and dyspepsia (3%, 7%). Concentration of the primary active metabolite, TLK236, increased proportionate to ezatiostat dosage. Seventeen hematologic improvement (HI) responses by International Working Group criteria were observed at dose levels of 200 to 6000 mg/day with 11 HI responses at doses of 4000 to 6000 mg/day. HI responses occurred in all lineages including 3 bilineage and 1 complete cytogenetic response. Decreased number of red blood cell and platelet transfusions and in some cases transfusion independence were attained.

1703,"('Isopentanoic acid', 'Delphinic acid', 'Butanoic acid, 3-methyl-', 'Isopropylacetic acid', 'Isovalerianic acid')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Isovaleric acid, also known as 3-methylbutanoic acid or β-methylbutyric acid, is a branched-chain alkyl carboxylic acid with the chemical formula (CH3)2CHCH2CO2H. It is classified as a short-chain fatty acid. Like other low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids, it has an unpleasant odor. The compound occurs naturally and can be found in many foods, such as cheese, soy milk, and apple juice. == History == 3-Methylbutanoic acid is a minor constituent of the perennial flowering plant valerian (Valeriana officinalis), from which it got its trivial name isovaleric acid: an isomer of valeric acid which shares its unpleasant odor. The dried root of this plant has been used medicinally since antiquity. Their chemical identity was first investigated in the 19th century by oxidation of the components of fusel alcohol, which includes the five-carbon amyl alcohols. == Manufacture == In industry, 3-methylbutanoic acid is produced by the hydroformylation of isobutylene with syngas, forming isovaleraldehyde, which is oxidised to the final product. (CH3)2C=CH2 + H2 + CO → (CH3)2CHCH2CHO → 3-methylbutanoic acid == Reactions == 3-Methylbutanoic acid reacts as a typical carboxylic acid: it can form amide, ester, anhydride, and chloride derivatives. The acid chloride is commonly used as the intermediate to obtain the others. The acid has been used to synthesize β-hydroxyisovaleric acid – otherwise known as β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid – via microbial oxidation by the fungus Galactomyces reessii. == Uses == Isovaleric acid has a strong pungent cheesy or sweaty smell, but its volatile esters such as ethyl isovalerate have pleasant odors and are widely used in perfumery. It is also the primary flavor added to wine when made using Brettanomyces yeasts. Other compounds produced by Brettanomyces yeasts include 4-ethylphenol, 4-vinylphenol, and 4-ethylguaiacol. An excess of isovaleric acid in wine is generally seen as a defect, as it can smell sweaty, leathery, or ""like a barnyard"", but in small amounts it can smell smokey, spicy, or medicinal. These phenomena may be prevented by killing any Brettanomyces yeasts, such as by sterile filtration, by the addition of relatively large quantities of sulfur dioxide and sometimes sorbic acid, by mixing in alcoholic spirit to give a fortified wine of sufficient strength to kill all yeast and bacteria, or by pasteurization. Isovaleric acid can also be found in beer, and, excepting some English–style ales, is usually considered a flaw. It can be produced by the oxidation of hop resins, or by Brettanomyces yeasts present. The compound's safety as a food additive was reviewed by an FAO and WHO panel, who concluded that there were no concerns at the likely levels of intake. == Biology == Since isovaleric acid and its esters are natural components of many foods, it is present in mammals including humans. Also, Isovaleryl-coenzyme A is an intermediate in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids. Isovaleric acid is a major component of the cause of intense foot odor, as it is produced by skin bacteria metabolizing leucine and in rare cases a condition called isovaleric acidemia can lead to heightened levels of this metabolite. == Salts and esters == An isovalerate or 3-methylbutanoate ion is (CH3)2CHCH2COO−, the conjugate base of the acid. It is the form found in biological systems at physiological pH. An isovalerate or 3-methylbutanoate compound is a salt or ester of the acid. === Examples === Ethyl isovalerate Menthyl isovalerate Isovaleryl-CoA Testosterone isovalerate == See also == 2-Methylbutanoic acid, an isomer Valeric acid, an isomer == References ==",Isopentanoic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.12774141132831573), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -4.56102097814437e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.5033220648765564), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.03809186443686485), (' PERSONAL', -0.4755193293094635), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.16102489829063416), (' END', -0.004162095487117767), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -3.5716304410016164e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.01266472414135933), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0003579214389901608), ('ĠINDU', -0.2736809551715851), ('ST', -2.753696753643453e-05), ('RI', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.1002691313624382), ('ĠEND', -0.4830775260925293), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4742271602153778)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.22580216825008392)])","('Isopentanoic acid, also known as isovaleric acid, is a naturally occurring compound found in various foods such as vanilla beans, bananas, and honey.

It also appears to have had a statistically significant effect of reducing breast cancer in women according to a study published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute. == Medical uses == === Osteoporosis === In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, lasofoxifene at a dose of 0.5 mg per day was associated with reduced risks of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures, ER-positive breast cancer, coronary heart disease, and stroke but an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events. === Breast cancer === In studies of breast cancer prevention, lasofoxifene showed a 79% reduction in breast cancer incidence and an 83% reduction specific incidence of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers, which is significantly higher than reductions found with the related SERMs tamoxifen and raloxifene. In accordance, a network meta-analysis of SERMs for breast cancer prevention found the highest reduction in risk with lasofoxifene of all the drugs. The reduction was even greater than that observed with aromatase inhibitors, which have generally been found to confer a greater risk reduction than SERMs. It also has shown promise in ESR1 mutant patients with 'approximately 40% of patients harboring this mutation'. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Lasofoxifene selectively binds to both ERα and ERβ with high affinity. Its IC50 for ERα (1.5 nM) is similar to that of estradiol (4.8 nM) and is at least 10-fold higher than those of tamoxifen and raloxifene. === Pharmacokinetics === Lasofoxifene has greatly improved oral bioavailability relative to tamoxifen and raloxifene, and this may also be involved in its greater potency. == Chemistry == Lasofoxifene is a naphthalene derivative and a desmethyl dihydro analogue of nafoxidine. == History == In September 2005, Pfizer received a non-approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding lasofoxifene (trade name Oporia), a selective estrogen receptor modulator for the prevention of osteoporosis. In January 2008, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, through its marketing partner, Pfizer, submitted a New Drug Application for lasofoxifene, which is expected to be marketed under the tradename Fablyn. Lasofoxifene was approved in the EU under the brand name Fablyn by the EMEA in March 2009. == Research == Lasofoxifene is under development by Sermonix Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and dyspareunia associated with vaginal atrophy in the United States and Europe.

This includes multiple myeloma in those who have and have not previously received treatment. It is generally used together with other medications. It is given by injection. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, tiredness, low platelets, fever, numbness, low white blood cells, shortness of breath, rash and abdominal pain. Other severe side effects include low blood pressure, tumour lysis syndrome, heart failure, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. It is in the class of medications known as proteasome inhibitor. It works by inhibiting proteasomes, cellular complexes that break down proteins. Bortezomib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2003 and in the European Union in 2004. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical use == Two open-label trials established the efficacy of bortezomib (with or without dexamethasone) on days 1,4,8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum of eight cycles in heavily pretreated people with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The phase III demonstrated the superiority of bortezomib over a high-dose dexamethasone regimen (e.g. median TTP 6.2 vs 3.5 months, and 1-year survival 80% vs 66%). New studies show that bortezomib may potentially help recover from vincristine treatment in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia, when replacing vincristine in the process. Bortezomib was also evaluated together with other drugs for the treatment of multiple myelomas in adults. It was seen that bortezomib plus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone as well as bortezomib plus melphalan and prednisone may result in a large increase in the progression-free survival. == Adverse effects == Gastro-intestinal effects and asthenia are the most common adverse events. Bortezomib is associated with peripheral neuropathy in 30% of people resulting in pain. This can be worse in people with pre-existing neuropathy. In addition, myelosuppression causing neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can also occur and be dose-limiting. However, these side effects are usually mild relative to bone marrow transplantation and other treatment options for people with advanced disease. Bortezomib is associated with a high rate of shingles, although prophylactic acyclovir can reduce the risk of this. Ocular side effects such as chalazion or hordeolum (stye) may be more common in women and have led to discontinuation of treatment. Acute interstitial nephritis has also been reported. == Drug interactions == Polyphenols derived from green tea extract including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which were expected to have a synergistic effect, instead were found to reduce the effectiveness of bortezomib in cell culture experiments. == Pharmacology == === Structure === The drug is an N-protected dipeptide and can be written as Pyz-Phe-boroLeu, which stands for pyrazinoic acid, phenylalanine and Leucine with a boronic acid instead of a carboxylic acid. === Mechanism === The boron atom in bortezomib is proposed to bind the catalytic site of the 26S proteasome with high affinity and specificity. In normal cells, the proteasome regulates protein expression and function by degradation of ubiquitylated proteins, and also rids the cell of abnormal or misfolded proteins. Clinical and preclinical data support a role for the proteasome in maintaining the immortal phenotype of myeloma cells, and cell-culture and xenograft data support a similar function in solid tumor cancers. While multiple mechanisms are likely to be involved, proteasome inhibition may prevent degradation of pro-apoptotic factors, thereby triggering programmed cell death in neoplastic cells. Bortezomib causes a rapid and dramatic change in the levels of intracellular peptides that are produced by the proteasome. Some intracellular peptides have been shown to be biologically active, and so the effect of bortezomib on the levels of intracellular peptides may contribute to the biological and/or side effects of the drug. === Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics === After subcutaneous administration, peak plasma levels are ~25-50 nM and this peak is sustained for 1-2 hrs. After intravenous injection, peak plasma levels are ~500 nM but only for ~5 minutes, after which the levels rapidly drop as the drug distributes to tissues (volume of distribution is ~500 L). Both routes provide equal drug exposures and generally comparable therapeutic efficacy. Elimination half life is 9–15 hours and the drug is primarily cleared by hepatic metabolism. The pharmacodynamics of bortezomib are determined by quantifying proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells taken from people receiving the drug. == History == Bortezomib was originally made in 1995 at Myogenics. The drug (PS-341) was tested in a small Phase I clinical trial on people with multiple myeloma. It was brought to further clinical trials by Millennium Pharmaceuticals in October 1999. In May 2003, bortezomib (marketed as Velcade by Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in multiple myeloma, based on the results from the SUMMIT Phase II trial. In 2008, bortezomib was approved in the United States for initial treatment of people with multiple myeloma. Bortezomib was previously approved in 2005, for the treatment of people with multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior therapy and in 2003, for the treatment of more refractory multiple myeloma. The 2008 approval was based on an international, multicenter, open label, active-control trial in previously untreated people with symptomatic multiple myeloma. People were randomized to receive either nine cycles of oral melphalan (M) plus prednisone (P) or MP plus bortezomib. People received M (9 mg/m2 ) plus prednisone (60 mg/m2 ) daily for four days every 6 weeks or the same MP schedule with bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m2 iv on days 1, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 of every 6 week cycle for 4 cycles then once weekly for 4 weeks for 5 cycles. Time- to- progression (TTP) was the primary efficacy endpoint. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and response rate (RR) were secondary endpoints. Eligible people were age > 65 years. A total of 682 people were randomized: 338 to receive MP and 344 to the combination of bortezomib plus MP. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the two groups. The trial was stopped following a pre-specified interim analysis showing a statistically significant improvement in TTP with the addition of bortezomib to MP (median 20.7 months) compared with MP (median 15 months) [HR: 0.54 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.70), p= 0.000002]. OS, PFS, and RR also were significantly superior for the bortezomib-MP combination. In August 2014, bortezomib was approved in the United States for the retreatment of adults with multiple myeloma who had previously responded to Velcade therapy and relapsed at least six months following completion of prior treatment. In October 2014, bortezomib was approved in the United States for the treatment of treatment-naïve people with mantle cell lymphoma. A ready-to-use formulation of bortezomib was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2024. == Society and culture == === Economics === In the UK, NICE initially recommended against Velcade in October 2006, due to its cost of about £18,000 per person, and because studies reviewed by NICE reported that it could only extend the life expectancy by an average of six months over standard treatment. However, the company later proposed a performance-linked cost reduction for multiple myeloma, and this was accepted. == References == == External links == ""Bortezomib"". NCI Drug Dictionary.

1706,"('Troglitazone', 'Rezulin', 'Romglizone', 'Prelay', 'Romozin')",Medical,"Troglitazone is an antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory drug, and a member of the drug class of the thiazolidinediones. It was prescribed for people with diabetes mellitus type 2. It was patented in 1983 and approved for medical use in 1997. It was subsequently withdrawn. == Mechanism of action == Troglitazone, like the other thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone), works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARα and – more strongly – PPARγ. Troglitazone also contains an α-Tocopherol moiety, potentially giving it vitamin E-like activity in addition to its PPAR activation. It has been shown to reduce inflammation. Troglitazone use was associated with a decrease of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (IκB). NFκB is an important cellular transcription regulator for the immune response. == History == Troglitazone was developed by Daiichi Sankyo (Japan). In the United States, it was introduced and manufactured by Parke-Davis in the late 1990s but turned out to be associated with an idiosyncratic reaction leading to drug-induced hepatitis. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medical officer assigned to evaluate troglitazone, John Gueriguian, did not recommend its approval due to potentially high liver toxicity; Parke-Davis complained to the FDA, and Gueriguian was subsequently removed from his post. A panel of experts approved it in January 1997. Once the prevalence of adverse liver effects became known, troglitazone was withdrawn from the British market in December 1997, from the United States market in 2000, and from the Japanese market soon afterwards. It did not get approval in the rest of Europe. Troglitazone was developed as the first anti-diabetic drug having a mechanism of action involving the enhancement of insulin resistance. At the time, it was widely believed that such drugs, by addressing the primary metabolic defect associated with Type 2 diabetes, would have numerous benefits including avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia associated with insulin and earlier oral antidiabetic drugs. It was further believed that reducing insulin resistance would potentially reduce the very high rate of cardiovascular disease that is associated with diabetes. Parke-Davis/Warner Lambert submitted the diabetes drug Rezulin for FDA review on July 31, 1996. The medical officer assigned to the review, Dr. John L. Gueriguian, cited Rezulin's potential to harm the liver and the heart, and he questioned its viability in lowering blood sugar for patients with adult-onset diabetes, recommending against the drug's approval. After complaints from the drugmaker, Gueriguian was removed on November 4, 1996, and his review was purged by the FDA. Gueriguian and the company had a single meeting at which Gueriguian used ""intemperate"" language; the company said its objections were based on inappropriate remarks made by Gueriguian. Parke-Davis said at the advisory committee that the risk of liver toxicity was comparable to placebo and that additional data of other studies confirmed this. According to Peter Gøtzsche, when the company provided these additional data one week after approval, they showed a substantially greater risk for liver toxicity. The FDA approved the drug on January 29, 1997, and it appeared in pharmacies in late March. At the time, Dr. Solomon Sobel, a director at the FDA overseeing diabetes drugs, said in a New York Times interview that adverse effects of troglitazone appeared to be rare and relatively mild. Glaxo Wellcome received approval from the British Medicines Control Agency (MCA) to market troglitazone, as Romozin, in July 1997. After reports of sudden liver failure in patients receiving the drug, Parke-Davis and the FDA added warnings to the drug label requiring monthly monitoring of liver enzyme levels. Glaxo Wellcome removed troglitazone from the market in Britain on December 1, 1997. Glaxo Wellcome had licensed the drug from Sankyo Company of Japan and had sold it in Britain from October 1, 1997. On May 17, 1998, a 55-year-old patient named Audrey LaRue Jones died of acute liver failure after taking troglitazone. Importantly, she had been monitored closely by physicians at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a participant in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) diabetes prevention study. This called into question the efficacy of the monitoring strategy. The NIH responded on June 4 by dropping troglitazone from the study. Dr. David J. Graham, an FDA epidemiologist charged with evaluating the drug, warned on March 26, 1999 of the dangers of using it and concluded that patient monitoring was not effective in protecting against liver failure. He estimated that the drug could be linked to over 430 liver failures and that patients incurred 1,200 times greater risk of liver failure when taking Rezulin. Dr. Janet B. McGill, an endocrinologist who had assisted in the Warner–Lambert's early clinical testing of Rezulin, wrote in a March 1, 2000 letter to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.): ""I believe that the company... deliberately omitted reports of liver toxicity and misrepresented serious adverse events experienced by patients in their clinical studies."" On March 21, 2000, the FDA withdrew the drug from the market. Dr. Robert I. Misbin, an FDA medical officer, wrote in a March 3, 2000 letter to Senator John Ashcroft of strong evidence that Rezulin could not be used safely. He was later threatened by the FDA with dismissal. By that time, the drug had been linked to 63 liver-failure deaths and had generated sales of more than $2.1 billion for Warner-Lambert. The drug cost $1,400 a year per patient in 1998. Pfizer, which had acquired Warner-Lambert in February 2000, reported the withdrawal of Rezulin cost $136 million. == Mechanisms of hepatotoxicity == Since the withdrawal in 2000, mechanisms of troglitazone hepatotoxicity have been extensively studied using a variety of in vivo, in vitro, and computational methods. These studies have suggested that hepatotoxicity of troglitazone results from a combination of metabolic and nonmetabolic factors. The nonmetabolic toxicity is a complex function of drug-protein interactions in the liver and biliary system. Initially, the metabolic toxicity was largely associated with reactive metabolite formation from the thiazolidinedione and chromane rings of troglitazone. Moreover, the formation of quinone and o-quinone methide reactive metabolites were proposed to be formed by metabolic oxidation of the hydroxy group (OH group) of the chromane ring. Detailed quantum chemical analysis of the metabolic pathways for troglitazone has shown that quinone reactive metabolite is generated by oxidation of the OH group, but o-quinone methide reactive metabolite is formed by the oxidation of the methyl groups (CH3 groups) ortho to the OH group of the chromane ring. This understanding has been recently used in the design of novel troglitazone derivatives with antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines. == Lawsuits == In 2009, Pfizer resolved all but three of 35,000 claims over its withdrawn diabetes drug Rezulin for a total of about $750 million. Pfizer, which acquired rival Wyeth for almost $64 billion, paid about $500 million to settle Rezulin cases consolidated in federal court in New York, according to court filings. The company also paid as much as $250 million to resolve state-court suits. In 2004, it set aside $955 million to end Rezulin cases. == References == == External links == ""Troglitazone"".

1708,"('Tranexamic acid', 'Trans-4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid', 'Cyklokapron', 'Tranexamsaeure', 'Trans amcha')",Medical,"Tranexamic acid is a medication used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss from major trauma, postpartum bleeding, surgery, tooth removal, nosebleeds, and heavy menstruation. It is also used for hereditary angioedema. It is taken either by mouth, injection into a vein, or by intramuscular injection. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine. It serves as an antifibrinolytic by reversibly binding four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen. This decreases the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, preventing fibrin degradation and preserving the framework of fibrin's matrix structure. Tranexamic acid has roughly eight times the antifibrinolytic activity of an older analogue, ε-aminocaproic acid. Tranexamic acid also directly inhibits the activity of plasmin with weak potency (IC50 = 87 mM), and it can block the active-site of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) with high specificity (Ki = 2 mM), one of the highest among all the serine proteases. Side effects are rare; they include changes in color vision, seizures, blood clots, and allergic reactions. Tranexamic acid appears to be safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic medication. Tranexamic acid was first made in 1962 by Japanese researchers Shosuke and Utako Okamoto. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tranexamic acid is available as a generic drug. == Uses == === Medical uses === Tranexamic acid is frequently used following major trauma. Tranexamic acid is used to prevent and treat blood loss in a variety of situations, such as dental procedures, heavy menstrual bleeding, and surgeries with high risk of blood loss. ==== Trauma ==== Tranexamic acid has been found to decrease the risk of death due to any cause in people who have significant bleeding due to trauma. It is most effective if taken within the first three hours following major trauma. It also decreases the risk of death if given within the first three hours of brain injury. ==== Menstrual bleeding ==== Tranexamic acid is sometimes used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. When taken by mouth it both safely and effectively treats regularly occurring heavy menstrual bleeding and improves quality of life. Another study demonstrated that the dose does not need to be adjusted in females who are between ages 12 and 16. In a 10-year study, tranexamic acid and other oral medicines (mefenamic acid) were found to be as effective as the levonorgestrel intrauterine coil; the same proportion of women had not had surgery for heavy bleeding and had similar improvements in their quality of life. ==== Childbirth ==== Tranexamic acid is sometimes used (often in conjunction with oxytocin) to reduce bleeding after childbirth. Death due to postpartum bleeding is reduced in women receiving tranexamic acid. ==== Surgery ==== Tranexamic acid is sometimes used in orthopedic surgery to reduce blood loss, to the extent of reducing or altogether abolishing the need for perioperative blood transfusion. It is of proven value in clearing the field of surgery and reducing blood loss when given before or after surgery. Drain and number of transfusions are reduced. In surgical corrections of craniosynostosis in children it reduces the need for blood transfusions. In spinal surgery (e.g., scoliosis), correction with posterior spinal fusion using instrumentation, to prevent excessive blood loss. In cardiac surgery, both with and without cardiopulmonary bypass (e.g., coronary artery bypass surgery), it is used to prevent excessive blood loss. ==== Dentistry ==== In the United States, tranexamic acid is FDA-approved for short-term use in people with severe bleeding disorders who are about to have dental surgery. Tranexamic acid is used for a short period before and after the surgery to prevent major blood loss and decrease the need for blood transfusions. Tranexamic acid is used in dentistry in the form of a 5% mouth rinse after extractions or surgery in patients with prolonged bleeding time; e.g., from acquired or inherited disorders. In China, tranexamic acid is allowed in over-the-counter toothpaste, with six products using the drug. As of 2018, there are no limits on dosage, nor requirements for labeling the concentration. 0.05% TXA in toothpaste is allowed OTC in Hong Kong. <5% TXA in over-the-counter toothpaste is first patented and marketed by Lion Corporation in Japan, where it is still sold. Presence of unauthorized TXA has led to the Canadian recall of a Yunnan Baiyao toothpaste in 2019. ==== Hematology ==== There is not enough evidence to support the routine use of tranexamic acid to prevent bleeding in people with blood cancers. However, several trials are currently assessing this use of tranexamic acid. For people with inherited bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand's disease), tranexamic acid is often given. It has also been recommended for people with acquired bleeding disorders (e.g., directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) to treat serious bleeding. ==== Nosebleeds ==== The use of tranexamic acid, applied directly to the area that is bleeding or taken by mouth, appears useful to treat nose bleeding compared to packing the nose with cotton pledgets alone. It decreases the risk of rebleeding within 10 days. === Cosmetic Uses === Tranexamic acid can be used in skincare products as a cosmetic active to reduce the appearance of inflammation and hyperpigmentation. Tranexamic acid is a zwitterion amino acid, and has a low permeability coefficient in the stratum corneum. Tranexamic acid can be combined with penetration enhancers and microneedling to overcome this limitation. Cosmetic uses may also employ lipophilic derivatives of tranexamic acid (ester prodrugs like Cetyl tranexamate mesylate) that are not zwitterionic and thus have improved skin permeability. == Contraindications == Allergic to tranexamic acid History of seizures History of venous or arterial thromboembolism or active thromboembolic disease Severe kidney impairment due to accumulation of the medication, dose adjustment is required in mild or moderate kidney impairment == Adverse effects == Side effects are rare. Reported adverse events include seizures, changes in color vision, blood clots, and allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. Whether the risk of venous thromboembolism (blood clots) is increased is a matter of debate. The risk is mentioned in the product literature, and they were reported in post marketing experience. Despite this, and the inhibitory effect of tranexamic acid on blood clot breakdown, large studies of the use of tranexamic acid have not shown an increase in the risk of venous or arterial thrombosis, even in people who had previously experienced thrombosis under other circumstances. === Special populations === For pregnancy, no harm has been found in animal studies. Small amounts appear in breast milk if taken during lactation. == Society and culture == Tranexamic acid was first synthesized in 1962 by Japanese researchers Shosuke and Utako Okamoto. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. === Brand names === Tranexamic acid is marketed in the US and Australia in tablet form as Lysteda and in Australia, Sweden and Jordan it is marketed in an IV form and tablet form as Cyklokapron, in the UK and Sweden as Cyclo-F. In the UK it is also marketed as Femstrual, in Asia as Transcam, in Bangladesh as Intrax & Tracid, in India as Pause, in Pakistan as Transamin, in Indonesia as Kalnex, in South America as Espercil, in Japan as Nicolda, in France, Poland, Belgium, and Romania as Exacyl and in Egypt as Kapron. In the Philippines, its capsule form is marketed as Hemostan and in Israel as Hexakapron. === Legal status === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tranexamic acid oral tablets (brand name Lysteda) for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in November 2009. In March 2011, the status of tranexamic acid for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding was changed in the UK, from POM (Prescription only Medicines) to P (Pharmacy Medicines) and became available over the counter in UK pharmacies under the brand names of Cyklo-F and Femstrual. ==== Research ==== Tranexamic acid might alleviate neuroinflammation in some experimental settings. Tranexamic acid can be used in case of postpartum hemorrhage; it can decrease the risk of death due to bleeding by one third according to the WHO. Tentative evidence supports the use of tranexamic acid in hemoptysis. In hereditary angioedema In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the frequency of epistaxis in patients with severe and frequent nosebleed episodes from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. In melasma: tranexamic acid is sometimes used in skin whitening as a topical agent, injected into a lesion, or taken by mouth, both alone and as an adjunct to laser therapy; as of 2017 its safety seemed reasonable but its efficacy for this purpose was uncertain because there had been no large scale randomized controlled studies nor long term follow-up studies. It is allowed as a quasi-drug for skin whitening in Japan. In hyphema: tranexamic acid is effective in reducing the risk of secondary hemorrhage outcomes in people with traumatic hyphema. In liver resection: tranexamic acid did not reduce bleeding or transfusions but did increase complications. == References ==",Cyklokapron,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.8889261304575484e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.00010783452307805419), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -4.625213477993384e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.47416841983795166), ('ĠPERSON', -0.04967720806598663), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008645131252706051)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pfizermedicalinformation.com](https://www.pfizermedicalinformation.com/cyklokapron/indications-usage?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=131, start_index=9, title='CYKLOKAPRON® (tranexamic acid) Indications and Usage | Pfizer Medical Information - US', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pfizermedicalinformation.com/cyklokapron/indications-usage?utm_source=openai')])"

1711,"('Carboxin', 'Carboxine', 'Fenoxan', 'Carbathiin', 'Vitavax')",Medical,"Carboxin is a narrow-spectrum fungicide used as a seed treatment in agriculture to protect crops from fungal diseases. It was first marketed by Uniroyal in 1969 using their brand name Vitavax. The compound is an anilide which combines a heterocyclic acid with aniline to give an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (SDHI). == Synthesis == The first synthesis of carboxin was disclosed in patents filed by Uniroyal. Ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate is treated with 2-mercaptoethanol and base, followed by cyclisation and water removal under acidic conditions. The resultant ethyl ester of the 1,4-oxathiine heterocycle is then formed into an amide with aniline using standard conditions via the carboxylic acid and acid chloride. This gives carboxin in high overall yield. The compound has been crystallised in two polymorphic forms, which have equal biological activity. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action of carboxin was not established until several years after it was first reported in 1966. In the period 1971–1975, evidence grew that it acted by inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDHI), and later work showed that it binds to the quinone reduction site of the enzyme complex, preventing ubiquinone from doing so. As a consequence, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain cannot function. The compound was an early example of a fungicide exhibiting systemic movement from its application site on the crop plant to protect newly-growing tissue. == Usage == Owing to its systemic properties, carboxin is suitable for use as a seed treatment to give fungal control on the growing crop. However, it controls a relatively narrow range of species: mainly Tilletia spp. (known as bunts and smuts) in cereal crops and Rhizoctonia in cotton and vegetables. The compound was used in Australia, the EU, the UK and the US but registration has lapsed in the EU. It was reported to have had a total worldwide sales of $75 million in 2014.: 405 == Human safety == Carboxin has low mammalian toxicity and is not persistent in the environment. One of its metabolites, the sulfone, is also active as an SDHI and has been sold as the fungicide oxycarboxin. == Analogues == Carboxin was the first SDHI-type fungicide and its invention triggered a search for compounds with improved properties, particularly for active ingredients which would control a broader range of economically-important diseases. Boscalid, introduced in 2003, retained the aniline amide part-structure but with a pyridine ring in place of the 1,4-oxathiine and with a second benzene ring attached to the aniline portion. By 2014, it had annual sales of $390 million. As of 2023, over 18 related amides had been marketed, with seven of these being derivatives of 3-(Difluoromethyl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid. The Fungicides Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) assigns fungicides into classes so as to facilitate resistance management and SDHI form one group. == Brands == Carboxin is the ISO common name for the active ingredient which is formulated into the branded product sold to end-users. Vitavax is the brand name originally used by Uniroyal but as the compound's patents expired it became available to many other manufacturers and has been sold under multiple names. == References ==",Vitavax,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.018302250653505325), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014242545701563358)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=12, title='Carboxin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxin?utm_source=openai')])"
1712,"('Glucose', 'Dextrose', 'Dglucose', '(2r,3s,4r,5r)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanal', 'Aldehydo-d-glucose')","Endogenous, Medical","Glucose is a sugar with the molecular formula C6H12O6, which is often abbreviated as Glc. It is overall the most abundant monosaccharide, a subcategory of carbohydrates. It is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight. It is used by plants to make cellulose, the most abundant carbohydrate in the world, for use in cell walls, and by all living organisms to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cell as energy. In energy metabolism, glucose is the most important source of energy in all organisms. Glucose for metabolism is stored as a polymer, in plants mainly as amylose and amylopectin, and in animals as glycogen. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar. The naturally occurring form is d-glucose, while its stereoisomer l-glucose is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts and is less biologically active. Glucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form. Glucose is naturally occurring and is found in its free state in fruits and other parts of plants. In animals, it is released from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucose, as intravenous sugar solution, is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is also on the list in combination with sodium chloride (table salt). The name glucose is derived from Ancient Greek γλεῦκος (gleûkos) 'wine, must', from γλυκύς (glykýs) 'sweet'. The suffix -ose is a chemical classifier denoting a sugar. == History == Glucose was first isolated from raisins in 1747 by the German chemist Andreas Marggraf. Glucose was discovered in grapes by another German chemist – Johann Tobias Lowitz – in 1792, and distinguished as being different from cane sugar (sucrose). Glucose is the term coined by Jean Baptiste Dumas in 1838, which has prevailed in the chemical literature. Friedrich August Kekulé proposed the term dextrose (from the Latin dexter, meaning ""right""), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, l-fructose (usually referred to as d-fructose) (a ketohexose) and l-glucose (l-glucose) turn linearly polarized light to the left. The earlier notation according to the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light (d and l-nomenclature) was later abandoned in favor of the d- and l-notation, which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric center farthest from the carbonyl group, and in concordance with the configuration of d- or l-glyceraldehyde. Since glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms, a correct understanding of its chemical makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in organic chemistry. This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of Emil Fischer, a German chemist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his findings. The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff's theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules. Between 1891 and 1894, Fischer established the stereochemical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible isomers, applying Van 't Hoff equation of asymmetrical carbon atoms. The names initially referred to the natural substances. Their enantiomers were given the same name with the introduction of systematic nomenclatures, taking into account absolute stereochemistry (e.g. Fischer nomenclature, d/l nomenclature). For the discovery of the metabolism of glucose Otto Meyerhof received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1922. Hans von Euler-Chelpin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Arthur Harden in 1929 for their ""research on the fermentation of sugar and their share of enzymes in this process"". In 1947, Bernardo Houssay (for his discovery of the role of the pituitary gland in the metabolism of glucose and the derived carbohydrates) as well as Carl and Gerty Cori (for their discovery of the conversion of glycogen from glucose) received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In 1970, Luis Leloir was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of glucose-derived sugar nucleotides in the biosynthesis of carbohydrates. == Chemical and physical properties == Glucose forms white or colorless solids that are highly soluble in water and acetic acid but poorly soluble in methanol and ethanol. They melt at 146 °C (295 °F) (α) and 150 °C (302 °F) (beta), decompose starting at 188 °C (370 °F) with release of various volatile products, ultimately leaving a residue of carbon. Glucose has a pKa value of 12.16 at 25 °C (77 °F) in water. With six carbon atoms, it is classed as a hexose, a subcategory of the monosaccharides. d-Glucose is one of the sixteen aldohexose stereoisomers. The d-isomer, d-glucose, also known as dextrose, occurs widely in nature, but the l-isomer, l-glucose, does not. Glucose can be obtained by hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as milk sugar (lactose), cane sugar (sucrose), maltose, cellulose, glycogen, etc. Dextrose is commonly commercially manufactured from starches, such as corn starch in the US and Japan, from potato and wheat starch in Europe, and from tapioca starch in tropical areas. The manufacturing process uses hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled pH in a jet followed by further enzymatic depolymerization. Unbonded glucose is one of the main ingredients of honey. The term dextrose is often used in a clinical (related to patient's health status) or nutritional context (related to dietary intake, such as food labels or dietary guidelines), while ""glucose"" is used in a biological or physiological context (chemical processes and molecular interactions), but both terms refer to the same molecule, specifically D-glucose. Dextrose monohydrate is the hydrated form of D-glucose, meaning that it is a glucose molecule with an additional water molecule attached. Its chemical formula is C6H12O6 · H2O. Dextrose monohydrate is also called hydrated D-glucose, and commonly manufactured from plant starches. Dextrose monohydrate is utilized as the predominant type of dextrose in food applications, such as beverage mixes—it is a common form of glucose widely used as a nutrition supplement in production of foodstuffs. Dextrose monohydrate is primarily consumed in North America as a corn syrup or high-fructose corn syrup. Anhydrous dextrose, on the other hand, is glucose that does not have any water molecules attached to it. Anhydrous chemical substances are commonly produced by eliminating water from a hydrated substance through methods such as heating or drying up (desiccation). Dextrose monohydrate can be dehydrated to anhydrous dextrose in industrial setting. Dextrose monohydrate is composed of approximately 9.5% water by mass; through the process of dehydration, this water content is eliminated to yield anhydrous (dry) dextrose. Anhydrous dextrose has the chemical formula C6H12O6, without any water molecule attached which is the same as glucose. Anhydrous dextrose on open air tends to absorb moisture and transform to the monohydrate, and it is more expensive to produce. Anhydrous dextrose (anhydrous D-glucose) has increased stability and increased shelf life, has medical applications, such as in oral glucose tolerance test. Whereas molecular weight (molar mass) for D-glucose monohydrate is 198.17 g/mol, that for anhydrous D-glucose is 180.16 g/mol The density of these two forms of glucose is also different. In terms of chemical structure, glucose is a monosaccharide, that is, a simple sugar. Glucose contains six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form—due to the presence of alcohol and aldehyde or ketone functional groups, the form having the straight chain can easily convert into a chair-like hemiacetal ring structure commonly found in carbohydrates. === Structure and nomenclature === Glucose is present in solid form as a monohydrate with a closed pyran ring (α-D-glucopyranose monohydrate, sometimes known less precisely by dextrose hydrate). In aqueous solution, on the other hand, it is an open-chain to a small extent and is present predominantly as α- or β-pyranose, which interconvert. From aqueous solutions, the three known forms can be crystallized: α-glucopyranose, β-glucopyranose and α-glucopyranose monohydrate. Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides lactose and sucrose (cane or beet sugar), of oligosaccharides such as raffinose and of polysaccharides such as starch, amylopectin, glycogen, and cellulose. The glass transition temperature of glucose is 31 °C (88 °F) and the Gordon–Taylor constant (an experimentally determined constant for the prediction of the glass transition temperature for different mass fractions of a mixture of two substances) is 4.5. === Open-chain form === A open-chain form of glucose makes up less than 0.02% of the glucose molecules in an aqueous solution at equilibrium. The rest is one of two cyclic hemiacetal forms. In its open-chain form, the glucose molecule has an open (as opposed to cyclic) unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms, where C-1 is part of an aldehyde group H(C=O)−. Therefore, glucose is also classified as an aldose, or an aldohexose. The aldehyde group makes glucose a reducing sugar giving a positive reaction with the Fehling test. === Cyclic forms === In solutions, the open-chain form of glucose (either ""D-"" or ""L-"") exists in equilibrium with several cyclic isomers, each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution, however, more than 99% of glucose molecules exist as pyranose forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25%, and furanose forms exist in negligible amounts. The terms ""glucose"" and ""D-glucose"" are generally used for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by an intramolecular nucleophilic addition reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either the C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a hemiacetal linkage, −C(OH)H−O−. The reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a six-membered heterocyclic system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar (hence ""-ose"") containing a derivatised pyran skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and C-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether furan. In either case, each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is −(C(CH2OH)HOH)−H or −(CHOH)−H respectively). The ring-closing reaction can give two products, denoted ""α-"" and ""β-"". When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the Haworth projection, the designation ""α-"" means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the −CH2OH group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane (a trans arrangement), while ""β-"" means that they are on the same side of the plane (a cis arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer D-glucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: α-D-glucopyranose, β-D-glucopyranose, α-D-glucofuranose, and β-D-glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid catalysis. The other open-chain isomer L-glucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of L-glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding D-glucose. The glucopyranose ring (α or β) can assume several non-planar shapes, analogous to the ""chair"" and ""boat"" conformations of cyclohexane. Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes, analogous to the ""envelope"" conformations of cyclopentane. In the solid state, only the glucopyranose forms are observed. Some derivatives of glucofuranose, such as 1,2-O-isopropylidene-D-glucofuranose are stable and can be obtained pure as crystalline solids. For example, reaction of α-D-glucose with para-tolylboronic acid H3C−(C6H4)−B(OH)2 reforms the normal pyranose ring to yield the 4-fold ester α-D-glucofuranose-1,2:3,5-bis(p-tolylboronate). === Mutarotation === Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different −OH group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the α and β forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium. The open-chain form is thermodynamically unstable, and it spontaneously isomerizes to the cyclic forms. (Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not observed in practice.) In solutions at room temperature, the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called mutarotation. Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of α:β 36:64. The ratio would be α:β 11:89 if it were not for the influence of the anomeric effect. Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to 0 °C (32 °F). === Optical activity === Whether in water or the solid form, d-(+)-glucose is dextrorotatory, meaning it will rotate the direction of polarized light clockwise as seen looking toward the light source. The effect is due to the chirality of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, l-(−)-glucose, is levorotatory (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five tautomers. The d- prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral centre has the same handedness as that of d-glyceraldehyde (which was so labelled because it is dextrorotatory). The fact that d-glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centres, not just of C-5; some of the other d-aldohexoses are levorotatory. The conversion between the two anomers can be observed in a polarimeter since pure α-d-glucose has a specific rotation angle of +112.2° mL/(dm·g), pure β-d-glucose of +17.5° mL/(dm·g). When equilibrium has been reached after a certain time due to mutarotation, the angle of rotation is +52.7° mL/(dm·g). By adding acid or base, this transformation is much accelerated. The equilibration takes place via the open-chain aldehyde form. === Isomerisation === In dilute sodium hydroxide or other dilute bases, the monosaccharides mannose, glucose and fructose interconvert (via a Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda–Van Ekenstein transformation), so that a balance between these isomers is formed. This reaction proceeds via an enediol: == Biochemical properties == Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide. Glucose is also the most widely used aldohexose in most living organisms. One possible explanation for this is that glucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the amine groups of proteins. This reaction—glycation—impairs or destroys the function of many proteins, e.g. in glycated hemoglobin. Glucose's low rate of glycation can be attributed to its having a more stable cyclic form compared to other aldohexoses, which means it spends less time than they do in its reactive open-chain form. The reason for glucose having the most stable cyclic form of all the aldohexoses is that its hydroxy groups (with the exception of the hydroxy group on the anomeric carbon of d-glucose) are in the equatorial position. Presumably, glucose is the most abundant natural monosaccharide because it is less glycated with proteins than other monosaccharides. Another hypothesis is that glucose, being the only d-aldohexose that has all five hydroxy substituents in the equatorial position in the form of β-d-glucose, is more readily accessible to chemical reactions,: 194, 199 for example, for esterification: 363 or acetal formation. For this reason, d-glucose is also a highly preferred building block in natural polysaccharides (glycans). Polysaccharides that are composed solely of glucose are termed glucans. Glucose is produced by plants through photosynthesis using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and can be used by all living organisms as an energy and carbon source. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and others which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and chitin, which are components of the cell wall in plants or fungi and arthropods, respectively. These polymers, when consumed by animals, fungi and bacteria, are degraded to glucose using enzymes. All animals are also able to produce glucose themselves from certain precursors as the need arises. Neurons, cells of the renal medulla and erythrocytes depend on glucose for their energy production. In adult humans, there is about 18 g (0.63 oz) of glucose, of which about 4 g (0.14 oz) is present in the blood. Approximately 180–220 g (6.3–7.8 oz) of glucose is produced in the liver of an adult in 24 hours. Many of the long-term complications of diabetes (e.g., blindness, kidney failure, and peripheral neuropathy) are probably due to the glycation of proteins or lipids. In contrast, enzyme-regulated addition of sugars to protein is called glycosylation and is essential for the function of many proteins. === Uptake === Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins T1R2 and T1R3 makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food—about 300 g (11 oz) per day is produced by conversion of food, but it is also synthesized from other metabolites in the body's cells. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens in part already during chewing by means of amylase, which is contained in saliva, as well as by maltase, lactase, and sucrase on the brush border of the small intestine. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates and can be split off from them using certain enzymes. Glucosidases, a subgroup of the glycosidases, first catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing terminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded by specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often derived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide chains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named after cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin), and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides, there are maltase, lactase, sucrase, trehalase, and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code for glycosidases. They have functions in the digestion and degradation of glycogen, sphingolipids, mucopolysaccharides, and poly(ADP-ribose). Humans do not produce cellulases, chitinases, or trehalases, but the bacteria in the gut microbiota do. In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins from the major facilitator superfamily. In the small intestine (more precisely, in the jejunum), glucose is taken up into the intestinal epithelium with the help of glucose transporters via a secondary active transport mechanism called sodium ion-glucose symport via sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). Further transfer occurs on the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelial cells via the glucose transporter GLUT2, as well uptake into liver cells, kidney cells, cells of the islets of Langerhans, neurons, astrocytes, and tanycytes. Glucose enters the liver via the portal vein and is stored there as a cellular glycogen. In the liver cell, it is phosphorylated by glucokinase at position 6 to form glucose 6-phosphate, which cannot leave the cell. Glucose 6-phosphatase can convert glucose 6-phosphate back into glucose exclusively in the liver, so the body can maintain a sufficient blood glucose concentration. In other cells, uptake happens by passive transport through one of the 14 GLUT proteins. In the other cell types, phosphorylation occurs through a hexokinase, whereupon glucose can no longer diffuse out of the cell. The glucose transporter GLUT1 is produced by most cell types and is of particular importance for nerve cells and pancreatic β-cells. GLUT3 is highly expressed in nerve cells. Glucose from the bloodstream is taken up by GLUT4 from muscle cells (of the skeletal muscle and heart muscle) and fat cells. GLUT14 is expressed exclusively in testicles. Excess glucose is broken down and converted into fatty acids, which are stored as triglycerides. In the kidneys, glucose in the urine is absorbed via SGLT1 and SGLT2 in the apical cell membranes and transmitted via GLUT2 in the basolateral cell membranes. About 90% of kidney glucose reabsorption is via SGLT2 and about 3% via SGLT1. === Biosynthesis === In plants and some prokaryotes, glucose is a product of photosynthesis. Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of polymeric forms of glucose like glycogen (in animals and mushrooms) or starch (in plants). The cleavage of glycogen is termed glycogenolysis, the cleavage of starch is called starch degradation. The metabolic pathway that begins with molecules containing two to four carbon atoms (C) and ends in the glucose molecule containing six carbon atoms is called gluconeogenesis and occurs in all living organisms. The smaller starting materials are the result of other metabolic pathways. Ultimately almost all biomolecules come from the assimilation of carbon dioxide in plants and microbes during photosynthesis.: 359 The free energy of formation of α-d-glucose is 917.2 kilojoules per mole.: 59 In humans, gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver and kidney, but also in other cell types. In the liver about 150 g (5.3 oz) of glycogen are stored, in skeletal muscle about 250 g (8.8 oz). However, the glucose released in muscle cells upon cleavage of the glycogen can not be delivered to the circulation because glucose is phosphorylated by the hexokinase, and a glucose-6-phosphatase is not expressed to remove the phosphate group. Unlike for glucose, there is no transport protein for glucose-6-phosphate. Gluconeogenesis allows the organism to build up glucose from other metabolites, including lactate or certain amino acids, while consuming energy. The renal tubular cells can also produce glucose. Glucose also can be found outside of living organisms in the ambient environment. Glucose concentrations in the atmosphere are detected via collection of samples by aircraft and are known to vary from location to location. For example, glucose concentrations in atmospheric air from inland China range from 0.8 to 20.1 pg/L, whereas east coastal China glucose concentrations range from 10.3 to 142 pg/L. === Glucose degradation === In humans, glucose is metabolized by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Glycolysis is used by all living organisms,: 551 with small variations, and all organisms generate energy from the breakdown of monosaccharides. In the further course of the metabolism, it can be completely degraded via oxidative decarboxylation, the citric acid cycle (synonym Krebs cycle) and the respiratory chain to water and carbon dioxide. If there is not enough oxygen available for this, the glucose degradation in animals occurs anaerobic to lactate via lactic acid fermentation and releases much less energy. Muscular lactate enters the liver through the bloodstream in mammals, where gluconeogenesis occurs (Cori cycle). With a high supply of glucose, the metabolite acetyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle can also be used for fatty acid synthesis. Glucose is also used to replenish the body's glycogen stores, which are mainly found in liver and skeletal muscle. These processes are hormonally regulated. In other living organisms, other forms of fermentation can occur. The bacterium Escherichia coli can grow on nutrient media containing glucose as the sole carbon source.: 59 In some bacteria and, in modified form, also in archaea, glucose is degraded via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. With Glucose, a mechanism for gene regulation was discovered in E. coli, the catabolite repression (formerly known as glucose effect). Use of glucose as an energy source in cells is by either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. The first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose by a hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate. The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged phosphate group prevents glucose 6-phosphate from easily crossing the cell membrane. Furthermore, addition of the high-energy phosphate group activates glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis. In anaerobic respiration, one glucose molecule produces a net gain of two ATP molecules (four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis through substrate-level phosphorylation, but two are required by enzymes used during the process). In aerobic respiration, a molecule of glucose is much more profitable in that a maximum net production of 30 or 32 ATP molecules (depending on the organism) is generated. Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. Tumor cells often grow comparatively quickly and consume an above-average amount of glucose by glycolysis, which leads to the formation of lactate, the end product of fermentation in mammals, even in the presence of oxygen. This is called the Warburg effect. For the increased uptake of glucose in tumors various SGLT and GLUT are overly produced. In yeast, ethanol is fermented at high glucose concentrations, even in the presence of oxygen (which normally leads to respiration rather than fermentation). This is called the Crabtree effect. Glucose can also degrade to form carbon dioxide through abiotic means. This has been demonstrated to occur experimentally via oxidation and hydrolysis at 22 °C and a pH of 2.5. === Energy source === Glucose is a ubiquitous fuel in biology. It is used as an energy source in organisms, from bacteria to humans, through either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration (in bacteria), or fermentation. Glucose is the human body's key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, providing about 3.75 kilocalories (16 kilojoules) of food energy per gram. Breakdown of carbohydrates (e.g., starch) yields mono- and disaccharides, most of which is glucose. Through glycolysis and later in the reactions of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, glucose is oxidized to eventually form carbon dioxide and water, yielding energy mostly in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The insulin reaction, and other mechanisms, regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood. The physiological caloric value of glucose, depending on the source, is 16.2 kilojoules per gram or 15.7 kJ/g (3.74 kcal/g). The high availability of carbohydrates from plant biomass has led to a variety of methods during evolution, especially in microorganisms, to utilize glucose for energy and carbon storage. Differences exist in which end product can no longer be used for energy production. The presence of individual genes, and their gene products, the enzymes, determine which reactions are possible. The metabolic pathway of glycolysis is used by almost all living beings. An essential difference in the use of glycolysis is the recovery of NADPH as a reductant for anabolism that would otherwise have to be generated indirectly. Glucose and oxygen supply almost all the energy for the brain, so its availability influences psychological processes. When glucose is low, psychological processes requiring mental effort (e.g., self-control, effortful decision-making) are impaired. In the brain, which is dependent on glucose and oxygen as the major source of energy, the glucose concentration is usually 4 to 6 mM (5 mM equals 90 mg/dL), but decreases to 2 to 3 mM when fasting. Confusion occurs below 1 mM and coma at lower levels. The glucose in the blood is called blood sugar. Blood sugar levels are regulated by glucose-binding nerve cells in the hypothalamus. In addition, glucose in the brain binds to glucose receptors of the reward system in the nucleus accumbens. The binding of glucose to the sweet receptor on the tongue induces a release of various hormones of energy metabolism, either through glucose or through other sugars, leading to an increased cellular uptake and lower blood sugar levels. Artificial sweeteners do not lower blood sugar levels. The blood sugar content of a healthy person in the short-time fasting state, e.g. after overnight fasting, is about 70 to 100 mg/dL of blood (4 to 5.5 mM). In blood plasma, the measured values are about 10–15% higher. In addition, the values in the arterial blood are higher than the concentrations in the venous blood since glucose is absorbed into the tissue during the passage of the capillary bed. Also in the capillary blood, which is often used for blood sugar determination, the values are sometimes higher than in the venous blood. The glucose content of the blood is regulated by the hormones insulin, incretin and glucagon. Insulin lowers the glucose level, glucagon increases it. Furthermore, the hormones adrenaline, thyroxine, glucocorticoids, somatotropin and adrenocorticotropin lead to an increase in the glucose level. There is also a hormone-independent regulation, which is referred to as glucose autoregulation. After food intake the blood sugar concentration increases. Values over 180 mg/dL in venous whole blood are pathological and are termed hyperglycemia, values below 40 mg/dL are termed hypoglycaemia. When needed, glucose is released into the bloodstream by glucose-6-phosphatase from glucose-6-phosphate originating from liver and kidney glycogen, thereby regulating the homeostasis of blood glucose concentration. In ruminants, the blood glucose concentration is lower (60 mg/dL in cattle and 40 mg/dL in sheep), because the carbohydrates are converted more by their gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids. Some glucose is converted to lactic acid by astrocytes, which is then utilized as an energy source by brain cells; some glucose is used by intestinal cells and red blood cells, while the rest reaches the liver, adipose tissue and muscle cells, where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen (under the influence of insulin). Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent; muscle cell glycogen is not returned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes. In fat cells, glucose is used to power reactions that synthesize some fat types and have other purposes. Glycogen is the body's ""glucose energy storage"" mechanism, because it is much more ""space efficient"" and less reactive than glucose itself. As a result of its importance in human health, glucose is an analyte in glucose tests that are common medical blood tests. Eating or fasting prior to taking a blood sample has an effect on analyses for glucose in the blood; a high fasting glucose blood sugar level may be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes mellitus. The glycemic index is an indicator of the speed of resorption and conversion to blood glucose levels from ingested carbohydrates, measured as the area under the curve of blood glucose levels after consumption in comparison to glucose (glucose is defined as 100). The clinical importance of the glycemic index is controversial, as foods with high fat contents slow the resorption of carbohydrates and lower the glycemic index, e.g. ice cream. An alternative indicator is the insulin index, measured as the impact of carbohydrate consumption on the blood insulin levels. The glycemic load is an indicator for the amount of glucose added to blood glucose levels after consumption, based on the glycemic index and the amount of consumed food. === Precursor === Organisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. Starch, cellulose, and glycogen (""animal starch"") are common glucose polymers (polysaccharides). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen) serve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and chitin, which is made from a derivative of glucose) have structural roles. Oligosaccharides of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores. These include lactose, the predominant sugar in milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and sucrose, another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and fructose. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and lipids in a process called glycosylation. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use phosphorylated glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond. Other than its direct use as a monomer, glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into lipids. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid). In living organisms, glucose is converted to several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various metabolic pathways. Among them, all other monosaccharides such as fructose (via the polyol pathway), mannose (the epimer of glucose at position 2), galactose (the epimer at position 4), fucose, various uronic acids and the amino sugars are produced from glucose. In addition to the phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate, which is part of the glycolysis, glucose can be oxidized during its degradation to glucono-1,5-lactone. Glucose is used in some bacteria as a building block in the trehalose or the dextran biosynthesis and in animals as a building block of glycogen. Glucose can also be converted from bacterial xylose isomerase to fructose. In addition, glucose metabolites produce all nonessential amino acids, sugar alcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, fatty acids, cholesterol and nucleic acids. Finally, glucose is used as a building block in the glycosylation of proteins to glycoproteins, glycolipids, peptidoglycans, glycosides and other substances (catalyzed by glycosyltransferases) and can be cleaved from them by glycosidases. == Pathology == === Diabetes === Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance. The pancreas is the organ responsible for the secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions. If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes. To monitor the body's response to blood glucose-lowering therapy, glucose levels can be measured. Blood glucose monitoring can be performed by multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) – for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person's body to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream. === Hypoglycemia management === Individuals with diabetes or other conditions that result in low blood sugar often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms. One sugar commonly used is glucose, often in the form of glucose tablets (glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or more other ingredients as a binder), hard candy, or sugar packet. == Sources == Most dietary carbohydrates contain glucose, either as their only building block (as in the polysaccharides starch and glycogen), or together with another monosaccharide (as in the hetero-polysaccharides sucrose and lactose). Unbound glucose is one of the main ingredients of honey. Glucose is extremely abundant and has been isolated from a variety of natural sources across the world, including male cones of the coniferous tree Wollemia nobilis in Rome, the roots of Ilex asprella plants in China, and straws from rice in California. == Commercial production == Glucose is produced industrially from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis using glucose amylase or by the use of acids. Enzymatic hydrolysis has largely displaced acid-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions. The result is glucose syrup (enzymatically with more than 90% glucose in the dry matter) with an annual worldwide production volume of 20 million tonnes (as of 2011). This is the reason for the former common name ""starch sugar"". The amylases most often come from Bacillus licheniformis or Bacillus subtilis (strain MN-385), which are more thermostable than the originally used enzymes. Starting in 1982, pullulanases from Aspergillus niger were used in the production of glucose syrup to convert amylopectin to starch (amylose), thereby increasing the yield of glucose. The reaction is carried out at a pH = 4.6–5.2 and a temperature of 55–60 °C. Corn syrup has between 20% and 95% glucose in the dry matter. The Japanese form of the glucose syrup, Mizuame, is made from sweet potato or rice starch. Maltodextrin contains about 20% glucose. Many crops can be used as the source of starch. Maize, rice, wheat, cassava, potato, barley, sweet potato, corn husk and sago are all used in various parts of the world. In the United States, corn starch (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Some commercial glucose occurs as a component of invert sugar, a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose that is produced from sucrose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolyzed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical. === Conversion to fructose === In the US, almost exclusively corn (more precisely, corn syrup) is used as glucose source for the production of isoglucose, which is a mixture of glucose and fructose, since fructose has a higher sweetening power – with same physiological calorific value of 374 kilocalories per 100 g. The annual world production of isoglucose is 8 million tonnes (as of 2011). When made from corn syrup, the final product is high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). == Commercial usage == Glucose is mainly used for the production of fructose and of glucose-containing foods. In foods, it is used as a sweetener, humectant, to increase the volume and to create a softer mouthfeel. Various sources of glucose, such as grape juice (for wine) or malt (for beer), are used for fermentation to ethanol during the production of alcoholic beverages. Most soft drinks in the US use HFCS-55 (with a fructose content of 55% in the dry mass), while most other HFCS-sweetened foods in the US use HFCS-42 (with a fructose content of 42% in the dry mass). In Mexico, on the other hand, soft drinks are sweetened by cane sugar, which has a higher sweetening power. In addition, glucose syrup is used, inter alia, in the production of confectionery such as candies, toffee and fondant. Typical chemical reactions of glucose when heated under water-free conditions are caramelization and, in presence of amino acids, the Maillard reaction. In addition, various organic acids can be biotechnologically produced from glucose, for example by fermentation with Clostridium thermoaceticum to produce acetic acid, with Penicillium notatum for the production of araboascorbic acid, with Rhizopus delemar for the production of fumaric acid, with Aspergillus niger for the production of gluconic acid, with Candida brumptii to produce isocitric acid, with Aspergillus terreus for the production of itaconic acid, with Pseudomonas fluorescens for the production of 2-ketogluconic acid, with Gluconobacter suboxydans for the production of 5-ketogluconic acid, with Aspergillus oryzae for the production of kojic acid, with Lactobacillus delbrueckii for the production of lactic acid, with Lactobacillus brevis for the production of malic acid, with Propionibacter shermanii for the production of propionic acid, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the production of pyruvic acid and with Gluconobacter suboxydans for the production of tartaric acid. Potent, bioactive natural products like triptolide that inhibit mammalian transcription via inhibition of the XPB subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH has been recently reported as a glucose conjugate for targeting hypoxic cancer cells with increased glucose transporter expression. Recently, glucose has been gaining commercial use as a key component of ""kits"" containing lactic acid and insulin intended to induce hypoglycemia and hyperlactatemia to combat different cancers and infections. == Analysis == When a glucose molecule is to be detected at a certain position in a larger molecule, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography analysis or lectin immunostaining is performed with concanavalin A reporter enzyme conjugate, which binds only glucose or mannose. === Classical qualitative detection reactions === These reactions have only historical significance: ==== Fehling test ==== The Fehling test is a classic method for the detection of aldoses. Due to mutarotation, glucose is always present to a small extent as an open-chain aldehyde. By adding the Fehling reagents (Fehling (I) solution and Fehling (II) solution), the aldehyde group is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, while the Cu2+ tartrate complex is reduced to Cu+ and forms a brick red precipitate (Cu2O). ==== Tollens test ==== In the Tollens test, after addition of ammoniacal AgNO3 to the sample solution, glucose reduces Ag+ to elemental silver. ==== Barfoed test ==== In Barfoed's test, a solution of dissolved copper acetate, sodium acetate and acetic acid is added to the solution of the sugar to be tested and subsequently heated in a water bath for a few minutes. Glucose and other monosaccharides rapidly produce a reddish color and reddish brown copper(I) oxide (Cu2O). ==== Nylander's test ==== As a reducing sugar, glucose reacts in the Nylander's test. ==== Other tests ==== Upon heating a dilute potassium hydroxide solution with glucose to 100 °C, a strong reddish browning and a caramel-like odor develops. Concentrated sulfuric acid dissolves dry glucose without blackening at room temperature forming sugar sulfuric acid. In a yeast solution, alcoholic fermentation produces carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2.0454 molecules of glucose to one molecule of CO2. Glucose forms a black mass with stannous chloride. In an ammoniacal silver solution, glucose (as well as lactose and dextrin) leads to the deposition of silver. In an ammoniacal lead acetate solution, white lead glycoside is formed in the presence of glucose, which becomes less soluble on cooking and turns brown. In an ammoniacal copper solution, yellow copper oxide hydrate is formed with glucose at room temperature, while red copper oxide is formed during boiling (same with dextrin, except for with an ammoniacal copper acetate solution). With Hager's reagent, glucose forms mercury oxide during boiling. An alkaline bismuth solution is used to precipitate elemental, black-brown bismuth with glucose. Glucose boiled in an ammonium molybdate solution turns the solution blue. A solution with indigo carmine and sodium carbonate destains when boiled with glucose. === Instrumental quantification === ==== Refractometry and polarimetry ==== In concentrated solutions of glucose with a low proportion of other carbohydrates, its concentration can be determined with a polarimeter. For sugar mixtures, the concentration can be determined with a refractometer, for example in the Oechsle determination in the course of the production of wine. ==== Photometric enzymatic methods in solution ==== The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic reaction (Trinder reaction) of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine to a purple dye. ==== Photometric test-strip method ==== The test-strip method employs the above-mentioned enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic acid to form hydrogen peroxide. The reagents are immobilised on a polymer matrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at 510 nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows routine blood sugar determination by nonscientists. In addition to the reaction of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry at higher wavelengths (550 nm, 750 nm). ==== Amperometric glucose sensor ==== The electroanalysis of glucose is also based on the enzymatic reaction mentioned above. The produced hydrogen peroxide can be amperometrically quantified by anodic oxidation at a potential of 600 mV. The GOx is immobilized on the electrode surface or in a membrane placed close to the electrode. Precious metals such as platinum or gold are used in electrodes, as well as carbon nanotube electrodes, which e.g. are doped with boron. Cu–CuO nanowires are also used as enzyme-free amperometric electrodes, reaching a detection limit of 50 μmol/L. A particularly promising method is the so-called ""enzyme wiring"", where the electron flowing during the oxidation is transferred via a molecular wire directly from the enzyme to the electrode. ==== Other sensory methods ==== There are a variety of other chemical sensors for measuring glucose. Given the importance of glucose analysis in the life sciences, numerous optical probes have also been developed for saccharides based on the use of boronic acids, which are particularly useful for intracellular sensory applications where other (optical) methods are not or only conditionally usable. In addition to the organic boronic acid derivatives, which often bind highly specifically to the 1,2-diol groups of sugars, there are also other probe concepts classified by functional mechanisms which use selective glucose-binding proteins (e.g. concanavalin A) as a receptor. Furthermore, methods were developed which indirectly detect the glucose concentration via the concentration of metabolized products, e.g. by the consumption of oxygen using fluorescence-optical sensors. Finally, there are enzyme-based concepts that use the intrinsic absorbance or fluorescence of (fluorescence-labeled) enzymes as reporters. ==== Copper iodometry ==== Glucose can be quantified by copper iodometry. === Chromatographic methods === In particular, for the analysis of complex mixtures containing glucose, e.g. in honey, chromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography are often used in combination with mass spectrometry. Taking into account the isotope ratios, it is also possible to reliably detect honey adulteration by added sugars with these methods. Derivatization using silylation reagents is commonly used. Also, the proportions of di- and trisaccharides can be quantified. ==== In vivo analysis ==== Glucose uptake in cells of organisms is measured with 2-deoxy-D-glucose or fluorodeoxyglucose. (18F)fluorodeoxyglucose is used as a tracer in positron emission tomography in oncology and neurology, where it is by far the most commonly used diagnostic agent. == References == == External links == Media related to Glucose at Wikimedia Commons",Dextrose,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.09464572370052338), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -5.438573680294212e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -2.1888679839321412e-05), (' FOOD', -0.17977967858314514), (',', -0.0003362966235727072), (' MED', -0.0022558800410479307), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.8136376142501831), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -4.23184028477408e-05), ('ĠMED', -0.48104745149612427), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.04861355945467949), ('ĠEND', -0.005294231232255697), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00863910373300314)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.008615042082965374), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0031777136027812958), (' MED', -0.0007266097818501294), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([bellchem.com](https://www.bellchem.com/news/utilizing-dextrose-in-multiple-industries?utm_source=openai), [palvifze.com](https://www.palvifze.com/Blog/detail/application-of-dextrose-monohydrate-in-food-and-medicine?utm_source=openai), [americaninternationalingredients.com](https://www.americaninternationalingredients.com/ingredient-categories/sweeteners/dextrose/?utm_source=openai), [independentchemical.com](https://independentchemical.com/blogs/dextrose-for-food-pharmaceutical-and-industrial-applications-20105.aspx?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=585, start_index=42, title='Utilizing Dextrose in Multiple Industries — Bell Chem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.bellchem.com/news/utilizing-dextrose-in-multiple-industries?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=585, start_index=42, title='Application of Dextrose Monohydrate in Food and Medicine', type='url_citation', url='https://www.palvifze.com/Blog/detail/application-of-dextrose-monohydrate-in-food-and-medicine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=585, start_index=42, title='Dextrose - American International Ingredients, Inc.', type='url_citation', url='https://www.americaninternationalingredients.com/ingredient-categories/sweeteners/dextrose/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=585, start_index=42, title='Dextrose for food, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications', type='url_citation', url='https://independentchemical.com/blogs/dextrose-for-food-pharmaceutical-and-industrial-applications-20105.aspx?utm_source=openai')])"
1713,"('Glucose', 'Levoglucose', 'Lglucose', '(2s,3r,4s,5s)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanal', 'Aldehydo-l-glucose')","Endogenous, Medical","Glucose is a sugar with the molecular formula C6H12O6, which is often abbreviated as Glc. It is overall the most abundant monosaccharide, a subcategory of carbohydrates. It is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight. It is used by plants to make cellulose, the most abundant carbohydrate in the world, for use in cell walls, and by all living organisms to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cell as energy. In energy metabolism, glucose is the most important source of energy in all organisms. Glucose for metabolism is stored as a polymer, in plants mainly as amylose and amylopectin, and in animals as glycogen. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar. The naturally occurring form is d-glucose, while its stereoisomer l-glucose is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts and is less biologically active. Glucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form. Glucose is naturally occurring and is found in its free state in fruits and other parts of plants. In animals, it is released from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucose, as intravenous sugar solution, is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is also on the list in combination with sodium chloride (table salt). The name glucose is derived from Ancient Greek γλεῦκος (gleûkos) 'wine, must', from γλυκύς (glykýs) 'sweet'. The suffix -ose is a chemical classifier denoting a sugar. == History == Glucose was first isolated from raisins in 1747 by the German chemist Andreas Marggraf. Glucose was discovered in grapes by another German chemist – Johann Tobias Lowitz – in 1792, and distinguished as being different from cane sugar (sucrose). Glucose is the term coined by Jean Baptiste Dumas in 1838, which has prevailed in the chemical literature. Friedrich August Kekulé proposed the term dextrose (from the Latin dexter, meaning ""right""), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, l-fructose (usually referred to as d-fructose) (a ketohexose) and l-glucose (l-glucose) turn linearly polarized light to the left. The earlier notation according to the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light (d and l-nomenclature) was later abandoned in favor of the d- and l-notation, which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric center farthest from the carbonyl group, and in concordance with the configuration of d- or l-glyceraldehyde. Since glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms, a correct understanding of its chemical makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in organic chemistry. This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of Emil Fischer, a German chemist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his findings. The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff's theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules. Between 1891 and 1894, Fischer established the stereochemical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible isomers, applying Van 't Hoff equation of asymmetrical carbon atoms. The names initially referred to the natural substances. Their enantiomers were given the same name with the introduction of systematic nomenclatures, taking into account absolute stereochemistry (e.g. Fischer nomenclature, d/l nomenclature). For the discovery of the metabolism of glucose Otto Meyerhof received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1922. Hans von Euler-Chelpin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Arthur Harden in 1929 for their ""research on the fermentation of sugar and their share of enzymes in this process"". In 1947, Bernardo Houssay (for his discovery of the role of the pituitary gland in the metabolism of glucose and the derived carbohydrates) as well as Carl and Gerty Cori (for their discovery of the conversion of glycogen from glucose) received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In 1970, Luis Leloir was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of glucose-derived sugar nucleotides in the biosynthesis of carbohydrates. == Chemical and physical properties == Glucose forms white or colorless solids that are highly soluble in water and acetic acid but poorly soluble in methanol and ethanol. They melt at 146 °C (295 °F) (α) and 150 °C (302 °F) (beta), decompose starting at 188 °C (370 °F) with release of various volatile products, ultimately leaving a residue of carbon. Glucose has a pKa value of 12.16 at 25 °C (77 °F) in water. With six carbon atoms, it is classed as a hexose, a subcategory of the monosaccharides. d-Glucose is one of the sixteen aldohexose stereoisomers. The d-isomer, d-glucose, also known as dextrose, occurs widely in nature, but the l-isomer, l-glucose, does not. Glucose can be obtained by hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as milk sugar (lactose), cane sugar (sucrose), maltose, cellulose, glycogen, etc. Dextrose is commonly commercially manufactured from starches, such as corn starch in the US and Japan, from potato and wheat starch in Europe, and from tapioca starch in tropical areas. The manufacturing process uses hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled pH in a jet followed by further enzymatic depolymerization. Unbonded glucose is one of the main ingredients of honey. The term dextrose is often used in a clinical (related to patient's health status) or nutritional context (related to dietary intake, such as food labels or dietary guidelines), while ""glucose"" is used in a biological or physiological context (chemical processes and molecular interactions), but both terms refer to the same molecule, specifically D-glucose. Dextrose monohydrate is the hydrated form of D-glucose, meaning that it is a glucose molecule with an additional water molecule attached. Its chemical formula is C6H12O6 · H2O. Dextrose monohydrate is also called hydrated D-glucose, and commonly manufactured from plant starches. Dextrose monohydrate is utilized as the predominant type of dextrose in food applications, such as beverage mixes—it is a common form of glucose widely used as a nutrition supplement in production of foodstuffs. Dextrose monohydrate is primarily consumed in North America as a corn syrup or high-fructose corn syrup. Anhydrous dextrose, on the other hand, is glucose that does not have any water molecules attached to it. Anhydrous chemical substances are commonly produced by eliminating water from a hydrated substance through methods such as heating or drying up (desiccation). Dextrose monohydrate can be dehydrated to anhydrous dextrose in industrial setting. Dextrose monohydrate is composed of approximately 9.5% water by mass; through the process of dehydration, this water content is eliminated to yield anhydrous (dry) dextrose. Anhydrous dextrose has the chemical formula C6H12O6, without any water molecule attached which is the same as glucose. Anhydrous dextrose on open air tends to absorb moisture and transform to the monohydrate, and it is more expensive to produce. Anhydrous dextrose (anhydrous D-glucose) has increased stability and increased shelf life, has medical applications, such as in oral glucose tolerance test. Whereas molecular weight (molar mass) for D-glucose monohydrate is 198.17 g/mol, that for anhydrous D-glucose is 180.16 g/mol The density of these two forms of glucose is also different. In terms of chemical structure, glucose is a monosaccharide, that is, a simple sugar. Glucose contains six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form—due to the presence of alcohol and aldehyde or ketone functional groups, the form having the straight chain can easily convert into a chair-like hemiacetal ring structure commonly found in carbohydrates. === Structure and nomenclature === Glucose is present in solid form as a monohydrate with a closed pyran ring (α-D-glucopyranose monohydrate, sometimes known less precisely by dextrose hydrate). In aqueous solution, on the other hand, it is an open-chain to a small extent and is present predominantly as α- or β-pyranose, which interconvert. From aqueous solutions, the three known forms can be crystallized: α-glucopyranose, β-glucopyranose and α-glucopyranose monohydrate. Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides lactose and sucrose (cane or beet sugar), of oligosaccharides such as raffinose and of polysaccharides such as starch, amylopectin, glycogen, and cellulose. The glass transition temperature of glucose is 31 °C (88 °F) and the Gordon–Taylor constant (an experimentally determined constant for the prediction of the glass transition temperature for different mass fractions of a mixture of two substances) is 4.5. === Open-chain form === A open-chain form of glucose makes up less than 0.02% of the glucose molecules in an aqueous solution at equilibrium. The rest is one of two cyclic hemiacetal forms. In its open-chain form, the glucose molecule has an open (as opposed to cyclic) unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms, where C-1 is part of an aldehyde group H(C=O)−. Therefore, glucose is also classified as an aldose, or an aldohexose. The aldehyde group makes glucose a reducing sugar giving a positive reaction with the Fehling test. === Cyclic forms === In solutions, the open-chain form of glucose (either ""D-"" or ""L-"") exists in equilibrium with several cyclic isomers, each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution, however, more than 99% of glucose molecules exist as pyranose forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25%, and furanose forms exist in negligible amounts. The terms ""glucose"" and ""D-glucose"" are generally used for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by an intramolecular nucleophilic addition reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either the C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a hemiacetal linkage, −C(OH)H−O−. The reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a six-membered heterocyclic system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar (hence ""-ose"") containing a derivatised pyran skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and C-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether furan. In either case, each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is −(C(CH2OH)HOH)−H or −(CHOH)−H respectively). The ring-closing reaction can give two products, denoted ""α-"" and ""β-"". When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the Haworth projection, the designation ""α-"" means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the −CH2OH group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane (a trans arrangement), while ""β-"" means that they are on the same side of the plane (a cis arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer D-glucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: α-D-glucopyranose, β-D-glucopyranose, α-D-glucofuranose, and β-D-glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid catalysis. The other open-chain isomer L-glucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of L-glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding D-glucose. The glucopyranose ring (α or β) can assume several non-planar shapes, analogous to the ""chair"" and ""boat"" conformations of cyclohexane. Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes, analogous to the ""envelope"" conformations of cyclopentane. In the solid state, only the glucopyranose forms are observed. Some derivatives of glucofuranose, such as 1,2-O-isopropylidene-D-glucofuranose are stable and can be obtained pure as crystalline solids. For example, reaction of α-D-glucose with para-tolylboronic acid H3C−(C6H4)−B(OH)2 reforms the normal pyranose ring to yield the 4-fold ester α-D-glucofuranose-1,2:3,5-bis(p-tolylboronate). === Mutarotation === Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different −OH group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the α and β forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium. The open-chain form is thermodynamically unstable, and it spontaneously isomerizes to the cyclic forms. (Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not observed in practice.) In solutions at room temperature, the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called mutarotation. Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of α:β 36:64. The ratio would be α:β 11:89 if it were not for the influence of the anomeric effect. Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to 0 °C (32 °F). === Optical activity === Whether in water or the solid form, d-(+)-glucose is dextrorotatory, meaning it will rotate the direction of polarized light clockwise as seen looking toward the light source. The effect is due to the chirality of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, l-(−)-glucose, is levorotatory (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five tautomers. The d- prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral centre has the same handedness as that of d-glyceraldehyde (which was so labelled because it is dextrorotatory). The fact that d-glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centres, not just of C-5; some of the other d-aldohexoses are levorotatory. The conversion between the two anomers can be observed in a polarimeter since pure α-d-glucose has a specific rotation angle of +112.2° mL/(dm·g), pure β-d-glucose of +17.5° mL/(dm·g). When equilibrium has been reached after a certain time due to mutarotation, the angle of rotation is +52.7° mL/(dm·g). By adding acid or base, this transformation is much accelerated. The equilibration takes place via the open-chain aldehyde form. === Isomerisation === In dilute sodium hydroxide or other dilute bases, the monosaccharides mannose, glucose and fructose interconvert (via a Lobry de Bruyn–Alberda–Van Ekenstein transformation), so that a balance between these isomers is formed. This reaction proceeds via an enediol: == Biochemical properties == Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide. Glucose is also the most widely used aldohexose in most living organisms. One possible explanation for this is that glucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the amine groups of proteins. This reaction—glycation—impairs or destroys the function of many proteins, e.g. in glycated hemoglobin. Glucose's low rate of glycation can be attributed to its having a more stable cyclic form compared to other aldohexoses, which means it spends less time than they do in its reactive open-chain form. The reason for glucose having the most stable cyclic form of all the aldohexoses is that its hydroxy groups (with the exception of the hydroxy group on the anomeric carbon of d-glucose) are in the equatorial position. Presumably, glucose is the most abundant natural monosaccharide because it is less glycated with proteins than other monosaccharides. Another hypothesis is that glucose, being the only d-aldohexose that has all five hydroxy substituents in the equatorial position in the form of β-d-glucose, is more readily accessible to chemical reactions,: 194, 199 for example, for esterification: 363 or acetal formation. For this reason, d-glucose is also a highly preferred building block in natural polysaccharides (glycans). Polysaccharides that are composed solely of glucose are termed glucans. Glucose is produced by plants through photosynthesis using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and can be used by all living organisms as an energy and carbon source. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and others which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and chitin, which are components of the cell wall in plants or fungi and arthropods, respectively. These polymers, when consumed by animals, fungi and bacteria, are degraded to glucose using enzymes. All animals are also able to produce glucose themselves from certain precursors as the need arises. Neurons, cells of the renal medulla and erythrocytes depend on glucose for their energy production. In adult humans, there is about 18 g (0.63 oz) of glucose, of which about 4 g (0.14 oz) is present in the blood. Approximately 180–220 g (6.3–7.8 oz) of glucose is produced in the liver of an adult in 24 hours. Many of the long-term complications of diabetes (e.g., blindness, kidney failure, and peripheral neuropathy) are probably due to the glycation of proteins or lipids. In contrast, enzyme-regulated addition of sugars to protein is called glycosylation and is essential for the function of many proteins. === Uptake === Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins T1R2 and T1R3 makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food—about 300 g (11 oz) per day is produced by conversion of food, but it is also synthesized from other metabolites in the body's cells. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens in part already during chewing by means of amylase, which is contained in saliva, as well as by maltase, lactase, and sucrase on the brush border of the small intestine. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates and can be split off from them using certain enzymes. Glucosidases, a subgroup of the glycosidases, first catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing terminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded by specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often derived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide chains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named after cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin), and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides, there are maltase, lactase, sucrase, trehalase, and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code for glycosidases. They have functions in the digestion and degradation of glycogen, sphingolipids, mucopolysaccharides, and poly(ADP-ribose). Humans do not produce cellulases, chitinases, or trehalases, but the bacteria in the gut microbiota do. In order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins from the major facilitator superfamily. In the small intestine (more precisely, in the jejunum), glucose is taken up into the intestinal epithelium with the help of glucose transporters via a secondary active transport mechanism called sodium ion-glucose symport via sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). Further transfer occurs on the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelial cells via the glucose transporter GLUT2, as well uptake into liver cells, kidney cells, cells of the islets of Langerhans, neurons, astrocytes, and tanycytes. Glucose enters the liver via the portal vein and is stored there as a cellular glycogen. In the liver cell, it is phosphorylated by glucokinase at position 6 to form glucose 6-phosphate, which cannot leave the cell. Glucose 6-phosphatase can convert glucose 6-phosphate back into glucose exclusively in the liver, so the body can maintain a sufficient blood glucose concentration. In other cells, uptake happens by passive transport through one of the 14 GLUT proteins. In the other cell types, phosphorylation occurs through a hexokinase, whereupon glucose can no longer diffuse out of the cell. The glucose transporter GLUT1 is produced by most cell types and is of particular importance for nerve cells and pancreatic β-cells. GLUT3 is highly expressed in nerve cells. Glucose from the bloodstream is taken up by GLUT4 from muscle cells (of the skeletal muscle and heart muscle) and fat cells. GLUT14 is expressed exclusively in testicles. Excess glucose is broken down and converted into fatty acids, which are stored as triglycerides. In the kidneys, glucose in the urine is absorbed via SGLT1 and SGLT2 in the apical cell membranes and transmitted via GLUT2 in the basolateral cell membranes. About 90% of kidney glucose reabsorption is via SGLT2 and about 3% via SGLT1. === Biosynthesis === In plants and some prokaryotes, glucose is a product of photosynthesis. Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of polymeric forms of glucose like glycogen (in animals and mushrooms) or starch (in plants). The cleavage of glycogen is termed glycogenolysis, the cleavage of starch is called starch degradation. The metabolic pathway that begins with molecules containing two to four carbon atoms (C) and ends in the glucose molecule containing six carbon atoms is called gluconeogenesis and occurs in all living organisms. The smaller starting materials are the result of other metabolic pathways. Ultimately almost all biomolecules come from the assimilation of carbon dioxide in plants and microbes during photosynthesis.: 359 The free energy of formation of α-d-glucose is 917.2 kilojoules per mole.: 59 In humans, gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver and kidney, but also in other cell types. In the liver about 150 g (5.3 oz) of glycogen are stored, in skeletal muscle about 250 g (8.8 oz). However, the glucose released in muscle cells upon cleavage of the glycogen can not be delivered to the circulation because glucose is phosphorylated by the hexokinase, and a glucose-6-phosphatase is not expressed to remove the phosphate group. Unlike for glucose, there is no transport protein for glucose-6-phosphate. Gluconeogenesis allows the organism to build up glucose from other metabolites, including lactate or certain amino acids, while consuming energy. The renal tubular cells can also produce glucose. Glucose also can be found outside of living organisms in the ambient environment. Glucose concentrations in the atmosphere are detected via collection of samples by aircraft and are known to vary from location to location. For example, glucose concentrations in atmospheric air from inland China range from 0.8 to 20.1 pg/L, whereas east coastal China glucose concentrations range from 10.3 to 142 pg/L. === Glucose degradation === In humans, glucose is metabolized by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Glycolysis is used by all living organisms,: 551 with small variations, and all organisms generate energy from the breakdown of monosaccharides. In the further course of the metabolism, it can be completely degraded via oxidative decarboxylation, the citric acid cycle (synonym Krebs cycle) and the respiratory chain to water and carbon dioxide. If there is not enough oxygen available for this, the glucose degradation in animals occurs anaerobic to lactate via lactic acid fermentation and releases much less energy. Muscular lactate enters the liver through the bloodstream in mammals, where gluconeogenesis occurs (Cori cycle). With a high supply of glucose, the metabolite acetyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle can also be used for fatty acid synthesis. Glucose is also used to replenish the body's glycogen stores, which are mainly found in liver and skeletal muscle. These processes are hormonally regulated. In other living organisms, other forms of fermentation can occur. The bacterium Escherichia coli can grow on nutrient media containing glucose as the sole carbon source.: 59 In some bacteria and, in modified form, also in archaea, glucose is degraded via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. With Glucose, a mechanism for gene regulation was discovered in E. coli, the catabolite repression (formerly known as glucose effect). Use of glucose as an energy source in cells is by either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. The first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose by a hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate. The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged phosphate group prevents glucose 6-phosphate from easily crossing the cell membrane. Furthermore, addition of the high-energy phosphate group activates glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis. In anaerobic respiration, one glucose molecule produces a net gain of two ATP molecules (four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis through substrate-level phosphorylation, but two are required by enzymes used during the process). In aerobic respiration, a molecule of glucose is much more profitable in that a maximum net production of 30 or 32 ATP molecules (depending on the organism) is generated. Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. Tumor cells often grow comparatively quickly and consume an above-average amount of glucose by glycolysis, which leads to the formation of lactate, the end product of fermentation in mammals, even in the presence of oxygen. This is called the Warburg effect. For the increased uptake of glucose in tumors various SGLT and GLUT are overly produced. In yeast, ethanol is fermented at high glucose concentrations, even in the presence of oxygen (which normally leads to respiration rather than fermentation). This is called the Crabtree effect. Glucose can also degrade to form carbon dioxide through abiotic means. This has been demonstrated to occur experimentally via oxidation and hydrolysis at 22 °C and a pH of 2.5. === Energy source === Glucose is a ubiquitous fuel in biology. It is used as an energy source in organisms, from bacteria to humans, through either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration (in bacteria), or fermentation. Glucose is the human body's key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, providing about 3.75 kilocalories (16 kilojoules) of food energy per gram. Breakdown of carbohydrates (e.g., starch) yields mono- and disaccharides, most of which is glucose. Through glycolysis and later in the reactions of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, glucose is oxidized to eventually form carbon dioxide and water, yielding energy mostly in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The insulin reaction, and other mechanisms, regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood. The physiological caloric value of glucose, depending on the source, is 16.2 kilojoules per gram or 15.7 kJ/g (3.74 kcal/g). The high availability of carbohydrates from plant biomass has led to a variety of methods during evolution, especially in microorganisms, to utilize glucose for energy and carbon storage. Differences exist in which end product can no longer be used for energy production. The presence of individual genes, and their gene products, the enzymes, determine which reactions are possible. The metabolic pathway of glycolysis is used by almost all living beings. An essential difference in the use of glycolysis is the recovery of NADPH as a reductant for anabolism that would otherwise have to be generated indirectly. Glucose and oxygen supply almost all the energy for the brain, so its availability influences psychological processes. When glucose is low, psychological processes requiring mental effort (e.g., self-control, effortful decision-making) are impaired. In the brain, which is dependent on glucose and oxygen as the major source of energy, the glucose concentration is usually 4 to 6 mM (5 mM equals 90 mg/dL), but decreases to 2 to 3 mM when fasting. Confusion occurs below 1 mM and coma at lower levels. The glucose in the blood is called blood sugar. Blood sugar levels are regulated by glucose-binding nerve cells in the hypothalamus. In addition, glucose in the brain binds to glucose receptors of the reward system in the nucleus accumbens. The binding of glucose to the sweet receptor on the tongue induces a release of various hormones of energy metabolism, either through glucose or through other sugars, leading to an increased cellular uptake and lower blood sugar levels. Artificial sweeteners do not lower blood sugar levels. The blood sugar content of a healthy person in the short-time fasting state, e.g. after overnight fasting, is about 70 to 100 mg/dL of blood (4 to 5.5 mM). In blood plasma, the measured values are about 10–15% higher. In addition, the values in the arterial blood are higher than the concentrations in the venous blood since glucose is absorbed into the tissue during the passage of the capillary bed. Also in the capillary blood, which is often used for blood sugar determination, the values are sometimes higher than in the venous blood. The glucose content of the blood is regulated by the hormones insulin, incretin and glucagon. Insulin lowers the glucose level, glucagon increases it. Furthermore, the hormones adrenaline, thyroxine, glucocorticoids, somatotropin and adrenocorticotropin lead to an increase in the glucose level. There is also a hormone-independent regulation, which is referred to as glucose autoregulation. After food intake the blood sugar concentration increases. Values over 180 mg/dL in venous whole blood are pathological and are termed hyperglycemia, values below 40 mg/dL are termed hypoglycaemia. When needed, glucose is released into the bloodstream by glucose-6-phosphatase from glucose-6-phosphate originating from liver and kidney glycogen, thereby regulating the homeostasis of blood glucose concentration. In ruminants, the blood glucose concentration is lower (60 mg/dL in cattle and 40 mg/dL in sheep), because the carbohydrates are converted more by their gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids. Some glucose is converted to lactic acid by astrocytes, which is then utilized as an energy source by brain cells; some glucose is used by intestinal cells and red blood cells, while the rest reaches the liver, adipose tissue and muscle cells, where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen (under the influence of insulin). Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent; muscle cell glycogen is not returned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes. In fat cells, glucose is used to power reactions that synthesize some fat types and have other purposes. Glycogen is the body's ""glucose energy storage"" mechanism, because it is much more ""space efficient"" and less reactive than glucose itself. As a result of its importance in human health, glucose is an analyte in glucose tests that are common medical blood tests. Eating or fasting prior to taking a blood sample has an effect on analyses for glucose in the blood; a high fasting glucose blood sugar level may be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes mellitus. The glycemic index is an indicator of the speed of resorption and conversion to blood glucose levels from ingested carbohydrates, measured as the area under the curve of blood glucose levels after consumption in comparison to glucose (glucose is defined as 100). The clinical importance of the glycemic index is controversial, as foods with high fat contents slow the resorption of carbohydrates and lower the glycemic index, e.g. ice cream. An alternative indicator is the insulin index, measured as the impact of carbohydrate consumption on the blood insulin levels. The glycemic load is an indicator for the amount of glucose added to blood glucose levels after consumption, based on the glycemic index and the amount of consumed food. === Precursor === Organisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. Starch, cellulose, and glycogen (""animal starch"") are common glucose polymers (polysaccharides). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen) serve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and chitin, which is made from a derivative of glucose) have structural roles. Oligosaccharides of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores. These include lactose, the predominant sugar in milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and sucrose, another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and fructose. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and lipids in a process called glycosylation. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use phosphorylated glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond. Other than its direct use as a monomer, glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into lipids. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid). In living organisms, glucose is converted to several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various metabolic pathways. Among them, all other monosaccharides such as fructose (via the polyol pathway), mannose (the epimer of glucose at position 2), galactose (the epimer at position 4), fucose, various uronic acids and the amino sugars are produced from glucose. In addition to the phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate, which is part of the glycolysis, glucose can be oxidized during its degradation to glucono-1,5-lactone. Glucose is used in some bacteria as a building block in the trehalose or the dextran biosynthesis and in animals as a building block of glycogen. Glucose can also be converted from bacterial xylose isomerase to fructose. In addition, glucose metabolites produce all nonessential amino acids, sugar alcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, fatty acids, cholesterol and nucleic acids. Finally, glucose is used as a building block in the glycosylation of proteins to glycoproteins, glycolipids, peptidoglycans, glycosides and other substances (catalyzed by glycosyltransferases) and can be cleaved from them by glycosidases. == Pathology == === Diabetes === Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance. The pancreas is the organ responsible for the secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions. If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes. To monitor the body's response to blood glucose-lowering therapy, glucose levels can be measured. Blood glucose monitoring can be performed by multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) – for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person's body to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream. === Hypoglycemia management === Individuals with diabetes or other conditions that result in low blood sugar often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms. One sugar commonly used is glucose, often in the form of glucose tablets (glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or more other ingredients as a binder), hard candy, or sugar packet. == Sources == Most dietary carbohydrates contain glucose, either as their only building block (as in the polysaccharides starch and glycogen), or together with another monosaccharide (as in the hetero-polysaccharides sucrose and lactose). Unbound glucose is one of the main ingredients of honey. Glucose is extremely abundant and has been isolated from a variety of natural sources across the world, including male cones of the coniferous tree Wollemia nobilis in Rome, the roots of Ilex asprella plants in China, and straws from rice in California. == Commercial production == Glucose is produced industrially from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis using glucose amylase or by the use of acids. Enzymatic hydrolysis has largely displaced acid-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions. The result is glucose syrup (enzymatically with more than 90% glucose in the dry matter) with an annual worldwide production volume of 20 million tonnes (as of 2011). This is the reason for the former common name ""starch sugar"". The amylases most often come from Bacillus licheniformis or Bacillus subtilis (strain MN-385), which are more thermostable than the originally used enzymes. Starting in 1982, pullulanases from Aspergillus niger were used in the production of glucose syrup to convert amylopectin to starch (amylose), thereby increasing the yield of glucose. The reaction is carried out at a pH = 4.6–5.2 and a temperature of 55–60 °C. Corn syrup has between 20% and 95% glucose in the dry matter. The Japanese form of the glucose syrup, Mizuame, is made from sweet potato or rice starch. Maltodextrin contains about 20% glucose. Many crops can be used as the source of starch. Maize, rice, wheat, cassava, potato, barley, sweet potato, corn husk and sago are all used in various parts of the world. In the United States, corn starch (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Some commercial glucose occurs as a component of invert sugar, a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose that is produced from sucrose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolyzed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical. === Conversion to fructose === In the US, almost exclusively corn (more precisely, corn syrup) is used as glucose source for the production of isoglucose, which is a mixture of glucose and fructose, since fructose has a higher sweetening power – with same physiological calorific value of 374 kilocalories per 100 g. The annual world production of isoglucose is 8 million tonnes (as of 2011). When made from corn syrup, the final product is high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). == Commercial usage == Glucose is mainly used for the production of fructose and of glucose-containing foods. In foods, it is used as a sweetener, humectant, to increase the volume and to create a softer mouthfeel. Various sources of glucose, such as grape juice (for wine) or malt (for beer), are used for fermentation to ethanol during the production of alcoholic beverages. Most soft drinks in the US use HFCS-55 (with a fructose content of 55% in the dry mass), while most other HFCS-sweetened foods in the US use HFCS-42 (with a fructose content of 42% in the dry mass). In Mexico, on the other hand, soft drinks are sweetened by cane sugar, which has a higher sweetening power. In addition, glucose syrup is used, inter alia, in the production of confectionery such as candies, toffee and fondant. Typical chemical reactions of glucose when heated under water-free conditions are caramelization and, in presence of amino acids, the Maillard reaction. In addition, various organic acids can be biotechnologically produced from glucose, for example by fermentation with Clostridium thermoaceticum to produce acetic acid, with Penicillium notatum for the production of araboascorbic acid, with Rhizopus delemar for the production of fumaric acid, with Aspergillus niger for the production of gluconic acid, with Candida brumptii to produce isocitric acid, with Aspergillus terreus for the production of itaconic acid, with Pseudomonas fluorescens for the production of 2-ketogluconic acid, with Gluconobacter suboxydans for the production of 5-ketogluconic acid, with Aspergillus oryzae for the production of kojic acid, with Lactobacillus delbrueckii for the production of lactic acid, with Lactobacillus brevis for the production of malic acid, with Propionibacter shermanii for the production of propionic acid, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the production of pyruvic acid and with Gluconobacter suboxydans for the production of tartaric acid. Potent, bioactive natural products like triptolide that inhibit mammalian transcription via inhibition of the XPB subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH has been recently reported as a glucose conjugate for targeting hypoxic cancer cells with increased glucose transporter expression. Recently, glucose has been gaining commercial use as a key component of ""kits"" containing lactic acid and insulin intended to induce hypoglycemia and hyperlactatemia to combat different cancers and infections. == Analysis == When a glucose molecule is to be detected at a certain position in a larger molecule, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography analysis or lectin immunostaining is performed with concanavalin A reporter enzyme conjugate, which binds only glucose or mannose. === Classical qualitative detection reactions === These reactions have only historical significance: ==== Fehling test ==== The Fehling test is a classic method for the detection of aldoses. Due to mutarotation, glucose is always present to a small extent as an open-chain aldehyde. By adding the Fehling reagents (Fehling (I) solution and Fehling (II) solution), the aldehyde group is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, while the Cu2+ tartrate complex is reduced to Cu+ and forms a brick red precipitate (Cu2O). ==== Tollens test ==== In the Tollens test, after addition of ammoniacal AgNO3 to the sample solution, glucose reduces Ag+ to elemental silver. ==== Barfoed test ==== In Barfoed's test, a solution of dissolved copper acetate, sodium acetate and acetic acid is added to the solution of the sugar to be tested and subsequently heated in a water bath for a few minutes. Glucose and other monosaccharides rapidly produce a reddish color and reddish brown copper(I) oxide (Cu2O). ==== Nylander's test ==== As a reducing sugar, glucose reacts in the Nylander's test. ==== Other tests ==== Upon heating a dilute potassium hydroxide solution with glucose to 100 °C, a strong reddish browning and a caramel-like odor develops. Concentrated sulfuric acid dissolves dry glucose without blackening at room temperature forming sugar sulfuric acid. In a yeast solution, alcoholic fermentation produces carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2.0454 molecules of glucose to one molecule of CO2. Glucose forms a black mass with stannous chloride. In an ammoniacal silver solution, glucose (as well as lactose and dextrin) leads to the deposition of silver. In an ammoniacal lead acetate solution, white lead glycoside is formed in the presence of glucose, which becomes less soluble on cooking and turns brown. In an ammoniacal copper solution, yellow copper oxide hydrate is formed with glucose at room temperature, while red copper oxide is formed during boiling (same with dextrin, except for with an ammoniacal copper acetate solution). With Hager's reagent, glucose forms mercury oxide during boiling. An alkaline bismuth solution is used to precipitate elemental, black-brown bismuth with glucose. Glucose boiled in an ammonium molybdate solution turns the solution blue. A solution with indigo carmine and sodium carbonate destains when boiled with glucose. === Instrumental quantification === ==== Refractometry and polarimetry ==== In concentrated solutions of glucose with a low proportion of other carbohydrates, its concentration can be determined with a polarimeter. For sugar mixtures, the concentration can be determined with a refractometer, for example in the Oechsle determination in the course of the production of wine. ==== Photometric enzymatic methods in solution ==== The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic reaction (Trinder reaction) of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine to a purple dye. ==== Photometric test-strip method ==== The test-strip method employs the above-mentioned enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic acid to form hydrogen peroxide. The reagents are immobilised on a polymer matrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at 510 nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows routine blood sugar determination by nonscientists. In addition to the reaction of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry at higher wavelengths (550 nm, 750 nm). ==== Amperometric glucose sensor ==== The electroanalysis of glucose is also based on the enzymatic reaction mentioned above. The produced hydrogen peroxide can be amperometrically quantified by anodic oxidation at a potential of 600 mV. The GOx is immobilized on the electrode surface or in a membrane placed close to the electrode. Precious metals such as platinum or gold are used in electrodes, as well as carbon nanotube electrodes, which e.g. are doped with boron. Cu–CuO nanowires are also used as enzyme-free amperometric electrodes, reaching a detection limit of 50 μmol/L. A particularly promising method is the so-called ""enzyme wiring"", where the electron flowing during the oxidation is transferred via a molecular wire directly from the enzyme to the electrode. ==== Other sensory methods ==== There are a variety of other chemical sensors for measuring glucose. Given the importance of glucose analysis in the life sciences, numerous optical probes have also been developed for saccharides based on the use of boronic acids, which are particularly useful for intracellular sensory applications where other (optical) methods are not or only conditionally usable. In addition to the organic boronic acid derivatives, which often bind highly specifically to the 1,2-diol groups of sugars, there are also other probe concepts classified by functional mechanisms which use selective glucose-binding proteins (e.g. concanavalin A) as a receptor. Furthermore, methods were developed which indirectly detect the glucose concentration via the concentration of metabolized products, e.g. by the consumption of oxygen using fluorescence-optical sensors. Finally, there are enzyme-based concepts that use the intrinsic absorbance or fluorescence of (fluorescence-labeled) enzymes as reporters. ==== Copper iodometry ==== Glucose can be quantified by copper iodometry. === Chromatographic methods === In particular, for the analysis of complex mixtures containing glucose, e.g. in honey, chromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography are often used in combination with mass spectrometry. Taking into account the isotope ratios, it is also possible to reliably detect honey adulteration by added sugars with these methods. Derivatization using silylation reagents is commonly used. Also, the proportions of di- and trisaccharides can be quantified. ==== In vivo analysis ==== Glucose uptake in cells of organisms is measured with 2-deoxy-D-glucose or fluorodeoxyglucose. (18F)fluorodeoxyglucose is used as a tracer in positron emission tomography in oncology and neurology, where it is by far the most commonly used diagnostic agent. == References == == External links == Media related to Glucose at Wikimedia Commons",Glucose,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.11860039085149765), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -3.4121114822482923e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -6.392202976712724e-06), (' FOOD', -0.14270542562007904), (',', -0.0001238004770129919), (' MED', -0.0006897979183122516), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.44475698471069336), ('OD', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -2.8609820219571702e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.25608405470848083), ('OG', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.622600959512056e-06), (',', -0.000432278640801087), ('ĠMED', -0.0019368238281458616), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024855216033756733)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -8.2994620242971e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -9.615255839889869e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=116, start_index=39, title='Glucose', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose?utm_source=openai')])"

Abiraterone acetate works by suppressing the production of androgens – specifically it inhibits CYP17A1 – and thereby decreases the production of testosterone. In doing so, it prevents the effects of these hormones in prostate cancer. Abiraterone acetate was described in 1995, and approved for medical use in the United States and the European Union in 2011. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Abiraterone acetate is used in combination with prednisone, a corticosteroid, as a treatment for mCRPC (previously called hormone-resistant or hormone-refractory prostate cancer). This is a form of prostate cancer that is not responding to first-line androgen deprivation therapy or treatment with androgen receptor antagonists. Abiraterone acetate has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (28 April 2011), European Medicines Agency (EMA) (23 September 2011), Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (5 September 2011) and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) (1 March 2012) approval for this indication. In Australia it is covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme when being used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer and given in combination with prednisone/prednisolone (subject to the conditions that the patient is not currently receiving chemotherapy, is either resistant or intolerant of docetaxel, has a WHO performance status of <2, and his disease has not since become progressive since treatment with PBS-subsidised abiraterone acetate has commenced). Abiraterone acetate/methylprednisolone, sold under the brand name Yonsa Mpred, is a composite package that contains both abiraterone acetate (Yonsa) and methylprednisolone. It was approved for medical use in Australia in March 2022. == Contraindications == Contraindications include hypersensitivity to abiraterone acetate. Although documents state that it should not be taken by women who are or who may become pregnant, there is no medical reason that any woman should take it. Women who are pregnant should not even touch the pills unless they are wearing gloves. Other cautions include severe baseline hepatic impairment, mineralocorticoid excess, cardiovascular disease including heart failure and hypertension, uncorrected hypokalemia, and adrenocorticoid insufficiency. == Side effects == Side effects by frequency: Very common (>10% frequency): Common (1-10% frequency): Uncommon (0.1-1% frequency): Adrenal insufficiency Myopathy Rhabdomyolysis Rare (<0.1% frequency): Allergic alveolitis == Overdose == Experience with overdose of abiraterone acetate is limited. There is no specific antidote for abiraterone acetate overdose, and treatment should consist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of cardiac and liver function. == Interactions == Abiraterone acetate is a CYP3A4 substrate and hence should not be administered concurrently with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, voriconazole) or inducers such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital. It also inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 and likewise should not be taken concurrently with substrates of any of these enzymes that have a narrow therapeutic index. Spironolactone generally exerts anti-androgenic effects, but experimental evidence exists that it acts as an androgen receptor agonist in an androgen-depleted environment, capable of inducing prostate cancer proliferation. This is supported by the observations described in several case reports. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Abiraterone, the active metabolite of abiraterone acetate, inhibits CYP17A1, which manifests as two enzymes, 17α-hydroxylase (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 2.5 nM) and 17,20-lyase (IC50 = 15 nM) (approximately 6-fold more selective for inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase over 17,20-lyase) that are expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues. CYP17A1 catalyzes two sequential reactions: (a) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α-hydroxy derivatives by its 17α-hydroxylase activity, and (b) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by its 17,20-lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17A1 activity by abiraterone acetate thus decreases circulating levels of androgens such as DHEA, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Abiraterone acetate, via abiraterone, has the capacity to lower circulating testosterone levels to less than 1 ng/dL (i.e., undetectable) when added to castration. These concentrations are considerably lower than those achieved by castration alone (~20 ng/dL). The addition of abiraterone acetate to castration was found to reduce levels of DHT by 85%, DHEA by 97 to 98%, and androstenedione by 77 to 78% relative to castration alone. In accordance with its antiandrogenic action, abiraterone acetate decreases the weights of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and testes. Abiraterone also acts as a partial antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), and as an inhibitor of the enzymes 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), CYP11B1 (steroid 11β-hydroxylase), CYP21A2 (Steroid 21-hydroxylase), and other CYP450s (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4). In addition to abiraterone itself, part of the activity of the drug has been found to be due to a more potent active metabolite, δ4-abiraterone (D4A), which is formed from abiraterone by 3β-HSD. D4A is an inhibitor of CYP17A1, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-4 isomerase, and 5α-reductase, and has also been found to act as a competitive antagonist of the AR reportedly comparable to the potent antagonist enzalutamide. However, the initial 5α-reduced metabolite of D4A, 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, is an agonist of the AR, and promotes prostate cancer progression. Its formation can be blocked by the coadministration of dutasteride, a potent and selective 5α-reductase inhibitor. ==== Estrogenic activity ==== There has been interest in the use of abiraterone acetate for the treatment of breast cancer due to its ability to lower estrogen levels. However, abiraterone has been found to act as a direct agonist of the estrogen receptor, and induces proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro. If abiraterone acetate is used in the treatment of breast cancer, it should be combined with an estrogen receptor antagonist like fulvestrant. In spite of its antiandrogenic and estrogenic properties, abiraterone acetate does not appear to produce gynecomastia as a side effect. ==== Other activities ==== Due to inhibition of glucocorticoid biosynthesis, abiraterone acetate can cause glucocorticoid deficiency, mineralocorticoid excess, and associated adverse effects. This is why the medication is combined with prednisone, a corticosteroid, which serves as a means of glucocorticoid replacement and prevents mineralocorticoid excess. Abiraterone acetate, along with galeterone, has been identified as an inhibitor of sulfotransferases (SULT2A1, SULT2B1b, SULT1E1), which are involved in the sulfation of DHEA and other endogenous steroids and compounds, with Ki values in the sub-micromolar range. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral administration, abiraterone acetate, the prodrug form in the commercial preparation, is converted into the active form, abiraterone. This conversion is likely to be esterase-mediated and not CYP-mediated. Administration with food increases absorption of the drug and thus has the potential to result in increased and highly variable exposures; the drug should be consumed on an empty stomach at least one hour before or two hours after food. The drug is highly protein bound (>99%), and is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 to inactive metabolites. The drug is excreted in feces (~88%) and urine (~5%), and has a terminal half-life of 12 ± 5 hours. == Chemistry == Abiraterone acetate, also known as 17-(3-pyridinyl)androsta-5,16-dien-3β-ol acetate, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of androstadienol (androsta-5,16-dien-3β-ol), an endogenous androstane pheromone. It is specifically a derivative of androstadienol with a pyridine ring attached at the C17 position and an acetate ester attached to the C3β hydroxyl group. Abiraterone acetate is the C3β acetate ester of abiraterone. == History == In the early 1990s, Mike Jarman, Elaine Barrie, and Gerry Potter of the Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics in the Institute of Cancer Research in London set out to develop drug treatments for prostate cancer. With the nonsteroidal androgen synthesis inhibitor ketoconazole as a model, they developed abiraterone acetate, filing a patent in 1993 and publishing the first paper describing it the following year. Rights for commercialization of the drug were assigned to BTG, a UK-based specialist healthcare company. BTG then licensed the product to Cougar Biotechnology, which began development of the commercial product. In 2009, Cougar was acquired by Johnson & Johnson, which developed and sells the commercial product, and is conducting ongoing clinical trials to expand its clinical uses. Abiraterone acetate was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on 28 April 2011 for mCRPC. The FDA press release made reference to a phase III clinical trial in which abiraterone acetate use was associated with a median survival of 14.8 months versus 10.9 months with placebo; the study was stopped early because of the successful outcome. Abiraterone acetate was also licensed by the European Medicines Agency. Until May 2012 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) did not recommend use of the drug within the NHS on cost-effectiveness grounds. This position was reversed when the manufacturer submitted revised costs. The use is currently limited to men who have already received one docetaxel-containing chemotherapy regimen. It was subsequently approved for the treatment of mCSPC in 2018. == Society and culture == === Names === Abiraterone is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name of abiraterone acetate's major active metabolite abiraterone. Abiraterone acetate is the USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name Modified, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name of abiraterone acetate. It is also known by its developmental code names CB-7630 and JNJ-212082, while CB-7598 was the developmental code name of abiraterone. Abiraterone acetate is marketed by Janssen Biotech (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson) under the brand name Zytiga, and by Sun Pharmaceutical under the brand name Yonsa. Generic versions of abiraterone acetate have been approved in the United States. Generic versions of Yonsa are not available as of November 2019. In May 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a Patent Trial and Appeal Board decision invalidating a patent by Johnson & Johnson on abiraterone acetate. Intas Pharmaceuticals markets the drug under the brand name Abiratas, Cadila Pharmaceuticals markets the drug as Abretone, and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals as Abirapro. It is marketed as Yonsa by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (licensed from Churchill Pharmaceuticals). === Brand names === Abiraterone acetate is marketed widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, elsewhere in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, and Israel. === Economics === A generic version is available in India at a price of $238 a month as of 2019. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics initially found abiraterone acetate to not be cost effective based on prices in 2012, however following an agreement to supply at a lower price it was accepted in 2014. A generic Zytiga version is available in India at a price of under $230 a month as of 2020. == Research == Abiraterone acetate is under development for the treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer and as of March 2018, is in phase II clinical trials for these indications. It was also under investigation for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but no further development has been reported for this potential use. == Prostate cancer == In people previously treated with docetaxel survival is increased by 3.9 months (14.8 months versus 10.9 months for placebo). In people with castration-refractory prostate cancer but who had not received chemotherapy those who received abiraterone acetate had a progression-free survival of 16.5 months rather than 8.3 months with placebo. After a median follow-up period of 22.2 months, overall survival was better with abiraterone acetate. Abiraterone acetate may be useful for prevention of the testosterone flare at the initiation of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. == References ==",Abiraterone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.059865078597795e-06), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000916418619453907)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/abirateroneacetate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=113, start_index=9, title='Abiraterone Acetate - NCI', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/abirateroneacetate?utm_source=openai')])"

The mechanism of action of Diosmin and other phlebotonics is undefined, and clinical evidence of benefit is limited. Diosmin is not recommended for treating the rectal mucosa, skin irritations, or wounds, and should not be used to treat dermatitis, eczema, or urticaria. Diosmin is not recommended for use in children or women during pregnancy. There is moderate-quality evidence that diosmin or other phlebotonics improved leg and ankle swelling and lower leg pain, and low-quality evidence for treating hemorrhoids. === Phlebotonics === Diosmin is included among a small class of agents called ""phlebotonics"" having heterogeneous composition and consisting partly of citrus peel extracts (flavonoids, such as hesperidin) and synthetic compounds, which are used to treat chronic venous insufficiency or hemorrhoids. In 2017, the American Working Group in Chronic Venous Disease recommended use of micronized purified flavonoid fraction (diosmiplex) as a medical food for chronic venous disease symptoms and venous ulcers, having ""beneficial outcomes without serious adverse events"", alone or combined with compression therapy, concurring with the previous guidance of the International European Society for Vascular Surgery. The German Dermatological Society indicated that Diosmin may be used with other treatments for symptoms of chronic venous diseases. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons mentions phlebotonics as a possible treatment for symptoms of hemorrhoid grades I to II, as there is only moderate-quality evidence of effectiveness with ""expectations of minimal harm"", while having no evidence of long-term benefit. French, Indian, Portuguese, and Italian professional societies of coloproctology issued similar recommendations regarding phlebotonics for hemorrhoids. == Adverse effects == In some 10% of users, diosmin causes mild gastrointestinal disorders or skin irritations (hives, itching), stomach pain, nausea, heart arrhythmias, or anemia. Preliminary research indicates no evidence of toxicity. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded in 2001 that there was inadequate evidence on which to base an expectation of safety. As of 2013, the FDA did not revise this position. == Regulatory status == Diosmin is distributed in the U.S. as a dietary supplement called Daflon. Diosmin is not approved as a prescription drug in the United States, although it is available as over-the-counter or prescription-only drug in Europe sold under name Detralex among others. Phlebotonics are not approved in Germany, and are restricted in Spain only for the treatment of chronic venous diseases. == See also == Daflon Venalex == References ==",Diosmin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.44324880838394165), ('ICAL', -2.5776860184123507e-06), (',', -0.005235767923295498), (' FOOD', -0.006957019679248333)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.5797976851463318), ('ICAL', -2.264974000354414e-06), (',', -5.173549288883805e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.00020239688456058502), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10035054385662079)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -9.615255839889869e-05), (' FOOD', -9.088346359931165e-07)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diosmin ', [])"
1718,"('Raloxifene (hydrochloride)', 'Keoxifene (hydrochloride)', 'Raloxifene', 'Keoxifene', 'Raloxifenum')",Medical,"Raloxifene, sold under the brand name Evista among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and those on glucocorticoids. For osteoporosis it is less preferred than bisphosphonates. It is also used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include hot flashes, leg cramps, swelling, and joint pain. Severe side effects may include blood clots and stroke. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. The medication may worsen menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and therefore a mixed agonist–antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER). It has estrogenic effects in bone and antiestrogenic effects in the breasts and uterus. Raloxifene was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 292nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Raloxifene is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In the case of either osteoporosis prevention or treatment, supplemental calcium and vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate. Raloxifene is used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for this indication. In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) clinical trial, raloxifene decreased the risk of all types of breast cancer by 62%, of invasive breast cancer by 72%, and of invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 84%. Conversely, it does not reduce the risk of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. There were no obvious differences in effectiveness of raloxifene in the MORE trial for prevention of breast cancer at a dosage of 60 mg/m2/day relative to 120 mg/m2/day. In the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, 60 mg/day raloxifene was 78% as effective as 20 mg/day tamoxifen in preventing non-invasive breast cancer. Women with undetectable levels of estradiol (<2.7 pg/mL) have a naturally low risk of breast cancer and, in contrast to women with detectable levels of estradiol, do not experience significant benefit from raloxifene in terms of reduction of breast cancer risk. == Contraindications == Raloxifene is contraindicated in lactating women or women who are or who may become pregnant. It also may be of concern to women with active or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis. == Side effects == Common side effects of raloxifene include hot flashes (25–28% vs. 18–21% for placebo), vaginal dryness, and leg cramps (generally mild; 5.5% vs. 1.9% for placebo). Raloxifene does not cause breast tenderness, endometrial hyperplasia, menstrual bleeding, or endometrial cancer. It does not appear to affect cognition or memory. Raloxifene is a teratogen; i.e., it can cause developmental abnormalities such as birth defects. Raloxifene may infrequently cause serious blood clots to form in the legs, lungs, or eyes. Other reactions experienced include leg swelling/pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, and vision changes. Black box warnings were added to the label of raloxifene in 2007 warning of increased risk of death due to stroke for postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for major coronary events, as well as increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The risk of venous thromboembolism with raloxifene is increased by several-fold in postmenopausal women (RRTooltip relative risk = 3.1). Raloxifene has a lower risk of thromboembolism than tamoxifen. In the MORE trial, raloxifene caused a 40% decrease in risk of cardiovascular events in women who were at increased risk for coronary artery disease, although there was no decrease in cardiovascular events for the group as a whole. A report in September 2009, from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen and raloxifene used to treat breast cancer, significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. A human case report in July 2016, suggests that raloxifene may in fact, at some point, also stimulate breast cancer growth leading to a reduction of advanced breast cancer disease upon the withdrawal of the drug. Unlike other SERMs, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene has no risk of uterine hyperplasia or endometrial cancer (RRTooltip relative risk = 0.8). Raloxifene does not increase the incidence of breast pain or tenderness in postmenopausal women. == Overdose == Raloxifene has been studied in clinical trials across a dosage range of 30 to 600 mg/day, and was well-tolerated at all dosages. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Mechanism of action ==== Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and hence is a mixed agonist and antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) in different tissues. It has estrogenic activity in some tissues, such as bone and the liver, and antiestrogenic activity in other tissues, such as the breasts and uterus. Its affinity (Kd) for the ERα is approximately 50 pM, which is similar to that of estradiol. Relative to estradiol, raloxifene has been reported to possess about 8 to 34% of the affinity for the ERα and 0.5 to 76% of the affinity for the ERβ. Raloxifene acts as a partial agonist of the ERα and as a pure antagonist of the ERβ. In contrast to the classical ERs, raloxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 10–100 nM), a membrane estrogen receptor. ==== Clinical effects ==== Raloxifene has antiestrogenic effects in the mammary glands in preclinical studies. In accordance, raloxifene reduces breast density in postmenopausal women, a known risk factor for breast cancer. It does not stimulate the uterus in postmenopausal women, and results in no increase in risk of endometrial thickening, vaginal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. At the same time, raloxifene has minimal antiestrogenic effect in the uterus in premenopausal women. This may possibly be due to inadequate tissue exposure of the uterus to raloxifene in these estrogen-rich individuals. In premenopausal women, raloxifene increases levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol. Conversely, in postmenopausal women, raloxifene has been found to reduce levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, while not affecting levels of estradiol. Raloxifene also decreases prolactin levels in postmenopausal women. In men, raloxifene has been found to disinhibit the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) and thereby increase total testosterone levels. Due to the simultaneous increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels however, free testosterone levels often remain unchanged in men during therapy with raloxifene. Raloxifene has estrogenic effects on liver protein synthesis. It increases SHBG levels in both pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. The medication decreases levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B, and homocysteine. Conversely, it has little effect on levels of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Raloxifene has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in vitro. The medication has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. It has also been found to increase insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women. Due to activation of estrogen receptors in the liver, raloxifene has procoagulatory effects, such as decreasing levels of fibrinogen and influencing levels of other coagulation factors. For these reasons, raloxifene increases the risk of thrombosis. Raloxifene increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women but decreases it in premenopausal women. In the MORE trial, the risk of vertebral fractures was decreased by 30%, and bone mineral density was increased in the spine (by 2.1% at 60 mg, 2.4% at 120 mg) and femoral neck (2.6% at 60 mg, 2.7% at 120 mg). It has been found to possess estrogenic effects in adipose tissue in postmenopausal women, promoting a shift from an android fat distribution to a gynoid fat distribution. The medication has been found to increase levels of leptin, an adipokine. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The absorption of raloxifene is approximately 60%. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability of raloxifene is only 2.0%. Raloxifene is rapidly absorbed from the intestines upon oral administration. Peak plasma levels of raloxifene occur 0.5 to 6 hours after an oral dose. In healthy postmenopausal women treated with 60 mg/day raloxifene, peak circulating raloxifene levels normalized by dose and body weight were (i.e., divided by (mg/kg)), 0.50 ng/mL (500 pg/mL) after a single dose and 1.36 ng/mL (1,360 pg/mL after multiple doses). ==== Distribution ==== Raloxifene is widely distributed throughout the body. There is extensive distribution of raloxifene into the liver, serum, lungs, and kidneys. The volume of distribution of raloxifene with a single 30 to 150 mg oral dose is approximately 2348 L/kg, which corresponds to ~170,000 L for a 72 kg person. Both raloxifene and its glucuronide metabolites show high plasma protein binding (>95%), including to both albumin and α1 acid glycoprotein, but not to sex hormone-binding globulin. More specifically, raloxifene is 98.2 ± 0.4% bound to plasma proteins. ==== Metabolism ==== Raloxifene is metabolized in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic recycling. It is metabolized exclusively by glucuronidation and is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Less than 1% of radiolabeled material in plasma comprises unconjugated raloxifene. The metabolites of raloxifene include several glucuronides. The elimination half-life of raloxifene after a single dose is 27.7 hours (1.2 days), whereas its half-life at steady state at a dosage of 60 mg/day is 15.8 to 86.6 hours (0.7–3.6 days), with an average of 32.5 hours (1.4 days). The extended half-life of raloxifene is attributed to enterohepatic recirculation and its high plasma protein binding. Raloxifene and its glucuronide conjugates are interconverted by reversible metabolism and enterohepatic recycling, which prolongs the elimination half-life of raloxifene with oral administration. The medication is deconjugated into its active form in a variety of tissues, including liver, lungs, spleen, bone, uterus, and kidneys. ==== Elimination ==== Raloxifene is mainly excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces. Less than 0.2% of a dose is excreted unchanged in urine and less than 6% of a dose is excreted in urine as glucuronide conjugates. == Chemistry == Raloxifene hydrochloride has the empirical formula C28H27NO4S•HCl, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 510.05 g/mol. Raloxifene hydrochloride is an off-white to pale-yellow solid that is slightly soluble in water. Raloxifene is a benzothiophene derivative and is structurally distinct from the triphenylethylene SERMs like tamoxifen, clomifene, and toremifene. It is the only benzothiophene SERM to have been marketed. A benzothiophene SERM that was not marketed is arzoxifene (LY-353381). Bazedoxifene (Duavee, Viviant) and pipendoxifene (ERA-923) are structurally related to raloxifene but are technically not benzothiophenes and instead are indoles. == History == Raloxifene was approved in the United States for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1997, the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1999, and to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer in certain postmenopausal women in 2007. It received orphan designation in 2005. == Society and culture == === Names === Raloxifene is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while raloxifène is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and raloxifene hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It has also been known by the name keoxifene. Raloxifene is sold mainly under the brand name Evista and to a lesser extent the brand name Optruma. It is also sold under a variety of other brand names in various countries. === Availability === Raloxifene is available widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, elsewhere throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Latin America, Southern, Eastern, and Southeastern Asia, and elsewhere in the world such as in Israel and Egypt. Raloxifene is provided in the form of 60 mg oral tablets. === Controversy === An editorial in Lancet Oncology criticized the way that research about the medication for breast cancer prevention was released. == Research == Clinical studies of raloxifene for metastatic breast cancer in women have been conducted but found little effectiveness at 60 mg/day in those previously treated with tamoxifen, though modest effectiveness has been observed at higher doses. In contrast to tamoxifen, raloxifene is not approved for the treatment of breast cancer. Raloxifene has been studied in men for a variety of uses, such as for treatment of schizophrenia, prostate cancer, and osteoporosis. It has been studied in combination with castration and bicalutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, for the treatment of prostate cancer. Raloxifene has been studied as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia in postmenopausal women. A 2017 meta-analysis concluded that it was safe and effective for this indication, although further studies with larger sample sizes are needed for confirmation. It may be effective in women with less severe symptoms. A tissue-selective estrogen-receptor complex (TSEC) of estradiol and raloxifene has been studied in postmenopausal women.

1720,"('Aminoguanidine (hydrochloride)', 'Pimagedine hydrochloride', 'Aminoguanidinium chloride', 'Aminoguanidine', 'Pimagedine')",Medical,"Pimagedine, also known as aminoguanidine, is an investigational drug for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy that is no longer under development as a drug. Pimagedine functions as an inhibitor of diamine oxidase and nitric oxide synthase. It acts to reduce levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) through interacting with 3-deoxyglucosone, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and related dicarbonyls. These reactive species are converted to less reactive heterocycles by this condensation reaction. == History == Pimagedine was under development as a drug for kidney diseases by the pharmaceutical company Alteon (now known Synvista Therapeutics Inc.) that was founded in 1986. In 1987, Alteon acquired a license to intellectual property relating to AGE inhibition from Rockefeller University. In 1989, Alteon and Marion Merrell Dow Inc (MMD) entered into a joint development program for pimagedine. In 1992, Alteon licensed a patent from Rockefeller University relating to the use of pimagedine to inhibit AGE formation. In 1995, Hoechst AG (now Sanofi-Aventis) acquired MMD and subsequently terminated its agreement with Alteon, which led Alteon to stop clinical trials, which caused some controversy. In 1997, Alteon and Genentech announced a collaboration under which Genentech would fund development of pimagedine and would have the rights to sell the drug if it would be approved. In March 1998, Alteon announced that it had been advised that it should discontinue its Phase III trial of pimagedine in non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes patients with overt nephropathy, after the trial's external safety monitoring committee found an increased risk of side effects in the treatment group. In November 1998, Alteon announced that its Phase III trial for pimagedine as a treatment for end stage renal disease had failed to prove efficacy, which led Carl Gordon, a leading biotech analyst, to say: ""It looks like pimagedine is probably finished."" In February, 1999, Genentech ended its collaboration with Alteon to develop pimagedine. In April 1999 Alteon announced that it would cease development of pimagedine as a treatment for end stage renal disease but might consider continuing development in type 1 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy or progressive kidney disease. Alteon's 2000, 2001, 2002 annual reports indicated that it was not running any clinical trials on pimagedine but was seeking co-development partners. Alteon's 2003 and subsequent annual reports did not mention that Alteon was seeking partners for pimagedine, which indicated that efforts to interest other companies and investors had failed and which signaled that commercial efforts to develop pimagedine as a drug were indeed finished. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === The industrial synthesis uses the reaction between cyanamide and hydrazine in aqueous solution. The compound can also be obtained from the reduction of nitroguanidine with zinc in acetic acid. === Properties === Aminoguanidine is a colorless solid that is soluble in water and ethanol. It is basic, producing salts when reacted with organic acids. As established by many crystallographic studies, protonation of aminoguanidine occurs at the imino nitrogen. With formic acid, condensation occurs, leading to cyclization to give 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The compound reacts with nitrous acid in acidic medium to give 5-aminotetrazole via the intermediate guanylazide. At neutral pH, the reaction leads to tetrazene. Diazotization in acetic acid yields 1,3-di-(tetrazolyl)-triazene. == References ==",Pimagedine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.012803574092686176), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.00840400904417038), ('ICAL', -5.9126061387360096e-05), (',', -0.16029813885688782), ('ĠINDU', -0.00833201501518488), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000387831823900342)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimagedine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Pimagedine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimagedine?utm_source=openai')])"
1721,"('Ethosuximide', 'Zarontin', 'Etosuximida', 'Ethosuxide', 'Ethosuccimide')",Medical,"Ethosuximide, sold under the brand name Zarontin among others, is a medication used to treat absence seizures. It may be used by itself or with other antiseizure medications such as valproic acid. Ethosuximide is taken by mouth. Ethosuximide is usually well tolerated. Common side effects include loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and feeling tired. Serious side effects include suicidal thoughts, low blood cell levels, and lupus erythematosus. It is unclear if it has adverse effects on the fetus during pregnancy. Ethosuximide is in the succinimide family of medications. Its mechanism of action is thought to be due to antagonism of the postsynaptic T-type voltage-gated calcium channel. Ethosuximide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ethosuximide is available as a generic medication. As of 2019, its availability was limited in many countries, with concerns about price fixing in the United States. == Medical uses == Ethosuximide is approved for absence seizures, and is considered the first choice medication for treating them, in part because it lacks the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of the alternative anti-absence drug, valproic acid. == Adverse effects == As with other anticonvulsants, ethosuximide carries a warning about use during pregnancy. Although a causal relationship with birth defects has not be established, the potential for harm to the baby is weighed against the known harm caused by a mother having even minor seizures. === Central nervous system === ==== Common ==== drowsiness mental confusion insomnia headache ataxia ==== Rare ==== paranoid psychosis increased libido exacerbation of depression === Gastrointestinal === dyspepsia vomiting nausea cramps constipation diarrhea stomach pain loss of appetite weight loss gum enlargement swelling of tongue abnormal liver function === Genitourinary === microscopic hematuria vaginal bleeding === Blood === The following can occur with or without bone marrow loss: pancytopenia agranulocytosis leukopenia eosinophilia === Skin === urticaria systemic lupus erythematosus Stevens–Johnson syndrome hirsutism pruritic erythematous rashes === Eyes === myopia == Drug interactions == Valproates can either decrease or increase the levels of ethosuximide; however, combinations of valproates and ethosuximide had a greater protective index than either drug alone. It may elevate serum phenytoin levels. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism by which ethosuximide affects neuronal excitability includes block of T-type calcium channels, and may include effects of the drug on other classes of ion channel. The primary finding that ethosuximide is a T-type calcium channel blocker gained widespread support, but initial attempts to replicate the finding were inconsistent. Subsequent experiments on recombinant T-type channels in cell lines demonstrated conclusively that ethosuximide blocks all T-type calcium channel isoforms. Significant T-type calcium channel density occurs in dendrites of neurons, and recordings from reduced preparations that strip away this dendritic source of T-type calcium channels may have contributed to reports of ethosuximide ineffectiveness. In March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince showed that ethosuximide and dimethadione, both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca2+ currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons. In June of that same year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be voltage-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that valproic acid, which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that. The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not. The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in dorsal root ganglia at concentrations ranging from 7 μmol/L to 1 mmol/L. That same year, however, Herrington and Lingle found no such effect at concentrations of up to 2.5 mmol/L. The year after, a study conducted on human neocortical cells removed during surgery for intractable epilepsy, the first to use human tissue, found that ethosuximide had no effect on Ca2+ currents at the concentrations typically needed for a therapeutic effect. In 1998, Slobodan M. Todorovic and Christopher J. Lingle of Washington University reported a 100% block of T-type current in dorsal root ganglia at 23.7 ± 0.5 mmol/L, far higher than Kostyuk reported. That same year, Leresche et al. reported that ethosuximide had no effect on T-type currents, but did decrease noninactivating Na+ current by 60% and the Ca2+-activated K+ currents by 39.1 ± 6.4% in rat and cat thalamocortical cells. It was concluded that the decrease in Na+ current is responsible for the anti-absence properties. In the introduction of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons that had lost most of their T-type channels. Using cloned α1G, α1H, and α1I T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that ethosuximide blocked the channels with an IC50 of 12 ± 2 mmol/L and that of N-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of mesuximide) is 1.95 ± 0.19 mmol/L for α1G, 1.82 ± 0.16 mmol/L for α1I, and 3.0 ± 0.3 mmol/L for α1H. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward. == Stereochemistry == Ethosuximide is a chiral drug with a stereocenter. Therapeutically, the racemate, the 1: 1 mixture of ( S ) and ( R ) - isomers used. == Society and culture == === Cost === As of 2019 there were concerns in the United States that the price of ethosuximide was inflated by manufacturers. === Availability === Availability of ethosuximide is limited in many countries. It was marketed under the trade names Emeside and Zarontin. However, both capsule preparations were discontinued from production, leaving only generic preparations available. Emeside capsules were discontinued by their manufacturer, Laboratories for Applied Biology, in 2005. Similarly, Zarontin capsules were discontinued by Pfizer in 2007.

It is taken by mouth. The most common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection. An orally active inhibitory pregnane neurosteroid, zuranolone acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Zuranolone was approved for medical use in the United States for the treatment of postpartum depression in August 2023. It was developed by Sage Therapeutics and Biogen. == Medical uses == Zuranolone is indicated for the treatment of postpartum depression. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, and urinary tract infection. The US FDA label contains a boxed warning noting that zuranolone can impact a person's ability to drive and perform other potentially hazardous activities. The use of zuranolone may cause suicidal thoughts and behavior. Zuranolone may also cause fetal harm. == History == Zuranolone was developed as an improvement on the intravenously administered neurosteroid brexanolone, with high oral bioavailability and a biological half-life suitable for once-daily administration. Its half-life is around 16 to 23 hours, compared to approximately 9 hours for brexanolone. The efficacy of zuranolone for the treatment of postpartum depression in adults was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The trial participants were women with postpartum depression who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for a major depressive episode and whose symptoms began in the third trimester or within four weeks of delivery. In study 1, participants received 50 mg of zuranolone or placebo once daily in the evening for 14 days. In study 2, participants received another zuranolone product that was approximately equal to 40 mg of zuranolone or placebo, also for 14 days. Participants in both studies were monitored for at least four weeks after the 14-day treatment. The primary endpoint of both studies was the change in depressive symptoms using the total score from the 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD-17), measured at day 15. Participants in the zuranolone groups showed significantly more improvement in their symptoms compared to those in the placebo groups. The treatment effect was maintained at day 42—four weeks after the last dose of zuranolone. == Society and culture == Zuranolone is the international nonproprietary name. === Legal status === Zuranolone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of postpartum depression in August 2023. The FDA granted the application for zuranolone priority review and fast track designations. Approval of Zurzuvae was granted to Sage Therapeutics, Inc. Zuranolone has also been under development for the treatment of major depressive disorder, but the application for this use was given a Complete Response Letter (CRL) by the FDA due to insufficient evidence of effectiveness. In the United States, zuranolone is a Schedule IV controlled substance. == Research == In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial to assess its efficacy and safety for the treatment of major depressive disorder, subjects in the zuranolone group (50 mg oral zuranolone once daily for 14 days) experienced statistically significant and sustained improvements in depressive symptoms (as measured by HAM-D score) throughout the treatment and follow-up periods of the study.

Recently, China's emerging PRV mutant strains resulted in the traditionally commercial vaccines not providing complete protection. Some studies reported that PRV could infect humans and cause endophthalmitis and encephalitis under certain circumstances. It is necessary to develop alternative manners to control the virus infection. Here, by screening a library of natural products, (S)-10-Hydroxycamptothecin (10-HCPT) was revealed to inhibit PRV replication with a selective index of 270.04. And 10-HCPT inhibited PRV replication by blocking the viral genome replication but not inhibiting the viral attachment, internalization, and release. RNA interference assay showed that 10-HCPT inhibited PRV replication by targeting DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1). Meanwhile, 10-HCPT treatment induced DNA damage response and stimulated antiviral innate immunity. Animal challenge experiments showed that 10-HCPT effectively alleviated clinical signs and hispathology, and increased INF-β responses in lung and brain tissues of mice induced by PRV infection. The results demonstrate that 10-HCPT is a promising therapeutic agent to control PRV infection. Head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh most common cancer worldwide. Targeted therapeutic drugs for HNSCC are still being explored. Among them, (S)-10-hydroxycamptothecin (10-HCPT), a specific inhibitor of TOP1, functions by DNA double-strand breaks that can inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptotic cell death subsequently. Previous studies have reported that MLN4924 exerts potent anti-tumor effects by inhibiting cullin-RING ligases and causing substrate accumulation in a variety of cancers. Here, we show that MLN4924 effectively causes dose-dependent accumulation of topoisomerase I (TOP1) and blocks TOP1 ubiquitination. Importantly, neddylation inhibition with MLN4924 acts synergistically with 10-HCPT to suppress cell growth, migration and apoptosis in HNSCC cells. Mechanistically, transcriptome sequencing shows that the cytotoxic effects of the combination of MLN4924 and 10-HCPT may involve activation of the NFKB1 pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that combined treatment with MLN4924 and 10-HCPT may be an effective strategy in HNSCC. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer in children and adolescents with high metastatic ability. This study aimed to explore the inhibitory effects of (S)-10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) on osteosarcoma cell growth and metastasis as well as the underlying mechanism. The osteosarcoma cells of 143B and U-2 OS (U-2), treated with HCPT (20, 100, or 300 nM), underwent detections, such as CCK-8, flow cytometry, Transwell, wound healing, and immunoblotting. EMT-related key proteins, like N-cadherin, Snail, and Vimentin, were found to be down-regulated, while E-cadherin was up-regulated dose-dependently in HCPT-exposed 143B and U-2 cells. Additionally, incubation of 143B and U-2 cells with HCPT for 3 hours dosedependently reduced the expression ratios of p-LATS1/LATS1, p-MST1/MST1, p-YAP/YAP, and p-TAZ/TAZ. Taken together, our study has demonstrated HCPT to inhibit osteosarcoma growth and metastasis potentially by activating the HIPPO signaling pathway and reversing EMT.

It was hypothesised that the addition of L-165041 to the culture medium enhances development and cryopreservation. Oocytes were allocated to one of two treatments: control-standard culture medium, or L-165041 added to the medium on day1 with no media change. Ultrastructure, cleavage, and blastocyst rates were evaluated in fresh, and in post-vitrification cultured embryos by optical and electronic microscopy. A subset of fresh embryos were fixed for TUNEL assay and for Sudan-Black-B histochemical staining. Vitrified-warmed embryos were assessed using MALDI-MS technique. Cleavage and blastocyst rates (control 49.4±5.2, L-165041 51.8±4.3) were not influenced by L-165041. The proportion of inner cell mass cells (ICM) was higher in fresh embryos, and the rate of total and ICM apoptosis was lower in L-165041. In warmed-embryos, total and ICM apoptosis was lower in L-165041. The overall hatching rate was higher in L-165041 (66.62±2.83% vs 53.19±2.90%). There was less lipid accumulation in fresh L-165041-embryos. In conclusion, the use of L-165041 is recommended to improve the viability of in vitro -derived bovine embryos. Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) has been implicated in energy metabolism and lipid oxidation process, detailed roles of PPARdelta in lipid homeostasis under pathologic conditions still remain controversial. Thus, we investigated the effect of PPARdelta ligand L-165041 on Western diet-induced fatty liver using low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLR(-/-)) mice. LDLR(-/-) mice received either L-165041 (5mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.1N NaOH) with Western diet for 16 weeks. According to our data, L-165041 drastically reduced lipid accumulation in the liver, decreasing total hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride content compared to the vehicle group. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that L-165041 lowered hepatic expression of PPARgamma, apolipoprotein B, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-6. In contrast, L-165041 increased hepatic expressions of PPARdelta, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1). Our data suggest that L-165041 might be effective in preventing Western diet-induced hepatic steatosis by regulating genes involved in lipid metabolism and the inflammatory response. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)δ is known to be expressed ubiquitously and involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that PPARδ is expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) and plays a potential role in endothelial survival and proliferation. Although PPARα and PPARγ are well recognized to play anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic roles in ECs, the general effect of PPARδ on angiogenesis in ECs remains unclear. Thus, we investigated the effect of the PPARδ ligand L-165041 on vascular EC proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro as well as in vivo. Our data show that L-165041 inhibited VEGF-induced cell proliferation and migration in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). L-165041 also inhibited angiogenesis in the Matrigel plug assay and aortic ring assay. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that L-165041 reduced the number of ECs in the S phase and the expression levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2, and CDK4; phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein was suppressed by pretreatment with L-165041. We confirmed whether these antiangiogenic effects of L-165041 were PPARδ-dependent using GW501516 and PPARδ siRNA. GW501516 treatment did not inhibit VEGF-induced angiogenesis, and transfection of PPARδ siRNA did not reverse this antiangiogenic effect of L-165041, suggesting that the antiangiogenic effect of L-165041 on ECs is PPARδ-independent. Together, these data indicate that the PPARδ ligand L-165041 inhibits VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis by suppressing the cell cycle progression independently of PPARδ. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of L-165041 in the treatment of many disorders related to pathological angiogenesis.",L 165041,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.023255961015820503), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5131527185440063), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00415854062885046)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-165041?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=6, title='L-165041', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-165041?utm_source=openai')])"
1726,"(""Indirubin-3'-monoxime"", ""Indirubin-3'-oxime"", 'Indirubin-3-monoxime', 'Indirubin-3-oxime', 'Indirubin-3monoxime')",Medical," Multiple myeloma (MM) is still an incurable malignancy of plasma cells. Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) work as the backbone agent and have greatly improved the outcome in majority of newly diagnosed patients with myeloma. However, drug resistance remains the major obstacle causing treatment failure in clinical practice. Here, we investigated the effects of Indirubin-3'-monoxime (I3MO), one of the derivatives of Indirubin, in the treatment of MM. MM patient primary samples and human cell lines were examined. I3MO effects on myeloma treatment and the underling molecular mechanisms were investigated via in vivo and in vitro study. Our results demonstrated the anti-MM activity of I3MO in both drug- sensitive and -resistance MM cells. I3MO sensitizes MM cells to bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, I3MO acts as a multifaceted regulator of cell death, which induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and abrogates NF-κB activation. I3MO efficiently down-regulated USP7 expression, promoted NEK2 degradation, and suppressed NF-κB signaling in MM. Our study reported that I3MO directly bound with and caused the down-regulation of PA28γ (PSME3), and PA200 (PSME4), the proteasome activators. Knockdown of PSME3 or PSME4 caused the inhibition of proteasome capacity and the overload of paraprotein, which sensitizes MM cells to bortezomib-mediated growth arrest. Clinical data demonstrated that PSME3 and PSME4 are over-expressed in relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) and associated with inferior outcome. Altogether, our study indicates that I3MO is agent triggering proteasome inhibition and represents a promising therapeutic strategy to improve patient outcome in MM. A full list of funding can be found in the acknowledgements. Indirubin-3'-monoxime is an effective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases, and may play an obligate role in neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we found that indirubin-3'-monoxime improved the morphology and increased the survival rate of SH-SY5Y cells exposed to amyloid-beta 25-35 (Aβ25-35), and also suppressed apoptosis by reducing tau phosphorylation at Ser199 and Thr205. Furthermore, indirubin-3'-monoxime inhibited phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Our results suggest that indirubin-3'-monoxime reduced Aβ25-35-induced apoptosis by suppressing tau hyperphosphorylation via a GSK-3β-mediated mechanism. Indirubin-3'-monoxime is a promising drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease. Indirubin is widely used as the active component of ""Dangui Luhui Wan"" in ancient China. However, its effects against the osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary malignancy, are still unknown. In our present study, we investigated the effects of the Indirubin-3'-monoxime (I3M), a derivative of indirubin with better water solubility, against the OS cells. We found I3M inhibited OS cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry assays showed that I3M could not only induce OS cell apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner but also regulate the cell cycle distribution. Additionally, we demonstrated that several Bcl-2 family members, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins contributed to this process. Furthermore, out data verified that I3M suppressed OS cell migration and invasion by decreasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Moreover, survivin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) might play important roles in the anti-OS effects of I3M. The administration of I3M also inhibited the OS cell growth in mice. Taken together, our results indicated the inhibitory effects of I3M against human OS and thus might be an efficient candidate for OS chemotherapy.",Indirubin-3'-monoxime,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012484145117923617), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04861140251159668)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00861456897109747)])","('INFO; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3742732/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4010160/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29274785/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21337385/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28817720/ ', [])"
1727,"('Zidovudine', 'Azidothymidine', 'Retrovir', 'Zidovudinum', ""Thymidine, 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-"")",Medical,"Zidovudine (ZDV), also known as azidothymidine (AZT), was the first antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use in combination with other antiretrovirals. It may be used to prevent mother-to-child spread during birth or after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is sold both by itself and together as lamivudine/zidovudine and abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine. It can be used by mouth or by slow injection into a vein. Common side effects include headaches, fever, and nausea. Serious side effects include liver problems, muscle damage, and high blood lactate levels. It is commonly used in pregnancy and appears to be safe for the fetus. ZDV is of the nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class. It works by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase that HIV uses to make DNA and therefore decreases replication of the virus. Zidovudine was first described in 1964. It was resynthesized from a public-domain formula by Burroughs Wellcome. It was approved in the United States in 1987 and was the first treatment for HIV. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == === HIV treatment === AZT was usually dosed twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral therapies. This approach is referred to as Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) and is used to prevent the likelihood of HIV resistance. As of 2019, the standard is a three-drug once-daily oral treatment that can include AZT. === HIV prevention === AZT has been used for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in combination with another antiretroviral drug called lamivudine. Together they work to substantially reduce the risk of HIV infection following the first single exposure to the virus. More recently, AZT has been replaced by other antiretrovirals such as tenofovir to provide PEP. Before tenofovir, a principal part of the clinical pathway for both pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery and has been proven to be integral to uninfected siblings' perinatal and neonatal development. Without AZT, 10–15% of fetuses with HIV-infected mothers will themselves become infected. AZT has been shown to reduce this risk to 8% when given in a three-part regimen post-conception, delivery, and six weeks post-delivery. Consistent and proactive precautionary measures, such as the rigorous use of antiretroviral medications, cesarean section, face masks, heavy-duty rubber gloves, clinically segregated disposable diapers, and avoidance of mouth contact will further reduce child-attendant transmission of HIV to as little as 1–2%. During 1994 to 1999, AZT was the primary form of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. AZT prophylaxis prevented more than 1000 parental and infant deaths from AIDS in the United States. In the U.S. at that time, the accepted standard of care for HIV-positive mothers was known as the 076 regimen and involved five daily doses of AZT from the second trimester onwards, as well as AZT intravenously administered during labour. As this treatment was lengthy and expensive, it was deemed unfeasible in the Global South, where mother-to-child transmission was a significant problem. A number of studies were initiated in the late 1990s that sought to test the efficacy of a shorter, simpler regimen for use in 'resource-poor' countries. This AZT short course was an inferior standard of care and would have been considered malpractice if trialed in the US; however, it was nonetheless a treatment that would improve the care and survival of impoverished subjects. === Antibacterial properties === Zidovudine also has antibacterial properties, though not routinely used in clinical settings. It acts on bacteria with a mechanism of action still not fully explained. Promising results from in vitro and in vivo studies showed the efficacy of AZT also against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (including mcr-1 carrying and metallo-β-lactamase producing isolates), especially in combination with other active agents (e.g., fosfomycin, colistin, tigecycline). == Side effects == Most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, acid reflux (heartburn), headache, cosmetic reduction in abdominal body fat, trouble sleeping, and loss of appetite. Less common side effects include faint discoloration of fingernails and toenails, mood elevation, occasional tingling or transient numbness of the hands or feet, and minor skin discoloration. Allergic reactions are rare. Early long-term higher-dose therapy with AZT was initially associated with side effects that sometimes limited therapy, including anemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy. All of these conditions were generally found to be reversible upon reduction of AZT dosages. They have been attributed to several possible causes, including transient depletion of mitochondrial DNA, sensitivity of the γ-DNA polymerase in some cell mitochondria, the depletion of thymidine triphosphate, oxidative stress, reduction of intracellular L-carnitine or apoptosis of the muscle cells. Anemia due to AZT was successfully treated using erythropoetin to stimulate red blood cell production. Drugs that inhibit hepatic glucuronidation, such as indomethacin, nordazepam, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and trimethoprim decreased the elimination rate and increased the therapeutic strength of the medication. Today, side effects are much less common with the use of lower doses of AZT. According to IARC, there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of zidovudine; it is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). In 2009, the State of California added zidovudine to its list of chemicals ""known to the state of California to cause cancer and other reproductive harm."" === Viral resistance === Even at the highest doses that can be tolerated in patients, AZT is not potent enough to prevent all HIV replication and may only slow the replication of the virus and progression of the disease. Prolonged AZT treatment can lead to HIV developing resistance to AZT by mutation of its reverse transcriptase. To slow the development of resistance, physicians generally recommend that AZT be given in combination with another reverse-transcriptase inhibitor and an antiretroviral from another group, such as a protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, or integrase inhibitor; this type of therapy is known as HAART (Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy). == Mechanism of action == AZT is a thymidine analogue. AZT works by selectively inhibiting HIV's reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that the virus uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA. Reverse transcription is necessary for production of HIV's double-stranded DNA, which would be subsequently integrated into the genetic material of the infected cell (where it is called a provirus). Cellular enzymes convert AZT into the effective 5'-triphosphate form. Some studies have shown that terminating synthesis of HIV's DNA chains is the specific inhibitory mechanism. At very high doses, AZT's triphosphate form may also inhibit DNA polymerase used by human cells to undergo cell division, but regardless of dosage AZT has an approximately 100-fold greater affinity for HIV's reverse transcriptase. The selectivity has been suggested to be due to the cell's ability to quickly repair its own DNA chain if it is disrupted by AZT during its formation, whereas the HIV virus lacks that ability. Thus AZT inhibits HIV replication without affecting the function of uninfected cells. At sufficiently high dosages, AZT begins to inhibit the cellular DNA polymerase used by mitochondria to replicate, accounting for its potentially toxic but reversible effects on cardiac and skeletal muscles, causing myositis. == Chemistry == Enantiopure AZT crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21. The primary intermolecular bonding motif is a hydrogen bonded dimeric ring formed from two N-H...O interactions. == History == === Initial cancer research === In the 1960s, the theory that most cancers were caused by environmental retroviruses gained clinical support and funding. It had recently become known, due to the work of Nobel laureates Howard Temin and David Baltimore, that nearly all avian cancers were caused by bird retroviruses, but corresponding human retroviruses had not yet been found. In parallel work, other compounds that successfully blocked the synthesis of nucleic acids had been proven to be both antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, the leading work being done at the laboratory of Nobel laureates George H. Hitchings and Gertrude Elion, leading to the development of the antitumor agent 6-mercaptopurine. Richard E. Beltz first synthesized AZT in 1961, but did not publish his research.Jerome Horwitz of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University School of Medicine synthesized AZT in 1964 under a US National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant. Development was shelved after it proved biologically inert in mice. In 1974, Wolfram Ostertag of the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in Göttingen, Germany, reported that AZT specifically targeted Friend virus (strain of murine leukemia virus). This report attracted little interest from other researchers as the Friend leukemia virus is a retrovirus, and at the time, there were no known human diseases caused by retroviruses. === HIV/AIDS research === In 1983, researchers at the Institut Pasteur in Paris identified the retrovirus now known as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) as the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. Shortly thereafter, Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan of the United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) initiated a program to develop therapies for HIV/AIDS. Using a line of CD4+ T cells that they had made, they developed an assay to screen drugs for their ability to protect CD4+ T cells from being killed by HIV. In order to expedite the process of discovering a drug, the NCI researchers actively sought collaborations with pharmaceutical companies having access to libraries of compounds with potential antiviral activity. This assay could simultaneously test both the anti-HIV effect of the compounds and their toxicity against infected T cells. In June 1984, Burroughs-Wellcome virologist Marty St. Clair set up a program to discover drugs with the potential to inhibit HIV replication. Burroughs-Wellcome had expertise in nucleoside analogs and viral diseases, led by researchers including George Hitchings, Gertrude Elion, David Barry, Paul (Chip) McGuirt Jr., Philip Furman, Martha St. Clair, Janet Rideout, Sandra Lehrman and others. Their research efforts were focused in part on the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that retroviruses, including HIV, utilize to replicate themselves. Secondary testing was performed in mouse cells infected with the retroviruses Friend virus or Harvey sarcoma virus, as the Wellcome group did not have a viable in-house HIV antiviral assay in place at that time, and these other retroviruses were believed to represent reasonable surrogates. AZT proved to be a remarkably potent inhibitor of both Friend virus and Harvey sarcoma virus, and a search of the company's records showed that it had demonstrated low toxicity when tested for its antibacterial activity in rats many years earlier. Based in part on these results, AZT was selected by nucleoside chemist Janet Rideout as one of 11 compounds to send to the NCI for testing in that organization's HIV antiviral assay. In February 1985, the NCI scientists found that AZT had potent efficacy in vitro. Several months later, a phase 1 clinical trial of AZT at the NCI was initiated at the NCI and Duke University. In doing this Phase I trial, they built on their experience in doing an earlier trial, with suramin, another drug that had shown effective anti-HIV activity in the laboratory. This initial trial of AZT proved that the drug could be safely administered to patients with HIV, that it increased their CD4 counts, restored T cell immunity as measured by skin testing, and that it showed strong evidence of clinical effectiveness, such as inducing weight gain in AIDS patients. It also showed that levels of AZT that worked in vitro could be injected into patients in serum and suppository form, and that the drug penetrated deeply only into infected brains. === Patent filed and FDA approval === A flawed double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of AZT was subsequently conducted by Burroughs-Wellcome and suggested that AZT safely prolongs the lives of people with HIV. However, it was quickly unblinded and several more in the drug receiving group later perished. Burroughs-Wellcome filed for a patent for AZT in 1985. The Anti-Infective Advisory Committee to United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted ten to one to recommend the approval of AZT. The FDA approved the drug (via the then-new FDA accelerated approval system) for use against HIV, AIDS, and AIDS Related Complex (ARC, a now-obsolete medical term for pre-AIDS illness) on March 20, 1987. The time between the first demonstration that AZT was active against HIV in the laboratory and its approval was 25 months. AZT was subsequently approved unanimously for infants and children in 1990. AZT was initially administered in significantly higher dosages than today, typically 400 mg every four hours, day and night, compared to modern dosage of 300 mg twice daily. The paucity of alternatives for treating HIV/AIDS at that time unambiguously affirmed the health risk/benefit ratio, with inevitable slow, disfiguring, and painful death from HIV outweighing the drug's side effect of transient anemia and malaise. == Society and culture == Until 1991, 80% of the $420 million allocated to the National Institute of Health's AIDS Clinical Trials Group, went toward studies of AZT. Aside from two similarly designed chemotherapies, ddI and ddC, from approval of AZT in 1987 until 1993, no other drugs against AIDS were approved, leading to criticism that research preoccupation with AZT and its close relatives, and the massive diverting of funds to such, had delayed the development of more efficacious drugs. In 1991, the advocacy group Public Citizen filed a lawsuit claiming that the patents were invalid. Subsequently, Barr Laboratories and Novopharm Ltd. also challenged the patent, in part based on the assertion that NCI scientists Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan should have been named as inventors, and those two companies applied to the FDA to sell AZT as a generic drug. In response, Burroughs Wellcome Co. filed a lawsuit against the two companies. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in 1992 in favor of Burroughs Wellcome, ruling that even though they had never tested it against HIV, they had conceived of it working before they sent it to the NCI scientists. This suit was appealed up to the Supreme Court of the US, but in 1996 the Court declined to formally review it. The case, Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Laboratories, was a landmark in US law of inventorship. In 2002, another lawsuit was filed challenging the patent by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which also filed an antitrust case against GSK. The patent case was dismissed in 2003 and AHF filed a new case challenging the patent. GSK's patents on AZT expired in 2005, and in September 2005, the FDA approved three generic versions. == References == == External links == ""Zidovudine"". Drug Information Portal.

1728,"('Doxylamine (succinate)', 'Doxylamine', 'Dossilamina', 'Doxylaminum', 'Doxilminio')",Medical,"Doxylamine is an antihistamine medication used to treat insomnia and allergies, and—in combination with pyridoxine (vitamin B6)—to treat morning sickness in pregnant women. It is available over-the-counter and is typically sold under such brand names as Equate or Unisom, among others; and it is used in nighttime cold medicines (e.g., NyQuil) and pain medications containing acetaminophen and/or codeine to help with sleep. The medication is delivered chemically by the salt doxylamine succinate and is taken by mouth. Doxylamine and other first-generation antihistamines are the most widely used sleep medications in the world. Typical side effects of doxylamine (at recommended doses) include dizziness, drowsiness, grogginess, and dry mouth, among others. As an antihistamine, doxylamine is an inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. As a first-generation antihistamine, it typically crosses the blood–brain barrier into the brain, thereby producing a suite of sedative and hypnotic effects that are mediated by the central nervous system. (N.b.: An agonist is a molecule that activates certain receptors (i.e., specific cellular proteins) in a cell to produce a specific pharmacological response, causing the cell to modify its activity—while an inverse agonist targets the same receptors as those of a given agonist, but causes a response opposite to that caused by the agonist. An antagonist blocks the action of a given agonist.) Doxylamine is also a potent anticholinergic, meaning that it causes delirum at high doses—i.e., at much higher doses than recommended. (Specifically it is an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1 through M5.) These sedative and deliriant effects have in some cases led to using the drug recreationally. Doxylamine was first described in 1948 or 1949. == Medical uses == Doxylamine is an antihistamine used to treat sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, hives, skin rash, itching, and other cold or allergy symptoms. It is also used as a short-term treatment for insomnia. === Insomnia === The first-generation sedating antihistamines diphenhydramine, doxepin, doxylamine, and pyrilamine are the most widely used medications in the world for preventing and treating insomnia. As of 2004, doxylamine and diphenhydramine, which are both over-the-counter medications, were the agents most commonly used to treat short-term insomnia. As of 2008 and 2017, over-the-counter antihistamines were not recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for treatment of chronic insomnia ""due to the relative lack of efficacy and safety data"". Neither version of their guidelines explicitly included or mentioned doxylamine, although diphenhydramine was discussed. A 2015 systematic review of over-the-counter sleep aids including doxylamine found little evidence to inform the use of doxylamine for treatment of insomnia. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found that doxylamine had an effect size (standardized mean difference (SMD)) against placebo for treatment of insomnia at 4 weeks of 0.47 (95% CITooltip confidence interval 0.06 to 0.89). The certainty of evidence was rated as moderate. No data were available for doxylamine in terms of longer-term treatment (3 months). For comparison, the other sedating medicines assessed, doxepin and trimipramine (both of which are tricyclic antidepressants) had effect sizes (SMD) at 4 weeks of 0.30 (95% CI –0.05 to 0.64) (very low certainty evidence) and 0.55 (95% CI –0.11 to 1.21) (very low certainty evidence), respectively. Doses of doxylamine that have been used for sleep range from 5 to 50 mg, with 25 mg being the typical dose. === Morning sickness === Doxylamine is used in the combination drug pyridoxine/doxylamine to treat morning sickness (nausea and vomiting of pregnancy). It is the only medication approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of morning sickness. === Available forms === Doxylamine is used medically as doxylamine succinate, the succinate salt of doxylamine, and is available both alone (brand names Decapryn, Doxy-Sleep-Aid, Unisom) and in combination with pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) (brand names Bendectin, Bonjesta, Diclegis). Doxylamine is available alone as immediate-release oral tablets containing 25 mg doxylamine succinate. Oral tablets containing 12.5 mg doxylamine succinate as well as oral capsules containing 25 mg doxylamine succinate were also previously available but were discontinued. The combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine is available in the form of extended- and delayed-release oral tablets containing 10 to 20 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 to 20 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride. Doxylamine alone is available over-the-counter, whereas doxylamine in combination with pyridoxine is a prescription-only medication. Doxylamine is also available in over-the-counter nighttime cold medicine products such as NyQuil Cold & Flu (contains acetaminophen, doxylamine succinate 6.25 to 12.5 mg, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide), where it serves as the sedating component. == Contraindications == The fetal safety rating of doxylamine is ""A"" (no evidence of risk). == Side effects == Side effects of doxylamine include dizziness, drowsiness, and dry mouth, among others. Doxylamine is a potent anticholinergic and has a side-effect profile common to such drugs, including blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, muscle incoordination, urinary retention, mental confusion, and delirium. Because of its relatively long elimination half-life (10–12 hours), doxylamine is associated with next-day effects including sedation, drowsiness, grogginess, dry mouth, and tiredness when used as a hypnotic. This may be described as a ""hangover effect"". The shorter elimination half-life of diphenhydramine (4–8 hours) compared to doxylamine may give it an advantage over doxylamine as a sleep aid in this regard. Antihistamines like doxylamine are sedating initially but tolerance occurs with repeated use and can result in rebound insomnia upon discontinuation. Occasional case reports of coma and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with doxylamine. This is in contrast to diphenhydramine. Studies of doxylamine's carcinogenicity in mice and rats have produced positive results for both liver and thyroid cancer, especially in the mouse. The carcinogenicity of the drug in humans is not well-studied, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer lists the drug as ""not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans"". Continuous and/or cumulative use of anticholinergic medications, including first-generation antihistamines, is associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older people. == Overdose == Doxylamine is generally safe for administration to healthy adults. Doses of doxylamine of up to 1,600 mg/day for 6 months have been given to adults with schizophrenia, with little toxicity encountered. The median lethal dose (LD50) is estimated to be 50–500 mg/kg in humans. Symptoms of overdose may include dry mouth, dilated pupils, insomnia, night terrors, euphoria, hallucinations, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and death. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose. These have been characterized by coma, tonic-clonic (or grand mal) seizures and cardiopulmonary arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiopulmonary arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3-year-old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. Rarely, an overdose results in rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Doxylamine acts primarily as an antagonist or inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. This action is responsible for its antihistamine and sedative properties. To a lesser extent, doxylamine acts as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, an action responsible for its anticholinergic and (at high doses) deliriant effects. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of doxylamine is 24.7% for oral administration and 70.8% for intranasal administration. The Tmax of doxylamine is 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Its elimination half-life is 10 to 12 hours (range 7 to 15 hours). Doxylamine is metabolized in the liver primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9. The main metabolites are N-desmethyldoxylamine, N,N-didesmethyldoxylamine, and doxylamine N-oxide. Doxylamine is eliminated 60% in the urine and 40% in feces. == Chemistry == Doxylamine is a member of the ethanolamine class of antihistamines. Other antihistamines from this group include bromodiphenhydramine, carbinoxamine, clemastine, dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, orphenadrine, and phenyltoloxamine. == History == Doxylamine is a first-generation antihistamine and was discovered by Nathan Sperber and colleagues and was first reported in 1948 or 1949. It has been the antihistamine component of NyQuil since 1966. Bendectin, a combination of doxylamine, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and dicyclomine (an anticholinergic antispasmodic agent), was marketed for treatment of morning sickness in 1956. This product was reformulated in 1976 to remove dicyclomine. The reformulated product was voluntarily discontinued by the manufacturer in the United States in 1983 due to concerns about an alleged association with congenital limb defects. However, these concerns have not been supported by studies. In 2013, doxylamine/pyridoxine was reintroduced in the United States under the brand name Diclegis. The combination was not removed from the market in Canada, where it had been marketed since 1979. == Society and culture == === Formulations === Doxylamine is primarily used as the succinic acid salt, doxylamine succinate. It is the sedating ingredient of NyQuil (generally in combination with dextromethorphan and acetaminophen). In Commonwealth countries, such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, doxylamine is available prepared with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and codeine under the brand name Dolased, Propain Plus, Syndol, or Mersyndol, as treatment for tension headache and other types of pain.

Brinzolamide was approved as a generic medication in the United States in November 2020. == Chemistry == Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (specifically, carbonic anhydrase II). Carbonic anhydrase is found primarily in erythrocytes (but also in other tissues including the eye). It exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active of which is carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II). == Indications == Use for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and raised intraocular pressure due to either excess aqueous humor production or inadequate drainage of the humor via the trabecular meshwork. == Pharmacodynamics == Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion and thus lowers the intraocular pressure in the anterior chamber, presumably by reducing the rate of formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport; this may alleviate the effects of open-angle glaucoma. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === The recommended frequency for topical application is two times per day. Following ocular instillation, the suspension is systemically absorbed to some degree; however the plasma concentrations are low and generally below the limits of detection (less than 10 ng/mL) due to extensive binding by tissues and erythrocytes. Oral administration is less-favored due to variable absorption from the stomach mucosa and an increased side-effect profile versus ophthalmic administration. === Distribution === The compound is fairly well protein-bound (60%), but adheres extensively to the carbonic anhydrase-containing erythrocytes. Due to the abundance of readily-bound erythrocytes and minimal known metabolism, Brinzolamide's whole blood half-life is very long (111 days). === Metabolism === While definitive sites of metabolism have not been firmly established, there are several metabolites worthy of note. N-Desethylbrinzolamide is an active metabolite of the parent compound, and thus exhibits carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity (largely carbonic anhydrase-I, when in the presence of Brinzolamide) and also accumulates in the erythrocytes. However, Brinzolamide's other known metabolites (N-Desmethoxypropylbrinzolamide and O-Desmethylbrinzolamide) either have no activity or their activity is currently unknown. === Excretion === Brinzolamide is excreted primarily unchanged (60%) in the urine, although the renal clearance rate has not been definitively determined. N-Desethylbrinzolamide is also found in the urine along with lower concentrations of the inactive metabolites, N-Desmethoxypropylbrinzolamide and O-Desmethylbrinzolamide; exact levels have not been definitively determined. == Cautions == === Side effects === Common, but mild: blurred vision; bitter, sour, or unusual taste; itching, pain, watering, or dryness of the eyes; feeling that something is in the eye; headache; runny nose Rare, but serious: fast or irregular heartbeat; fainting; skin rash, hives, or itching; severe eye irritation, redness, or swelling; swelling in the face, lips, or throat; wheezing or trouble breathing === Precautions === Hypersensitivity to other sulfonamides Acute angle-closure glaucoma Concomitant administration of oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease or liver disease == Combinations == === With timolol === The combination of brinzolamide with timolol is marketed under the trade name Azarga. This combination may be more effective than either medication alone. === With brimonidine === The combination of brinzolamide with brimonidine is marketed under the trade name Simbrinza.

1730,"('Desipramine hydrochloride', 'Desipramine', 'Norimipramine', 'Desmethylimipramine', 'Desipramin')",Medical,"Desipramine, sold under the brand name Norpramin among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) used in the treatment of depression. It acts as a relatively selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, though it does also have other activities such as weak serotonin reuptake inhibitory, α1-blocking, antihistamine, and anticholinergic effects. The drug is not considered a first-line treatment for depression since the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, which have fewer side effects and are safer in overdose. == Medical uses == Desipramine is primarily used for the treatment of depression. It may also be useful to treat symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Evidence of benefit is only in the short term, and with concerns of side effects its overall usefulness is not clear. Desipramine at very low doses is also used to help reduce the pain associated with functional dyspepsia. It has also been tried, albeit with little evidence of effectiveness, in the treatment of cocaine dependence. Evidence for usefulness in neuropathic pain is also poor. == Side effects == Desipramine tends to be less sedating than other TCAs and tends to produce fewer anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and cognitive or memory impairments. == Overdose == Desipramine is particularly toxic in cases of overdose, compared to other antidepressants. Any overdose or suspected overdose of desipramine is considered to be a medical emergency and can result in death without prompt medical intervention. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Desipramine is a very potent and relatively selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), which is thought to enhance noradrenergic neurotransmission. Based on one study, it has the highest affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) of any other TCA, and is said to be the most noradrenergic and the most selective for the NET of the TCAs. The observed effectiveness of desipramine in the treatment of ADHD was the basis for the development of the selective NRI atomoxetine and its use in ADHD. Desipramine has the weakest antihistamine and anticholinergic effects of the TCAs. It tends to be slightly activating/stimulating rather than sedating, unlike most others TCAs. Whereas other TCAs are useful for treating insomnia, desipramine can cause insomnia as a side effect due to its activating properties. The drug is also not associated with weight gain, in contrast to many other TCAs. Secondary amine TCAs like desipramine and nortriptyline have a lower risk of orthostatic hypotension than other TCAs, although desipramine can still cause moderate orthostatic hypotension. === Pharmacokinetics === Desipramine is the major metabolite of imipramine and lofepramine. == Chemistry == Desipramine is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine (N-methyldesipramine), clomipramine, trimipramine, and lofepramine (N-(4-chlorobenzoylmethyl)desipramine). Desipramine is a secondary amine TCA, with its N-methylated parent imipramine being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine TCAs include nortriptyline and protriptyline. The chemical name of desipramine is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepin-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C18H22N2 with a molecular weight of 266.381 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the dibudinate salt is or has been used for intramuscular injection in Argentina (brand name Nebril) and the free base form is not used. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 50-47-5, of the hydrochloride is 58-28-6, and of the dibudinate is 62265-06-9. == History == Desipramine was developed by Geigy. It first appeared in the literature in 1959 and was patented in 1962. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in 1963 or 1964. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Desipramine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while desipramine hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name.

1732,"('Kynurenic acid', 'Quinurenic acid', 'Kynurenate', 'Transtorine', 'Kinurenic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Kynurenic acid (KYNA or KYN) is a product of the normal metabolism of amino acid L-tryptophan. It has been shown that kynurenic acid possesses neuroactive activity. It acts as an antiexcitotoxic and anticonvulsant, most likely through acting as an antagonist at excitatory amino acid receptors. Because of this activity, it may influence important neurophysiological and neuropathological processes. As a result, kynurenic acid has been considered for use in therapy in certain neurobiological disorders. Conversely, increased levels of kynurenic acid have also been linked to certain pathological conditions. Kynurenic acid was discovered in 1853 by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in dog urine, which it was apparently named after. It is formed from L-kynurenine in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme kynurenine—oxoglutarate transaminase. == Mechanism of action == KYNA has been proposed to act on five targets: As an antagonist at ionotropic AMPA, NMDA and Kainate glutamate receptors in the concentration range of 0.1-2.5 mM. As a noncompetitive antagonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor. As an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, recently (2011) direct recording of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents in adult (noncultured) hippocampal interneurons by the Cooper laboratory validated a 2009 study that failed to find any blocking effect of kynurenic acid across a wide range of concentrations, thus suggesting that in noncultured, intact preparations from adult animals there is no effect of kynurenic acid on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents. As a ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35. As an agonist for the G protein-coupled receptor HCAR3. == Role in disease == High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in patients with tick-borne encephalitis, schizophrenia and HIV-related illnesses. In all these situations, increased levels were associated with confusion and psychotic symptoms. Kynurenic acid acts in the brain as a glycine-site NMDAr antagonist, key in glutamatergic neurotransmission system, which is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The kynurenic acid hypothesis of schizophrenia was proposed in 2007, based on its action on midbrain dopamine activity and NMDArs, thus linking dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia with the glutamate hypothesis of the disease. Kynurenic acid is reduced in individuals with mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, especially during depressive episodes. High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in human urine in certain metabolic disorders, such as marked pyridoxine deficiency and deficiency/absence of kynureninase. When researchers decreased the levels of kynurenic acid in the brains of mice, their cognition was shown to improve markedly. However, kynurenic acid also shows neuroprotective properties. Some researchers have posited that the increased levels found in cases of neurological degradation is due to a failed attempt to protect the cells. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid compared to kynurenine appear to be associated with poorer T cell response and higher mortality in male subjects with COVID-19, suggesting an explanation for the poorer clinical outcomes observed in males than in females. == Link to ketogenic diet == One controlled study kept mice on a ketogenic diet and measured kynurenic acid concentrations in different parts of the brain. It found that the mice on the ketogenic diet had greater kynurenic acid concentrations in the striatum and hippocampus compared to mice on a normal diet, with no significant difference in the cortex. In response to the studies showing detrimental behaviour following increases in kynurenic acid the authors also note that the diet was generally well tolerated by the animals, with no ""gross behavioural abnormalities"". They posit that the increases in concentrations found were insufficient to produce behavioural changes seen in those studies. == See also == Xanthurenic acid == References == == External links == Link found between TBE and schizophrenia - TheLocal.se, Sweden's news in English, 6 November 2007.",Kinurenic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0001239196863025427), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.000627014203928411), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.07278712093830109), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.0005901502445340157), ('ĠMED', -0.011820864863693714), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07890715450048447)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynurenic_acid ', [])"

1734,"('Ramipril', 'Tritace', 'Altace', 'Ramace', 'Carasel')",Medical,"Ramipril, sold under the brand name Altace among others, is an ACE inhibitor type medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It can also be used as a preventative medication in patients over 55 years old to reduce the risk of having a heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death in patients shown to be at high risk, such as some diabetics and patients with vascular disease. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and cough. Serious side effects may include liver problems, angioedema, kidney problems, and high blood potassium. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an ACE inhibitor and works by decreasing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity. Ramipril was patented in 1981 and approved for medical use in 1989. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 187th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Activation and binding == Ramipril is a pro-drug. The molecule must be hydrolyzed by an esterase at the OCH2CH3 and form a carboxylate. This carboxylate then interacts with the positive Zn2+ ion which is located at the active site of the ACE enzyme. Ramipril is similar in structure to another ACE Inhibitor, trandolapril, but it has a second cyclopentane ring instead of a cyclohexane ring. == Medical uses == Medical uses include: High blood pressure (Hypertension) Congestive heart failure Following heart attack in people with evidence of heart failure People over 55 years at high risk: prevention of heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular death, or in need of revascularization procedures Prevent the onset and/or delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease, with or without proteinuria. Randomized trial evidence suggests that a maximum tolerable dose prevents cardiovascular events and death in patients with diabetic kidney disease. == Contraindications == Contraindications to its use include volume-depleted patients, a history of angioedema while on an ACE inhibitor, pregnancy and hypotension. People should not take ramipril (or any ACE inhibitors) if they have hyperkalemia. It is also recommended to avoid using salt-substitutes as this can further increase potassium levels in the blood. Ramipril can be considered in patients with bilateral or unilateral significant renal artery stenosis (RAS). An early rise in serum creatinine above baseline is expected after initiation of therapy with Ramipril, however, monitoring serum biochemistry and renal function after initiation is crucial. Treatment with Ramipril in some patients with significant narrowing in both kidneys can increase serum creatinine concentration (measured in the blood test), which returns to baseline upon therapy cessation. == Adverse effects == Shakiness Dry cough Dizziness and lightheadedness due to low blood pressure Fatigue, especially in the early stages Mouth dryness in the early stages Nausea Fainting Signs of infection (e.g., fever, chills, persistent sore throat) Chest pain Neutropenia (low white blood cells) Impotence (erectile dysfunction) Hyperkalemia Serious allergic reactions to this drug are unlikely, but immediate medical attention must be sought if they occur. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction include, but are not limited to a rash or swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, or throat. In extreme cases, ramipril may lead to potentially fatal liver problems. == Mechanism of action == ACE inhibitors inhibit the actions of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), thereby lowering the production of angiotensin II and decreasing the breakdown of bradykinin. The decrease in angiotensin II results in relaxation of arteriole smooth muscle leading to a decrease in total peripheral resistance, reducing blood pressure as the blood is pumped through widened vessels. Its effect on bradykinin is responsible for the dry cough side effect. Ramipril, a prodrug or precursor drug, is converted to the active metabolite ramiprilat by carboxylesterase 1. Ramiprilat is mostly excreted by the kidneys. Its half-life is variable (3–16 hours), and is prolonged by heart and liver failure, as well as kidney failure. Peak effect occurs between 3 and 6 hours after dosing, with approximately 50% of this effect retained after 24 hours. == Synthesis == The penultimate step in the synthesis of ramipril combines an alanine derivative with a (S,S,S)-2-azabicyclo-[3.3.0]-octane-3-carboxylic acid protected as its benzyl ester. In the original patented route, these components were obtained by a multi-step process. The acid chloride forms an amide bond with the amino group of the pyrrolidine ring in the presence of triethylamine and ramipril is the product after the benzyl ester has been removed by hydrogenation. == Society and culture == === US patent === The compound was protected by a patent which was assigned to the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst AG (since merged into Aventis) on 29 October 1991. The patent was scheduled to expire on 29 October 2008. On 11 September 2007, in an appeal by the Indian company Lupin Ltd., the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed a district court trial verdict and found that Aventis's patent on ramipril was invalid for ""obviousness"", opening this drug to generic manufacturers. === Brand names === Ramipril is marketed as Prilace by Arrow Pharmaceuticals in Australia, Ramipro by Westfield Pharma in the Philippines, Triatec by Sanofi-Aventis in Italy and United States and Altace by King Pharmaceuticals in the United States, Novapril by Pharmanova in Ghana, Ramitens by PharmaSwiss, Ampril by Krka in Slovenia, Corpril by Cemelog-BRS in Hungary, Piramil and Prilinda by Hemofarm in Serbia, by Lek in Poland and by Novartis and Opsonin Pharma Limited as Ramace in Bangladesh, and in Canada as Altace (Sanofi-Aventis) and Ramipril (Pharmascience). Ramipril is marketed in India under the brand names Cardace, Zigpril, Ramistar, Odipril and Zorem . Ramipril is marketed in Myanmar under brand name Endpril . == Research == The 2001 Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation trial seemed to show ramipril possessed cardioprotective qualities which extended beyond its qualities as an antihypertensive. However, the trial and the interpretation of its results have been criticised. The Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) trial showed a 27% reduction in mortality for patients receiving ramipril for chronic heart failure following a myocardial infarction. Ramipril was found to have similar results as telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker. == References ==",Carasel,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.288163083605468e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01941147819161415), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014631589874625206)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.trademarkelite.com/australia/trademark/trademark-detail/2087626/Carasel ', [])"

1736,"('Fenbendazole', 'Panacur', 'Fenbendazol', 'Phenbendasol', 'Fenbendazolum')",Medical,"Fenbendazole is a broad-spectrum benzimidazole anthelmintic used against gastrointestinal parasites including: Giardia species, roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, the tapeworm genus Taenia (but not effective against Dipylidium caninum, a common dog tapeworm), pinworms, Aelurostrongylus spp., paragonimiasis, strongyles, and strongyloides that can be administered to sheep, cattle, horses, fish, dogs, cats, rabbits, most reptiles, freshwater shrimp tanks as planaria and hydra treatments, and seals. == Mechanism of action == Fenbendazole works by binding to tubulin, a protein that is part of the microtubules in the cells of parasites. This binding disrupts the microtubules' formation and function, leading to the parasites' inability to absorb nutrients, resulting in their eventual death. This mode of action makes fenbendazole effective against both adult and larval stages of many parasitic worms. == Uses in veterinary medicine == === Dogs and cats === Fenbendazole is commonly used to treat intestinal parasites, including roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and certain tapeworms. It is often administered as part of a broader deworming protocol. === Horses === In equine medicine, fenbendazole is used to control strongyles, pinworms, and ascarids. It is available in paste form for easy administration. === Cattle and goats === Fenbendazole is effective against lungworms, stomach worms, and intestinal worms in ruminants. It is administered through feed, drenching, or bolus form. == Drug interactions == Drug interactions may occur if salicylanilides such as dibromsalan and niclosamide are co-administered. Abortions in cattle and death in sheep have been reported after using these medications together. Abortions in domestic ruminants have been associated with concurrent use of antitrematode therapeutic agents. == Dosage and administration == The appropriate dosage of the medication fenbendazole depends on the specific animal species being treated, as well as the particular formulation or preparation of the fenbendazole product being used. To ensure the correct dosage, considering the animal species being treated with its weight, using a dosage calculator like the Fenbendazole Paraclear Defense Dosage Calculator would be recommended. == Toxicity == Fenbendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in most species. The LD50 in laboratory animals exceeds 10 g/kg when administered orally. == Metabolism == Fenbendazole is metabolized in the liver to oxfendazole, which is anthelmintic, too; oxfendazole partially gets reduced back to fenbendazole in the liver and rumen. Also, fenbendazole itself is an active metabolite of another anthelmintic drug, febantel. == Safety and precautions == Fenbendazole is generally safe when used as directed, but following veterinary guidelines and dosage instructions to avoid potential side effects is important. Some animals may experience mild gastrointestinal upset. It is not recommended for use in pregnant animals without veterinary advice. == Repurposing == Fenbendazole has been proposed for repurposing as an anticancer drug due to its ability to disrupt energy metabolism in cancer cells and induce cell death through multiple mechanisms. Its poor bioavailability when administered orally, though, remains a challenge for its use as a cancer treatment. == See also == Ivermectin – Medication for parasite infestations Nocodazole – Microtubule depolymerizing drug Praziquantel – Anti-parasite medication == References ==",Panacur,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.46445897221565247)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0604994036257267), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4742101728916168)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([akc.org](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/panacur-for-dogs/?utm_source=openai), [petmd.com](https://www.petmd.com/pet-medication/fenbendazole-panacur-safe-guard-for-dogs-cats?utm_source=openai), [merck-animal-health-usa.com](https://www.merck-animal-health-usa.com/species/canine/products/panacur-granules-22-2?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=346, start_index=6, title='Panacur For Dogs – American Kennel Club', type='url_citation', url='https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/panacur-for-dogs/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=346, start_index=6, title='Fenbendazole (Panacur®, Safe-guard®) | for Dogs and Cats | Dog, Cat, Pet Medication| PetMD | PetMD', type='url_citation', url='https://www.petmd.com/pet-medication/fenbendazole-panacur-safe-guard-for-dogs-cats?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=346, start_index=6, title='PANACUR® GRANULES 22.2% | Merck Animal Health USA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.merck-animal-health-usa.com/species/canine/products/panacur-granules-22-2?utm_source=openai')])"
1737,"('N-ethylmaleimide', 'Ethylmaleimide', 'Maleimide, n-ethyl-', 'Maleic acid n-ethylimide', 'N-ethyl maleimide')",Medical,"N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) is an organic compound that is derived from maleic acid. It contains the amide functional group, but more importantly it is an alkene that is reactive toward thiols and is commonly used to modify cysteine residues in proteins and peptides. == Organic chemistry == NEM is a Michael acceptor in the Michael reaction, which means that it adds nucleophiles such as thiols. The resulting thioether features a strong C–S bond and the reaction is virtually irreversible. Reaction with thiols occur in the pH range 6.5–7.5, NEM may react with amines or undergo hydrolysis at a more alkaline pH. NEM has been widely used to probe the functional role of thiol groups in enzymology. NEM is an irreversible inhibitor of all cysteine peptidases, with alkylation occurring at the active site thiol group (see schematic). == Case studies == NEM blocks vesicular transport. In lysis buffers, 20 to 25 mM of NEM is used to inhibit de-sumoylation of proteins for Western Blot analysis. NEM has also been used as an inhibitor of deubiquitinases. N-Ethylmaleimide was used by Arthur Kornberg and colleagues to knock out DNA polymerase III in order to compare its activity to that of DNA polymerase I (pol III and I, respectively). Kornberg had been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering pol I, then believed to be the mechanism of bacterial DNA replication, although in this experiment he showed that pol III was the actual replicative machinery. NEM activates ouabain-insensitive Cl-dependent K efflux in low-K sheep and goat red blood cells. This discovery contributed to the molecular identification of K–Cl cotransport (KCC) in human embryonic cells transfected by KCC1 isoform cDNA, 16 years later. Since then, NEM has been widely used as a diagnostic tool to uncover or manipulate the membrane presence of K–Cl cotransport in cells of many species in the animal kingdom. Despite repeated unsuccessful attempts to identify chemically the target thiol group, at physiological pH, NEM may form adducts with thiols within protein kinases that phosphorylate KCC at specific serine and threonine residues primarily within the C-terminal domain of the transporter. The ensuing dephosphorylation of KCC by protein phosphatases leads to activation of KCC. == References == == External links == The MEROPS online database for peptidases and their inhibitors: NEM The bifunctional analogues such as p-NN′-phenylenebismaleimide can be used as cross-linking reagent for cystine residues. see Lutter, L.

The most common side effects include injection site reactions, skin hyperpigmentation (skin patches that are darker than surrounding skin), headache and gastrointestinal side effects (such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), among others. Spontaneous penile erections in males and adverse sexual reactions in females have occurred with treatment. Depression and suicidal ideation have also occurred with setmelanotide. Setmelanotide was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2020, and in the European Union in July 2021. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Setmelanotide is indicated for chronic weight management (weight loss and weight maintenance for at least one year) in people six years and older with obesity due to three rare genetic conditions: pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency, proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) deficiency, and leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency confirmed by genetic testing demonstrating variants in POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR genes considered pathogenic (causing disease), likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance. Setmelanotide is the first FDA-approved treatment for these genetic conditions. Setmelanotide is not approved for obesity due to suspected POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency with variants classified as benign (not causing disease) or likely benign or other types of obesity, including obesity associated with other genetic syndromes and general (polygenic) obesity. == Pharmacology == Setmelanotide binds to and activates MC4 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), areas involved in the regulation of appetite, and this action is thought to underlie its appetite suppressant effects. In addition to reducing appetite, setmelanotide increases resting energy expenditure in both obese animals and humans. Importantly, unlike certain other MC4 receptor agonists, such as LY-2112688, setmelanotide has not been found to produce increases in heart rate or blood pressure. Setmelanotide has been reported to possess the following activity profile (cAMP, EC50): MC4 (0.27 nM) > MC3 (5.3 nM) ≈ MC1 (5.8 nM) > MC5 (1600 nM) ≟ MC2 (>1000 nM). (19.6-fold selectivity for MC4 over MC3, the second target of highest activity.) == History == Setmelanotide was invented at Ipsen. It was initially known as BIM-22493 and then as RM-493 and IRC-022493. It was evaluated in two one-year clinical studies. The first study enrolled 10 participants with obesity and confirmed or suspected POMC or PCSK1 deficiency while the second study enrolled 11 participants with obesity and confirmed or suspected LEPR deficiency; all participants were six years or older. Most participants had lost more than 10% of their initial body weight after a year of treatment. Some participants also reported feeling less hungry. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for setmelanotide orphan disease designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review.

Setmelanotide was approved for medical use in the European Union in July 2021. == Research == Setmelanotide is a peptide drug and investigational anti-obesity medication which acts as a selective agonist of the MC4 receptor; the structure of the bound complex has recently been determined. Its peptide sequence is Ac-Arg-Cys(1)-D-Ala-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Cys(1)-NH2. It was first discovered at Ipsen and is being developed by Rhythm Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. In addition, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals is conducting trials of setmelanotide for the treatment of Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS), a genetic disorder which includes MC4 receptor deficiency and associated symptoms such as excessive appetite and obesity. As of December 2014, the drug is in phase II clinical trials for obesity and PWS. So far, preliminary data has shown no benefit of Setmelanotide in Prader-Willi syndrome. The drug has some efficacy in obese people who lack the genetic variants that the drug is approved for, but its safety and efficacy in this wider population is not well understood. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02896192 for ""Setmelanotide for the Treatment of Early-Onset POMC Deficiency Obesity"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03287960 for ""Setmelanotide for the Treatment of LEPR Deficiency Obesity"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Setmelanotide acetate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.2066785934148356e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009252319578081369)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/setmelanotide-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20506354?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=149, start_index=9, title='Setmelanotide (subcutaneous route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/setmelanotide-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20506354?utm_source=openai')])"
1739,"('Valacyclovir (hydrochloride)', 'Valaciclovir hydrochloride')",Medical,"Valaciclovir, also spelled valacyclovir, is an antiviral medication used to treat outbreaks of herpes simplex or herpes zoster (shingles). It is also used to prevent cytomegalovirus following a kidney transplant in high risk cases. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache and vomiting. Severe side effects may include kidney problems. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. It is a prodrug, which works after being converted to aciclovir in a person's body. Valaciclovir was patented in 1987 and came into medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 113th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valaciclovir is used for the treatment of HSV and VZV infections, including: Oral and genital herpes simplex (treatment and prevention) Reduction of HSV transmission from people with recurrent infection to uninfected individuals Herpes zoster (shingles): the typical dosage for treatment of herpes is 1,000 mg orally three times a day for seven consecutive days. Prevention of cytomegalovirus following organ transplantation Prevention of herpesviruses in immunocompromised people (such as those undergoing cancer chemotherapy) Chickenpox in children (ages 2–18) It has shown promise as a treatment for infectious mononucleosis and is preventively administered in suspected cases of herpes B virus exposure. Bell's palsy does not seem to benefit from using valaciclovir as its only treatment. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of people) associated with valaciclovir are the same as for aciclovir, its active metabolite. They include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include: agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, edema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, rash, weakness and/or renal impairment. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include: coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, tremor, ataxia, encephalopathy, psychotic symptoms, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and/or anaphylaxis. == Pharmacology == Valaciclovir is a prodrug, an esterified version of aciclovir that has greater oral bioavailability (about 55%) than aciclovir. It is converted by esterases to the active drug, aciclovir, and the amino acid valine via hepatic first-pass metabolism. Aciclovir is selectively converted into a monophosphate form by viral thymidine kinase, which is more effective (3000 times) in phosphorylation of aciclovir than cellular thymidine kinase. Subsequently, the monophosphate form is further phosphorylated into a disphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and then into the active triphosphate form, aciclo-GTP, by cellular kinases. === Mechanism of action === Aciclo-GTP, the active triphosphate metabolite of aciclovir, is a very potent inhibitor of viral DNA replication. Aciclo-GTP competitively inhibits and inactivates the viral DNA polymerase. Its monophosphate form also incorporates into the viral DNA, resulting in chain termination. It has also been shown that the viral enzymes cannot remove aciclo-GMP from the chain, which results in inhibition of further activity of DNA polymerase. Aciclo-GTP is fairly rapidly metabolized within the cell, possibly by cellular phosphatases. Aciclovir is active against most species in the herpesvirus family. In descending order of activity: Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) Herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2) Varicella zoster virus (VZV) Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) The drug is predominantly active against HSV and, to a lesser extent, VZV. It is only of limited efficacy against EBV and CMV. However, valaciclovir has been shown to lower or eliminate the presence of the Epstein–Barr virus in subjects afflicted with acute mononucleosis, leading to a significant decrease in the severity of symptoms. Valaciclovir and acyclovir act by inhibiting viral DNA replication, but as of 2016 there was little evidence that they are effective against Epstein–Barr virus. Acyclovir therapy does prevent viral latency, but has not proven effective at eradicating latent viruses in nerve ganglia. As of 2005, resistance to valaciclovir has not been significant. Mechanisms of resistance in HSV include deficient viral thymidine kinase and mutations to viral thymidine kinase and/or DNA polymerase that alter substrate sensitivity. It also is used for herpes B virus postexposure prophylaxis. == Chemistry == Details of the synthesis of valaciclovir were first published by scientists from the Wellcome Foundation. Aciclovir was esterified with a carboxybenzyl protected valine, using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as the dehydrating agent. In the final step, the protecting group was removed by hydrogenation using a palladium on alumina catalyst. == History == Valaciclovir was patented in 1987 and came into medical use in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 113th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Society and culture == === Brand names === It is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the brand names Valtrex and Zelitrex.

1740,"('Trehalose', 'Œ±,œ±-trehalose', 'Alpha,alpha-trehalose', 'Mycose', 'Ergot sugar')","Food, Medical","Trehalose (from Turkish tıgala – a sugar derived from insect cocoons + -ose) is a sugar consisting of two molecules of glucose. It is also known as mycose or tremalose. Some bacteria, fungi, plants and invertebrate animals synthesize it as a source of energy, and to survive freezing and lack of water. Extracting trehalose was once a difficult and costly process, but around 2000, the Hayashibara company (Okayama, Japan) discovered an inexpensive extraction technology from starch. Trehalose has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food, cosmetics and as a drug. A procedure developed in 2017 using trehalose allows sperm storage at room temperatures. == Structure == Trehalose is a disaccharide formed by a 1,1-glycosidic bond between two α-glucose units. It is found in nature as a disaccharide and also as a monomer in some polymers. Two other stereoisomers exist: α,β-trehalose, also called neotrehalose, and β,β-trehalose, also called isotrehalose. Neither of these alternate isomers has been isolated from living organisms, but isotrehalose has been was found in starch hydroisolates. == Synthesis == At least three biological pathways support trehalose biosynthesis. An industrial process can derive trehalose from corn starch. == Properties == === Chemical === Trehalose is a nonreducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1–1 alpha bond, giving it the name α-D-gluco­pyranosyl-(1→1)-α-D-gluco­pyranoside. The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore is stable in solution at high temperatures, even under acidic conditions. The bonding keeps nonreducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation). Trehalose is less soluble than sucrose, except at high temperatures (>80 °C). Trehalose forms a rhomboid crystal as the dihydrate, and has 90% of the calorific content of sucrose in that form. Anhydrous forms of trehalose readily regain moisture to form the dihydrate. Anhydrous forms of trehalose can show interesting physical properties when heat-treated. Trehalose aqueous solutions show a concentration-dependent clustering tendency. Owing to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, they self-associate in water to form clusters of various sizes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that concentrations of 1.5–2.2 molar allow trehalose molecular clusters to percolate and form large and continuous aggregates. Trehalose directly interacts with nucleic acids, facilitates melting of double stranded DNA and stabilizes single-stranded nucleic acids. === Biological === Organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, invertebrates, and lower and higher plants have enzymes that can make trehalose. In nature, trehalose can be found in plants, and microorganisms. In animals, trehalose is prevalent in shrimp, and also in insects, including grasshoppers, locusts, butterflies, and bees, in which trehalose serves as blood-sugar. Trehalase genes are found in tardigrades, the microscopic ecdysozoans found worldwide in diverse extreme environments. Trehalose is the major carbohydrate energy storage molecule used by insects for flight. One possible reason for this is that the glycosidic linkage of trehalose, when acted upon by an insect trehalase, releases two molecules of glucose, which is required for the rapid energy requirements of flight. This is double the efficiency of glucose release from the storage polymer starch, for which cleavage of one glycosidic linkage releases only one glucose molecule. The concentrations of both trehalose and glucose in the insect hemolymph are tightly controlled by multiple enzymes and hormones, including trehalase, insulin-like peptides (ILPs and DILPs), adipokinetic hormone (AKH), leucokinin (LK), octopamine and other mediators, thereby maintaining carbohydrate homeostasis by endocrine and metabolic feedback mechanisms. In plants, trehalose is seen in sunflower seeds, moonwort, Selaginella plants, and sea algae. Within the fungi, it is prevalent in some mushrooms, such as shiitake (Lentinula edodes), oyster, king oyster, and golden needle. Even within the plant kingdom, Selaginella (sometimes called the resurrection plant), which grows in desert and mountainous areas, may be cracked and dried out, but will turn green again and revive after rain because of the function of trehalose. The two prevalent theories as to how trehalose works within the organism in the state of cryptobiosis are the vitrification theory, a state that prevents ice formation, or the water displacement theory, whereby water is replaced by trehalose. In bacterial cell wall, trehalose has a structural role in adaptive responses to stress such as osmotic differences and extreme temperature. Yeast uses trehalose as a carbon source in response to abiotic stresses. In humans, the only known function of trehalose is as a neuroprotective, which it accomplishes by inducing autophagy and thereby clearing protein aggregates. Trehalose has also been reported for anti-bacterial, anti-biofilm, and anti-inflammatory (in vitro and in vivo) activities, upon its esterification with fatty acids of varying chain lengths. == Nutritional and dietary properties == Trehalose is rapidly broken down into glucose by the enzyme trehalase, which is present in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa of omnivores (including humans) and herbivores.: 135 It causes less of a spike in blood sugar than glucose. Trehalose has about 45% the sweetness of sucrose at concentrations above 22%, but when the concentration is reduced, its sweetness decreases more quickly than that of sucrose, so that a 2.3% solution tastes 6.5 times less sweet as the equivalent sugar solution.: 444 It is commonly used in prepared frozen foods, like ice cream, because it lowers the freezing point of foods. Deficiency of trehalase enzyme is unusual in humans, except in the Greenlandic Inuit, where it is present in only 10–15% of the population.: 197 == Metabolism == Five biosynthesis pathways have been reported for trehalose. The most common pathway is TPS/TPP pathway which is used by organisms that synthesize trehalose using the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase (TPS). Second, trehalose synthase (TS) in certain types of bacteria could produce trehalose by using maltose and another disaccharide with two glucose units as substrates. Third, the TreY-TreZ pathway in some bacteria converts starch that contain maltooligosaccharide or glycogen directly into trehalose. Fourth, in primitive bacteria, trehalose glycisyltransferring synthase (TreT) produces trehalose from ADP-glucose and glucose. Fifth, trehalose phosphorylase (TreP) either hydrolyses trehalose into glucose-1-phosphate and glucose or may act reversibly in certain species. Vertebrates do not have the ability to synthesize or store trehalose. Trehalase in humans is found only in specific location such as the intestinal mucosa, renal brush-border, liver and blood. Expression of this enzyme in vertebrates is initially found during the gestation period that is the highest after weaning. Then, the level of trehalase remained constant in the intestine throughout life. Meanwhile, diets consisting of plants and fungi contain trehalose. Moderate amount of trehalose in diet is essential and having low amount of trehalose could result in diarrhea, or other intestinal symptoms. == Medical use == Trehalose is an ingredient, along with hyaluronic acid, in an artificial tears product used to treat dry eye. Outbreaks of Clostridioides difficile were initially associated with trehalose, but this finding was disputed in 2019. In 2021, the FDA accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and granted fast track status for an injectable form of trehalose (SLS-005) as a potential treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). == History == In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an ergot of rye, and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from Trehala manna, a substance made by weevils and named it trehalose. Trehalose has long been known as an autophagy inducer that acts independently of mTOR. In 2017, research was published showing that trehalose induces autophagy by activating TFEB, a protein that acts as a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. == See also == Biostasis Cryoprotectant Cryptobiosis Freeze drying Lentztrehalose Trehalosamine IMCTA-C14 == References == == External links == Media related to Trehalose at Wikimedia Commons Trehalose in sperm preservation",Trehalose,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.16039644181728363), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.26801180839538574), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -3.4121114822482923e-06), (' MED', -0.002244227332994342), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.1041613295674324), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0001245659514097497), ('ĠMED', -0.7210838794708252), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.03804726526141167), ('ĠPERSON', -0.1725626438856125), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -5.9126061387360096e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31327348947525024)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trehalose?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=109, start_index=30, title='Trehalose', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trehalose?utm_source=openai')])"
1741,"('Tubercidin', 'Sparsomycin a', 'Tubercidine', 'Sparsamycin a', 'Antibiotic xk 101-1')",Medical," Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an RNA virus with constantly emerging recombinant and mutant strains. Because of the high genetic diversity of PRRSV, current vaccines only provide partial protection against the infection of heterologous strains, which makes it a challenge for PRRSV prevention and control. Tubercidin is a naturally extracted compound with potential antiviral properties. However, whether tubercidin has anti-PRRSV ability is unknown. Our study found that tubercidin showed effective antiviral effects on PRRSV replication. In terms of mechanism, tubercidin suppressed PRRSV at the entry, replication, and release steps of the viral life cycle. Additionally, we demonstrated that tubercidin treatment promoted the activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene I and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell signaling pathway, thus increasing the type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine expression. Furthermore, tubercidin restrained the viral non-structural protein 2 expression and viral dsRNA synthesis and ultimately inhibited PRRSV replication. Hence, our data showed that tubercidin is promising and has potential antiviral ability against PRRSV replication  Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most important swine diseases, which causes huge economic loss worldwide. However, there is no effective therapeutic method for PRRS prevention and control. Here, we found that tubercidin, a naturally extracted adenosine analog, exhibited strong anti-porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) activity. Mechanically, tubercidin inhibited viral binding, replication, and release. Tubercidin suppressed PRRSV non-structural protein 2 expression, which is important for the formation of replication and transcription complex, leading to the block of viral RNA synthesis and PRRSV replication.

Starting with the observation of BRD4 activity of compounds from a previous program, the compounds were optimized for BRD4 potency and physical properties. The optimized compound from this campaign exhibited excellent pharmacokinetic profile and exhibited high potency in vitro and in vivo effecting c-Myc downregulation and tumor growth inhibition in xenograft studies. This compound was selected as the development candidate, AZD5153. The series showed enhanced potency as a result of bivalent binding and a clear correlation between BRD4 activity and cellular potency. 7-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-6-(2-ethyl-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine (TPA023) is a triazolopyridazine that binds with equivalent high (subnanomolar) affinity to the benzodiazepine binding site of recombinant human GABA(A) receptors containing an alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, or alpha5 subunit but has partial agonist efficacy at the alpha2 and alpha3 subtypes and essentially antagonist efficacy at the alpha1 and alpha5 subtypes. In rats, TPA023 gave time- and dose-dependent occupancy after oral dosing, with 50% occupancy corresponding to a dose of 0.42 mg/kg. It has anxiolytic-like activity in unconditioned (elevated plus maze) and conditioned (fear-potentiated startle and conditioned suppression of drinking) rat models of anxiety with minimum effective doses (MED; 1-3 mg/kg) corresponding to 70 to 88% occupancy. However, there was no appreciable sedation in a response sensitivity (chain-pulling) assay at a dose of 30 mg/kg, resulting in 99% occupancy. Similarly, TPA023 was robustly anxiolytic in the squirrel monkey conditioned emotional response assay, with a MED of 0.3 mg/kg, but did not produce any sedation in a lever-pressing test of sedation even at 10 mg/kg. TPA023 produced no impairment in performance in the mouse Rotarod assay, and there was only a mild interaction with ethanol. In addition to anxiolytic-like efficacy, TPA023 had anticonvulsant activity in a mouse pentylenetetrazole seizure model. Finally, TPA023 did not cause precipitated withdrawal in mice treated for 7 days with the nonselective agonist triazolam, nor did N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142) precipitate withdrawal in mice treated for 7 days with TPA023. In summary, the novel alpha2/alpha3-selective efficacy profile of TPA023 translates into a nonsedating anxiolytic profile that is distinct from nonselective agonists. The HGF/MET pathway is frequently activated in a variety of cancer types. Several selective small molecule inhibitors of the MET kinase are currently in clinical evaluation, in particular for NSCLC, liver, and gastric cancer patients. We report herein the discovery of a series of triazolopyridazines that are selective inhibitors of wild-type (WT) MET kinase and several clinically relevant mutants. We provide insight into their mode of binding and report unprecedented crystal structures of the Y1230H variant. A multiparametric chemical optimization approach allowed the identification of compound 12 (SAR125844) as a development candidate. In this chemical series, absence of CYP3A4 inhibition was obtained at the expense of satisfactory oral absorption. Compound 12, a promising parenteral agent for the treatment of MET-dependent cancers, promoted sustained target engagement at tolerated doses in a human xenograft tumor model. Preclinical pharmacokinetics conducted in several species were predictive for the observed pharmacokinetic behavior of 12 in cancer patients.","Triazolopyridazine, 4",PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0015030752401798964), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.011093487031757832), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12697477638721466)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -9.615255839889869e-05)])","('INFO; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/577392,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Triazolopyridazine_-18,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4-_Triazol-1-yl_pyridazine,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c01411,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36534051/,https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/aldrich/cds002398,https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/aldrich/syx00359,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8258836/,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm00081a014 ', [])"

1744,"('Ribitol', 'Adonitol', 'Adonite', 'Xylitol', 'Xylite')",Medical,"Xylitol is a chemical compound with the formula C5H12O5, or HO(CH2)(CHOH)3(CH2)OH; specifically, one particular stereoisomer with that structural formula. It is a colorless or white crystalline solid. It is classified as a polyalcohol and a sugar alcohol, specifically an alditol. Of the common sugar alcohols, only sorbitol is more soluble in water. The name derives from Ancient Greek: ξύλον, xyl[on] 'wood', with the suffix -itol used to denote it being a sugar alcohol. Xylitol is used as a food additive and sugar substitute. Its European Union code number is E967. Replacing sugar with xylitol in food products may promote better dental health, but evidence is lacking on whether xylitol itself prevents dental cavities. In the United States, xylitol is used as a common sugar substitute, and is considered to be safe for humans. Xylitol can be toxic to dogs. == History == Emil Fischer, a German chemist, and his assistant Rudolf Stahel isolated a new compound from beech wood chips in September 1890 and named it Xylit, after the Greek word for wood. The following year, the French chemist M. G. Bertrand isolated xylitol syrup by processing wheat and oat straw. Sugar rationing during World War II led to an interest in sugar substitutes. Interest in xylitol and other polyols became intense, leading to their characterization and manufacturing methods. == Structure, production, commerce == Xylitol is one of three 5-carbon sugar alcohols. The others are arabitol and ribitol. These three compounds differ in the stereochemistry of the three secondary alcohol groups. Xylitol occurs naturally in small amounts in plums, strawberries, cauliflower, and pumpkin; humans and many other animals make trace amounts during metabolism of carbohydrates. Unlike most sugar alcohols, xylitol is achiral. Most other isomers of pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol are chiral, but xylitol has a plane of symmetry. Industrial production starts with lignocellulosic biomass from which xylan is extracted; raw biomass materials include hardwoods, softwoods, and agricultural waste from processing maize, wheat, or rice. The mixture is hydrolyzed with acid to give xylose. The xylose is purified by chromatography. Purified xylose is catalytically hydrogenated into xylitol using a Raney nickel catalyst. The conversion changes the sugar (xylose, an aldehyde) into the primary alcohol, xylitol. Xylitol can also be obtained by industrial fermentation, but this methodology are not as economical as the acid hydrolysis/chromatography route described above. Fermentation is effected by bacteria, fungi, or yeast, especially Candida tropicalis. According to the US Department of Energy, xylitol production by fermentation from discarded biomass is one of the most valuable renewable chemicals for commerce, forecast to be a US $1.41 billion industry by 2025. == Uses == Xylitol is used as a sugar substitute in such manufactured products as drugs, dietary supplements, confections, toothpaste, and chewing gum, but is not a common household sweetener. Xylitol has negligible effects on blood sugar because its assimilation and metabolism are independent of insulin. It is approved as a food additive and sugar substitute in the United States. Xylitol is also found as an additive to saline solution for nasal irrigation and has been reported to be effective in improving symptoms of chronic sinusitis. Xylitol can also be incorporated into fabrics to produce a cooling fabric. When moisture, such as sweat, comes into contact with the xylitol embedded in the fabric, it produces a cooling sensation. == Food properties == === Nutrition, taste, and cooking === Humans absorb xylitol more slowly than sucrose, and xylitol supplies 40% fewer calories than an equal mass of sucrose. Xylitol has about the same sweetness as sucrose, but is sweeter than similar compounds like sorbitol and mannitol. Xylitol is stable enough to be used in baking, but because xylitol and other polyols are more heat-stable, they do not caramelise as sugars do. When used in foods, they lower the freezing point of the mixture. === Food risks === No serious health risk exists in most humans for normal levels of consumption. The European Food Safety Authority has not set a limit on daily intake of xylitol. Due to the adverse laxative effect that all polyols have on the digestive system in high doses, xylitol is banned from soft drinks in the European Union. Similarly, due to a 1985 report by the E.U. Scientific Committee on Food which states that ""ingesting 50 g a day of xylitol can cause diarrhea"", tabletop sweeteners (as well as other products containing xylitol) are required to display the warning ""Excessive consumption may induce laxative effects"". === Metabolism === Xylitol has 2.4 kilocalories of food energy per gram of xylitol (10 kilojoules per gram) according to U.S. and E.U. food-labeling regulations. The real value can vary, depending on metabolic factors. Primarily, the liver metabolizes absorbed xylitol. The main metabolic route in humans occurs in cytoplasm, via nonspecific NAD-dependent dehydrogenase (polyol dehydrogenase), which transforms xylitol to D-xylulose. Specific xylulokinase phosphorylates it to D-xylulose-5-phosphate. This then goes to pentose phosphate pathway for further processing. About 50% of eaten xylitol is absorbed via the intestines. Of the remaining 50% that is not absorbed by the intestines, in humans, 50–75% of the xylitol remaining in the gut is fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain organic acids and gases, which may produce flatulence. The remnant unabsorbed xylitol that escapes fermentation is excreted unchanged, mostly in feces; less than 2 g of xylitol out of every 100 g ingested is excreted via urine. Xylitol ingestion also increases motilin secretion, which may be related to xylitol's ability to cause diarrhea. The less-digestible but fermentable nature of xylitol also contributes to constipation relieving effects. == Health effects == === Dental care === A 2015 Cochrane review of ten studies between 1991 and 2014 suggested a positive effect in reducing tooth decay of xylitol-containing fluoride toothpastes when compared to fluoride-only toothpaste, but there was insufficient evidence to determine whether other xylitol-containing products can prevent tooth decay in infants, children or adults. Subsequent reviews support the belief that xylitol can suppress the growth of pathogenic Streptococcus in the mouth, thereby reducing dental caries and gingivitis, although there is concern that swallowed xylitol may cause intestinal dysbiosis. A 2022 review suggested that xylitol-containing chewing gum decreases plaque, but not xylitol-containing candy. === Earache === In 2011 EFSA ""concluded that there was not enough evidence to support"" the claim that xylitol-sweetened gum could prevent middle-ear infections, also known as acute otitis media (AOM). A 2016 review indicated that xylitol in chewing gum or a syrup may have a moderate effect in preventing AOM in healthy children. It may be an alternative to conventional therapies (such as antibiotics) to lower risk of earache in healthy children – reducing risk of occurrence by 25% – although there is no definitive proof that it could be used as a therapy for earache. === Diabetes === In 2011, EFSA approved a marketing claim that foods or beverages containing xylitol or similar sugar replacers cause lower blood glucose and lower insulin responses compared to sugar-containing foods or drinks. Xylitol products are used as sucrose substitutes for weight control, as xylitol has 40% fewer calories than sucrose (2.4 kcal/g compared to 4.0 kcal/g for sucrose). The glycemic index (GI) of xylitol is only 7% of the GI for glucose. == Adverse effects == === Humans === When ingested at high doses, xylitol and other polyols may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including flatulence, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome (see Metabolism above); some people experience the adverse effects at lower doses. Xylitol has a lower laxation threshold than some sugar alcohols but is more easily tolerated than mannitol and sorbitol. Increased xylitol consumption can increase oxalate, calcium, and phosphate excretion to urine (termed oxaluria, calciuria, and phosphaturia, respectively). These are known risk factors for kidney stone disease, but despite that, xylitol has not been linked to kidney disease in humans. A 2024 study suggests that xylitol is prothrombotic (increases clotting) and is associated with cardiovascular risk when consumed at ""typical dietary amounts"". === Dogs and other animals === Xylitol is poisonous to dogs. Ingesting 100 milligrams of xylitol per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg bw) causes dogs to experience a dose-dependent insulin release; depending on the dose it can result in life-threatening hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemic symptoms of xylitol toxicity may arise as quickly as 30 to 60 minutes after ingestion. Vomiting is a common first symptom, which can be followed by tiredness and ataxia. At doses above 500 mg/kg bw, liver failure is likely and may result in coagulopathies like disseminated intravascular coagulation. Xylitol is safe for rhesus macaques, horses, and rats. A 2018 study suggests that xylitol is safe for cats in doses of up to 1000 mg/kg; however, this study was performed on only 6 cats and should not be considered definitive. == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Xylitol at Wikimedia Commons",Xylite,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.003787250490859151), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.008617527782917023), (' PERSONAL', -0.046879641711711884), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.03806169703602791), (' INDUSTR', -0.007779825944453478), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.00154066551476717), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.008790958672761917), ('ĠMED', -0.6105251908302307), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -0.06197937950491905), ('ĠPERSON', -0.1104247123003006), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.0967194612021558e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.061998091638088226)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -7.896309739408025e-07)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([drugsace.com](https://drugsace.com/xylitol/?utm_source=openai), [sinobiochemistry.com](https://www.sinobiochemistry.com/Bulk-Price-Food-Ingredient-Additive-Sweetener-Xylitol-Powder-Xylite-Flavoring-Agents-pd516135258.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=264, start_index=21, title='Xylitol - Uses, Functions & other effects DrugsAce', type='url_citation', url='https://drugsace.com/xylitol/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=264, start_index=21, title='Bulk Price Food Ingredient Additive Sweetener Xylitol Powder Xylite Flavoring Agents - Buy Xylitol, Xylitol Price, Bulk Xylitol Product on Sinobio Chemistry', type='url_citation', url='https://www.sinobiochemistry.com/Bulk-Price-Food-Ingredient-Additive-Sweetener-Xylitol-Powder-Xylite-Flavoring-Agents-pd516135258.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1745,"('(r)-ibuprofen', 'Levibuprofen', 'Ibuprofen', '(r)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid', 'R-ibuprofen')",Medical,"Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation. This includes painful menstrual periods, migraines, and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in a premature baby. It can be taken orally (by mouth) or intravenously. It typically begins working within an hour. Common side effects include heartburn, nausea, indigestion, and abdominal pain. As with other NSAIDs, potential side effects include gastrointestinal bleeding. Long-term use has been associated with kidney failure, and rarely liver failure, and it can exacerbate the condition of patients with heart failure. At low doses, it does not appear to increase the risk of heart attack; however, at higher doses it may. Ibuprofen can also worsen asthma. While its safety in early pregnancy is unclear, it appears to be harmful in later pregnancy, so it is not recommended during that period. Like other NSAIDs, it works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins by decreasing the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Ibuprofen is a weaker anti-inflammatory agent than other NSAIDs. Ibuprofen was discovered in 1961 by Stewart Adams and John Nicholson while working at Boots UK Limited and initially marketed as Brufen. It is available under a number of brand names including Advil, Motrin, and Nurofen. Ibuprofen was first marketed in 1969 in the United Kingdom and in 1974 in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 33rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ibuprofen is used primarily to treat fever (including postvaccination fever), mild to moderate pain (including pain relief after surgery), painful menstruation, osteoarthritis, dental pain, headaches, and pain from kidney stones. About 60% of people respond to any NSAID; those who do not respond well to a particular one may respond to another. A Cochrane medical review of 51 trials of NSAIDs for the treatment of lower back pain found that ""NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute low back pain"". It is used for inflammatory diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used for pericarditis and patent ductus arteriosus. === Ibuprofen lysine === In some countries, ibuprofen lysine (the lysine salt of ibuprofen, sometimes called ""ibuprofen lysinate"") is licensed for treatment of the same conditions as ibuprofen; the lysine salt is used because it is more water-soluble. However, subsequent studies shown no statistical differences between the lysine salt and ibuprofen base. In 2006, ibuprofen lysine was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for closure of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1,500 g (1 and 3 lb), who are no more than 32 weeks gestational age when usual medical management (such as fluid restriction, diuretics, and respiratory support) is not effective. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects include nausea, heartburn, indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, gastrointestinal ulceration, headache, dizziness, rash, salt and fluid retention, and high blood pressure. Infrequent adverse effects include esophageal ulceration, heart failure, high blood levels of potassium, kidney impairment, confusion, and bronchospasm. Ibuprofen can exacerbate asthma, sometimes fatally. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Ibuprofen may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to demonstrate the presence of the drug in a person having experienced an anaphylactic reaction, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in people who are hospitalized, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. A monograph relating ibuprofen plasma concentration, time since ingestion, and risk of developing renal toxicity in people who have overdosed has been published. In October 2020, the U.S. FDA required the drug label to be updated for all NSAID medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. === Cardiovascular risk === Along with several other NSAIDs, chronic ibuprofen use is correlated with the risk of progression to hypertension in women, though less than for paracetamol (acetaminophen), and myocardial infarction (heart attack), particularly among those chronically using higher doses. On 9 July 2015, the U.S. FDA toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with ibuprofen and related NSAIDs; the NSAID aspirin is not included in this warning. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued similar warnings in 2015. === Skin === Along with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen has been associated with the onset of bullous pemphigoid or pemphigoid-like blistering. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen has been reported to be a photosensitizing agent, but it is considered a weak photosensitizing agent compared to other members of the 2-arylpropionic acid class. Like other NSAIDs, ibuprofen is an extremely rare cause of the autoimmune diseases Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis. === Interactions === ==== Alcohol ==== Drinking alcohol when taking ibuprofen may increase the risk of stomach bleeding. ==== Aspirin ==== According to the FDA, ""ibuprofen can interfere with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin, potentially rendering aspirin less effective when used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention"". Allowing sufficient time between doses of ibuprofen and immediate-release (IR) aspirin can avoid this problem. The recommended elapsed time between a dose of ibuprofen and a dose of aspirin depends on which is taken first. It would be 30 minutes or more for ibuprofen taken after IR aspirin, and 8 hours or more for ibuprofen taken before IR aspirin. However, this timing cannot be recommended for enteric-coated aspirin. If ibuprofen is taken only occasionally without the recommended timing, though, the reduction of the cardioprotection and stroke prevention of a daily aspirin regimen is minimal. ==== Paracetamol (acetaminophen) ==== Ibuprofen combined with paracetamol is considered generally safe in children for short-term usage. === Overdose === Ibuprofen overdose has become common since it was licensed for over-the-counter (OTC) use. Many overdose experiences are reported in the medical literature, although the frequency of life-threatening complications from ibuprofen overdose is low. Human responses in cases of overdose range from an absence of symptoms to a fatal outcome despite intensive-care treatment. Most symptoms are an excess of the pharmacological action of ibuprofen and include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, ear ringing, and nystagmus. Rarely, more severe symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeding, seizures, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, fast heart rate, atrial fibrillation, coma, liver dysfunction, acute kidney failure, cyanosis, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest have been reported. The severity of symptoms varies with the ingested dose and the time elapsed; however, individual sensitivity also plays an important role. Generally, the symptoms observed with an overdose of ibuprofen are similar to the symptoms caused by overdoses of other NSAIDs. The correlation between the severity of symptoms and measured ibuprofen plasma levels is weak. Toxic effects are unlikely at doses below 100 mg/kg, but can be severe above 400 mg/kg (around 150 tablets of 200 mg units for an average adult male); however, large doses do not indicate the clinical course is likely to be lethal. A precise lethal dose is difficult to determine, as it may vary with age, weight, and concomitant conditions of the person. Treatment to address an ibuprofen overdose is based on how the symptoms present. In cases presenting early, decontamination of the stomach is recommended. This is achieved using activated charcoal; charcoal absorbs the drug before it can enter the bloodstream. Gastric lavage is now rarely used, but can be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening, and it can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Purposeful vomiting is not recommended. Most ibuprofen ingestions produce only mild effects, and the management of overdose is straightforward. Standard measures to maintain normal urine output should be instituted and kidney function monitored. Since ibuprofen has acidic properties and is also excreted in the urine, forced alkaline diuresis is theoretically beneficial. However, because ibuprofen is highly protein-bound in the blood, the kidneys' excretion of the unchanged drug is minimal. Forced alkaline diuresis is, therefore, of limited benefit. === Miscarriage === A Canadian study of pregnant women suggests that those taking any type or amount of NSAIDs (including ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen) were 2.4 times more likely to miscarry than those not taking the medications. However, an Israeli study found no increased risk of miscarriage in the group of mothers using NSAIDs. == Pharmacology == Ibuprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). PGH2, in turn, is converted by other enzymes into various prostaglandins (which mediate pain, inflammation, and fever) and thromboxane A2 (which stimulates platelet aggregation and promotes blood clot formation). Like aspirin and indomethacin, ibuprofen is a nonselective COX inhibitor, in that it inhibits two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2. The analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs appears to operate mainly through inhibition of COX-2, which decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Inhibition of COX-1 instead would be responsible for unwanted effects on the gastrointestinal tract. However, the role of the individual COX isoforms in the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and gastric damage effects of NSAIDs is uncertain, and different compounds cause different degrees of analgesia and gastric damage. Ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. The R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer in vivo. The S-enantiomer is believed to be the more pharmacologically active enantiomer. The R-enantiomer is converted through a series of three main enzymes. These enzymes include acyl-CoA-synthetase, which converts the R-enantiomer to (−)-R-ibuprofen I-CoA; 2-arylpropionyl-CoA epimerase, which converts (−)-R-ibuprofen I-CoA to (+)-S-ibuprofen I-CoA; and hydrolase, which converts (+)-S-ibuprofen I-CoA to the S-enantiomer. In addition to the conversion of ibuprofen to the S-enantiomer, the body can metabolize ibuprofen to several other compounds, including numerous hydroxyl, carboxyl and glucuronyl metabolites. Virtually all of these have no pharmacological effects. Unlike most other NSAIDs, ibuprofen also acts as an inhibitor of Rho kinase and may be useful in recovery from spinal cord injury. Another unusual activity is inhibition of the sweet taste receptor. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral administration, peak serum concentration is reached after 1–2 hours, and up to 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. The majority of ibuprofen is metabolized and eliminated within 24 hours in the urine; however, 1% of the unchanged drug is removed through biliary excretion. === Metabolism === Ibuprofen mainly undergoes hepatic metabolism. The following table shows potential pathways of ibuprofen metabolism. Both hydroxymetabolites and carboxyl-ibuprofen are inactive. == Chemistry == Ibuprofen is practically insoluble in water, but very soluble in most organic solvents like ethanol (66.18 g/100 mL at 40 °C for 90% EtOH), methanol, acetone and dichloromethane. The original synthesis of ibuprofen by the Boots Group started with the compound isobutylbenzene. The synthesis took six steps. Firstly, isobutylbenzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation with acetic anhydride, yielding p-isobuthylphenyl methyl ketone. Then, through Darzens reaction with ethyl chloroacetate, a α,β-epoxyester is obtained. Then, in acidic environment, it undergoes decarboxylation and hydrolysis, yielding an aldehyde bearing one more carbon atom than the initial ketone. Then, it goes through a reaction with hydroxylamine, yielding a corresponding oxime. Later, it is converted into a nitrile and hydrolyzed into ibuprofen. A modern, greener technique with fewer waste byproducts (23% of total product mass vs. 60% theoretical value) for the synthesis involves only three steps and was developed in the 1980s by the Celanese Chemical Company. The synthesis is initiated with the acylation of isobutylbenzene using the recyclable Lewis acid catalyst hydrogen fluoride. The following catalytic hydrogenation of isobutylacetophenone is performed with either Raney nickel or palladium on carbon to lead into the key-step, the carbonylation of 1-(4-isobutylphenyl)ethanol. This is achieved by a PdCl2(PPh3)2 catalyst, at around 50 bar of CO pressure, in the presence of HCl (10%). The reaction presumably proceeds through the intermediacy of the styrene derivative (acidic elimination of the alcohol) and (1-chloroethyl)benzene derivative (Markovnikow addition of HCl to the double bond). === Stereochemistry === Ibuprofen, like other 2-arylpropionate derivatives such as ketoprofen, flurbiprofen and naproxen, contains a stereocenter in the α-position of the propionate moiety. The product sold in pharmacies is a racemic mixture of the S and R-isomers. The S (dextrorotatory) isomer is the more biologically active; this isomer has been isolated and used medically (see dexibuprofen for details). The isomerase enzyme, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, converts (R)-ibuprofen into the (S)-enantiomer. (S)-ibuprofen, the eutomer, harbors the desired therapeutic activity. The inactive (R)-enantiomer, the distomer, undergoes a unidirectional chiral inversion to offer the active (S)-enantiomer. That is, when the ibuprofen is administered as a racemate the distomer is converted in vivo into the eutomer while the latter is unaffected. == History == Ibuprofen was derived from propionic acid by the research arm of Boots Group during the 1960s. The name is derived from the 3 functional groups: isobutyl (ibu) propionic acid (pro) phenyl (fen). Its discovery was the result of research during the 1950s and 1960s to find a safer alternative to aspirin. The molecule was discovered and synthesized by a team led by Stewart Adams, with a patent application filed in 1961. Adams initially tested the drug as treatment for his hangover. In 1985, Boots's worldwide patent for ibuprofen expired and generic products were launched. The medication was launched as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the United Kingdom in 1969, and in the United States in 1974. Later, in 1983 and 1984, it became the first NSAID (other than aspirin) to be available over-the-counter (OTC) in these two countries. Boots was awarded the Queen's Award for Technical Achievement in 1985 for the development of the drug. In November 2013, work on ibuprofen was recognized by the erection of a Royal Society of Chemistry blue plaque at Boots' Beeston Factory site in Nottingham, which reads: In recognition of the work during the 1980s by The Boots Company PLC on the development of ibuprofen which resulted in its move from prescription-only status to over-the-counter sale, therefore expanding its use to millions of people worldwide and another at BioCity Nottingham, the site of the original laboratory, which reads: In recognition of the pioneering research work, here on Pennyfoot Street, by Dr Stewart Adams and Dr John Nicholson in the Research Department of Boots which led to the discovery of ibuprofen used by millions worldwide for the relief of pain. == Availability and administration == Ibuprofen was made available by prescription in the United Kingdom in 1969 and in the United States in 1974. Ibuprofen is the International nonproprietary name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), Australian Approved Name (AAN) and United States Adopted Name (USAN). In the United States, it has been sold under the brand-names Motrin and Advil since 1974 and 1984, respectively. Ibuprofen is commonly available in the United States up to the FDA's 1984 dose limit OTC, rarely used higher by prescription. In 2009, the first injectable formulation of ibuprofen was approved in the United States, under the brand name Caldolor. Ibuprofen can be taken orally (by mouth) (as a tablet, a capsule, or a suspension) and intravenously. == Research == Ibuprofen is sometimes used for the treatment of acne because of its anti-inflammatory properties, and has been sold in Japan in topical form for adult acne. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen may be useful in the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when standing up). NSAIDs are of unclear utility in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Ibuprofen has been associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease and may delay or prevent it. Aspirin, other NSAIDs, and paracetamol (acetaminophen) had no effect on the risk for Parkinson's. In March 2011, researchers at Harvard Medical School announced in Neurology that ibuprofen had a neuroprotective effect against the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. People regularly consuming ibuprofen were reported to have a 38% lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease, but no such effect was found for other pain relievers, such as aspirin and paracetamol. Use of ibuprofen to lower the risk of Parkinson's disease in the general population would not be problem-free, given the possibility of adverse effects on the urinary and digestive systems. Some dietary supplements might be dangerous to take along with ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, but as of 2016, more research needs to be conducted to be certain. These supplements include those that can prevent platelet aggregation, including ginkgo, garlic, ginger, bilberry, dong quai, feverfew, ginseng, turmeric, meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), and willow (Salix spp.); those that contain coumarin, including chamomile, horse chestnut, fenugreek and red clover; and those that increase the risk of bleeding, like tamarind. == References == == External links == GB patent 971700, Stewart Sanders Adams & John Stuart Nicholson, ""Anti-Inflammatory Agents"", published 1964-09-30, assigned to Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd ""Evidence for the efficacy of pain medications"" (PDF).

1746,"('(s)-ibuprofen', '(s)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid', 'Sibuprofen', '(s)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid', 'Ibuproten')",Medical," Ibuprofen liquid comes in two pediatric concentrations: 200 mg/5 mL for infants and 100 mg/5 mL for children. This study aimed to investigate the misdosing of ibuprofen liquid products by comparing administration accuracy with differing pediatric concentrations and dosages. Subject selection included 116 volunteers. Participants were provided with the children's ibuprofen package including the dosing cup, the infants' ibuprofen package including the infant dosing dropper, and a 5 mL syringe. Each subject drew up a specified dose of infants' ibuprofen and children's ibuprofen and deposited each sample into a graduated cylinder. The dose (70 or 100 mg) and order of concentration usage (infants' first or children's first) were randomized. A total of 116 subjects, with a mean age of 32 ± 14 years, participated in the study. Mean absolute dosing errors for all trials, including those who made no errors, were significantly higher for infants' ibuprofen compared to children's ibuprofen: 39 vs. 27 mg (p = 0.036). A total of 31% of all ibuprofen dosage experiments (71 of 232 trials) had greater than 50% error of the assigned dose. Dosage errors using infants' ibuprofen were significantly higher than the children's ibuprofen. This suggests that removing the infant form from consumer availability may help reduce dosing errors when administering ibuprofen to pediatric patients. Pediatric misdosing is a significant problem with over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen. A previous study found that 51% of patients under the age of 10 were inaccurately dosed with antipyretic medication, including ibuprofen, with an increased incidence in infants. We found significantly more dosing errors with the infant concentration (200 mg/5 mL) as opposed to the children's concentration (100 mg/5 mL), 39 vs. 27 mg, respectively (p = 0.036). We believe that this research is beneficial to pediatric patient caregivers, clinicians, and policymakers to identify the problem of inaccurate ibuprofen dosing and to propose a way to mitigate this by having one concentration easily accessible. Racemic ibuprofen, which contains equal quantities of R(-)-ibuprofen and S(+)-ibuprofen, has been used as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent for over 30 years. Although the S(+)-enantiomer is capable of inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) at clinically relevant concentrations, R(-)-ibuprofen is not a COX inhibitor. The two enantiomers of ibuprofen are therefore different in terms of their pharmacological properties and may be regarded as two different 'drugs'. They also differ in terms of their metabolic profiles. For example, R(-)-ibuprofen becomes involved in pathways of lipid metabolism and is incorporated into triglycerides along with endogenous fatty acids. S(+)-Ibuprofen does not appear to become involved in these unusual metabolic reactions, which is why S(+)-ibuprofen is regarded as being metabolically 'cleaner' than racemic ibuprofen. When racemic ibuprofen is given to humans, a substantial fraction of the dose of R(-)-ibuprofen (50%-60%) undergoes 'metabolic inversion' to yield S(+)-ibuprofen. On this basis, it has been argued that to obtain clinical effects that are comparable to those of a given dose of racemic ibuprofen, the dose of S(+)-ibuprofen would need to be about 75% of the dose of the racemate. However, this 'pharmacokinetic' rationale does not take into account the fact that inversion is not instantaneous, that there is variability in the extent of inversion between individuals, and that the kinetics of inversion may differ depending on the dosing situations. For example, the extent of inversion appears to be reduced when the racemate is given to patients experiencing acute pain. Recent studies have demonstrated that the clinical benefits of racemic ibuprofen can be derived from the administration of the single S(+)-enantiomer at a dose that is half that of the racemate. For example, 200 mg of S(+)-ibuprofen has been found to be superior or at least equivalent to 400 mg of the racemate in the relief of dental pain. Possible explanations for this higher than expected efficacy of S(+)-ibuprofen are considered. The enantioselective esterification of ibuprofen catalyzed by Novozym40086 was successfully conducted in organic solvent. Removing-water reagent was added into the reaction mixture to remove water produced in the esterification. The effects of temperature, n-hexanol concentration, ibuprofen concentration, and loading of enzymes were investigated. Under the condition of equilibrium, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant (K) of 7.697 and enantioselectivity (E) of 8.512 were obtained. The esterification reaction achieved its equilibrium in approximately 30 hours with conversion of 56% and ee",(s)-ibuprofen,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.319370302458992e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006759266252629459), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31330183148384094)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Ibuprofen', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen?utm_source=openai')])"

1748,"('Rebaudioside a', 'Stevioside a3', 'Rebaudioside-a', 'Truvia', 'Sweetener 4g-s')","Food, Medical","Truvia (also shown as truvía) is a brand of stevia-based sugar substitute developed jointly by The Coca-Cola Company and Cargill. It is distributed and marketed by Cargill as a tabletop sweetener as well as a food ingredient. Truvia is made of stevia leaf extract, erythritol, and natural flavors. Because it comes from the stevia plant, Cargill classifies Truvia as a natural sweetener in addition to being a non-nutritive sweetener, although Cargill has settled lawsuits alleging deceptive marketing of Truvia as ""natural"". Since its launch in 2008, Truvia natural sweetener has become the second best-selling sugar substitute in units in the U.S. behind Splenda, surpassing Equal and Sweet'n Low. Truvia competes with Stevia In The Raw, the #2 brand of stevia, owned by Cumberland Packaging who also makes Sweet 'n Low. == Tabletop sweetener == Truvia tabletop sweetener is marketed to consumers as a packet sweetener for food and beverages. This makes it a direct competitor to existing packet sweeteners Splenda (sucralose), Equal (aspartame), Sweet'n Low (saccharin), and table sugar. It is available in the United States in 40-ct, 80-ct, 140-ct, and 240-ct single-serve packages. It is also available in the U.S. in a 9.8 oz ""spoonable"" container that is the equivalent of an 80-ct box. One packet of Truvia natural sweetener provides the same sweetness as two teaspoons of sugar. Truvia also makes a 75% reduced calorie sugar blend with stevia sweetener in both Cane Sugar and Brown Sugar varieties. == Ingredients == Truvia ingredients include erythritol (a sugar alcohol), stevia leaf extract, and natural flavorings. == Food ingredient == In addition to the Truvia tabletop sweetener, Truvia is used as a food ingredient. The Truvia web site lists products that use Truvia as a sweetener, including flavors of vitamin water, Sprite Green, All Sport Naturally Zero, Blue Sky Free, Crystal Light Pure, and some varieties of Odwalla juices. Cargill also sells a Truvia Cane Sugar Blend product that is a suitable sugar substitute for baking. == Safety and health effects == === Gastrointestinal side effects === Most of Truvia's side effects are related to erythritol which is a sugar alcohol. Sugar alcohols are valuable as sweeteners since they cause little to no rise in blood glucose levels as sugar does. However, the downside to most sugar alcohols is their propensity to cause gastrointestinal side effects. Erythritol is unique in that among these compounds it has one of the most favorable nutritional profiles. Erythritol is almost as sweet as sucrose, is virtually non-caloric, and cannot be fermented by gut bacteria present in the small intestine. According to Truvia's website, up to 90% of erythritol is absorbed by the small intestine and excreted unchanged in the urine. Only a small amount of it will reach the large intestine where GI symptoms, like bloating, flatulence, and cramping usually originate. Truvia's website claims: Studies with erythritol show almost no side effects reported unless very high doses are consumed at a single sitting in liquid form on an empty stomach(Bornet FR 1996). It took at least 4 times the amount of erythritol to generate looser stools, compared with the level of sorbitol, a very commonly used and well tolerated sugar alcohol (Oku T 1996). One study gave the test subjects 1 gram per kilogram (1 kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds) for five days (Tetzloff W 1996). So a 220 pound person would be taking 100 grams of erythritol every day, or 33 packets of Truvia® natural sweetener. These doses are far beyond the expected daily use and were delivered in a way that is very unlike our normal eating pattern. However...a few study subjects reported cramping, noisy stomach churning or, more commonly, loose stool after consuming it. This pattern has been seen with many types of sugars and carbohydrates. There are just some people who may have a limit to how much they can consume without having mild, brief symptoms. == Controversy == Cargill, the manufacturer of Truvia, has had litigation brought against it in two separate class-action lawsuits in 2013. The suits claimed that Cargill was deceptive in its marketing of Truvia as a ""natural"" sweetener, with the suit stating that stevia leaf extract and erythritol are ""highly processed"". While the FDA has been generally ambiguous about its opinion of the use of ""natural"" as a qualifier for food, Cargill decided to settle out of court. In 2014, Cargill settled a class-action lawsuit grounded in false and misleading advertising for $6.1 million. == Availability == On July 4, 2011, the EU's Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health recommended the approval of high purity stevia extracts for use as a food ingredient throughout the EU. == References == == External links == Official website for Truvia Cargill's website for Truvia health and safety information",Truvia,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -1.981667537620524e-06), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.000259723310591653), ('OD', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1002601757645607)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truvia?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=6, title='Truvia', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truvia?utm_source=openai')])"

It is generally less preferred than statins. Use is recommended together with dietary changes and exercise. It is unclear if it changes the risk of heart disease. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, and intestinal upset. Serious side effects may include angioedema, gallstones, liver problems, and muscle breakdown. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It belongs to the fibrates group of medications and works by decreasing the breakdown of lipids in fat cells. Gemfibrozil was patented in 1968, and came into medical use in 1982. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 231st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Hyperlipidemia (Type III) Hypertriglyceridemia (Type IV): Gemfibrozil, though not as effective as niacin (nicotinic acid, a form of Vitamin B3), is better tolerated. Reduce triglyceride levels Reduce very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels Modest reduction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels Moderate increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels == Side effects == GI distress Musculoskeletal pain Increased incidence of gallstone Hypokalemia (low blood potassium) Increased risk of cancer == Contraindications == Gemfibrozil should not be given to these patients: Hepatic dysfunction Gemfibrozil should be used with caution in these higher risk categories: Biliary tract disease Renal dysfunction Pregnant women Obese patients == Drug interactions == Anticoagulants: Gemfibrozil potentiates the action of warfarin and indanedione anticoagulants. Statin drugs: Concomitant administration of fibrates (including gemfibrozil) with statin drugs increases the risk of muscle cramping, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis. Gemfibrozil inhibits the activation of the liver's Cytochrome P450 system and CYP2C8, reducing hepatic metabolism of many drugs, and prolonging their half lives and duration of action. Drugs metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system include: Many antidepressants Many antipsychotics Many antiepileptics Theophylline and other methylxanthine drugs Several anesthetic agents Oral contraceptive pills Statins Warfarin Selexipag == Mechanism of actions == The exact mechanism of action of gemfibrozil is unknown; however, several theories exist regarding the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) effect; it can inhibit lipolysis and decrease subsequent hepatic fatty acid uptake as well as inhibit hepatic secretion of VLDL; together these actions decrease serum VLDL levels and increase HDL-cholesterol; the mechanism behind HDL elevation is currently unknown. Gemfibrozil increases the activity of extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase (LL), thereby increasing lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis. It does so by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) 'transcription factor ligand', a receptor that is involved in metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, as well as adipose tissue differentiation. This increase in the synthesis of lipoprotein lipase thereby increases the clearance of triglycerides. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. Gemfibrozil also inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of apolipoprotein B, a carrier molecule for VLDL. == History == Gemfibrozil was selected from a series of related compounds synthesized in the laboratories of the American company Parke-Davis in the late 1970s. It came from research for compounds that lower plasma lipid levels in humans and in animals. == Environmental data == Gemfibrozil has been detected in biosolids (the solids remaining after sewage treatment) at concentrations up to 2650 ng/g wet weight. This indicates that it survives the wastewater treatment process. It is also detected as environmental persistent micropollutant in aquifers and in groundwaters in karstic areas. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Lopid International Study"" (PDF).

It is related to the β- (beta) and γ- (gamma) cyclodextrins, which contain seven and eight glucose units, respectively. All cyclodextrins are white, water-soluble solids with minimal toxicity. Cyclodextrins tend to bind other molecules in their quasi-cylindrical, lipophilic interiors. The compound is of wide interest because it exhibits host–guest properties, forming inclusion compounds. This inclusion (and release) behavior leads to applications in medicine. == Structure == In α-cyclodextrin, the six glucose subunits are linked end to end via α-1, 4 linkages. The result has the shape of a tapered cylinder, with six primary alcohols on one face and twelve secondary alcohol groups on the other. The exterior surface of cyclodextrins is somewhat hydrophilic whereas the interior core is hydrophobic. == Applications == α-Cyclodextrin is marketed for a range of medical, healthcare, and food and beverage applications. For drug delivery, this cyclodextrin confers aqueous solubility to hydrophobic drugs and stability to labile drugs. == Synthesis == Cyclodextrins are natural starch-conversion products. For industrial use, they are manufactured by enzymatic degradation from vegetable raw materials, such as corn or potatoes. First, the starch is liquified either by heat treatment or using α-amylase.

Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor. It was developed and marketed by Incyte Corp in the US under the brand name Jakafi, and by Novartis elsewhere in the world, under the brand name Jakavi. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 2011, and in the European Union in 2012. Ruxolitinib is the first FDA-approved pharmacologic treatment to address repigmentation in vitiligo patients. The crystal structure of ruxolitinib and of its dihydrate form are known. == Medical uses == In the United States and the European Union, ruxolitinib is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adults with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post-polycythaemia-vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. It is also indicated for the treatment of adults with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. Ruxolitinib is also indicated for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in people who are twelve years of age and older, and for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in people twelve years of age and older. It is commonly given as an oral tablet. In the United States, ruxolitinib cream is indicated for the topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. In the European Union, ruxolitinib cream is indicated for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. == Side effects == In myelofibrosis, the most common side effects include thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils), urinary tract infections (infection of the kidney, renal pelvis, ureter, bladder or urethra), bleeding, bruising, weight gain, hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol levels), dizziness, headache and raised liver enzyme levels. In polycythaemia vera, the most common side effects include anemia (low red blood cell counts) and thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), bleeding, bruising, hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol levels), hypertriglyceridemia (high blood fat levels), dizziness, raised liver enzyme levels and high blood pressure. In acute graft-versus-host disease, the most common hematologic adverse reactions include anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. The most common nonhematologic adverse reactions include infections and edema. Immunologic side effects have included herpes zoster (shingles) and case reports of opportunistic infections. Metabolic side effects have included weight gain. Laboratory abnormalities have included alanine transaminase (ALT) abnormalities, aspartate transaminase (AST) abnormalities, and mildly elevated cholesterol levels. == Mechanism of action == Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor) with selectivity for subtypes JAK1 and JAK2. Ruxolitinib inhibits dysregulated JAK signaling associated with myelofibrosis. JAK1 and JAK2 recruit signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) to cytokine receptors leading to modulation of gene expression. == History == In March 2012, the phase III Controlled Myelofibrosis Study with Oral JAK Inhibitor-I (COMFORT-I) and COMFORT-II trials showed significant benefits by reducing spleen size and relieving debilitating symptoms. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In November 2011, ruxolitinib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis based on results of the COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II Trials. In 2014, it was approved in polycythemia vera when there has been an inadequate response to or intolerance of hydroxyurea, based on the RESPONSE trial. In May 2019, the indication for ruxolitinib was expanded in the US to include steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. The indication was further expanded in the US in September 2021, for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in people 12 years of age and older. In September 2021, ruxolitinib cream (sold under the brand name Opzelura) was approved for medical use in the United States for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). It is the first topical Janus kinase inhibitor approved in the United States. In July 2022, ruxolitinib cream (sold under the brand name Opzelura) was approved for medical use in the United States for the treatment of vitiligo. On 23 February 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Opzelura, intended for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo. The applicant for this medicinal product is Incyte Biosciences Distribution B.V. == Research == It is being investigated for plaque psoriasis, alopecia areata, relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. In February 2016, a phase III trial for pancreatic cancer was terminated due to insufficient efficacy. Eight weeks-treatment with ruxolitinib blunted senescent cell-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis and increased insulin sensitivity in 22-month-old mice.

1755,"('Hemin', 'Hemin chloride')",Medical,"Hemin (haemin; ferric chloride heme) is an iron-containing porphyrin with chlorine that can be formed from a heme group, such as heme B found in the hemoglobin of human blood. == Chemistry == Hemin is protoporphyrin IX containing a ferric iron (Fe3+) ion with a coordinating chloride ligand. Chemically, hemin differs from the related heme-compound hematin chiefly in that the coordinating ion is a chloride ion in hemin, whereas the coordinating ion is a hydroxide ion in hematin. The iron ion in haem is ferrous (Fe2+), whereas it is ferric (Fe3+) in both hemin and hematin. Hemin is endogenously produced in the human body, for example during the turnover of old red blood cells. It can form inappropriately as a result of hemolysis or vascular injury. Several proteins in human blood bind to hemin, such as hemopexin and serum albumin. == Pharmacological use == A lyophilised form of hemin is used as a pharmacological agent in certain cases for the treatment of porphyria attacks, particularly in acute intermittent porphyria. Administration of hemin can reduce heme deficits in such patients, thereby suppressing the activity of delta-amino-levulinic acid synthase (a key enzyme in the synthesis of the porphyrins) by biochemical feedback, which in turn reduces the production of porphyrins and of the toxic precursors of heme. In such pharmacological contexts, hemin is typically formulated with human albumin prior to administration by a medical professional, to reduce the risk of phlebitis and to stabilize the compound, which is potentially reactive if allowed to circulate in free-form. Such pharmacological forms of hemin are sold under a range of trade names including the trademarks Panhematin and Normosang. == History of isolation == Hemin was first crystallized out of blood in 1853, by Ludwik Karol Teichmann. Teichmann discovered that blood pigments can form microscopic crystals. Thus, crystals of hemin are occasionally referred to as 'Teichmann crystals'. Hans Fischer synthesized hemin, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1930. Fischer's procedure involves treating defibrinated blood with a solution of sodium chloride in acetic acid. == Forensics == Hemin can be produced from hemoglobin by the so-called Teichmann test, when hemoglobin is heated with glacial acetic acid (saturated with saline). This can be used to detect blood traces. == Other == Hemin is considered the ""X factor"" required for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae. == References == == External links == Hemin at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Hemin,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.6931948065757751), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0005538671393878758), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -1.2352385965641588e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.5390327572822571), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -1.9550132492440753e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.00019500737835187465), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024917051196098328)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0011711753904819489), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -5.512236498361744e-07), (' END', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS; https://www.drugs.com/mtm/hemin.html,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/hemin-intravenous-route/description/drg-20406498,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemin ', [])"

1757,"('Glyoxylic acid', 'Glyoxalic acid', 'Oxoacetic acid', 'Oxoethanoic acid', 'Formylformic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Glyoxylic acid or oxoacetic acid is an organic compound. Together with acetic acid, glycolic acid, and oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid is one of the C2 carboxylic acids. It is a colourless solid that occurs naturally and is useful industrially. == Structure and nomenclature == The structure of glyoxylic acid is shown as having an aldehyde functional group. The aldehyde is only a minor component of the form most prevalent in some situations. Instead, glyoxylic acid often exists as a hydrate or a cyclic dimer. For example, in the presence of water, the carbonyl rapidly converts to a geminal diol (described as the ""monohydrate""). The equilibrium constant (K) is 300 for the formation of dihydroxyacetic acid at room temperature: Dihydroxyacetic acid has been characterized by X-ray crystallography. In aqueous solution, this monohydrate exists in equilibrium with a hemiacylal dimer form: In isolation, the aldehyde structure has as a major conformer a cyclic hydrogen-bonded structure with the aldehyde carbonyl in close proximity to the carboxyl hydrogen: The Henry's law constant of glyoxylic acid is KH = 1.09 × 104 × exp[(40.0 × 103/R) × (1/T − 1/298)]. == Preparations == The conjugate base of glyoxylic acid is known as glyoxylate and is the form that the compound exists in solution at neutral pH. Glyoxylate is the byproduct of the amidation process in biosynthesis of several amidated peptides. For the historical record, glyoxylic acid was prepared from oxalic acid electrosynthetically: in organic synthesis, lead cathodes were applied for preparing glyoxylic acid from oxalic acid in a sulfuric acid electrolyte. Hot nitric acid can oxidize glyoxal to glyoxylic acid, however this reaction is highly exothermic and prone to thermal runaway. In addition, oxalic acid is the main side product. Also, ozonolysis of maleic acid is effective. == Biological role == Glyoxylate is an intermediate of the glyoxylate cycle, which enables organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and plants to convert fatty acids into carbohydrates. The glyoxylate cycle is also important for induction of plant defense mechanisms in response to fungi. The glyoxylate cycle is initiated through the activity of isocitrate lyase, which converts isocitrate into glyoxylate and succinate. Research is being done to co-opt the pathway for a variety of uses such as the biosynthesis of succinate. === In humans === Glyoxylate is produced via two pathways: through the oxidation of glycolate in peroxisomes or through the catabolism of hydroxyproline in mitochondria. In the peroxisomes, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by AGT1 or into oxalate by glycolate oxidase. In the mitochondria, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by AGT2 or into glycolate by glyoxylate reductase. A small amount of glyoxylate is converted into oxalate by cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase. === In plants === In addition to being an intermediate in the glyoxylate cycle, glyoxylate is also an important intermediate in the photorespiration pathway. Photorespiration is a result of the side reaction of RuBisCO with O2 instead of CO2. While at first considered a waste of energy and resources, photorespiration has been shown to be an important method of regenerating carbon and CO2, removing toxic phosphoglycolate, and initiating defense mechanisms. In photorespiration, glyoxylate is converted from glycolate through the activity of glycolate oxidase in the peroxisome. It is then converted into glycine through parallel actions by SGAT and GGAT, which is then transported into the mitochondria. It has also been reported that the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex may play a role in glycolate and glyoxylate metabolism. == Disease relevance == === Diabetes === Glyoxylate is thought to be a potential early marker for Type II diabetes. One of the key conditions of diabetes pathology is the production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) caused by the hyperglycemia. AGEs can lead to further complications of diabetes, such as tissue damage and cardiovascular disease. They are generally formed from reactive aldehydes, such as those present on reducing sugars and alpha-oxoaldehydes. In a study, glyoxylate levels were found to be significantly increased in patients who were later diagnosed with Type II diabetes. The elevated levels were found sometimes up to three years before the diagnosis, demonstrating the potential role for glyoxylate to be an early predictive marker. === Nephrolithiasis === Glyoxylate is involved in the development of hyperoxaluria, a key cause of nephrolithiasis (commonly known as kidney stones). Glyoxylate is both a substrate and inductor of sulfate anion transporter-1 (sat-1), a gene responsible for oxalate transportation, allowing it to increase sat-1 mRNA expression and as a result oxalate efflux from the cell. The increased oxalate release allows the buildup of calcium oxalate in the urine, and thus the eventual formation of kidney stones. The disruption of glyoxylate metabolism provides an additional mechanism of hyperoxaluria development. Loss of function mutations in the HOGA1 gene leads to a loss of the 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase, an enzyme in the hydroxyproline to glyoxylate pathway. The glyoxylate resulting from this pathway is normally stored away to prevent oxidation to oxalate in the cytosol. The disrupted pathway, however, causes a buildup of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate which can also be transported to the cytosol and converted into glyoxylate through a different aldolase. These glyoxylate molecules can be oxidized into oxalate increasing its concentration and causing hyperoxaluria. == Reactions and uses == Glyoxylic acid is about ten times stronger an acid than acetic acid, with an acid dissociation constant of 4.7 × 10−4 (pKa = 3.32): OCHCO2H ⇌ OCHCO−2 + H+ Heated glyoxylic acid disproportionates in a Cannizzaro reaction, forming hydroxyacetic acid and oxalic acid: 2 OCHCO2H + H2O → HOCH2CO2H + HO2CCO2H Glyoxylic acid gives heterocycles upon condensation with urea and 1,2-diaminobenzene. Gloxylate esters polymerize in base, forming a poly-methyleneoxy backbone with pendant ester groups. === Phenol derivatives === In general, glyoxylic acid undergoes an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction with phenols, a versatile step in the synthesis of several other compounds. The immediate product with phenol itself is 4-hydroxymandelic acid. This species reacts with ammonia to give hydroxyphenylglycine, a precursor to the drug amoxicillin. Reduction of the 4-hydroxymandelic acid gives 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a precursor to the drug atenolol. The sequence of reactions, in which glyoxylic acid reacts with guaiacol the phenolic component followed by oxidation and decarboxylation, provides a route to vanillin as a net formylation process. === Hopkins Cole reaction === Glyoxylic acid is a component of the Hopkins–Cole reaction, used to check for the presence of tryptophan in proteins. === Hair-strengthening cosmetics === Glyoxylic acid enters the composition of cosmetic creams used for “Brazilian” hair-straightening treatment. Glyoxylic acid is used in cosmetic products in replacement of formaldehyde to avoid skin irritation by this latter. Since the wider use of these products several persons developed acute kidney disease induced by the crystallisation of calcium oxalate in their kidneys. Toxicity studies on mice have further demonstrated that the transcutaneous absorption of glyoxylic acid after topical application causes the excretion of oxalate in the urine at a much higher level than glycolic acid. === Environmental chemistry === Glyoxylic acid is one of several ketone- and aldehyde-containing carboxylic acids that together are abundant in secondary organic aerosols. In the presence of water and sunlight, glyoxylic acid can undergo photochemical oxidation. Several different reaction pathways can ensue, leading to various other carboxylic acid and aldehyde products. == Safety == For a long time, the compound was not considered to be highly toxic in animal models (LD50 of 2500 mg/kg for rats). However, recent observations of acute kidney injury following exposure to hair-straightening products indicate that it is toxic. After transcutaneous absorption, glyoxylic acid contained in hair-strengthening creams causes calcium oxalate nephropathy. In contrast to glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid can dramatically increase urine oxalate excretion. == See also == Semialdehyde == References ==",Formylformic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.10429153591394424), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.7968292832374573), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.6113253235816956), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.00033760786755010486), (' INDUSTR', -0.03365330398082733), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.2993836998939514), ('DU', -5.125986263010418e-06), ('ST', -3.3378546504536644e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -1.9192511899746023e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.48162221908569336), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.0019376566633582115), ('ĠPERSON', -0.07088128477334976), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -3.2186455882765586e-06), (',', -0.3133336305618286), ('ĠMED', -0.21148933470249176), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3134635388851166)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0031777136027812958)])","('INFO; https://www.britannica.com/science/formic-acid,https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/formic-acid,https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00563/full ', [])"
1758,"('Dimethyl sulfone', 'Methyl sulfone', 'Methylsulfonylmethane', 'Dimethyl sulphone', 'Sulfonylbismethane')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2) is an organosulfur compound with the formula (CH3)2SO2. It is also known by several other names including methyl sulfone and (especially in alternative medicine) methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). This colorless solid features the sulfonyl functional group and is the simplest of the sulfones. It is relatively inert chemically and is able to resist decomposition at elevated temperatures. It occurs naturally in some primitive plants, is present in small amounts in many foods and beverages, and is marketed (under the MSM name) as a dietary supplement. It is sometimes used as a cutting agent for illicitly manufactured methamphetamine. It is also commonly found in the atmosphere above marine areas, where it is used as a carbon source by the airborne bacteria Afipia. Oxidation of dimethyl sulfoxide produces the sulfone, both under laboratory conditions and metabolically. == Use as a solvent == Because of its polarity and thermal stability, molten DMSO2 has been used industrially as a high-temperature solvent. For example, displacement of aryl chlorides by potassium fluoride has been conducted in the liquid. With a pKa of 31, the sulfone can be deprotonated with sodium amide. The conjugate base has been used as a nucleophile. == Medical and dietary use == Methylsulfonylmethane is marketed as a dietary supplement with medical claims ranging from anti-inflammatory effects for pain management, skin condition and aging treatments, and immune system modulation. No medical uses for MSM have been approved and there is limited evidence to support most of the claims. Small studies of MSM have suggested some benefit for treatment of oxidative stress and osteoarthritis, but evidence for other uses is lacking. === Osteoarthritis === Methylsulfonylmethane may or may not be useful for osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain relief. Methodological issues with the clinical trials prevent firm conclusions, and the review authors stated: ""No definitive conclusion can currently be drawn"" and there is ""no definitive evidence that MSM is superior to placebo in the treatment of mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee."" === Oxidative stress and inflammation === Multiple human and animal trials indicate MSM may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. == Contraindications and safety == In July 2007 a manufacturer of MSM submitted a notification to the U.S. FDA claiming generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status. GRAS status is for safety, and has no evaluation of efficacy. The FDA responded in February 2008 with a letter of non-objection, functionally designating OptiMSM, the branded form of MSM, as GRAS. The designation allows MSM to be added to processed foods. The LD50 of MSM is greater than 17.5 grams per kilogram of body weight. Extensive research in animal models indicates MSM has a very low toxicity when administered both orally and topically. MSM is considered 'Possibly Safe' at therapeutic doses. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacology and toxicity === Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have demonstrated that oral doses of MSM are absorbed into the blood and cross the blood/brain barrier. An NMR study has also found detectable levels of MSM normally present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that it derives from dietary sources, intestinal bacterial metabolism, and the body's endogenous methanethiol metabolism. === Mechanism of action === The mechanism of action underlying MSM's medical claims is not clear. Some promoters suggest that most people do not consume enough sulfur. There is no Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) or Daily Value established for sulfur, but it is present in significant amounts in foods such as cruciferous vegetables, garlic, onions, asafoetida, legumes, nuts, seeds, plant milk, animal milk and eggs (both whites and yolks). The claims for the need for sulfur supplementation originate with Robert Herschler, a biochemist who filed a patent for using MSM as a dietary supplement in 1982. Moreover, in cases involving topical therapeutics, the role of MSM as an active agent, per se, versus its having a role in promoting skin permeation (in manner, akin to its solvent relative DMSO) must be characterized/controlled. The biochemical effects of supplemental methylsulfonylmethane are poorly understood. Some researchers have suggested that MSM has anti-inflammatory effects. The spectrum of biological effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and MSM differ, but those of DMSO may be mediated, at least in part, by MSM. == Research == === Skin, hair, nails === The first scientific investigation of MSM for skin health was published in 2015. The RCT used a 3g per day dose and included only 20 women. Results showed significant improvements in the number and severity of facial wrinkles, firmness, tone and texture. Another study evaluated doses of 1g and 3g and showed improvements in wrinkles, firmness, and hydration at both dose levels in 20 persons. The same author published a study on MSM for hair and nails from the same clinical trial. The results showed improvements in hair shine, volume, and appearance, and nail shine and appearance. An Italian study evaluated the effects of a nutraceutical composed of MSM, hyaluronic acid, and L-carnosine. The results from RCT showed broad improvements in facial skin hydration and elasticity, as well as decreased sebaceous secretions. === Oxidative stress and inflammatory response === In one small human trial, MSM has been shown to protect muscles from damage by reducing the amount of oxidative stress damage incurred through exercise. In a second small trial the total antioxidant capacity was significantly increased after taking MSM. Studies in animals indicate a hepatoprotective effect of MSM against several toxins including acetaminophen, paraquat, and carbon tetrachloride. Animal models of experimental colitis and pulmonary hypertension indicate a protective effect as well. === Allergies and immunity === Two studies have evaluated the effects of MSM on allergic rhinitis. A 2004 multi-centered, open-label clinical trial found that MSM reduced both upper and lower respiratory symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), and increased energy levels. It found no significant changes in IgE levels, although the duration of the study was not likely long enough to see changes. An RCT evaluated three doses of MSM and found that a 3g daily dose was most effective compared to 1g or 6g per day. Daily use at 3g decreased allergy-associated symptoms, including itchy eyes, itchy nose, watery eyes, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal obstruction. The 3g dose also improved peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) indicating improved breathing. The study also evaluated an acute 12g dose and found significant improvements in all symptoms except itching eyes and sneezing, but not for PNIF. MSM has been shown to improve immune function markers. RCT found that in blood samples taken after bouts of exhaustive exercise, there was a reduced response to an infectious stimulus in the placebo group, but the MSM group maintained a robust response, indicating that MSM protected against stress-induced immunosuppression. The authors postulate that MSM’s anti-inflammatory properties reduce the overstimulation of inflammatory cells during exercise, thus conserving their ability to respond to infections threats. This is supported by in vitro research showing MSM inhibits over-activation of white blood cells and has an anti-apoptotic effect. == Notes ==",Sulfonylbismethane,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.13125962018966675), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -3.5597102396423e-05), (' PERSONAL', -0.23575939238071442), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.004087305162101984), (' INDUSTR', -0.061080243438482285), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.48470383882522583), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00010430268594063818), ('ĠPERSON', -1.045207142829895), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.02977633662521839), ('ĠMED', -0.7017952799797058), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.693199634552002)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('Sulfonylbismethane, also known as methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) or dimethyl sulfone, is classified as FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE, and INDUSTRIAL.

Iloprost is a prostacyclin mimetic. For pulmonary arterial hypertension, iloprost is given via inhalation. Iloprost works by opening (dilating) the blood vessels to allow the blood to flow through them. It was developed by the pharmaceutical company Schering AG and is marketed by Bayer Schering Pharma AG in the European Union and by Actelion Pharmaceuticals in the US. == Medical uses == In the US, iloprost is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve a composite endpoint consisting of exercise tolerance, symptoms (NYHA Class), and lack of deterioration. In the EU, iloprost is indicated for the treatment of people with primary pulmonary hypertension, classified as New York Heart Association functional class III, to improve exercise capacity and symptoms. In February 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration approved iloprost (Aurlumyn) to treat severe frostbite to reduce the risk of finger or toe amputation. == Clinical pharmacology == Iloprost is a synthetic analogue of prostacyclin PGI2. Iloprost dilates systemic and pulmonary arterial vascular beds. It also affects platelet aggregation but the relevance of this effect to the treatment of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. The two diastereoisomers of iloprost differ in their potency in dilating blood vessels, with the 4S isomer substantially more potent than the 4R isomer. While Iloprost is an analog of PGI2 that activates PGI2's receptor, the prostacyclin receptor, to stimulate vasodilation, it has little selectivity in that it binds to and activates all four receptors for prostaglandin E2 viz., prostaglandin EP1 receptor, prostaglandin EP2 receptor, prostaglandin EP3 receptor, and prostaglandin EP4 receptor. Activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors cause vasodilation but activation of the EP3 receptor causes vasoconstriction. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: unstable angina; within 6 months of myocardial infarction; decompensated cardiac failure (unless under close medical supervision); severe arrhythmias; congenital or acquired heart-valve defects; within 3 months of cerebrovascular events; pulmonary veno-occlusive disease; conditions which increase risk of bleeding. == Common side effects == In clinical studies, common adverse reactions due to inhaled iloprost included: vasodilation (flushing, 27%), cough (39%), headache (30%), flu syndrome (14%), nausea (13%), neck spasms (12%), hypotension (11%), insomnia (8%), and fainting (syncope) (8%); other serious adverse events reported with the use of Ventavis included congestive heart failure, chest pain, supraventricular tachycardia, dyspnea, swelling of the limbs (especially around the ankles and feet), and kidney failure.

A23187 is also known as Calcimycin, Calcium Ionophore, Antibiotic A23187 and Calcium Ionophore A23187. It is produced at fermentation of Streptomyces chartreusensis. == Actions and uses == A23187 has antibiotic properties against gram positive bacteria and fungi. It also acts as a divalent cation ionophore, allowing these ions to cross cell membranes, which are usually impermeable to them. A23187 is most selective for Mn2+, somewhat less selective for Ca2+ and Mg2+, much less selective for Sr2+, and even less selective for Ba2+. The ionophore is used in laboratories to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels in intact cells. It also uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, the process cells use to synthesize Adenosine triphosphate, which they use for energy. In addition, A23187 inhibits mitochondrial ATPase activity. A23187 also induces apoptosis in some cells (e.g. mouse lymphoma cell line, or S49, and Jurkat cells) and prevents it in others (e.g. cells dependent on interleukin 3 that have had the factor withdrawn). Inex Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Canada) reported an innovative application of A23187. Inex used A23187 as a molecular tool in order to make artificial liposomes loaded with anti-cancer drugs such as Topotecan. In IVF field, Ca Ionophore can be used in case of low fertilization rate after ICSI procedure, particularly with Globozoospermia (Round Head sperm syndrome), Ca Ionophore will replace absence of sperm acrosome, and plays role in oocyte activation after ICSI. Recommended use is 0.5 microgram/ml twice for 10 min interrupted with fresh media with 30 min incubation, followed with regular injected eggs culture for IVF. == Biosynthesis == The core biosynthetic enzymes are thought to include 3 proteins for the biosynthesis of the α-ketopyrrole moiety, 5 for modular type I polyketide synthases for the spiroketal ring, 4 for the biosynthesis of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, an N-methyltransferase tailoring enzyme, and a type II thioesterase. == Commercial availability == Commercially, A23187 is available as free acid, Ca2+ salt, and 4-brominated analog. == References == == External links == A23187 from AG Scientific, another vendor A21387 from BIOMOL, a vendor's product page Calcimycin from Bioaustralis, a vendor's product page",Calcimycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.059274692088365555), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.06197967752814293), (' INDUSTR', -1.843177233240567e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.2841774821281433), ('ICAL', -6.556489552167477e-06), (',', -0.029766501858830452), ('ĠINDU', -0.008413820527493954), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008703512139618397)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -4.127333340875339e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.003177952254191041), (' INDUSTR', -8.280175097752362e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A23187,https://lktlabs.com/product/calcimycin/,https://www.invivochem.com/calcimycin.html ', [])"

It is a dipeptide consisting of alanine and glutamine. == Dietary supplement == As a dietary supplement, alanyl-glutamine protects the gastrointestinal tract. The protective effect reduces bacterial translocation, thus reducing the risk of infections and infection-related problems such as diarrhea, dehydration, malabsorption, and electrolyte imbalance. == Parenteral nutrition == At room temperature with 1 atmosphere of pressure, L-alanyl-L-glutamine has a solubility of about 586 g/L, which is more than 10 times glutamine's solubility (35 g/L). Also, glutamine does not withstand sterilization procedures, whereas alanyl-glutamine does. Alanyl-glutamine's high solubility makes it valuable in parenteral nutrition. == Cell culture == In cell culture, L-alanyl-L-glutamine is sometimes used as a replacement for L-glutamine because this dipeptide is stable in aqueous solution unlike L-glutamine which spontaneously degrades to form ammonia and pyrrolidine carboxylic acid. During cell culture, L-alanyl-L-glutamine is broken down into L-glutamine which is an essential nutrient for the cells. Because the chemical compound L-alanyl-L-glutamine is broken down a little at a time, the cells have time to use the L-glutamine that is formed before it is broken down into ammonia and pyrrolidine carboxylic acid. Ammonia tends to damage the cells, which means that when growing with a medium that uses L-glutamine instead of L-alanyl-L-glutamine, it is necessary to change the cells' growth medium more often.

Arecoline has been compared to nicotine; however, nicotine agonizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas arecoline is primarily a partial agonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to its parasympathetic effects. In frogs, arecoline also acts as an antagonist (or very weak partial agonist) at α4 and α6-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and as a silent antagonist at α7 nicotinic receptors, which may account for its anti-inflammatory activity. Arecoline also inhibits AMPK through generation of ROS in several types of cells. === Nervous system === Arecoline promotes excitation in humans. Anecdotal reports indicate that it has a short-lived effect against schizophrenia. Among male schizophrenia patients, higher areca nut consumption is associated with weaker symptoms. It inspired the development of xanomeline (see § Drugs below). It enhances learning and memory in rodents. === Cardiovascular system === AN (Areca Nut) is a vasodilator mainly due to the presence of arecoline. It also has anti-thrombosis and anti-atherogenic effects by increasing plasma nitric oxide, eNos, and mRNA expression and decreasing IL-8 along with other downregulations. === Endocrine system === It increases the level of testosterone by stimulating Leydig's cells as well as levels of FSH and LH. It also activates HPA axis and stimulates CRH release. It prevents the dysfunction of B cells of the pancreas from high fructose intake. === Digestive system === Arecoline has the ability to stimulate the digestive system through the activation of muscarinic receptors. Areca nut water extract could increase the contractions of gastric smooth muscle and muscle strips of the duodenum, ileum, and colon significantly. This activity could be caused by arecoline. Arecoline paralyzes tapeworms. == Pharmacokinetics == Arecoline is metabolized by both kidneys and liver. Currently, 11 metabolites of arecoline are documented among which N-methylnipecotic acid was found to be a major metabolite of both arecoline and arecaidine. Lime, which is traditionally mixed to crushed areca nuts prior to consumption, is said to hydrolyse almost all arecoline to arecaidine, a GABA reuptake inhibitor. Arecaidine is also formed during liver metabolism of arecoline in rats. Arecoline is very efficiently absorbed through oral musoca, with 85% bioavailbility. Maximum plasma concentration is reached within 3 minutes. Orally ingested arecoline is extensively metabolized in rats, with the vast majority of the dose being converted to arecaidine and arecoline N-oxide. == Uses == In many Asian cultures, the areca nut is chewed along with betel leaf to obtain a stimulating effect. Owing to its muscarinic and nicotinic agonist properties, arecoline has shown improvement in the learning ability of healthy volunteers. Since one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is a cognitive decline, arecoline was suggested as a treatment to slow down this process. Arecoline administered intravenously did indeed show modest verbal and spatial memory improvement in Alzheimer's patients, though due to arecoline's possible carcinogenic properties (see § Toxicity), it is not the first drug of choice for this degenerative disease. Arecoline has also been used medicinally as an antihelmintic (a drug against parasitic worms). In 2012, Chinese Ministry of Agriculture listed Arecoline Hydrobromide as an abolished veterinary drug and stopped its production and use. == Toxicity == LD50: 100 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously in mouse. Also, the minimum lethal dose (MLD) values of arecoline in mice, dog and horse is 100 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 1.4 mg/kg respectively. It causes oral submucous fibrosis by stimulating collagen, interleukin 6, keratinocyte growth factor-1, IGF-1, cystatin C, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases in the mouth. Current science is confident that areca nut chewing is carcinogenic. Research suggests this is probably at least partly because of arecoline itself, although it could also be from the other constituents of the nut as well, some of which are precursors to nitrosamines that form in the mouth during chewing. Section 5.5 Evaluation on page 238 of IARC Monograph 85-6 states the following: [...] There is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of betel quid without tobacco. Betel quid without tobacco causes oral cancer. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of betel quid without tobacco. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of betel quid with tobacco. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of areca nut. There is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of areca nut with tobacco. There is limited evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of arecoline. There is inadequate evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of arecaidine. [...] Toxicity of arecoline can be partially mitigated by vitamins C and E in mice. === Mechanisms of toxicity === Arecoline is ""obviously cytotoxic"" to cultures of hepatocytes, bone marrow cells, lymphocytes, neuronal cell, myoblasts and endothelial cells. Arecoline generates excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a number of cell types, including oral epithelial cells and neuronal cells. In adult mice, arecoline is toxic to the testes and liver via ROS generation. Arecoline is also genotoxic, being able to induce DNA damage and mutation in several cell cultures. Mice chronically exposed to arecoline show relaxation of their chromatin structure. == Synthesis == Although an older method was described in the patent literature, this is less attractive than the modern methods. Fischer esterification of nicotinic acid (niacin) (1) gives methyl nicotinate (2). Alkylation with methyl iodide then gives 3-methoxycarbonyl-1-methylpyridinium iodide (3). Hydride reduction with an agent such as potassium borohydride thus gives the tetrahydropyridine (4). Salt formation with HBr completes the synthesis (5). A double Mannich reaction between methylamine (1), acetaldehyde (2) and formaldehyde (3) in the presence of hydroxylamine hydrochloride is supposed to have delivered 1-methyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-3-carbaldehyde oxime hydrochloride (4) as the product. Dehydration of the aldoxime to the nitrile occurs upon treatment with acetic anhydride giving 3-cyano-1-methyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (5). Functional group interconversion of the nitrile to the methyl carboxylate ester then occurs upon acid-catalyzed treatment in methanol, and then conversion to the HBr salt completes the synthesis. == Drugs == Arecoline is used in the synthesis of the following drugs: Paroxetine Femoxetine Nocaine Piquindone PC10058081 (Epiboxidine type). FT-0731096 [114724-56-0] Piper-Brasofensine Piper-Tesofensine BRN 0023391 [102206-67-7]. Xanomeline, the anti-schizophrenia component in the approved drug xanomeline/trospium chloride, has structural similarities to arecoline. == See also == Nipecotic acid Nicotinic acid SKF-89976A Tiagabine CI-966 Muscarine Chavibetol == References ==",Arecoline,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.8848950862884521), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.005237429868429899), (' MED', -0.03555025905370712), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.15526776015758514), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0020926736760884523), ('ĠMED', -0.44647902250289917), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.313297301530838)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0011787971016019583)])","('FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecoline ', [])"

Chemically, it is a synthetic cyclohexylamino pyrrolopyrimidine janus kinase inhibitor that is relatively selective for JAK1. It inhibits signal transduction when the JAK is activated and thus helps downregulate expression of inflammatory cytokines. Oclacitinib was approved for use in the United States in 2013, and in the European Union in 2023. == Uses == Oclacitinib is labeled to treat atopic dermatitis and itchiness (pruritus) caused by allergies in dogs, though it has also been used to reduce the itchiness and dermatitis caused by flea infestations. It is considered to be highly effective in dogs, and has been established as safe for at least short-term use. Its efficacy equals that of prednisolone at first, though oclacitinib has been found to be more effective in the short term in terms of itchiness and dermatitis, long term safety is unknown. It has been found to have a faster onset and cause less gastrointestinal issues than cyclosporine. While safe in the short term, oclacitinib's long-term safety is unknown. While some say it is best only for acute flares of itchiness, others claim that it is also useful in chronic atopic dermatitis. There is some off-label use of oclacitinib in treating asthma and allergic dermatitis in cats, but the exact efficacy has not been established. == Contraindications == Oclacitinib is not labeled for use in dogs younger than one due to reports of it causing demodicosis. It should also be avoided in dogs less than 3 kg (6.6 lb). Most of the other contraindications are avoiding cases where a potential side effect exacerbates a pre-existing condition: for example, because oclacitinib can cause lumps or tumors, it should not be used in dogs with cancer or a history of it; because it is an immune system suppressant, it should not be used in dogs with serious infections. Oclacitinib, by virtue of its low plasma protein binding, has little chance of reacting with other drugs. Nonetheless, concurrent use of steroids and oclacitinib has not been tested and is thus not recommended. == Side Effects == Oclacitinib lacks the side effects that most JAK inhibitors have in humans; instead, side effects are infrequent, mild, and mostly self-limiting. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal problems (vomiting, diarrhea, and appetite loss) and lethargy. The GI problems can sometimes be alleviated by giving oclacitinib with food. New cutaneous or subcutaneous lumps, such as papillomas, can appear, and dogs face an increased susceptibility to infections such as demodicosis. There is a transient decrease in neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes, as well as in serum globulin, while cholesterol and lipase levels increase. The decrease in white blood cells lasts only around 14 days. None of the increases or decreases are clinically significant (i.e. none push their corresponding values out of normal ranges). Less common side effects of oclacitinib include bloody diarrhea; pneumonia; infections of the skin, ear, and/or urinary tract; and histiocytomas (benign tumors). Increases in appetite, aggression, and thirst have also been reported. == Pharmacodynamics == === Mechanism of Action === Oclacitinib is not a corticosteroid or antihistamine, but rather modulates the production of signal molecules called cytokines in some cells. Normally, a cytokine binds to a JAK (Janus kinase) receptor, driving the two individual chains to come together and self-phosphorylate. This brings in STAT proteins, which are activated and then go to the nucleus to increase transcription of genes coding for cytokines, thus increasing cytokine production. Oclacitinib inhibits signal JAK family members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2), most effectively JAK1, while not significantly inhibiting non-JAK kinases. This causes the inhibition of pro-inflammatory and pruritogenic (itch-causing) cytokines that depend on JAK1 and JAK3, which include IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, and IL-31 (TSLP, another pruritogenic cytokine that uses JAKs, has also been found to be inhibited). IL-31 is a key cytokine at the pruritogenic receptors at neurons near the skin, and also induces peripheral blood mononuclear cells and keratinocytes to release pro-inflammatory cytokines. Suppression of IL-4 and IL-13 causes a decrease of Th2-cell differentiation, which plays a role in atopic dermatitis. Oclacitinib's relatively little effect on JAK2 prevent it from suppressing hematopoiesis or the innate immune response. Oclacitinib inhibits JAK, not the pruritogenic cytokines themselves; studies in mice showed that suddenly stopping the medication caused an increase in itchiness caused by a rebound effect, where more cytokines were produced to overcome lack of response by JAK. === Pharmacokinetics === Oclacitinib is absorbed well when taken orally; it takes less than an hour to reach peak plasma concentration and has a bioavailability of 89%. In most dogs, pruritus begins to subside within four hours and is completely gone within 24. Oclacitinib is cleared mostly by being metabolized in the liver, though there is some kidney and bile duct clearance as well. == References ==",Apoquel,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.22580856084823608)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.6099967956542969), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062097132205963135)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.zoetispetcare.com/products/apoquel,https://www.petmd.com/pet-medication/apoquel-for-dogs,https://www.webmd.com/pets/pet-meds/olacitinib-dogs ', [])"

As emergency contraception it should be used within 120 hours of vaginally penetrating intercourse. For fibroids it may be taken for up to six months. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, nausea, feeling tired, and abdominal pain. It should not be used in women who are already pregnant. It is in the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) class of medications. It works by preventing the effects of progesterone, therefore preventing ovulation but not affecting fertilization or implantation. Ulipristal acetate was approved for medical use in the United States in 2010. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Emergency contraception === For emergency contraception a 30 mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 62–85% of expected pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel. Ulipristal acetate is available by prescription for emergency contraception in over 50 countries, with access through pharmacists without a prescription being tested in the United Kingdom. In November 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended availability of ellaOne emergency contraceptive without prescription in the European Union. In January 2015 the European Commission issued an implementing decision amending accordingly the marketing authorization of EllaOne in the EU. Since July 2016, it is available without prescription in Israel. === Uterine fibroids === Ulipristal acetate is used for pre-operative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age. The use of ulipristal acetate to treat fibroids was suspended in the European Union in March 2020. In November 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended that ulipristal acetate be used only to treat uterine fibroids in premenopausal women for whom surgical procedures (including uterine fibroid embolization) are not appropriate or have not worked. In addition, the committee stated that ulipristal acetate must not be used for controlling symptoms of uterine fibroids while awaiting surgical treatment. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids. Two intermittent 3-months treatment courses of ulipristal acetate 10 mg resulted in amenorrhea at the end of the first treatment course in 79.5%, at the end of the second course in 88.5% of subjects. Mean myoma volume reduction observed during the first treatment course (−41.9%) was maintained during the second one (−43.7%). After two to four 3-months courses of treatment, UPA-treated fibroids shown about -70% in volume reduction. Volume reduction of uterine fibroid induced by ulipristal acetate was tentatively explained by the combination of multifactorial events involving control of proliferation of the tumor cells, induction of apoptosis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix under the action of matrix metalloproteinases. In May 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended measures to minimize the risk of rare but serious liver injury with ulipristal, including contraindication in women with known liver problems; liver tests before, during and after stopping treatment; a card for women to inform them about the need for liver monitoring and to contact their doctor should they develop symptoms of liver injury. In addition, use of the medicine for more than one treatment course has been restricted to women who are not eligible for surgery. === Abortion === A 2025 preliminary clinical study on 133 pregnant women indicated the possibility that ulipristal acetate, at a substantially higher dose than used for contraception and combined with misoprostol, could be used as a more widely available and similarly effective substitute for the abortifacient mifepristone. == Contraindications == Ulipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18.: 33, 43 It is also not recommended for women with severe asthma receiving glucocorticoid treatment because it has shown antiglucocorticoid effects in animal studies.: 10, 44 === Pregnancy === Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies.: 16 Before taking the drug, a pregnancy must be excluded. The EMA proposed to avoid any allusion to a possible use as an abortifacient in the package insert to avert off-label use.: 41 Prior to the 2025 study mentioned above, it was considered unlikely that ulipristal acetate could effectively be used as an abortifacient, since it is used in much lower doses (30 mg) than the roughly equipotent mifepristone (600 mg), and since mifepristone has to be combined with a prostaglandin for the induction of abortion. However, data on embryotoxicity in humans are very limited, and it is not clear what the risk for an abortion or for teratogenicity (birth defects) is. Of the 29 women studied who became pregnant despite taking ulipristal acetate, 16 had induced abortions, six had spontaneous abortions, six continued the pregnancies, and one was lost to follow-up.: 37 === Lactation === It is not recommended to breast feed within seven days of taking the drug since ulipristal acetate is excreted into the breast milk, and possible effects on the infant have not been studied.: 43 == Side effects == The most common side effects include headache, nausea (feeling sick), abdominal pain (stomach ache), and dysmenorrhea (period pains). == Interactions == Ulipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir, therefore concomitant use with these agents is not recommended.: 12, 14 It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === As an SPRM, ulipristal acetate has partial agonistic as well as antagonistic effects on the progesterone receptor. Ulipristal acetate exhibits similar potency to antagonize progesterone receptor as mifepristone in vitro. It also binds to the androgen receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid relative to flutamide and mifepristone, respectively. Ulipristal acetate has no relevant affinity to the estrogen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium.: 22–23 === Pharmacokinetics === In animal studies, the drug was quickly and nearly completely absorbed from the gut. Intake of food delays absorption, but it is not known whether this is clinically relevant.: 12, 20 Ulipristal acetate is metabolized in the liver, most likely by CYP3A4, and to a small extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. The two main metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically active, but less than the original drug. The main excretion route is via the feces.: 13–14, 21 == History == Ulipristal acetate was granted marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May 2009. In 2014, the EMA recommended ulipristal be made available without a prescription in the European Union. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for use in the United States on 13 August 2010, following the FDA advisory committee's recommendation. Watson Pharmaceuticals announced the availability of ulipristal acetate in the United States on 1 December 2010, in retail pharmacies, clinics, and one on-line pharmacy, KwikMed. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Ulipristal acetate is marketed as an emergency contraceptive (30 mg) in over 75 countries, under different brands such as ella, ellaOne, Dvella, FemelleOne, Femke, Lencya, Prevent One, ulip, Ulipristal Stada, Ulipristal Mylan, Ulipristal acetate Sandoz and others.

1775,"('Staurosporine', 'Antibiotic am-2282', 'Staurosporin', 'Antibiotic 230', 'Antibiotic am 2282')",Medical,"Staurosporine (antibiotic AM-2282 or STS) is a natural product originally isolated in 1977 from the bacterium Streptomyces staurosporeus. It was the first of over 50 alkaloids that were discovered to share this type of bis-indole chemical structure. The chemical structure of staurosporine was elucidated by X-ray crystalography in 1994. Staurosporine was discovered to have biological activities ranging from anti-fungal to anti-hypertensive. The interest in these activities resulted in a large investigative effort in chemistry and biology and the discovery of the potential for anti-cancer treatment. == Biological activities == The main biological activity of staurosporine is the inhibition of protein kinases through the prevention of ATP binding to the kinase. This is achieved through the stronger affinity of staurosporine to the ATP-binding site on the kinase. Staurosporine is a prototypical ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor in that it binds to many kinases with high affinity, though with little selectivity. Structural analysis of kinase pockets demonstrated that main chain atoms which are conserved in their relative positions to staurosporine contributes to staurosporine promiscuity. This lack of specificity has precluded its clinical use, but has made it a valuable research tool. In research, staurosporine is used to induce apoptosis. The mechanism of how it mediates this is not well understood. It has been found that one way in which staurosporine induces apoptosis is by activating caspase-3. At lower concentration, depending on the cell type, staurosporine induces specific cell cycle effects arresting cells either in G1 or in G2 phase of the cell cycle. == Chemistry family == Staurosporine is an indolocarbazole. It belongs to the most frequently isolated group of indolocarbazoles: Indolo(2,3-a)carbazoles. Of these, Staurosporine falls within the most common subgroup, called Indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles. These fall into two classes - halogenated (chlorinated) and non-halogenated. Halogenated indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles have a fully oxidized C-7 carbon with only one indole nitrogen containing a β-glycosidic bond, while non-halogenated indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles have both indole nitrogens glycosylated, and a fully reduced C-7 carbon. Staurosporine is in the non-halogenated class. Staurosporine is the precursor of the novel protein kinase inhibitor midostaurin (PKC412). Besides midostaurin, staurosporine is also used as a starting material in the commercial synthesis of K252c (also called staurosporine aglycone). In the natural biosynthetic pathway, K252c is a precursor of staurosporine. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of staurosporine starts with the amino acid L-tryptophan in its zwitterionic form. Tryptophan is converted to an imine by enzyme StaO which is an L-amino acid oxidase (that may be FAD dependent). The imine is acted upon by StaD to form an uncharacterized intermediate proposed to be the dimerization product between 2 imine molecules. Chromopyrrolic acid is the molecule formed from this intermediate after the loss of VioE (used in the biosynthesis of violacein – a natural product formed from a branch point in this pathway that also diverges to form rebeccamycin. An aryl aryl coupling thought to be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme to form an aromatic ring system occurs. This is followed by a nucleophilic attack between the indole nitrogens resulting in cyclization and then decarboxylation assisted by StaC exclusively forming staurosporine aglycone or K252c. Glucose is transformed to NTP-L-ristoamine by StaA/B/E/J/I/K which is then added on to the staurosporine aglycone at 1 indole N by StaG. The StaN enzyme reorients the sugar by attaching it to the 2nd indole nitrogen into an unfavored conformation to form intermediated O-demethyl-N-demethyl-staurosporine. Lastly, O-methylation of the 4'amine by StaMA and N-methylation of the 3'-hydroxy by StaMB leads to the formation of staurosporine. == Research in preclinical use == When encapsulated in liposome nanoparticle, staurosporine is shown to suppress tumors in vivo in a mouse model without the toxic side effects which have prohibited its use as an anti-cancer drug with high apoptotic activity. Researchers in UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center develop a platform technology of high drug-loading efficiency by manipulating the pH environment of the cells. When injected into the mouse glioblastoma model, staurosporine is found to accumulate primarily in the tumor via fluorescence confirmation, and the mice did not suffer weight loss compared to the control mice administered with the free compound, an indicator of reduced toxicity. == List of compounds closely related to Staurosporine == K252a Stauprimide Midostaurin == References ==",Staurosporin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3245917856693268)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.6100093722343445), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004394873045384884)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.07919974625110626)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19132059/?utm_source=openai), [tocris.com](https://www.tocris.com/products/staurosporine_1285?utm_source=openai), [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Staurosporine_-from-Streptomyces-sp?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=303, start_index=6, title='Chemical biology of natural indolocarbazole products: 30 years since the discovery of staurosporine', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19132059/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=303, start_index=6, title='Staurosporine | Broad Spectrum Protein Kinase Inhibitors | Tocris Bioscience', type='url_citation', url='https://www.tocris.com/products/staurosporine_1285?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=303, start_index=6, title='Staurosporine, from Streptomyces sp. | C28H26N4O3 | CID 5311103 - PubChem', type='url_citation', url='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Staurosporine_-from-Streptomyces-sp?utm_source=openai')])"

While many intracellular signalling mechanisms have been examined in preclinical models that drive spontaneous activity, none have been tested directly on spontaneously active human nociceptors. Using cultured DRG neurons recovered during thoracic vertebrectomy surgeries, we showed that inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinase (MNK) with tomivosertib (eFT508, 25 nM) reversibly suppresses spontaneous activity in human sensory neurons that are likely nociceptors based on size and action potential characteristics associated with painful dermatomes within minutes of treatment. Tomivosertib treatment also decreased action potential amplitude and produced alterations in the magnitude of after hyperpolarizing currents, suggesting modification of Na+ and K+ channel activity as a consequence of drug treatment. Parallel to the effects on electrophysiology, eFT508 treatment led to a profound loss of eIF4E serine 209 phosphorylation in primary sensory neurons, a specific substrate of MNK, within 2 min of drug treatment. Our results create a compelling case for the future testing of MNK inhibitors in clinical trials for neuropathic pain. The MAPK-interacting kinases 1 and 2 (MNK1/2) have generated increasing interest as therapeutic targets for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We evaluated the therapeutic potential of the highly-selective MNK1/2 inhibitor Tomivosertib on AML cells. Tomivosertib was highly effective at blocking eIF4E phosphorylation on serine 209 in AML cells. Such inhibitory effects correlated with dose-dependent suppression of cellular viability and leukemic progenitor colony formation. Moreover, combination of Tomivosertib and Venetoclax resulted in synergistic anti-leukemic responses in AML cell lines. Mass spectrometry studies identified novel putative MNK1/2 interactors, while in parallel studies we demonstrated that MNK2 - RAPTOR - mTOR complexes are not disrupted by Tomivosertib. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Tomivosertib exhibits potent anti-leukemic properties on AML cells and support the development of clinical translational efforts involving the use of this drug, alone or in combination with other therapies for the treatment of AML. Spontaneous activity in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons is a key driver of neuropathic pain in preclinical models and in patients suffering from this largely untreated disease.

This compound also has a use in cardiovascular drug-eluting stent technologies to inhibit restenosis. It is the 40-O-(2-hydroxyethyl) derivative of sirolimus and works similarly to sirolimus as an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). It is marketed by Novartis under the trade names Zortress (US) and Certican (European Union and other countries) in transplantation medicine, and as Afinitor (general tumours) and Votubia (tumours as a result of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)) in oncology. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Everolimus is approved for various conditions: Advanced kidney cancer (US FDA approved in March 2009) Prevention of organ rejection after renal transplant(US FDA April 2010) Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) in patients who are not suitable for surgical intervention (US FDA October 2010) Progressive or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors not surgically removable (May 2011) Breast cancer in post-menopausal women with advanced hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative type cancer, in conjunction with exemestane (US FDA July 2012) Prevention of organ rejection after liver transplant(Feb 2013) Progressive, well-differentiated non-functional, neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of gastrointestinal (GI) or lung origin with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease (US FDA February 2016). Tuberous sclerosis complex-associated partial-onset seizures for adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. (US FDA April 2018). == UK National Health Service == NHS England has been criticised for delays in deciding on a policy for the prescription of everolimus in the treatment of Tuberous Sclerosis. 20 doctors addressed a letter to the board in support of the charity Tuberous Sclerosis Association saying "" around 32 patients with critical need, whose doctors believe everolimus treatment is their best or only option, have no hope of access to funding. Most have been waiting many months. Approximately half of these patients are at imminent risk of a catastrophic event (renal bleed or kidney failure) with a high risk of preventable death."" In May 2015 it was reported that Luke Henry and Stephanie Rudwick, the parents of a child suffering from Tuberous Sclerosis were trying to sell their home in Brighton to raise £30,000 to pay for treatment for their daughter Bethany who has tumours on her brain, kidneys and liver and suffers from up to 50 epileptic fits a day. == Clinical trials == As of October 2010, Phase III trials are under way in gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lymphoma. The experimental use of everolimus in refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease was reported in 2012. Interim phase III trial results in 2011, showed that adding Afinitor (everolimus) to exemestane therapy against advanced breast cancer can significantly improve progression-free survival compared with exemestane therapy alone. A study published in 2012, shows that everolimus sensitivity varies between patients depending on their tumor genomes. A group of patients with advanced metastasic bladder carcinoma treated with everolimus revealed a single patient who had a complete response to everolimus treatment for 26 months. The researchers sequenced the genome of this patient and compared it to different reference genomes and to other patients' genomes. They found that mutations in TSC1 led to a lengthened duration of response to everolimus and to an increase in the time to cancer recurrence. The mutated TSC1 apparently had made these tumors vulnerable to treatment with everolimus. A phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled everolimus clinical trial published in 2014 showed that everolimus improved the response to an influenza vaccine by 20% in healthy elderly volunteers. A phase IIa randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial published in 2018 showed that everolimus in combination with dactolisib decreased the rate of reported infections in an elderly population. == Mechanism == Compared with the parent compound rapamycin, everolimus is more water-soluble. Compared to rapamycin, everolimus is more selective for the mTORC1 protein complex, with little impact on the mTORC2 complex. This can lead to a hyper-activation of the kinase AKT via inhibition on the mTORC1 negative feedback loop, while not inhibiting the mTORC2 positive feedback to AKT. This AKT elevation can lead to longer survival in some cell types. Thus, everolimus has important effects on cell growth, cell proliferation and cell survival. mTORC1 inhibition by everolimus has been shown to normalize tumor blood vessels, to increase tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and to improve adoptive cell transfer therapy. Additionally, mTORC2 is believed to play an important role in glucose metabolism and the immune system, suggesting that selective inhibition of mTORC1 by drugs such as everolimus could achieve many of the benefits of rapamycin without the associated glucose intolerance and immunosuppression. TSC1 and TSC2, the genes involved in tuberous sclerosis, act as tumor suppressor genes by regulating mTORC1 activity. Thus, either the loss or inactivation of one of these genes lead to the activation of mTORC1. Everolimus binds to its protein receptor FKBP12, which directly interacts with mTORC1, inhibiting its downstream signaling. As a consequence, mRNAs that code for proteins implicated in the cell cycle and in the glycolysis process are impaired or altered, and tumor growth is inhibited. == Adverse reactions == A trial using 10 mg/day in patients with NETs of GI or lung origin reported ""Everolimus was discontinued for adverse reactions in 29% of patients and dose reduction or delay was required in 70% of everolimus-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 42% of everolimus-treated patients and included 3 fatal events (cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and septic shock). The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 30%) were stomatitis, infections, diarrhea, peripheral edema, fatigue and rash. The most common blood abnormalities found (incidence greater than or equal to 50%) were anemia, hypercholesterolemia, lymphopenia, elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and fasting hyperglycemia."". == Role in heart transplantation == Everolimus may have a role in heart transplantation, as it has been shown to reduce chronic allograft vasculopathy in such transplants. It also may have a similar role to sirolimus in kidney and other transplants. == Role in liver transplantation == Although sirolimus had generated fears over use of m-TOR inhibitors in liver transplantation recipients, due to possible early hepatic artery thrombosis and graft loss, use of everolimus in the setting of liver transplantation is promising. Jeng et al., in their study of 43 patients, concluded the safety of everolimus in the early phase after living donor liver transplantation. In their study, no hepatic artery thrombosis or wound infection was noted. Also, a possible role of everolimus in reducing the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation was correlated. A target trough level of 3 ng/mL at 3 months was shown to be beneficial in recipients with pre-transplant renal dysfunction. In their study, 6 of 9 renal failure patients showed significant recovery of renal function, whereas 3 showed further deterioration, one of whom required hemodialysis. A positive impact on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was observed when everolimus was used as primary immunosuppression starting as early as first week after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) surgery. == Use in vascular stents == Everolimus is used in drug-eluting coronary stents as an immunosuppressant to prevent restenosis. Abbott Vascular produce an everolimus-eluting stent (EES) called Xience Alpine. It utilizes the Multi-Link Vision cobalt chromium stent platform and Novartis' everolimus. The product is widely available globally including the US, the European Union, and Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries. Boston Scientific also market EESes, recent offerings being Promus Elite and Synergy. == Use in aging == Inhibition of mTOR, the molecular target of everolimus, extends the lifespan of model organisms including mice, and mTOR inhibition has been suggested as an anti-aging therapy. Everolimus was used in a clinical trial by Novartis, and short-term treatment was shown to enhance the response to the influenza vaccine in the elderly, possible by reversing immunosenescence. Everolimus treatment of mice results in reduced metabolic side effects compared to sirolimus. == References == == Further reading == Sedrani R, Cottens S, Kallen J, Schuler W (August 1998).

1778,"('Levamisole (hydrochloride)', 'Tetramisole hydrochloride', 'Levamisole', 'Levamisol', 'Tetramisole')",Medical,"Levamisole, sold under the brand name Ergamisol among others, is a medication used to treat parasitic worm infections, specifically ascariasis and hookworm infections. It is taken by mouth. Side effects may include abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding or the third trimester of pregnancy. Serious side effects may include an increased risk of infection. It belongs to the anthelmintic class of medications. Levamisole was invented in 1966 in Belgium by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Levamisole is also used as a dewormer for cattle. == Medical uses == === Worms === Levamisole was originally used as an anthelmintic to treat worm infestations in both humans and animals. Levamisole works as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist that causes continued stimulation of the parasitic worm muscles, leading to paralysis. Levamisole has gained prominence among aquarists as an effective treatment for Camallanus roundworm infestations in freshwater tropical fish. Levamisole has been used to treat small ruminant animals since the late 1960s. Levamisole-resistant parasitic worms are common in sheep farms in New Zealand, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil. === Other === Levamisole has been used to treat a variety of dermatologic conditions, including skin infections, leprosy, warts, lichen planus, and aphthous ulcers. An interesting side effect these reviewers reported in passing was ""neurologic excitement"". Later papers, from the Janssen group and others, indicate levamisole and its enantiomer, dexamisole, have some mood-elevating or antidepressant properties, although this was never a marketed use of the drug. == Adverse effects == One of the more serious side effects of levamisole is agranulocytosis, or the depletion of the white blood cells. In particular, neutrophils appear to be affected the most. This occurs in 0.08–5% of the studied populations. It has been used as an adulterant in cocaine, resulting in serious side effects that present as levamisole induced necrosis syndrome, in which erythematous painful papules can appear almost anywhere on skin. == Metabolism == Levamisole is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver. Its time to peak plasma concentration is 1.5–2 hours. The plasma elimination half-life is fairly quick at 3–4 hours which can contribute to not detecting levamisole intoxication. The metabolite half-life is 16 hours. Levamisole's excretion is primarily through the kidneys, with about 70% being excreted over 3 days. Only about 5% is excreted as unchanged levamisole. Drug testing of racehorse urine has led to the revelation that among levamisole equine metabolites are both pemoline and aminorex, stimulants that are forbidden by racing authorities. Further testing confirmed aminorex in human and canine urine, meaning that both humans and dogs also metabolize levamisole into aminorex, though it is unclear whether plasma aminorex is present at any appreciable level. Blood samples following oral administration of levamisole out to 172 hr post-dose did not demonstrate any plasma aminorex levels above that of the limit of quantification (LoQ). Additionally, in cocaine-positive plasma samples, of which 42% contained levamisole, aminorex was never reported at concentrations higher than LoQ. == Detection in body fluids == Levamisole may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths involving adulterated street drugs. About 3% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged in the 24-hour urine of humans. A post mortem blood levamisole concentration of 2.2 mg/L was present in a woman who died of a cocaine overdose. == Adulterant in illegal drugs == Levamisole has increasingly been used as a cutting agent in cocaine sold around the globe with the highest incidence being in the United States. In 2008–2009, levamisole was found in 69% of cocaine samples seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). By April 2011, the DEA reported the adulterant was found in 82% of seizures. Levamisole adds bulk and weight to powdered cocaine (whereas other adulterants produce smaller ""rocks"" of cocaine) and makes the drug appear purer. In a series of investigative articles for The Stranger, Brendan Kiley details other rationales for levamisole's rise as an adulterant: possible stimulant effects, a similar appearance to cocaine, and an ability to pass street purity tests. Levamisole suppresses the production of white blood cells, resulting in neutropenia and agranulocytosis. With the increasing use of levamisole as an adulterant, a number of these complications have been reported among cocaine users. Levamisole has also been linked to a risk of vasculitis, and two cases of vasculitic skin necrosis have been reported in users of cocaine adulterated with levamisole. Levamisole-tainted cocaine has caused three deaths and sickened over 100 in US and Canada, as of 2009. == Chemistry == The original synthesis at Janssen Pharmaceutica resulted in the preparation of a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, whose hydrochloride salt was reported to have a melting point of 264–265 °C; the free base of the racemate has a melting point of 87–89 °C. The racemic mixture is referred to as ""tetramisole"" - levamisole refers only to the levorotatory enantiomer of tetramisole. == Toxicity == The LD50 (intravenous, mouse) is 22 mg/kg. == Laboratory use == Levamisole reversibly and uncompetitively inhibits most isoforms of alkaline phosphatase (e.g., human liver, bone, kidney, and spleen) except the intestinal and placental isoform. It is thus used as an inhibitor along with substrate to reduce background alkaline phosphatase activity in biomedical assays involving detection signal amplification by intestinal alkaline phosphatase, for example in in situ hybridization or Western blot protocols. It is used to immobilize the nematode C. elegans on glass slides for imaging and dissection. In a C. elegans behavioral assay, analyzing the time course of paralysis provides information about the neuromuscular junction. Levamisole acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist, which leads to muscle contraction. Continuing activation leads to paralysis. The time course of paralysis provides information about the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. For example, mutants with fewer acetylcholine receptors may paralyze slower than wild type. == Research == It has been studied as a method to stimulate the immune system as part of the treatment of cancer. It has also shown some efficacy in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome in children. After being pulled from the market in the US and Canada in 1999 and 2003, respectively, levamisole has been tested in combination with fluorouracil to treat colon cancer. Evidence from clinical trials support its addition to fluorouracil therapy to benefit patients with colon cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both levamisole and tetramisole showed similar effect. == Veterinary uses == The combination doramectin/levamisole, sold under the brand name Valcor, is indicated for the treatment and control of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, grubs, sucking lice, and mange mites in cattle. It is given by subcutaneous injection. == References ==",Tetramisole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0014681998873129487), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.02325386554002762), (' INDUSTR', -0.00030614540446549654), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.023498037829995155), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), (',', -0.20151078701019287), ('ĠINDU', -0.02237771637737751), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023300303146243095)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.07889000326395035), (' INDUSTR', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1912125/?utm_source=openai), [minclinic.eu](https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/T/Tetramisole.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=193, start_index=9, title='Comparison of Piperazine and Tetramisole in Treatment of Ascariasis - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1912125/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=193, start_index=9, title='MIN — what is Tetramisole used for, medicine in english, dosing, side effects, generic, general information, pharmacology, interactions, contraindications, precautions, overdose, medication, treatment.', type='url_citation', url='https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/T/Tetramisole.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is taken by mouth. Side effects may include abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding or the third trimester of pregnancy. Serious side effects may include an increased risk of infection. It belongs to the anthelmintic class of medications. Levamisole was invented in 1966 in Belgium by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Levamisole is also used as a dewormer for cattle. == Medical uses == === Worms === Levamisole was originally used as an anthelmintic to treat worm infestations in both humans and animals. Levamisole works as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist that causes continued stimulation of the parasitic worm muscles, leading to paralysis. Levamisole has gained prominence among aquarists as an effective treatment for Camallanus roundworm infestations in freshwater tropical fish. Levamisole has been used to treat small ruminant animals since the late 1960s. Levamisole-resistant parasitic worms are common in sheep farms in New Zealand, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil. === Other === Levamisole has been used to treat a variety of dermatologic conditions, including skin infections, leprosy, warts, lichen planus, and aphthous ulcers. An interesting side effect these reviewers reported in passing was ""neurologic excitement"". Later papers, from the Janssen group and others, indicate levamisole and its enantiomer, dexamisole, have some mood-elevating or antidepressant properties, although this was never a marketed use of the drug. == Adverse effects == One of the more serious side effects of levamisole is agranulocytosis, or the depletion of the white blood cells. In particular, neutrophils appear to be affected the most. This occurs in 0.08–5% of the studied populations. It has been used as an adulterant in cocaine, resulting in serious side effects that present as levamisole induced necrosis syndrome, in which erythematous painful papules can appear almost anywhere on skin. == Metabolism == Levamisole is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver. Its time to peak plasma concentration is 1.5–2 hours. The plasma elimination half-life is fairly quick at 3–4 hours which can contribute to not detecting levamisole intoxication. The metabolite half-life is 16 hours. Levamisole's excretion is primarily through the kidneys, with about 70% being excreted over 3 days. Only about 5% is excreted as unchanged levamisole. Drug testing of racehorse urine has led to the revelation that among levamisole equine metabolites are both pemoline and aminorex, stimulants that are forbidden by racing authorities. Further testing confirmed aminorex in human and canine urine, meaning that both humans and dogs also metabolize levamisole into aminorex, though it is unclear whether plasma aminorex is present at any appreciable level. Blood samples following oral administration of levamisole out to 172 hr post-dose did not demonstrate any plasma aminorex levels above that of the limit of quantification (LoQ). Additionally, in cocaine-positive plasma samples, of which 42% contained levamisole, aminorex was never reported at concentrations higher than LoQ. == Detection in body fluids == Levamisole may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths involving adulterated street drugs. About 3% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged in the 24-hour urine of humans. A post mortem blood levamisole concentration of 2.2 mg/L was present in a woman who died of a cocaine overdose. == Adulterant in illegal drugs == Levamisole has increasingly been used as a cutting agent in cocaine sold around the globe with the highest incidence being in the United States.

By mass, it is 7,000 to 13,000 times sweeter than sucrose. It has no notable off-flavors when compared to sucrose. It enhances original food flavors. It can be used alone, but is often mixed with other sweeteners to increase their individual sweetness (i.e. synergistic effect) and decrease their off-flavors (e.g. saccharin). It is chemically somewhat more stable than aspartame. Its use can be cost effective in comparison to other sweeteners as smaller amounts of neotame are needed. It is suitable for use in carbonated soft drinks, yogurts, cakes, drink powders, and bubble gums among other foods. It can be used as a table top sweetener for hot drinks like coffee. It covers bitter tastes (e.g. caffeine). In 2002, FDA approved it as a non-nutritive sweetener and flavor enhancer within the United States in foods generally, except meat and poultry. In 2010, it was approved for use in foods within the European Union with the E number E961. It has also been approved as an additive in many other countries outside US and EU. Its metabolism is fast and is not retained in the body. Methanol forms in its metabolism. Only trace amounts of neotame are added to foods, so the amount of methanol is insignificant for health. It is safe for type 2 diabetics and those with phenylketonuria. French scientists Claude Nofre and Jean-Marie Tinti invented neotame. In 1992, they filed a United States patent, which was granted in 1996. == Safety == In US and EU, the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of neotame for humans is 0.3 and 2 mg per kg of bodyweight (mg/kg bw), respectively. NOAEL for humans is 200 mg/kg bw per day within EU. Estimated possible daily intakes from foods are well below ADI levels. Ingested neotame can form phenylalanine, but in normal use of neotame, this is not significant to those with phenylketonuria. It also has no adverse effects in type 2 diabetics. It is not considered to be carcinogenic or mutagenic. The Center for Science in the Public Interest has ranked neotame as safe. == Sweetness == Water solutions of neotame that are equivalent in sweetness to sucrose water solutions increase logarithmically in relative sweetness as the sucrose concentration of a comparably sweet sucrose solution increases until a plateau is reached. Maximum sweetness is reached at neotame solution concentrations that are relatively as sweet as a water solution that is 15.1 percentage sucrose by weight, i.e., at 15.1 sucrose equivalence % (SE%). For comparison, acesulfame K, cyclamate and saccharin reach their maximum sweetness at 11.6 SE%, 11.3 SE% and 9 SE%, respectively. Neotame is a high-potency sweetener, and it is 7,000 to 13,000 times sweeter than table sugar. Neotame contains flavor-enhancing properties, and compared to sucrose or aspartame, it has a relatively lower cost per sweetness factor. == Chemistry == === Structure === Neotame is formally a secondary amine of 3,3-dimethylbutanal and aspartame. The latter is a dipeptide of phenylalanine and aspartic acid. Neotame has 2 stereocenters and 4 stereoisomers. Sweetness is due to the (2S),(3S)-stereoisomer. === Spectroscopy === Neotame NMR spectroscopy identifies its structure with a peak at 0.84 ppm indicating the three methyl groups on the carbon chain bonded to the nitrogen. === Synthesis === Neotame is synthesized from aspartame through a reductive alkylation with 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde in a palladium catalyst with methanol. The stereochemistry of aspartame is conserved during the synthesis and therefore, neotame and aspartame have the same stereochemistry. (2S),(3S)-stereoisomer of aspartame is needed to synthesize the (2S),(3S)-stereoisomer of neotame. === Properties and reactivity === Neotame has similar stability as aspartame, but has greater stability especially in heated and dairy foods. Increased temperature, moisture or pH increase losses, and are the main relevant properties of a food when considering the stability of neotame. For example, about 90% of original neotame remains after 8 weeks of storage in pH 3.2 beverages. Neotame is especially stable as a dry powder at room temperature and humidity even if mixed with glucose or maltodextrin, and is relatively inert in foods with reducing sugars like fructose. Unlike aspartame, neotame doesn't form diketopiperazines via intra-molecular cyclization due to its N-alkyl substitution with 3,3-dimethylbutyl. This increases its heat stability. Over 1000 g of neotame dissolves in 1 kg of ethanol at 15 °C. At 15 °C the solubility of neotame is 10.6 g/kg in water and 43.6 g/kg in ethyl acetate. At 25 °C the solubilities are 12.6 g/kg and 77.0 g/kg, respectively. At 40 °C the solubilities are 18.0 g/kg and 238 g/kg, respectively. At 50 °C the solubilities are 25.2 g/kg and 872 g/kg, respectively. Neotame is acidic and its 0.5 wt% solution has a pH of 5.80. === Manufacture === Industrially neotame is made from 3,3-dimethylbutanal and aspartame via reductive amination. They are dissolved in methanol, palladium on carbon catalyst is added, air is replaced with hydrogen and the reaction is carried out in room temperature under pressure for a few hours. Catalyst is filtered out. This can be aided with diatomaceous earth. Methanol is distilled followed by addition of water. The mixture is cooled for a few hours, neotame is isolated via centrifugation, washed with water and vacuum dried. Neotame is milled to suitable size. == Metabolism == In humans and many other animals like dogs, rats and rabbits, neotame is rapidly but incompletely absorbed. Its metabolites are not retained or concentrated in specific tissues. In humans at oral doses of about 0.25 mg per kg of bodyweight (mg/kg bw), about 34% is absorbed into blood. Pharmacokinetics of oral doses of 0.1–0.5 mg/kg bw are somewhat linear, and at such doses, maximum neotame concentration in blood plasma is reached after about 0.5 hours with a half-life of about 0.75 hours. In blood and in body in general, non-specific esterases degrade neotame to de-esterified neotame and methanol, which is the main metabolic pathway in humans. De-esterified neotame has a plasma half-life of about 2 hours, and is the main metabolite in plasma. In humans, over 80% of the original oral dose is excreted in feces and urine within 48 hours and the rest later. About 64% of the original dose is excreted in feces mostly as metabolites. Major metabolite in feces is the de-esterified neotame. Over 1% of the original dose is excreted in feces as N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-aspartyl - L - phenylalanine. Over 1% is excreted in urine as carnitine conjugate of 3,3-dimethylbutyric acid. Other minor metabolites form. The major metabolic pathway leads to N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-aspartyl - L - phenylalanine with a side product of methanol, and the minor pathway happens when the N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-aspartyl - L - phenylalanine is oxidized into 3,3-dimethylbutyric acid. The side products for the minor pathway is methanol, aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Methanol from neotame metabolism is insignificant at regulated levels used in foods and in comparison to methanol naturally found in foods. == Patent == The patent covering the neotame molecule in the US, 5,480,668, was originally set to expire 7 November 2012, but was extended for 973 days by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The patent expired on 8 July 2015. == References == == External links == Media related to Neotame at Wikimedia Commons Official neotame website",Neotame,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.2520383298397064), (' INDUSTR', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0007975496700964868), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.5759625434875488), ('ĠINDU', -0.007927384227514267), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.2159273865108844e-05), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009298768127337098)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotame,https://foodadditives.net/artificial-sweeteners/neotame/,https://www.hfpappexternal.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/index.cfm?id=NEOTAME&set=FoodSubstances ', [])"

It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body.

1784,"('Sultiame', 'Ospolot', 'Sultiam', 'Sulphenyltame', 'Sulthiamine')",Medical,"Sultiame (or sulthiame) is a sulfonamide and inhibitor of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. It is used as an anticonvulsant and in recent studies showed promise in reducing sleep disordered breathing and other symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). == History == Sultiame was first synthesised in the laboratories of Bayer AG in the mid-1950s and eventually launched as Ospolot in Europe and other markets the early 1960s. It never became a registered drug in the United States. The brand was transferred to Desitin GmbH in 1993 and is sold in several European countries, in Israel, Japan, and Australia. Sultiame became established as a second-line drug for treatment of partial epilepsy in the 1960s and 1970s and was often used in combination with the established anticonvulsant phenytoin. Temporal lobe seizures appeared particularly responsive to sultiame. Doubts subsequently arose as to whether sultiame has intrinsic anticonvulsant properties. After discovering sultiame's ability to raise the blood levels of phenytoin, it was assumed that sultiame would only act in combination with phenytoin. This finding, together with the equivocal results of a study in the US, resulted in a quick decline of sultiame's use. It was only in 1988, that the German child neurologist Hermann Doose discovered its specific effects in benign focal epilepsies of childhood. Today, sulthiame is the drug of choice for benign focal epilepsies of childhood (such as benign rolandic epilepsy) in the German-speaking countries and Israel. == Indications == Historically, sultiame has been used to treat partial seizures. In Australia, it is currently registered for behavioural disorders associated with epilepsy; hyperkinetic behaviour; temporal lobe epilepsy; myoclonic seizures; grand mal attacks; and Jacksonian seizures. In contrast to other sulfonamide drugs, sultiame is devoid of antibacterial activity. Latest research is evaluating sultiamine for sleep apnea with early positive results. == Adverse effects == The more common adverse effects are ataxia, paraesthesia of face and limbs, hyperpnoea, dyspnoea, and anorexia. Less common adverse effects include giddiness, rash, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, nausea, weight loss, leukopenia, headache, depression, drooling, increased pain, insomnia, status epilepticus. Disturbances in calcium and vitamin D metabolism have been occasionally reported after long-term use. == Interactions == Sultiame taken together with primidone may lead to severe side-effects, including psychotic reactions. The addition of sulthiame to phenytoin therapy has shown to be followed by a rise in the serum levels of phenytoin. Sultiame may also lead to a rise of phenobarbitone blood levels. Alcohol must not be consumed during treatment. == Overdose == Vomiting, hypotension, headache, vertigo, ataxia, metabolic acidosis with hyperpnoea and catatonic state may occur. There is no specific antidote. It is not known whether dialysis may help in case of overdose. == Synthesis == Sulfanilamide can be reacted with ω-chlorobutylsulfonyl chloride and aqueous sodium carbonate to form the presumed intermediate (middle), which spontaneously cyclizes to give the drug. == References ==",Ospolot,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00016890530241653323), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007549058645963669)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([galinos.gr](https://www.galinos.gr/web/drugs/main/drugs/ospolot?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Γαληνός - Φάρμακο - OSPOLOT', type='url_citation', url='https://www.galinos.gr/web/drugs/main/drugs/ospolot?utm_source=openai')])"
