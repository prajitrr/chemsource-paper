DPA is primarily used to designate two isomers, all-cis-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-docosapentaenoic acid) and all-cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosapentaenoic acid). They are also commonly termed n-6 DPA and n-3 DPA, respectively; these designations describe the position of the double bond being 6 or 3 carbons closest to the (omega) carbon at the methyl end of the molecule and is based on the biologically important difference that n-6 and n-3 PUFA are separate PUFA classes, i.e. the omega-6 fatty acids and omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. Mammals, including humans, can not interconvert these two classes and therefore must obtain dietary essential PUFA fatty acids from both classes in order to maintain normal health (see essential fatty acids). == Isomers == The two isomers osbond acid and clupanodonic acid have the same number of double bonds, but on different positions along the chain, so they are regioisomers. === all-cis-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acid (osbond acid) === n-6 DPA is an ω-6 fatty acid with the trivial name osbond acid. It is formed in two steps from eicosatetraenoic acid (5,8,11,14-20:4n-6 or arachidonic acid, AA). Arachidonic acid is elongated to docosatetraenoic acid (7,10,13,16-22:4n-6 or adrenic acid, AdA), which in turn is converted by Δ4-desaturase to osbond acid. === all-cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid (clupanodonic acid) === n-3 DPA is an n-3 fatty acid with the trivial name clupanodonic acid. It is an intermediate compound between eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 5,8,11,14,17-20:5n-3 or timnodonic acid) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 4,7,10,13,16,19-22:6n-3 or cervonic acid) in the metabolic pathway of DHA in eucaryotes. Eicosapentaenoic acid is elongated to clupanodonic acid, which in turn is converted by Δ4-desaturase to docosahexaenoic acid 22:6n-3 (see Docosahexaenoic acid § Biosynthesis). Mammalian cells, including human cells, metabolize DPAn-3 to an array of products that are members of the specialized proresolving mediators class of PUFA metabolites. These metabolites include four resolvins of T series and three of D series (RvT1, RvT2, RvT3, RvT4, RvD1n-3, RvD2n-3, and RvD5n-3 (do not confuse with D series resolvins derived from DHA); see Specialized proresolving mediators § n-3 DPA-derived resolvins and Resolvin), two protectins (PD1n-3 and PD2n-3; see Specialized proresolving mediators § n-3 DPA-derived protectins/neuroprotectins and Neuroprotectin), and three maresins (MaR1n-3, MaR2n-3, and MaR3n-3; see Specialized proresolving mediators § n-3 DPA-derived maresins and Maresin). == Nutrition == Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) is an n-3 fatty acid that is structurally similar to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with the same number of double bonds, but two more carbon chain units. Dietary sources These are the top five sources for DPA according to the USDA Agricultural Research Service: Fish oil, menhaden 0.668 g in 1 tbsp. (13.6 g) Fish oil, salmon 0.407 g in 1 tbsp.

3767,"('Ginsenoside rg1', 'Panaxoside a', 'Panaxoside rg1', 'Sanchinoside c1', 'Ginsenoside a2')",Medical," Ginseng has been used in China as a superior medicinal material for thousands of years that can nourish the five internal organs, calm the mind and benefit wisdom. Due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective activities, one of the active components of ginseng, ginsenoside Rg1, has been extensively investigated in the remedy of brain disorders, especially dementia and depression. In this review, we summarized the research progress on the action mechanisms of Rg1 ameliorating depression-like behaviors, including inhibition of hyperfunction of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, regulation of synaptic plasticity and gut flora. Rg1 may alleviate Alzheimer's disease in the early phase, as well as in the middle-late phases through repairing dendrite, axon and microglia- and astrocyte-related inflammations. We also proposed that Rg1 could regulate memory state (the imbalance of working and aversive memory) caused by distinct stimuli. These laboratory studies would further the clinical trials on Rg1. From the prospective of drug development, we discussed the limitations of the present investigations and proposed our ideas to increase permeability and bioavailability of Rg1. Taken together, Rg1 has the potential to treat neuropsychiatric disorders, but a future in-depth investigation of the mechanisms is still required. In addition, drug development will benefit from the clinical trials in one specific neuropsychiatric disorder. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disorder in the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we examined the pharmacological effects of ginsenoside Rg1, a natural compound with low bioavailability, on the acute experimental colitis mice induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and explored underlying mechanisms. Acute UC was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 2.5% DSS for 7 days, meanwhile, 2 mg/10 g b.w. ginsenoside Rg1 was administrated to treat the mice. Body weight, colon length, colon tissue pathology, and colon tissue inflammatory cytokines were assessed. The composition structure of gut microbiota was profiled using 16s rRNA sequencing. Global metabolomic profiling of the feces was performed, and tryptophan and its metabolites in the serum were detected. The results showed that Rg1 significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colonic injury and colonic inflammation. In addition, Rg1 also partly reversed the imbalance of gut microbiota composition caused by DSS. Rg1 intervention can regulate various metabolic pathways of gut microbiota such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis and vitamin B6 metabolism and the most prominent metabolic alteration was tryptophan metabolism. DSS decreased the levels of tryptophan metabolites in the serum, including indole-3-carboxaldehyde, indole-3-lactic acid, 3-indolepropionic acid, and niacinamide and Rg1 can increase the levels of these metabolites. In conclusion, the study discovered that Rg1 can protect the intestinal barrier and alleviate colon inflammation in UC mice, and the underlying mechanism is closely related to the regulation of gut microbiota composition and microbial tryptophan metabolism. Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD) causes high mortality in seriously ill patients. Ginsenoside Rg1 has been proven to have effective anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties. However, the specific role of Rg1 in SIMD and the molecular mechanism remain unclear. Hence, we aimed to investigate the latent effects of ginsenoside Rg1 against SIMD and explore its underlying mechanisms. Male C57BL/6J mice and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were used as in vivo and in vitro models, respectively. Western blot analysis was used to detect the level of protein expression, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was conducted to determine the messenger RNA expression of inflammatory factors. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assay and flow cytometry were used to determine the apoptosis rate. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function. The results showed that Rg1 improved cardiac function and attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis and inflammation in mice. In addition, in NRCMs, Rg1 downregulated the expression of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines and reversed the increased expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3). In addition, treatment with TLR4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), a p-NF-κB inhibitor, or NLRP3 siRNA suppressed LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation. In conclusion, Rg1 can attenuate LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis both in NRCMs and septic mice and restore impaired cardiac function. Moreover, Rg1 may exert its effect via blocking the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway.",Ginsenoside rg1,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.011133896186947823), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.018158959224820137), (' FOOD', -5.080963092041202e-06)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.09798957407474518), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), (',', -0.03806275874376297), ('ĠFOOD', -0.08034112304449081), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20153583586215973)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.00861456897109747), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginsenoside ', [])"

LY2523355 was given on days 1, 2, and 3 every 3 weeks at one of three dose levels: 2, 4, and 5 mg/m²/day. Toxicity was assessed according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0, and tumor response according to RECIST version 1.1. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used only for grade 4 neutropenia or grade 3 febrile neutropenia. Twelve patients were treated at doses of 2 (n = 3), 4 (n = 3), and 5 (n = 6) mg/m²/day. Most frequent treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia and leukopenia (100 %). Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 83 %, but all recovered to above 500 neutrophils/μl within 7 days. All patients at 4 and 5 mg/m²/day required G-CSF support. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported up to 5 mg/m²/day. In PK analysis, LY2523355 exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner. The PK parameters for LY2523355 were similar to those observed in Western populations. No objective tumor responses were observed. The recommended dose of LY2523355 with therapeutic G-CSF use for further studies was determined to be 5 mg/m²/day in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors.

Two concurrent dose-escalation studies investigated litronesib across the dose range of 0.125-16 mg/m One hundred and seventeen patients with advanced malignancies were enrolled. Neutropenia was the primary dose-limiting toxicity. Prophylactic pegfilgrastim reduced neutropenia frequency and severity, allowing administration of higher litronesib doses, but increases in the incidences of mucositis and stomatitis were observed.

Chiral instability has been observed at pH 6 and above with the rate of racemization increasing with pH. A positively charged trigonal intermediate is inferred from the fact that p-methoxy substituent on the phenyl accelerated racemization, whereas a p-trifluoromethyl substituent had the opposite effect. Racemization is proposed to occur through a relay mechanism involving intramolecular deprotonation of the sulfonamide by the side chain amino group and attack of the sulfonamide anion on C5, cleaving the C5S bond, to form an aziridine; heterolytic dissociation of the aziridine yields an ylide. This pathway is supported by (1) a crystal structure providing evidence for a hydrogen bond between the sulfonamide NH and the amino group, (2) effects of substituents on the rate of racemization, and (3) computational studies. This racemization mechanism results from neighboring group effects in this densely functionalized molecule. Of particular novelty is the involvement of the side-chain secondary amino group, which overcomes the weak acidity of the sulfonamide by anchimeric assistance.",Litronesib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00033558503491804004), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012712739408016205), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008665931411087513)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu](https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/107949/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=101, start_index=9, title='API | litronesib', type='url_citation', url='https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/107949/?utm_source=openai')])"

3772,"('Diatrizoic acid', 'Diatrizoate', 'Amidotrizoic acid', 'Amidotrizoate', 'Urogranoic acid')",Medical,"Diatrizoate, also known as amidotrizoate, Gastrografin, is a contrast agent used during X-ray imaging. This includes visualizing veins, the urinary system, spleen, and joints, as well as computer tomography (CT scan). It is given by mouth, injection into a vein, injection into the bladder, through a nasogastric tube, or rectally. Relatively common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, and skin redness. Other side effects include itchiness, kidney problems, low blood pressure, and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people who have an iodine allergy. Diatrizoate is an iodinated ionic radiocontrast agent with high osmolality. Diatrizoate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1954. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Diatrizoic acid may be used as an alternative to barium sulfate for medical imaging of the gastrointestinal tract, such as upper gastrointestinal series and small bowel series. It is indicated for use in patients who are allergic to barium, or in cases where the barium might leak into the abdominal cavity. It does not coat the stomach/bowel lining as well as barium, so it is not used commonly for this purpose. It is also used to treat Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworms). Diatrizoate may not actually kill Ascaris, but instead it promotes shifting of fluid in the bowel lumen due to its osmotic properties, so may relieve intestinal obstruction caused by impacted Ascaris. Diatrizoate is used in suspected intestinal perforation, meconium ileus, and to identify bowel-lumen communication. It should not be used to investigate tracheo-oesophageal fistula because it can cause pulmonary oedema when aspirated into respiratory system. Diatrizoate can dislodge sticky meconium by drawing water into intestines. Diatrizoate is minimally absorbed from the intestines and excreted into urinary bladder. Because of its high osmolarity it can draw water from the surrounding tissues into the intestines, thus cause dehydration in people with already small plasma volume such as infants. Because of the additives and flavouring agents, diatrizoate formulated as Gastrografin must not be used intravascularly, though other formulations of diatrizoate are indicated for intravascular use. This chemical must be kept away from sunlight during storage. === Administration === It is given orally on computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis as 30 ml solution with 3% concentration to visualise the bowel lumen and any communications with the bowel lumen. In principle, diatrizoic acid is administered by the route most appropriate and sensible to image the structure/-s of interest (e.g., IV for blood vessels through which it is distributed and kidney–ureters–bladder that excrete it; orally or per rectally as an enema for the gastrointestinal tract). It is given orally or by enema to image the gastrointestinal tract. It is given by Foley catheter to image the urinary tract. == Contraindications == A history of sensitivity to iodine is not a contraindication to using diatrizoate, although it suggests caution in use of the agent. In this case, a regimen of oral or intravenous corticosteroids may be given as prophylaxis, or an alternative such as barium sulfate may be preferable. Gastrografin is contraindicated to use along with certain medications that can cause lactic acidosis, such as metformin. Concurrent use may lead to kidney failure and lactic acidosis, and a clinician may need to space the agents apart over a number of days to prevent an interaction. Gastrografin is a hypertonic solution, and therefore it should be avoided in imaging studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract in patients who are at risk of aspiration, as it will cause prompt pulmonary edema if accidentally introduced into the tracheobronchial tree. Urografin is not to be used for myelography, ventriculography or cisternography, since it is likely to provoke neurotoxic symptoms in these examinations. == Chemistry == Diatrizoate is considered a high-osmolality contrast agent. Its osmolality ranges from approximately 1500 mOsm/kg (50% solution) to over 2000 mOsm/kg (76% solution). === Synthesis === 3,5-Dinitrobenzoic acid is reduced to 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid using Raney nickel or palladium on carbon. This is then reacted with potassium iodochloride or iodine monochloride to produce 3,5-diamino-2,4,6-triidobenzoic acid, which is finally acylated using acetic anhydride and acidified with sulfuric acid to produce diatrizoate. Another synthesis pathway iodates 3,5-diacetamidobenzoic acid using iodine monochloride. == Brand names == Brand names include Hypaque, Gastrografin, MD-Gastroview, Iothalmate, and Urografin.

It is a more specific inhibitor to MMP-2 and MMP-9 (in vitro) than to MMP-1, and may therefore lack the musculoskeletal side effects seen with non-specific inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of S-3304 when administered as single and multiple oral doses to healthy male volunteers. 48 male volunteers received single oral doses ranging from 10 - 800 mg S-3304 or placebo under fasting conditions. At the 200 mg dose level, effects of high-fat diets were studied in a crossover design. In the multiple dose design, 24 male subjects were administered 200 mg, 400 mg or 800 mg S-3304 or placebo b.i.d. after meals for 10 - 17 days. Studies were conducted in a randomized double-blind fashion. Safety assessment was conducted based on blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, electrocardiogram and physical examination. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for S-3304 and its metabolites. All subjects were enrolled in the studies after obtaining informed consent. Adverse events reported after single dose administration of S-3304 or placebo were all of mild severity. Adverse events reported in the multiple dose treatment with S-3304 or placebo were mostly of mild severity, except for two episodes of moderate headache and two episodes of moderate myalgia. Most commonly reported adverse events in the multiple treatments with S-3304 were headache and somnolence. No clinically significant changes were observed in the clinical laboratory tests, except for reversible elevation of alanine aminotransferase of one subject at 800 mg S-3304 b.i.d. In the single dose administration, Cmax and mean AUC0-infinity linearly increased up to 63,167 ng/ml and 311,960 ng x h/ml at the 800 mg dose level, respectively; tmax and t1/2 ranged from 2 - 3 hours and from 9.5 - 15.5 hours, respectively. High-fat diets reduced Cmax from 21,565 ng/ml to 14,095 ng/ml but did not alter AUC0-infinity. Hydroxylated metabolites were detected in plasma in concentrations less than 1% of S-3304. Less than 1% S-3304 was excreted in urine. The AUC of one dosing interval and Cmax did not change after multiple doses but t1/2 increased from 9.5 - 10.0 hours to 12.5 - 13.5 hours. The 6beta-hydroxycortisol/ cortisol ratio was not changed after multiple doses suggesting no effect on CYP3A4 activity. S-3304 demonstrated a good safety profile and good systemic exposure when administered orally up to 800 mg b.i.d. during 10 - 17 days. At the highest dose level of 800 mg b.i.d., it was free of rheumatoid arthritis-like symptoms. To investigate the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics of S-3304 in healthy volunteers treated with high doses of S-3304 for 28 days. Thirty-two healthy volunteers were recruited. Four male and four female subjects were allocated to one of four doses (800 mg, 1600 mg, 2400 mg and 3200 mg). At each dose six volunteers took active medication and two volunteers took placebo in a double-blind fashion. Volunteers took a single dose on days 1 and 28 for pharmacokinetic purposes, and took twice daily doses from day 3-27. The pharmacokinetics of S-3304 and its hydroxy metabolites were evaluated. Tolerance was based on subjective adverse events, clinical examination, vital signs, ECG and laboratory tests including haematology and biochemistry profiles using CTC grading. Doses up to 2400 mg twice daily were generally well tolerated. At 3200 mg twice daily, five volunteers including one randomized to placebo were withdrawn from treatment mainly due to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation. C(max) of S-3304 on day 1, whose geometric mean and 95% confidence interval were 66.3 microg ml(-1) (48.8, 90.0) for 800 mg, 82.6 microg ml(-1) (69.3, 98.6) for 1600 mg, 89.5 microg ml(-1) (79.5, 100.7) for 2400 mg, and 110.5 microg ml(-1) (88.9, 137.7) for 3200 mg, respectively, was correlated with the log-transformed peak ALT (P < 0.0001 for male and P = 0.048 for female volunteers). In healthy volunteers the maximum tolerated dose of S-3304 was 2400 mg twice daily. ALT elevation was the most frequent dose-limiting factor and was correlated with C(max) on day 1. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) play a fundamental role in cancer development and progression. S-3304 is a potent, orally active, noncytotoxic inhibitor of MMPs, primarily MMP-2 and MMP-9, that prolongs survival in mice xenografts and is well tolerated in healthy volunteers. The aims of this phase I clinical trial were to determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, pharmacokinetic profile, and intratumoral MMP inhibitory activity of single-agent S-3304 in advanced and refractory solid tumors. MMP activity was determined by film in situ zymography (FIZ). Patients had tumor biopsies before and after S-3304 administration and were also evaluated for response and survival. Four dose levels were explored [DL1-DL4 or 800, 1,600, 2,400, and 3200 mg twice daily (BID), respectively], and 32 patients were enrolled. Toxicities were mostly gastrointestinal. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, but dose escalations beyond DL4 were impractical (number of capsules needed). S-3304 steady-state concentrations were reached by day 8, and day 1 mean C(max) and AUC(0-8) increases were less than dose proportional. After S-3304 administration, 17 of 18 patients experienced inhibition of MMP activity by FIZ. Strong mean inhibition of MMP activity was observed in DL1 to DL3. The negative mean inhibitory activity calculated for DL4 was due to one patient with a 397% MMP activity increase. S-3304 is safe, well tolerated, and achieves plasma concentrations above those required to inhibit MMP-2 and MMP-9. Its intratumoral MMP inhibitory activity has been shown using FIZ, which is useful as a biomarker with this and other MMP inhibitors.",S 3304,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0011703446507453918), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.018709726631641388), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062004365026950836)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/s-3304.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=6, title='S-3304 | sulfonamide analogue | CAS# 203640-27-1 | InvivoChem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/s-3304.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Using a cell-based luciferase reporter of SNCA expression we performed a quantitative high-throughput screen of 155,885 compounds and identified A-443654, an inhibitor of the multiple functional kinase AKT, as a potent inhibitor of SNCA. HEK-293 cells with CAG repeat expanded ATXN2 (ATXN2-Q58 cells) have increased levels of α-synuclein. We found that A-443654 normalized levels of both SNCA mRNA and α-synuclein monomers and oligomers in ATXN2-Q58 cells. A-443654 also normalized levels of α-synuclein in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from a patient carrying a triplication of the SNCA gene. Analysis of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress markers showed that A-443654 successfully prevented α-synuclein toxicity and restored cell function in ATXN2-Q58 cells, normalizing the levels of mTOR, LC3-II, p62, STAU1, BiP, and CHOP. A-443654 also decreased the expression of DCLK1, an inhibitor of α-synuclein lysosomal degradation. Our study identifies A-443654 and AKT inhibition as a potential strategy for reducing SNCA expression and treating Parkinson's disease pathology. Both Akt and Aurora A kinase have been shown to be important targets for intervention for cancer therapy. We report here that Compound A (A-443654), a specific Akt inhibitor, interferes with mitotic progression and bipolar spindle formation. Compound A induces G(2)/M accumulation, defects in centrosome separation, and formation of either monopolar arrays or disorganized spindles. On the basis of gene expression array studies, we identified Aurora A as one of the genes regulated transcriptionally by Akt inhibitors including Compound A. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, either by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or by Compound A, dramatically inhibits the promoter activity of Aurora A, whereas the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor has little effect, suggesting that Akt might be responsible for up-regulating Aurora A for mitotic progression. Further analysis of the Aurora A promoter region indicates that the Ets element but not the Sp1 element is required for Compound A-sensitive transcriptional control of Aurora A. Overexpression of Aurora A in cells treated with Compound A attenuates the mitotic arrest and the defects in bipolar spindle formation induced by Akt inhibition. Our studies suggest that that Akt may promote mitotic progression through the transcriptional regulation of Aurora A. Rapamycin, a natural product inhibitor of the Raptor-mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC1), is known to induce Protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) Ser-473 phosphorylation in a subset of human cancer cell lines through inactivation of S6K1, stabilization of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, and increased signaling through the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) axis. We report that A-443654, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of Akt serine/threonine kinases, induces Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation in all human cancer cell lines tested, including PTEN- and TSC2-deficient lines. This phenomenon is dose-dependent, manifests coincident with Akt inhibition and likely represents an alternative, rapid-feedback pathway that can be functionally dissociated from mTORC1 inhibition. Experiments performed in TSC2-/- cells indicate that TSC2 and IRS-1 cooperate with, but are dispensable for, A-443654-mediated Akt phosphorylation. This feedback event does require PI3K activity, however, as it can be inhibited by LY294002 or wortmannin. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of mTOR or Rictor, components of the rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2 complex, but not the mTORC1 component Raptor, also inhibited Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation induced by A-443654. Our data thus indicate that Akt phosphorylation and activity are coupled in a manner not previously appreciated and provide a novel mode of Akt regulation that is distinct from the previously described rapamycin-induced IRS-1 stabilization mechanism.",A 443654,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.001932205050252378), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5760356783866882), (' INDUSTR', -2.069664333248511e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.08374585211277008), ('ICAL', -1.0609570381348021e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5759614706039429)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([probes-drugs.org](https://www.probes-drugs.org/compound/PD004813/?utm_source=openai), [drugs.ncats.io](https://drugs.ncats.io/substance/Q4UG565ZYH?utm_source=openai), [guidetopharmacology.org](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=8204&utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=296, start_index=6, title='A-443654 (PD004813, YWTBGJGMTBHQTM-IBGZPJMESA-N)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.probes-drugs.org/compound/PD004813/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=296, start_index=6, title='A-443654', type='url_citation', url='https://drugs.ncats.io/substance/Q4UG565ZYH?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=296, start_index=6, title='A-443654 | Ligand page | IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY', type='url_citation', url='https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=8204&utm_source=openai')])"

The chemical works by interfering with the transmission of stimuli in the insect nervous system. Specifically, it causes a blockage of the nicotinergic neuronal pathway. By blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, imidacloprid prevents acetylcholine from transmitting impulses between nerves, resulting in the insect's paralysis and eventual death. It is effective on contact and via stomach action. Because imidacloprid binds much more strongly to insect neuron receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, this insecticide is more toxic to insects than to mammals. From 1999 through at least 2018, imidacloprid was the most widely used insecticide in the world. Although it is now off patent, the primary manufacturer of this chemical is Bayer CropScience (part of Bayer AG). It is sold under many names for many uses; it can be applied by soil injection, tree injection, application to the skin of the plant, broadcast foliar, or ground application as a granular or liquid formulation, or as a pesticide-coated seed treatment. Imidacloprid is widely used for pest control in agriculture. Other uses include application to foundations to prevent termite damage, pest control for gardens and turf, treatment of domestic pets to control fleas, protection of trees from boring insects, and in preservative treatment of some types of lumber products. A 2018 review by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that most uses of neonicotinoid pesticides such as Imidacloprid represent a risk to wild bees and honeybees. In 2022 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concluded that Imidacloprid is likely to adversely affect 79 percent of federally listed endangered or threatened species and 83 percent of critical habitats. The pesticide has been banned for all outdoor use in the entire European Union since 2018, but has a partial approval in the United States and some other countries. It still remains in widespread use in other major parts of the world. == Use == Imidacloprid is one of the most widely used insecticide in the world. Its major uses include: Seed treatment – Imidacloprid is a popular seed treatment insecticide in the world Agriculture – Control of aphids, cane beetles, thrips, stink bugs, locusts, and a variety of other insects that damage crops Arboriculture – Control of the emerald ash borer, hemlock woolly adelgid, and other insects that attack trees (including hemlock, maple, oak, and birch) Home Protection – Control of termites, carpenter ants, cockroaches, and moisture-loving insects Domestic animals – Control of fleas (applied to the back of the neck) Turf – Control of Japanese beetle larvae (exp. Grubs) Gardening – Control of aphids and other pests When used on plants, imidacloprid, which is systemic, is slowly taken up by plant roots and slowly translocated up the plant via xylem tissue. === Application to trees === When used on trees, it can take 30–60 days to reach the top (depending on the size and height) and enter the leaves in high enough quantities to be effective. Imidacloprid can be found in the trunk, the branches, the twigs, the leaves, the leaflets, and the seeds. Many trees are wind pollinated. But others such as fruit trees, linden, catalpa, and black locust trees are bee and wind pollinated and imidacloprid would likely be found in the flowers in small quantities. Higher doses must be used to control boring insects than other types. === Use in the United States === The estimated annual use of the compound in US agriculture is mapped by the US Geological Service and shows an increasing trend from its introduction in 1994 to 2014 when it reached 2,000,000 pounds (910,000 kg). However, use from 2015 to 2019 dropped following concerns about the effect of neonicotinoid chemicals on pollinating insects. In May 2019, the Environmental Protection Agency revoked approval for a number of products containing imidacloprid as part of a legal settlement, although some formulations continue to be available. == History == On January 21, 1986, a patent was filed and granted on May 3, 1988, for imidacloprid in the United States (U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,060) by Nihon Tokushu Noyaku Seizo K.K. of Tokyo, Japan. On March 25, 1992, Miles, Inc. (later Bayer CropScience) applied for registration of imidacloprid for turfgrass and ornamentals in the United States. On March 10, 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved the registration of imidacloprid. On January 26, 2005, the Federal Register noted the establishment of the '(Pesticide Tolerances for) Emergency Exemptions' for imidacloprid. Its use was granted to Hawaii (for the) use (of) this pesticide on bananas(,) and the States of Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota to use (of) this pesticide on sunflower(s). === Registrations === Imidacloprid is sold under several brand names, including Confidor (Bayer CropScience India), Marathon (OHP, US). == Biochemistry == Imidacloprid is a systemic insecticide, belonging to the class of chloronicotinyl neonicotinoid insecticides. It works by interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses in insects by binding irreversibly to specific insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is in IRAC group 4A. As a systemic pesticide, imidacloprid translocates or moves easily in the xylem of plants from the soil into the leaves, fruit, pollen, and nectar of a plant. Imidacloprid also exhibits excellent translaminar movement in plants and can penetrate the leaf cuticle and move readily into leaf tissue. Since imidacloprid is effective at very low levels (nanogram and picogram), it can be applied at much lower concentrations (e.g., 0.05–0.125 lb/acre or 55–140 g/ha) than other insecticides. The availability of imidacloprid and its favorable toxicity package as compared to other insecticides on the market in the 1990s allowed the EPA to replace more toxic insecticides including the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, the organophosphorus compounds, and methylcarbamates. == Toxicology == Based on laboratory rat studies, imidacloprid is rated as ""moderately toxic"" on an acute oral basis to mammals and low toxicity on a dermal basis by the World Health Organization and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (class II or III, requiring a ""Warning"" or ""Caution"" label). It is rated as an ""unlikely"" carcinogen and as weakly mutagenic by the U.S. EPA (group E). It is not listed for reproductive or developmental toxicity, but is listed on EPA's Tier 1 Screening Order for chemicals to be tested under the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). Tolerances for imidacloprid residues in food range from 0.02 mg/kg in eggs to 3.0 mg/kg in hops. === Mammals === Imidacloprid and its nitrosoimine metabolite (WAK 3839) have been well studied in rats, mice and dogs. In dogs the LD50 is 450 mg/kg of body weight (i.e., in any sample of medium-sized dogs weighing 13 kilograms (29 lb), half of them would be killed after consuming 5,850 mg of imidacloprid, or about 1⁄5th of an ounce). The acute inhalation LD50 in rats was not reached at the greatest attainable concentrations, 69 milligrams per cubic meter of air as an aerosol, and 5,323 mg a.i./m3 of air as dust. In mammals, the primary effects following acute high-dose oral exposure to imidacloprid are mortality, transient cholinergic effects (dizziness, apathy, locomotor effects, labored breathing) and transient growth retardation. Exposure to high doses may be associated with degenerative changes in the testes, thymus, bone marrow and pancreas. Cardiovascular and hematological effects have also been observed at higher doses. The primary effects of longer term, lower-dose exposure to imidacloprid are on the liver, thyroid, and body weight (reduction). Low- to mid-dose oral exposures have been associated with reproductive toxicity, developmental retardation and neurobehavioral deficits in rats and rabbits. Imidacloprid is neither carcinogenic in laboratory animals nor mutagenic in standard laboratory assays. It is not irritating to eyes or skin in rabbits and guinea pigs. In humans, similar effects are expected. Primary effects following acute oral ingestion include emesis, diaphoresis, drowsiness and disorientation. === Bees === Imidacloprid is acutely toxic to honeybees: its LD50 ranges from 5 to 70 nanograms per bee. Honeybee colonies vary in their ability to metabolize toxins, which explains this wide range. Imidacloprid is more toxic to bees than the organophosphate dimethoate (oral LD50 152 ng/bee) or the pyrethroid cypermethrin (oral LD50 160 ng/bee). The toxicity of imidacloprid to bees differs from most insecticides in that it is more toxic orally than by contact. The contact acute LD50 is 0.024 μg active ingredient per bee. In laboratory studies, sublethal levels of imidacloprid have been shown to impair navigation, foraging behavior, feeding behavior, and olfactory learning performance in honeybees (Apis mellifera). In general, however, despite the fact that many laboratory studies have shown the potential for neonicotinoid toxicity, the majority of field studies have found only limited or no effects on honeybees. In bumblebees, exposure to 10 ppb imidacloprid reduces natural foraging behaviour, increases worker mortality and leads to reduced brood development. The probable mechanism is that the mevalonate pathway is substantially downregulated by the chronic imidacloprid exposure, which can help to explain the imidacloprid impairment of the cognitive functions. === Birds === Imidacloprid is considered acutely toxic to birds, and to cause avian reproductive toxicity. In bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), imidacloprid was determined to be moderately toxic with an 14-day LD50 of 152 mg a.i./kg. It was slightly toxic in a 5-day dietary study with an acute oral LC50 of 1,420 mg a.i./kg diet, a NOAEC of < 69 mg a.i./kg diet, and a LOAEC = 69 mg a.i./kg diet. Exposed birds exhibited ataxia, wing drop, opisthotonos, immobility, hyperactivity, fluid-filled crops and intestines, and discolored livers. In a reproductive toxicity study with bobwhite quail, the NOAEC = 120 mg a.i./kg diet and the LOAEC = 240 mg a.i./kg diet. Eggshell thinning and decreased adult weight were observed at 240 mg a.i./kg diet. Imidacloprid is highly toxic to four bird species: Japanese quail, house sparrow, canary, and pigeon. The acute oral LD50 for Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix) is 31 mg a.i./kg bw with a NOAEL = 3.1 mg a.i./kg. The acute oral LD50 for house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is 41 mg a.i./kg bw with a NOAEL = 3 mg a.i./kg and a NOAEL = 6 mg a.i./kg. The LD50s for pigeon (Columba livia) and canary (Serinus canaria) are 25–50 mg a.i./kg. Mallard ducks are more resistant to the effects of imidacloprid with a 5-day dietary LC50 of > 4,797 ppm. The NOAEC for body weight and feed consumption is 69 mg a.i./kg diet. Reproductive studies with mallard ducks showed eggshell thinning at 240 mg a.i./kg diet. According to the European Food Safety Authority, imidacloprid poses a potential high acute risk for both herbivorous and insectivorous birds. Chronic risk has not been well established. A 2014 observational study conducted in the Netherlands correlated declines in some bird populations with environmental imidacloprid residues, although it stopped short of concluding that the association was causal. === Aquatic life === Imidacloprid is highly toxic on an acute basis to aquatic invertebrates, with EC50 values = 0.037 - 0.115 ppm. It is also highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates on a chronic basis (effects on growth and movement): NOAEC/LOAEC = 1.8/3.6 ppm in daphnids; NOAEC = 0.001 in Chironomus midge, and NOAEC/LOAEC = 0.00006/0.0013 ppm in mysid shrimp. Its toxicity to fish is relatively low; however, the EPA has requested review of secondary effects on fish with food chains that include sensitive aquatic invertebrates. Research published in 2018 demonstrated accumulation of imidacloprid in the blood of rainbow trout, contradicting claims from Bayer that persistence (bioaccumulation) does not occur with imidacloprid. === Plant life === Imidacloprid has been shown to turn off some genes that some rice varieties use to produce defensive chemicals. While imidacloprid is used for control of the brown planthopper and other rice pests, there is evidence that imidacloprid actually increases the susceptibility of the rice plant to planthopper infestation and attacks. Imidacloprid has been shown to increase the rate of photosynthesis in upland cotton at temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit). == Environmental fate == The main routes of dissipation of imidacloprid in the environment are aqueous photolysis (half-life = 1–4 hours) and plant uptake. The major photometabolites include imidacloprid desnitro, imidacloprid olefine, imidacloprid urea, and five minor metabolites. The end product of photodegradation is 6-chloronicotinic acid (6-CNA) and ultimately carbon dioxide. Since imidacloprid has a low vapor pressure, it normally does not volatilize readily. Although imidacloprid breaks down rapidly in water in the presence of light, it remains persistent in water in the absence of light. It has a water solubility of .61 g/L, which is relatively high. In the dark, at pH between 5 and 7, it breaks down very slowly, and at pH 9, the half-life is about 1 year. In soil under aerobic conditions, imidacloprid is persistent with a half-life of the order of 1–3 years. On the soil surface, the half-life is 39 days. Major soil metabolites include imidacloprid nitrosimine, imidacloprid desnitro and imidacloprid urea, which ultimately degrade to 6-chloronicotinic acid, CO2, and bound residues. 6-Chloronicotinic acid is recently shown to be mineralized via a nicotinic acid (vitamin B3) pathway in a soil bacterium. In soil, imidacloprid strongly binds to organic matter. When not exposed to light, imidacloprid breaks down slowly in water, and thus has the potential to persist in groundwater for extended periods. However, in a survey of groundwater in areas of the United States which had been treated with imidacloprid for the emerald ash borer, imidacloprid was usually not detected. When detected, it was present at very low levels, mostly at concentrations less than 1 part per billion (ppb) with a maximum of 7 ppb, which are below levels of concern for human health. The detections have generally occurred in areas with porous rocky or sandy soils with little organic matter, where the risk of leaching is high — and/or where the water table was close to the surface. Based on its high water solubility (0.5-0.6 g/L) and persistence, both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency in Canada consider imidacloprid to have a high potential to run off into surface water and to leach into ground water and thus warn not to apply it in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow. According to standards set by the environmental ministry of Canada, if used correctly (at recommended rates, without irrigation, and when heavy rainfall is not predicted), imidacloprid does not characteristically leach into the deeper soil layers despite its high water solubility (Rouchaud et al. 1994; Tomlin 2000; Krohn and Hellpointner 2002). In a series of field trials conducted by Rouchaud et al. (1994, 1996), in which imidacloprid was applied to sugar beet plots, it was consistently demonstrated that no detectable leaching of imidacloprid to the 10–20 cm soil layer occurred. Imidacloprid was applied to a corn field in Minnesota, and no imidacloprid residues were found in sample column segments below the 0–15.2 cm depth segment (Rice et al. 1991, as reviewed in Mulye 1995). However, a 2012 water monitoring study by the state of California, performed by collecting agricultural runoff during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011, found imidacloprid in 89% of samples, with levels ranging from 0.1 to 3.2 μg/L. 19% of the samples exceeded the EPA threshold for chronic toxicity for aquatic invertebrates of 1.05 μg/L. The authors also point out that Canadian and European guidelines are much lower (0.23 μg/L and 0.067 μg/L, respectively) and were exceeded in 73% and 88% of the samples, respectively. The authors concluded that ""imidacloprid commonly moves offsite and contaminates surface waters at concentrations that could harm aquatic invertebrates"". == Regulation == === European Union === In the mid to late 1990s, French beekeepers reported a significant loss of bees, which they attributed to the use of imidacloprid. In 1999, the French Minister of Agriculture suspended the use of imidacloprid on sunflower seeds and appointed a team of expert scientists to examine the impact of imidacloprid on bees. In 2003, this panel issued a report which concluded that imidacloprid posed a significant risk to bees. In 2004, the French Minister of Agriculture suspended the use of imidacloprid as a seed treatment for sunflowers and maize (corn). Certain imidacloprid seed treatments were also temporarily banned in Italy, following preliminary monitoring studies that identified correlations between bee losses and the use of neonicotinoid pesticides. In January 2013, a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report concluded that neonicotinoids posed an unacceptably high risk to bees: ""A high acute risk to honey bees was identified from exposure via dust drift for the seed treatment uses in maize, oilseed rape and cereals. A high acute risk was also identified from exposure via residues in nectar and/or pollen."" The EFSA also identified a number of gaps in the scientific evidence and were unable to finalize risk assessments for some uses authorized in the European Union (EU). Following the report, EU member states voted to restrict the use of the three main neonics, including imidacloprid, for seed treatment, soil application (granules) and foliar treatment in crops attractive to bees. In February 2018, the European Food Safety Authority published a further report concluding that neonicotinoids posed a serious danger to bees. In April 2018, the member states of the EU decided to ban the neonicotinoids for all outdoor uses. === United States === On July 1, 2022, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States banned commercial sales of imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids – acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam – to the general public for all outdoor uses. Licensed dealers will be able to sell only to pesticide-licensed and certified individuals. The states of Maryland, Connecticut and Vermont also restrict use of neonicotinoid pesticides. == See also == Insecticide Neonicotinoid Pesticide toxicity to bees == References == == External links == Gervais, J.A.; Luukinen, B.; Buhl, K.; Stone, D.

3778,"('Isosorbide mononitrate', 'Isosorbide-5-mononitrate', 'Isosorbide 5-mononitrate', 'Imdur', 'Monosorbitrate')",Medical,"Isosorbide mononitrate, sold under many brand names, is a medication used for heart-related chest pain (angina), heart failure and esophageal spasms. It can be used both to treat and to prevent heart-related chest pain; however, it is generally less preferred than beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, low blood pressure with standing, blurry vision, and skin flushing. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure especially if also exposed to PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil. Use is not recommended in pregnancy. It is believed to work by relaxing smooth muscle within blood vessels. It was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1981. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, isosorbide was the 119th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Isosorbide mononitrate is a nitrate-class drug used for the prevention of angina pectoris. The sublingual patch has an onset of five minutes and a duration of action of one hour. The oral, slow release tablet has an onset of thirty minutes, and a duration of 8 hours. == Adverse effects == The following adverse effects have been reported in studies with isosorbide mononitrate: Very common: Headache predominates (up to 30%) necessitating withdrawal of 2 to 3% of patients, but the incidence reduces rapidly as treatment continues. Common: Tiredness, sleep disturbances (6%) and gastrointestinal disturbances (6%) have been reported during clinical trials with isosorbide mononitrate modified-release tablets, but at a frequency no greater than for placebo. Hypotension (4 to 5%), poor appetite (2.5%), nausea (1%) Adverse effects associated with the clinical use of the drug are as expected with all nitrate preparations. They occur mainly in the early stages of treatment. Hypotension (4%) with symptoms such as dizziness and nausea (1%) have been reported. In general, these symptoms disappear during long-term treatment. Other reactions that have been reported with isosorbide mononitrate-modified release tablets include tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhoea, vertigo, and heartburn. == Interactions == Sildenafil (Viagra). Concomitant administration of isosorbide mononitrate and sildenafil (Viagra) or other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Tadalafil and Udenafil) can potentiate the vasodilatory effect of isosorbide mononitrate with the potential result of serious side-effects such as syncope or myocardial infarction. Life-threatening hypotension may also occur. Therefore, sildenafil should not be given to patients already receiving isosorbide mononitrate therapy. Sulfhydryl-containing compounds. The metabolism of organic nitrates to nitric oxide is dependent on the presence of sulfhydryl groups in the muscle. The combination of oral N-acetylcysteine and a single dose of sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg significantly prolonged the total exercise time in patients with angina pectoris and angiographically proven significant coronary artery disease, when compared with isosorbide mononitrate alone. Concomitant administration of other exogenous sources of sulfhydryl groups such as methionine and captopril may produce a similar interaction. Phenylalkylamine calcium antagonists. The addition of a calcium channel blocker of the verapamil type, such as gallopamil 75 mg, has been shown to further improve left ventricular functional parameters when given in combination with isosorbide mononitrate in a sustained-release formulation. Propranolol. The addition of isosorbide mononitrate to propranolol treatment in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension caused a marked fall in portal pressure, a reduction in hepatic blood flow, cardiac output and mean arterial blood pressure, but no additional change in azygos blood flow. The additional effect of isosorbide mononitrate was especially evident in patients whose portal pressure was not reduced by propranolol. Calcium antagonists (general). Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium antagonists and organic nitrates were used in combination. Dose adjustments of either class of agent may be necessary. == Brand names == It is sold in the US by Lannett Company, under the brand name Monoket, and was also sold in the US under the name Imdur, and marketed in the UK under the trade names: Isotard, Monosorb, Chemydur. In India, this drug is available under the brand names of Ismo, Imdur, Isonorm, Monotrate, Solotrate, and Monit. In Russia it is occasionally used under the brand names Monocinque and Pektrol.

It is used for standard endotracheal intubation, as well as for rapid sequence induction (RSI). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Rocuronium bromide is a competitive antagonist for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Of the neuromuscular-blocking drugs it is considered to be a non-depolarizing neuromuscular junction blocker, because it acts by dampening the receptor action causing muscle relaxation, instead of continual depolarisation which is the mechanism of action of the depolarizing neuromuscular junction blockers, like succinylcholine. It was designed to be a weaker antagonist at the neuromuscular junction than pancuronium; hence its monoquaternary structure and its having an allyl group and a pyrrolidine group attached to the D ring quaternary nitrogen atom. Rocuronium has a rapid onset and intermediate duration of action. There is considered to be a risk of allergic reaction to the drug in some patients (particularly those with asthma), but a similar incidence of allergic reactions has been observed by using other members of the same drug class (non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs). The γ-cyclodextrin derivative sugammadex (trade name Bridion) is an agent to reverse the action of rocuronium by binding to it with high affinity. Sugammadex has been in use since 2009 in many European countries; however, it was turned down for approval twice by the US FDA due to concerns over allergic reactions and bleeding, but finally approved the medication for use during surgical procedures in the United States on December 15, 2015. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine can also be used as a reversal agent of rocuronium but is not as effective as sugammadex. Neostigmine is often still used due to its low cost compared with sugammadex. == History == It was introduced in 1994. == Society and culture == === Executions === On July 27, 2012, the U.S. state of Virginia replaced pancuronium bromide, one of the three drugs used in execution by lethal injection, with rocuronium bromide. On October 3, 2016, the U.S. state of Ohio announced that it would resume executions on January 12, 2017, using a combination of midazolam, rocuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio was in January 2014. On August 24, 2017, the U.S. state of Florida executed Mark James Asay using a combination of etomidate, rocuronium bromide, and potassium acetate. === Euthanasia === Since 2016, rocuronium bromide has been the standard drug, along with propofol, administered to patients for euthanasia in Canada. === Brand names === Rocuronium bromide is marketed under the brand name Zemuron in the United States and Esmeron in most other countries. == References ==",Rocuronium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00016234986833296716), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005266957450658083)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/rocuronium-intravenous-route/description/drg-20137750?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=145, start_index=9, title='Rocuronium (intravenous route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/rocuronium-intravenous-route/description/drg-20137750?utm_source=openai')])"

It can also be used to help with endotracheal intubation but suxamethonium (succinylcholine) is generally preferred if this needs to be done quickly. It is given by injection into a vein. Effects are greatest at about 4 minutes and last for up to an hour. Common side effects include flushing of the skin and low blood pressure. Serious side effects may include allergic reactions; however, it has not been associated with malignant hyperthermia. Prolonged paralysis may occur in people with conditions like myasthenia gravis. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Atracurium is in the neuromuscular-blocker family of medications and is of the non-depolarizing type. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on skeletal muscles. Atracurium was approved for medical use in the United States in 1983. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Atracurium is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Atracurium is a medication used in addition to other medications in to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. It can be used to help with endotracheal intubation but takes up to 2.5 minutes to result in appropriate intubating conditions. === Duration of action === Neuromuscular-blocking agents can be classified in accordance to their duration of pharmacological action, defined as follows: == Side effects == === Cardiovascular === The tetrahydroisoquinolinium class of neuromuscular blocking agents, in general, is associated with histamine release upon rapid administration of a bolus intravenous injection. There are some exceptions to this rule; cisatracurium (Nimbex), for example, is one such agent that does not elicit histamine release even up to 5×ED95 doses. The liberation of histamine is a dose-dependent phenomenon such that, with increasing doses administered at the same rate, there is a greater propensity for eliciting histamine release and its ensuing sequelae. Most commonly, the histamine release following administration of these agents is associated with observable cutaneous flushing (facial face and arms, commonly), hypotension and a consequent reflex tachycardia. These sequelae are very transient effects: the total duration of the cardiovascular effects is no more than one to two minutes, while the facial flush may take around 3–4 minutes to dissipate. Because these effects are so transient, there is no reason to administer adjunctive therapy to ameliorate either the cutaneous or the cardiovascular effects. === Bronchospasm === Bronchospasm has been reported on occasion with the use of atracurium. However, this particular undesirable effect does not appear to be observed nearly as often as that seen with rapacuronium, which led to the latter's withdrawal of approval for clinical use worldwide. The issue of bronchospasm acquired prominence in the neuromuscular-blocking agents arena after the withdrawal from clinical use of rapacuronium (Raplon - a steroidal neuromuscular-blocking agent marketed by Organon) in 2001 after several serious events of bronchospasm, including five unexplained fatalities, following its administration. Bronchospasm was not an unknown phenomenon prior to rapacuronium: occasional reports of bronchospasm have been noted also with the prototypical agents, tubocurarine and succinylcholine, as well as alcuronium, pancuronium, vecuronium, and gallamine. === Seizures === Seizures rarely occur. Because atracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination as a primary route of chemodegradation, one of the major metabolites from this process is laudanosine, a tertiary amino alkaloid reported to be a modest CNS stimulant with epileptogenic activity and cardiovascular effects such a hypotension and bradycardia. As part of the then fierce marketing battle between the competing pharmaceutical companies (Burroughs Wellcome Co. and Organon, Inc.) with their respective products, erroneous information was quickly and subtly disseminated very shortly after the clinical introduction of atracurium that the clinical use of atracurium was likely to result in a terrible tragedy because of the significant clinical hazard by way of frank seizures induced by the laudanosine by-product - the posited hypothesis being that the laudanosine produced from the chemodegradation of parent atracurium would cross the blood–brain barrier in sufficiently high enough concentrations that lead to epileptogenic foci. Fortunately, both for the public and for atracurium, rapid initial investigations irrefutably failed to find any overt or EEG evidence for a connection between atracurium administration and epileptogenic activity. Indeed, because laudanosine is cleared primarily via renal excretion, a cat study modelling anephric patients went so far as to corroborate that EEG changes, when observed, were evident only at plasma concentrations 8 to 10 times greater than those observed in humans during infusions of atracurium. Thus, the cat study predicted that, following atracurium administration in an anephric patient, laudanosine accumulation and related CNS or cardiovascular toxicity were unlikely - a prediction that correlated very well with a study in patients with kidney failure and undergoing cadaveric renal transplantation. Furthermore, almost a decade later, work by Cardone et al.. confirmed that, in fact, it is the steroidal neuromuscular-blocking agents pancuronium and vecuronium that, when introduced directly into the CNS, were likely to cause acute excitement and seizures, owing to accumulation of cytosolic calcium caused by activation of acetylcholine receptor ion channels. Unlike the two steroidal agents, neither atracurium nor laudanosine caused such accumulation of intracellular calcium. Just over two decades later with availability of atracurium, there is little doubt that laudanosine accumulation and related toxicity will likely never be seen with the doses of atracurium that are generally used. Laudanosine is also a metabolite of cisatracurium that, because of its identical structure to atracurium, undergoes chemodegradation via Hofmann elimination in vivo. Plasma concentrations of laudanosine generated are lower when cisatracurium is used. == Pharmacokinetics == Atracurium is susceptible to degradation by Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis as components of the in vivo metabolic processes. The initial in vitro studies appeared to indicate a major role for ester hydrolysis but, with accumulation of clinical data over time, the preponderance of evidence indicated that Hofmann elimination at physiological pH is the major degradation pathway vindicating the premise for the design of atracurium to undergo an organ-independent metabolism. Hofmann elimination is a temperature- and pH-dependent process, and therefore atracurium's rate of degradation in vivo is highly influenced by body pH and temperature: An increase in body pH favors the elimination process, whereas a decrease in temperature slows down the process. Otherwise, the breakdown process is unaffected by the level of plasma esterase activity, obesity, age, or by the status of renal or hepatic function. On the other hand, excretion of the metabolite, laudanosine, and, to a small extent, atracurium itself is dependent on hepatic and renal functions that tend to be less efficient in the elderly population. The pharmaceutical presentation is a mixture of all ten possible stereoisomers. Although there are four stereocentres, which could give 16 structures, there is a plane of symmetry running through the centre of the diester bridge, and so 6 meso structures (structures that can be superimposed by having the opposite configuration then 180° rotation) are formed. This reduces the number from sixteen to ten. There are three cis-cis isomers (an enantiomeric pair and a meso structure), four cis-trans isomers (two enantiomeric pairs), and three trans-trans isomers (an enantiomeric pair and a meso structure). The proportions of cis−cis, cis−trans, and trans−trans isomers are in the ratio of 10.5 :6.2 :1. [cis-cis isomers ≈ 58% cis-trans isomers ≈ 36% trans-trans isomers ≈ 6%]. One of the three cis-cis structures is marketed as a single-isomer preparation, cisatracurium (trade name Nimbex); it has the configuration 1R, 2R, 1′R, 2′R at the four stereocentres. The beta-blocking drug nebivolol has ten similar structures with 4 stereocentres and a plane of symmetry, but only two are presented in the pharmaceutical preparation. === Intramuscular function parameters === ED95: the dose of any given intramuscular-blocking agent required to produce 95% suppression of muscle twitch (e.g., the abductor pollicis) response with balanced anesthesia Clinical duration: difference in time between time of injection and time to 25% recovery from neuromuscular block Train-of-four (TOF) response: stimulated muscle twitch response in trains of four when stimuli are applied in a burst of four as opposed to a single stimulus, equal depression in depolarizing and fading response with non-depolarizing blocker. 25%-75% recovery index: an indicator of the rate of skeletal muscle recovery - essentially, the difference in time between the time to recovery to 25% and time to recovery to 75% of baseline value T4:T1 ≥ 0.7: a 70% ratio of the fourth twitch to the first twitch in a TOF - provides a measure of the recovery of neuromuscular function T4:T1 ≥ 0.9: a 90% ratio of the fourth twitch to the first twitch in a TOF - provides a measure of the full recovery of neuromuscular function == History == Atracurium besilate was first made in 1974 by George H. Dewar, a pharmacist and a medicinal chemistry doctoral candidate in John B. Stenlake's medicinal chemistry research group in the Department of Pharmacy at Strathclyde University, Scotland. Dewar first named this compound ""33A74"" before its eventual emergence in the clinic as atracurium. Atracurium was the culmination of a rational approach to drug design to produce the first non-depolarizing non-steroidal skeletal muscle relaxant that undergoes chemodegradation in vivo. The term chemodegradation was coined by Roger D. Waigh, Ph.D., also a pharmacist and a postdoctoral researcher in Stenlake's research group. Atracurium was licensed by Strathclyde University to the Wellcome Foundation UK, which developed the drug (then known as BW 33A) and its introduction to first human trials in 1979, and then eventually to its first introduction (as a mixture of all ten stereoisomers) into clinical anesthetic practice in the UK, in 1983, under the tradename of Tracrium. The premise to the design of atracurium and several of its congeners stemmed from the knowledge that a bis-quaternary structure is essential for neuromuscular-blocking activity: ideally, therefore, a chemical entity devoid of this bis-quaternary structure via susceptibility to inactive breakdown products by enzymic-independent processes would prove to be invaluable in the clinical use of a drug with a predictable onset and duration of action. Hofmann elimination provided precisely this basis: It is a chemical process in which a suitably activated quaternary ammonium compound can be degraded by the mildly alkaline conditions present at physiological pH and temperature. In effect, Hofmann elimination is a retro-Michael addition chemical process. It is important to note here that the physiological process of Hofmann elimination differs from the non-physiological Hofmann degradation process: the latter is a chemical reaction in which a quaternary ammonium hydroxide solid salt is heated to 100 °C, or an aqueous solution of the salt is boiled. Regardless of which Hofmann process is referenced, the end-products in both situations will be the same: an alkene and a tertiary amine. The approach to utilizing Hofmann elimination as a means to promoting biodegradation had its roots in much earlier observations that the quaternary alkaloid petaline (obtained from the Lebanese plant Leontice leontopetalum) readily underwent facile Hofmann elimination to a tertiary amine called leonticine upon passage through a basic (as opposed to an acidic) ion-exchange resin. Stenlake's research group advanced this concept by systematically synthesizing numerous quaternary ammonium β-aminoesters and β-aminoketones and evaluated them for skeletal muscle relaxant activity: one of these compounds, initially labelled as 33A74, eventually led to further clinical development, and came to be known as atracurium. Atracurium played a part in triggering the 2019 Samoa measles outbreak. == References == == External links == Neuromuscular+blocking+agents at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Atracurium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.847726889536716e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00034314466756768525)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00732?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Atracurium besylate: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00732?utm_source=openai')])"
3781,"('Cisatracurium (besylate)', 'Cisatracurium', 'Cisatracurium ion', ""(1r-cis,1'r-cis)-atracurium"", ""(1r,2r,1'r,2'r)-atracurium"")",Medical,"Cisatracurium besilate (INN; cisatracurium besylate (USAN); formerly recognized as 51W89; trade name Nimbex) is a bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinolinium that has effect as a non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drug, used adjunctively in anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. It shows intermediate duration of action. Cisatracurium is one of the ten isomers of the parent molecule, atracurium. Moreover, cisatracurium represents approximately 15% of the atracurium mixture. == History == The generic name cisatracurium was conceived by scientists at Burroughs Wellcome Co. (now part of GlaxoSmithKline) by combining the name ""atracurium"" with ""cis"" [hence cisatracurium] because the molecule is one of the three cis-cis isomers comprising the ten isomers of the parent, atracurium. Atracurium itself was invented at Strathclyde University and licensed to Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC, for further development and subsequent marketing as Tracrium. As the secondary pharmacology of atracurium was being developed, it became clear that the primary clinical disadvantage of atracurium was likely to be its propensity to elicit histamine release. To address this issue, a program was initiated to investigate the individual isomer constituents of atracurium to identify and isolate the isomer(s) associated with the undesirable histamine effects as well as identify the isomer that might possibly retain the desirable properties without the histamine release. Thus, in 1989, D A Hill and G L Turner, PhD (both chemists at Burroughs Wellcome Co., Dartford, UK) first synthesized cisatracurium as an individual isomer molecule. The pharmacological research of cisatracurium and the other individual isomers was then developed further primarily by R. Brandt Maehr and William B. Wastila, PhD (both of whom were pharmacologists within the Division of Pharmacology at Burroughs Wellcome Co.) in collaboration with John J. Savarese MD (who at the time was an anesthesiologist in the Dept. of Anesthesia, Harvard Medical School at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Thereafter, the entire clinical development of cisatracurium was completed in a record short period from 1992 to 1994: the team of scientists was led by J. Neal Weakly PhD, Martha M. Abou-Donia PhD, and Steve Quessy PhD, in the Division of Clinical Neurosciences at Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC. By the time of its approval for human use, in 1995, by the US Food and Drug Administration, Burroughs Wellcome Co. had merged with Glaxo Inc., and cisatracurium was approved to be marketed as Nimbex by GlaxoWellcome Inc. The trade name ""Nimbex"" was derived from inserting an ""i"" to the original proposal ""Nmbex,"" which stood for excellent Neuromuscular blocker. == Preclinical pharmacology == In vitro studies using human plasma indicated that cisatracurium spontaneously degrades at physiological pH via Hofmann elimination to yield laudanosine and the quaternary monoacrylate. Subsequent ester hydrolysis of the monoacrylate generates the monoquaternary alcohol, although the rate-limiting step is Hofmann elimination. In rat plasma, cisatracurium is also metabolized by non-specific carboxylesterases (a rate-limiting step) to the monoquaternary alcohol and the monoquaternary acid. == Clinical pharmacology == As is evident with the parent molecule, atracurium, cisatracurium is also susceptible to degradation by Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis as components of the in vivo metabolic processes. See the atracurium page for information on Hofmann elimination in vivo versus the Hofmann degradation chemical reaction. Because Hofmann elimination is a temperature- and plasma pH-dependent process, cisatracurium's rate of degradation in vivo is highly influenced by body pH and temperature just as it is with the parent molecule, atracurium: thus, an increase in body pH favors the elimination process, whereas a decrease in temperature slows down the process. One of the metabolites of cisatracurium via Hofmann elimination is laudanosine – see the atracurium page for further discussion of the issue regarding this metabolite. 80% of cisatracurium is metabolized eventually to laudanosine and 20% is metabolized hepatically or excreted renally. 10-15% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Since Hofmann elimination is an organ-independent chemodegradative mechanism, there is little or no risk to the use of cisatracurium in patients with liver or renal disease when compared with other neuromuscular-blocking agents. The two reverse ester linkages in the bridge between the two isoquinolinium groups make atracurium and cisatracurium poor targets for plasma cholinesterase, unlike mivacurium which has two conventional ester linkages. == Adverse effects == === Histamine release – hypotension, reflex tachycardia and cutaneous flush === === Bronchospasm – Pulmonary compliance === To date, cisatracurium has not been reported to elicit bronchospasm at doses that are clinically prescribed. === Laudanosine – Epileptic foci === Cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann elimination as a primary route of chemodegradation: consequently one of the metabolites from this process is laudanosine, a tertiary amino alkaloid reported to be a modest CNS stimulant with epileptogenic activity and cardiovascular effects such as low blood pressure and a slowed heart rate. As a tertiary amine, Laudanosine is unionised and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. Presently, there is little evidence that laudanosine accumulation and related toxicity will likely ever be seen with the doses of cisatracurium that are administered in clinical practice especially given that the plasma concentrations of laudanosine generated are lower with cisatracurium than those seen with atracurium. == Research == A recent study showed that cisatracurium pretreatment effectively decreases the incidence and severity of pain induced by propofol general anaesthesia. Another study showed that hiccups accompanied by vomiting, insomnia, shortness of breath can also be relieved by the nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, cisatracurium, during total intravenous anesthesia. == Synthesis == Treatment of 1,5-Pentanediol with 3-bromopropionyl chloride gives the corresponding ester; dehydrohalogenation of the ester with triethylamine then gives the bis-acrylate (2). Reaction of that unsaturated ester with tetrahydropapaverine (3) leads to conjugate addition of the secondary amine and formation of the intermediate (4). Alkylation with methyl benzenesulfonate forms the bis-quaternary salt, affording cisatracuronium (5). == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Cisatracurium besylate"".

3784,"('Squalene', 'Super squalene', 'Trans-squalene', 'Addavax', 'Spinacene')","Endogenous, Medical","Squalene is an organic compound. It is a triterpene with the formula C30H50. It is a colourless oil, although impure samples appear yellow. It was originally obtained from shark liver oil (hence its name, as Squalus is a genus of sharks). An estimated 12% of bodily squalene in humans is found in sebum. Squalene has a role in topical skin lubrication and protection. Most plants, fungi, and animals produce squalene as biochemical precursor in sterol biosynthesis, including cholesterol and steroid hormones in the human body. It is also an intermediate in the biosynthesis of hopanoids in many bacteria. Squalene is an important ingredient in some vaccine adjuvants: The Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline adjuvants are called MF59 and AS03, respectively. == Role in triterpenoid synthesis == Squalene is a biochemical precursor to both steroids and hopanoids. For sterols, the squalene conversion begins with oxidation (via squalene monooxygenase) of one of its terminal double bonds, resulting in 2,3-oxidosqualene. It then undergoes an enzyme-catalysed cyclisation to produce lanosterol, which can be elaborated into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol in a multistep process by the removal of three methyl groups, the reduction of one double bond by NADPH and the migration of the other double bond. In many plants, this is then converted into stigmasterol, while in many fungi, it is the precursor to ergosterol. The biosynthetic pathway is found in many bacteria, and most eukaryotes, though has not been found in Archaea. == Production == === Biosynthesis === Squalene is biosynthesised by coupling two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate. The condensation requires NADPH and the enzyme squalene synthase. Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. === Industry === Synthetic squalene is prepared commercially from geranylacetone. === Shark conservation === In 2020, conservationists raised concerns about the potential slaughter of sharks to obtain squalene for a COVID-19 vaccine. Environmental and other concerns over shark hunting have motivated its extraction from other sources. Biosynthetic processes use genetically engineered yeast or bacteria. == Uses == === As an adjuvant in vaccines === Immunologic adjuvants are substances, administered in conjunction with a vaccine, that stimulate the immune system and increase the response to the vaccine. Squalene is not itself an adjuvant, but it has been used in conjunction with surfactants in certain adjuvant formulations. An adjuvant using squalene is Seqirus' proprietary MF59, which is added to influenza vaccines to help stimulate the human body's immune response through production of CD4 memory cells. It is the first oil-in-water influenza vaccine adjuvant to be commercialised in combination with a seasonal influenza virus vaccine. It was developed in the 1990s by researchers at Ciba-Geigy and Chiron; both companies were subsequently acquired by Novartis. The Influenza vaccine business of Novartis was later acquired by CSL Bering and created the company Seqirus. It is present in the form of an emulsion and is added to make the vaccine more immunogenic. However, the mechanism of action remains unknown. MF59 is capable of switching on a number of genes that partially overlap with those activated by other adjuvants. How these changes are triggered is unclear; to date, no receptors responding to MF59 have been identified. One possibility is that MF59 affects the cell behaviour by changing the lipid metabolism, namely by inducing accumulation of neutral lipids within the target cells. An influenza vaccine called FLUAD which used MF59 as an adjuvant was approved for use in the US in people 65 years of age and older, beginning with the 2016–2017 flu season. A 2009 meta-analysis assessed data from 64 clinical trials of influenza vaccines with the squalene-containing adjuvant MF59 and compared them to the effects of vaccines with no adjuvant. The analysis reported that the adjuvated vaccines were associated with slightly lower risks of chronic diseases, but that neither type of vaccines altered the rate of autoimmune diseases; the authors concluded that their data ""supports the good safety profile associated with MF59-adjuvated influenza vaccines and suggests there may be a clinical benefit over non-MF59-containing vaccines"". == Safety == Toxicology studies indicate that in the concentrations used in cosmetics, squalene has low acute toxicity, and is not a significant contact allergen or irritant. The World Health Organization and the US Department of Defense have both published extensive reports that emphasise that squalene is naturally occurring, even in oils of human fingerprints. The WHO goes further to explain that squalene has been present in over 22 million flu vaccines given to patients in Europe since 1997 without significant vaccine-related adverse events. === Controversies === Attempts to link squalene to Gulf War syndrome have been debunked. == References == == External links == Squalene MS Spectrum",Squalene,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.011655640788376331), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.4376017153263092), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -2.7610454708337784e-05), (' MED', -0.08910774439573288), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5761622786521912), (' INDUSTR', -0.5759475231170654), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.5150205492973328), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -5.364403477869928e-06), ('ĠEND', -0.016224728897213936), ('OG', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.003184844274073839), ('ĠPERSON', -0.3715853691101074), ('AL', 0.0), ('ĠCARE', -2.9802276912960224e-06), (',', -0.3132701814174652), ('ĠFOOD', -0.03811221942305565), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0297715924680233)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -1.3544423381972592e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.01906544715166092), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,FOOD,PERSONAL CARE;https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Squalene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882744/,https://www.fda.gov/media/75798/download ', [])"

FLT3 and Aurora A kinases play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). KW-2449 could modulate immune cells, but the immunomodulatory effects of KW-2449 on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have not been investigated yet. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of KW-2449 on EAE mouse model. In this study, C57BL/6 EAE mice were orally treated with (10 mg/kg/day) KW-2449 solution and compared with EAE and control mice. Following the treatment, histological analyses were performed on the brain and cerebellum to evaluate the pathological score. The gene expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) were measured using qRT-PCR. The serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, CCL-2 and MMP-2 were determined by using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicated that the clinical score, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the demyelination in EAE mice treated with KW-2449 decreased significantly compared to control groups. KW-2449 also decreased TNF-α, IL-6, CCL-2 inflammatory cytokines, and MMP-2 in both brain mRNA expressions and serum levels of EAE mice. The KW-2449, aging as a multi-kinase inhibitor, modulates the inflammatory responses of cytokine cascades either in the brain or in plasma and reduces EAE pathogenesis manifestation. Cisplatin (cis-dichloro-diammine platinum, CDDP) is a well-known chemotherapeutic drug against a broad spectrum of human malignancies. However, the clinical utility of this effective chemotherapy agent is dose limited by its toxic side effects such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Necroptosis is a form of programmed necrotic cell death that is mediated by serine/threonine kinases, RIPK1 and RIPK3, together with MLKL. In this study, we identified that the multitargeted kinase inhibitor KW-2449 inhibited cisplatin-induced necroptosis, while potentiated cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Mechanistic studies indicated that KW-2449 directly inhibited RIPK1 kinase activity to block necroptosis. Oral administration of KW-2449 attenuated renal cell necrosis and reduced pro-inflammatory responses in mouse models of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Taken together, our study shows that KW-2449 is a novel necroptosis inhibitor by targeting RIPK1 kinase activity and has great clinic potential for the treatment of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. KW-2449 is a novel multitargeted kinase inhibitor that has been reported to alleviate chronic inflammation and altered immunity during the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of KW-2449 on sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC). A rat model of moderate SIC was induced using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) method. KW-2449 was administered to rats at 10 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days by intraperitoneal injection. At 24 hours after CLP, echocardiography, electrocardiogram, and hemodynamic analyses were performed. Blood and cardiac tissues were collected for further analysis. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses were used to identify the key genes affected by KW-2449 treatment during SIC. KW-2449 improved the liver dysfunction in septic rats. KW-2449 significantly improved left ventricular (LV) systolic function and hemodynamics compared to the CLP group. KW-2449 suppressed the systemic inflammatory response, decreased myocardial inflammation and cell apoptosis in the CLP rats. RNA-seq analyses indicated that there were a total of 2256 differentially expressed genes in the CLP group compared to the Control group, among which 63 genes were down-regulated and 59 genes were up-regulated by KW-2449. Specifically, Pparα was identified as a key target gene of KW-2449 in the treatment of SIC by RNA-seq analysis.KW-2449 also significantly upregulated the protein expression of Pparα in the LV tissue of septic rats. KW-2449 reduced systemic inflammation, cardiac inflammation, and improved cardiac dysfunction in the CLP-induced SIC rat model.

Herein, we report a fluorescence method for AQ4N detection through the modulation of the molecule-like photoinduced electron transfer (PET) behavior of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs). AQ4N can electrostatically bind to the surface of carboxylated chitosan (CC) and dithiothreitol (DTT) co-stabilized AuNCs and quench their fluorescence via a Coulomb interaction-accelerated PET process. Under optimized experimental conditions, the linear range of AQ4N is from 25 to 200 nM and the limit of detection is as low as 5 nM. In addition, this assay is confirmed to be reliable based on its successful use in AQ4N determination in mouse plasma samples. This work offers an effective strategy for AQ4N sensing based on fluorescent AuNCs and widens the application of AuNCs in clinical diagnosis and pharmaceutical analysis. Banoxantrone (AQ4N) is a prototype hypoxia selective cytotoxin that is activated by haem containing reductases such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In the present study, we evaluate whether elevated levels of iNOS in human tumour cells will improve their sensitivity to AQ4N.

We employed an expression vector containing the cDNA for human iNOS to transfect human fibrosarcoma HT1080 tumour cells. Alternatively, parental cells were exposed to a cytokine cocktail to induce iNOS gene expression and enzymatic activity. The cells were then treated with AQ4N alone and in combination with radiation in the presence or absence of the iNOS inhibitor N-methyl-L‑arginine. In parental cells, AQ4N showed little difference in toxicity under hypoxic verses normoxic conditions. Notably, cells with upregulated iNOS activity showed a significant increase in sensitivity to AQ4N, but only under conditions of reduced oxygenation. When these cells were exposed to the combination of AQ4N and radiation, there was much greater cell killing than that observed with either modality alone. In the clinical development of hypoxia selective cytotoxins it is likely they will be used in combination with radiotherapy. In the present study, we demonstrated that AQ4N can selectively kill hypoxic cells via an iNOS-dependent mechanism. This hypoxia-selective effect can be augmented by combining AQ4N with radiation without increasing cytotoxicity to well‑oxygenated tissues. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting hypoxic tumours with high levels of iNOS with a combination of AQ4N and radiotherapy could be a useful clinical therapeutic strategy.",Banoxantrone,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.007052054163068533), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01816670224070549)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([ashpublications.org](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/108/11/2429/128521/Banoxantrone-AQ4N-a-Tissue-Targeted-Prodrug?utm_source=openai), [go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB04975?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=229, start_index=6, title='Banoxantrone (AQ4N), a Tissue Targeted Prodrug: Results of a Phase 1 Study in Lymphomas. | Blood | American Society of Hematology', type='url_citation', url='https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/108/11/2429/128521/Banoxantrone-AQ4N-a-Tissue-Targeted-Prodrug?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=229, start_index=6, title='Banoxantrone: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB04975?utm_source=openai')])"

Moxidectin kills some of the most common internal and external parasites by selectively binding to a parasite's glutamate-gated chloride ion channels. These channels are vital to the function of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells; when moxidectin binds to the channels, it disrupts neurotransmission, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. == Medical uses == Moxidectin was approved for onchocerciasis (river-blindness) in 2018 for people over the age of 11 in the United States based on two studies. There is a need for additional trials, with long-term follow-up, to assess whether moxidectin is safe and effective for treatment of nematode infection in children and women of childbearing potential. Moxidectin is predicted to be helpful to achieve elimination goals of this disease. Dogs: Prevention of heartworm. In combination with imidacloprid to treat sarcoptic mange. Horses: Treatment of parasites including Strongylus vulgaris, and stomach bots such as Gasterophilus intestinalis. Cattle: Treatment of parasites such as the gastrointestinal nematode Ostertagia ostertagi, and the lungworm Dictyocaulus viviparus. Sheep: Treatment of the nematodes Teladorsagia circumcincta and Haemonchus contortus. Nematodes can develop cross-resistance between moxidectin and other similar parasiticides, such as ivermectin, doramectin and abamectin. The ways in which the parasites evolve resistance to this drug include mutations in glutamate-gated chloride channel genes, GABA-R genes, or increased expression of p-glycoprotein, which is a transmembrane drug efflux pump. Allele frequency changes corresponding to resistance to moxidectin and/or other macrocyclic lactone-class drugs have been observed in the glutamate-gated chloride channel α-subunit gene of Haemonchus contortus and Cooperia oncophora, as well as in the H. contortus genes coding for p-glycoprotein and the GABA-R gene. Moxidectin is being evaluated as a treatment to eradicate scabies in humans, especially when resistant to other treatments. == Adverse effects == Studies of moxidectin show the side effects vary by animal and may be affected by the product's formulation, application method and dosage.. It is however regarded as relatively safe. An overdose of moxidectin enhances the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. In horses, overdose may lead to depression, drooping of the lower lip, tremor, lack of coordination when moving (ataxia), decreased rate of breathing (respiratory rate), stupor and coma. If a dog licks moxidectin from the skin which was applied as a ""spot-on"" (topical) treatment, this has the same effect as an overdose, and may cause vomiting, salivation and neurological signs such as ataxia, tremor, and nystagmus. Some Collie dogs can tolerate moxidectin, but other individuals are sensitive and upon ingestion, experience vomiting, salivation or transient neurological signs. == Pharmacology == Moxidectin is very lipophilic, which causes it to have a high volume of distribution. Moxidectin concentrates in the animal's adipose tissue, from where it is released for up to two months following administration. In goats, the oral bioavailability of moxidectin is 2.7 times lower, and the half-life is 1.8 times shorter than in sheep. == Chemistry == Moxidectin, a macrocyclic lactone of the milbemycin class, is a semisynthetic derivative of nemadectin, which is a fermentation product of the bacterium Streptomyces cyanogriseus subsp. noncyanogenus. == History == In the late 1980s, an American Cyanamid Company agronomist discovered the Streptomyces bacteria from which moxidectin is derived in a soil sample from Australia. Two companies filed patents for moxidectin: Glaxo Group and the American Cyanamid Company; in 1988, all patents were transferred to American Cyanamid. In 1990, the first moxidectin product was sold in Argentina. For human use, moxidectin was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in June 2018 for the treatment of onchocerciasis in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. This is the first human approval worldwide. The license holder is the nonprofit biopharmaceutical company Medicines Development for Global Health. == References ==",Moxidectin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.1003151461482048), (' INDUSTR', -9.491498531133402e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006992755807004869), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1604691445827484)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/moxidectin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=9, title='Moxidectin: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/moxidectin.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Dal-GenE-2 (Dal-302), a phase III, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study, will evaluate the potential of dalcetrapib to reduce the occurrence of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) in approximately 2,000 patients with a documented recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and the AA genotype at variant rs1967309 in the ADCY9 gene. Based on a genetic discovery from a study called dal-OUTCOMES, that suggested patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome and a specific AA genotype in a gene called ADCY9 may gain a potential benefit for future cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, a study called Dal-GenE trial was performed by DalCor Pharmaceuticals to validate these observations. This specific AA genotype is carried by approximately 20% of the total population and up to 40% in people of African descent. Dal-GenE was a randomized placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of dalcetrapib versus placebo on cardiovascular risk in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome bearing this potentially protective AA genotype. Eligible patients were optimally treated for their cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension and elevated LDL cholesterol. The prespecified primary endpoint was time-to-first event for the composite of cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non- fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke. The results published in 2022 showed that dalcetrapib did not significantly reduce the risk of occurrence of the primary endpoint of ischaemic cardiovascular events at end of study in patients with an acute coronary syndrome within 1–3 months of randomization and the AA genotype at variant rs1967309 in the ADCY9 gene.However, the results of the dal-GenE trial showed a 21% relative risk reduction (RRR) in fatal and non-fatal MI in 6,149 patients across 34 countries, and a 45% RRR for the same endpoint in 1,200 patients in North America and further confirmed the safety profile of dalcetrapib. Dalcetrapib (INN, codenamed JTT-705) is a CETP inhibitor which was originally being developed by F. Hoffmann–La Roche until May 2012. DalCor Pharmaceuticals licensed dalcetrapib as a potential pioneering precision medicine for patients with cardiovascular disease. By combining genetic and clinical insights into the development program, dalcetrapib is intended to reduce fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) following a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and deliver superior cardiovascular outcome in a specific genetic subset of patients. A companion diagnostic test, developed in conjunction with Roche Diagnostics, identifies patients with the specific genotype, AA genotype at variant rs1967309 in the adenylate cyclase type 9 (ADCY9), who may potentially benefit from dalcetrapib treatment. The drug was initially aimed at raising the blood levels of HDL cholesterol. Prevailing observations indicate that high HDL-C levels correlate with better overall cardiovascular health, though it remains unclear whether pharmacologically raising HDL-C levels consequently leads to a benefit in cardiovascular health. F. Hoffmann-La Roche conducted the dal-OUTCOMES phase III trial which was halted in 2012 “due to a lack of clinically meaningful efficacy.” The results of dal-OUTCOMES were published in November 2012.Subsequently, a pharmacogenomic genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the Montreal Heart Institute reported that patients from the dal-OUTCOMES study bearing a protective allele, the AA genotype, at SNP rs1967309 in the ADCY9 gene may have benefited from dalcetrapib therapy. Changes in inflammation and cholesterol efflux capacity observed in these patients may in part explain the benefits associated with the protective genotype. These findings led to DalCor Pharmaceuticals conducting the dal-GenE and Dal-GenE-2 trials described above. == See also == CETP inhibitor == References ==",Dalcetrapib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.7610454708337784e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00012563870404846966), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003183774882927537)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22725099/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalcetrapib,https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/5b96c6fbdeca4e3081ceb53e1a6a4628 ', [])"
3791,"('Arachidonic acid', 'Immunocytophyt', 'Immunocytophyte', 'Vevodar', 'Arachidonate')","Food, Medical","Arachidonic acid (AA, sometimes ARA) is a polyunsaturated omega−6 fatty acid 20:4(ω−6), or 20:4(5,8,11,14). If its precursors or diet contains linoleic acid it is formed by biosynthesis and can be deposited in animal fats. It is a precursor in the formation of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes. Together with omega−3 fatty acids and other omega−6 fatty acids, arachidonic acid provides energy for body functions, contributes to cell membrane structure, and participates in the synthesis of eicosanoids, which have numerous roles in physiology as signaling molecules. Its name derives from the ancient Greek neologism arachis 'peanut', although peanut oil does not contain any arachidonic acid. Arachidonate is the name of the derived carboxylate anion (conjugate base of the acid), salts, and some esters. == Chemistry == In chemical structure, arachidonic acid is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and four cis-double bonds; the first double bond is located at the sixth carbon from the omega end. Some chemistry sources define 'arachidonic acid' to designate any of the eicosatetraenoic acids. However, almost all writings in biology, medicine, and nutrition limit the term to all cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. == Biology == Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid present in the phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositides) of membranes of the body's cells, and is abundant in the brain, muscles, and liver. Skeletal muscle is an especially active site of arachidonic acid retention, accounting for roughly 10–20% of the phospholipid fatty acid content typically. In addition to being involved in cellular signaling as a lipid second messenger involved in the regulation of signaling enzymes, such as PLC-γ, PLC-δ, and PKC-α, -β, and -γ isoforms, arachidonic acid is a key inflammatory intermediate and can also act as a vasodilator. (Note separate synthetic pathways, as described in section below.) == Biosynthesis and cascade in humans == Arachidonic acid is freed from phospholipid by hydrolysis, catalyzed by the phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Arachidonic acid for signaling purposes appears to be derived by the action of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2, 85 kDa), whereas inflammatory arachidonic acid is generated by the action of a low-molecular-weight secretory PLA2 (sPLA2, 14-18 kDa). Arachidonic acid is a precursor to a wide range of eicosanoids: The enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (i.e. prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and 2 [⁠PTGS1 and PTGS2]) convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin H2, which in turn may be converted to various prostaglandins, to prostacyclin, to thromboxanes, and to the 17-carbon product of thromboxane metabolism of prostaglandin G2/H2, 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT). The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase catalyzes the oxidation of arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which in turn converts to various leukotrienes (i.e., leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4) as well as to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) which may then be further metabolized to 5-HETE's more potent 5-keto analog, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) (also see 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). The enzymes 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15) and 15-lipoxygenase-2 (ALOX15B). ALOX15B catalyzes the oxidation of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), which may then be further converted to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and lipoxins; 15-Lipoxygenase-1 may also further metabolize 15-HPETE to eoxins in a pathway analogous to (and presumably using the same enzymes as used in) the pathway which metabolizes 5-HPETE to leukotrienes. The enzyme 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) catalyzes oxidation of arachidonic acid to 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE), which may then be metabolized to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and to hepoxilins. Arachidonic acid is also a precursor to anandamide. Some arachidonic acid is converted into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by epoxygenase. The production of these derivatives and their actions in the body are collectively known as the ""arachidonic acid cascade""; see Essential fatty acid interactions and the enzyme and metabolite linkages given in the previous paragraph for more details. === PLA2 activation === PLA2, in turn, is activated by ligand binding to receptors, including: 5-HT2 receptors mGLUR1 bFGF receptor IFN-α receptor IFN-γ receptor Furthermore, any agent increasing intracellular calcium may cause activation of some forms of PLA2. === PLC activation === Alternatively, arachidonic acid may be cleaved from phospholipids after phospholipase C (PLC) cleaves off the inositol trisphosphate group, yielding diacylglycerol (DAG), which subsequently is cleaved by DAG lipase to yield arachidonic acid. Receptors that activate this pathway include: A1 receptor D2 receptor α2 adrenergic receptor 5-HT1 receptor PLC may also be activated by MAP kinase. Activators of this pathway include PDGF and FGF. == In the body == === Cell membranes === Along with other omega−6 and omega−3 fatty acids, arachidonic acid contributes to the structure of cell membranes. When incorporated into phospholipids, the omega fatty acids affect cell membrane properties, such as permeability and the activity of enzymes and cell-signaling mechanisms. === Brain === Arachidonic acid, one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain, is present in similar quantities to docosahexaenoic acid, with the two accounting for about 20% of brain fatty-acid content. Arachidonic acid is involved in the early neurological development of infants. == Dietary supplement == Arachidonic acid is marketed as a dietary supplement. A 2019 review of clinical studies investigating the potential health effects of arachidonic acid supplementation of up to 1500 mg per day on human health found there were no clear benefits. There were no adverse effects in adults of using high daily doses (1500 mg) of arachidonic acid on several biomarkers of blood chemistry, immune function, and inflammation. A 2009 review indicated that consumption of 5−10% of food energy from omega−6 fatty acids including arachidonic acid may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases compared to lower intakes. A 2014 meta-analysis of possible associations between heart disease risk and individual fatty acids reported a significantly reduced risk of heart disease with higher levels of EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid. == See also == == References == == External links == Arachidonic+Acid at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Arachidonate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0029546432197093964), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.014166207052767277), (' FOOD', -1.8670179997570813e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.05798698589205742), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.0011755467858165503), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0015644703526049852), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2520219683647156)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; ', [])"

This pathway is upregulated in liver disease where the level of KP metabolites correlates with the severity of disease. Cirrhosis is associated with cardiac dysfunction, which manifests itself during severe physiological challenges such as liver transplantation. Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis is linked to systemic inflammation and impaired cardiac beta-adrenergic signaling pathways. The KP pathway is involved in modulation of cardiac signaling and is upregulated by systemic inflammation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of IDO inhibition on development of cardiac dysfunction in an experimental model of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). Experimental groups were given either 1-methyl tryptophan (1-MT, 1, 3, 9 mg/kg), or saline. 28 days after BDL, cardiac chronotropic response to epinephrine was assessed ex vivo. HPLC was employed to measure hepatic and cardiac levels of tryptophan, kynurenine and kynurenic acid. Cirrhosis in rats was associated with impaired cardiac chronotropic responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation. 1-MT dose-dependently improved cirrhosis-induced chronotropic dysfunction as well as elevated serum levels of CRP and IL-6 in BDL rats. Hepatic and cardiac kynurenine/tryptophan ratio were elevated in cirrhotic rats and were reduced following 1-MT administration. Chronic administration of 1-MT could also reduce hepatic inflammation, fibrosis and ductular proliferation. 1-MT attenuates cardiac dysfunction in rats with biliary cirrhosis. This protective effect is not limited to the cardiac function as liver histopathologic changes were also improved following chronic 1-MT administration. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has been identified as an important antimicrobial and immunoregulatory effector molecule essential for the establishment of tolerance by regulating local tryptophan (Trp) concentrations. On the other hand, the immunosuppressive capacity of IDO can have detrimental effects for the host as it can lead to deleterious alterations of the immune response by promoting tolerance to some types of tumors. To suppress this disadvantageous IDO effect, the competitive inhibitor 1-Methyl-Tryptophan (1-MT) is being tested in clinical trials. However, it remains inconclusive which stereoisomer of 1-MT is the more effective inhibitor of IDO-mediated immunosuppression. While IDO enzyme activity is more efficiently inhibited by 1-L-MT in cell-free or in vitro settings, 1-D-MT is superior to 1-L-MT in the enhancement of anti-tumor responses in vivo.Here, we present new data showing that commercially available 1-L-MT lots contain tryptophan in amounts sufficient to compensate for the IDO-mediated tryptophan depletion in vitro. The addition of 1-L-MT abrogated IDO-mediated antimicrobial effects and permitted the growth of the tryptophan-auxotroph microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus and Toxoplasma gondii. Consistent with this, the tryptophan within 1-L-MT lots was sufficient to antagonize IDO-mediated inhibition of T cell responses. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed not only tryptophan within 1-L-MT, but also the incorporation of this tryptophan in bacterial and human proteins that were generated in the presence of 1-L-MT in otherwise tryptophan-free conditions. In summary, these data reveal that tryptophan within 1-L-MT can affect the results of in vitro studies in an L-stereospecific and IDO-independent way.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a targetable metabolic checkpoint that, in preclinical models, inhibits anti-tumor immunity following chemotherapy. We conducted a phase I trial (NCT02502708) of the oral IDO-pathway inhibitor indoximod in children with recurrent brain tumors or newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Separate dose-finding arms were performed for indoximod in combination with oral temozolomide (200 mg/m2/day x 5 days in 28-day cycles), or with palliative conformal radiation. Blood samples were collected at baseline and monthly for single-cell RNA-sequencing with paired single-cell T cell receptor sequencing. Eighty-one patients were treated with indoximod-based combination therapy. Median follow-up was 52 months (range 39-77 months). Maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and the pediatric dose of indoximod was determined as 19.2 mg/kg/dose, twice daily. Median overall survival was 13.3 months (n = 68, range 0.2-62.7) for all patients with recurrent disease and 14.4 months (n = 13, range 4.7-29.7) for DIPG. The subset of n = 26 patients who showed evidence of objective response (even a partial or mixed response) had over 3-fold longer median OS (25.2 months, range 5.4-61.9, p = 0.006) compared to n = 37 nonresponders (7.3 months, range 0.2-62.7). Four patients remain free of active disease longer than 36 months. Single-cell sequencing confirmed emergence of new circulating CD8 T cell clonotypes with late effector phenotype. Indoximod was well tolerated and could be safely combined with chemotherapy and radiation. Encouraging preliminary evidence of efficacy supports advancing to Phase II/III trials for pediatric brain tumors. Indoximod has shaped our understanding of the biology of IDO1 in the control of immune responses, though its mechanism of action has been poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that indoximod creates a tryptophan (Trp) sufficiency signal that reactivates mTOR in the context of low Trp concentrations, thus opposing the effects caused by IDO1. Here we extend the understanding of indoximod's mechanism of action by showing that it has pleiotropic effects on immune regulation. Indoximod can have a direct effect on T cells, increasing their proliferation as a result of mTOR reactivation. Further, indoximod modulates the differentiation of CD4 Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) causes tumor immune suppression. The IDO1 pathway inhibitor indoximod combined with a taxane in patients with ERBB2-negative metastatic breast cancer was tested in a prospective clinical trial.

This phase 2 double-blinded randomized 1:1 placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled patients at multiple international centers from August 26, 2013, to January 25, 2016. Eligibility criteria included ERBB2-negative metastatic breast cancer, ability to receive taxane therapy, good performance status, normal organ function, no previous immunotherapy use, and no autoimmune disease. The study was discontinued in June 2017 because of lack of efficacy. Data analysis was performed from February 2019 to April 2020. A taxane (paclitaxel [80 mg/m2] weekly 3 weeks on, 1 week off, or docetaxel [75 mg/m2] every 3 weeks) plus placebo or indoximod (1200 mg) orally twice daily as first-line treatment. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points were median overall survival, objective response rate, and toxic effects. A sample size of 154 patients would detect a hazard ratio of 0.64 with 1-sided α = .1 and β = .2 after 95 events. Archival tumor tissue was stained with immunohistochemistry for IDO1 expression as an exploratory analysis. Of 209 patients enrolled, 169 were randomized and 164 were treated (85 in the indoximod arm; 79 in the placebo arm). The median (range) age was 58 (29-85) years; 166 (98.2%) were female, and 135 (79.9%) were White. The objective response rate was 40% and 37%, respectively (indoximod vs placebo) (P = .74). The median (range) follow-up time was 17.4 (0.1-39.4) months. The median PFS was 6.8 months (95% CI, 4.8-8.9) in the indoximod arm and 9.5 months (95% CI, 7.8-11.2) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.8). Differences between the experimental and placebo arms in median PFS (6.8 vs 9.5 months) and overall survival (19.5 vs 20.6 months) were not statistically significant. Grade 3 or greater treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 60% of patients in both arms. This randomized clinical trial found that, among patients with ERBB2-negative metastatic breast cancer, addition of indoximod to a taxane did not improve PFS compared with a taxane alone.

3795,"('Cephalexin', 'Cefalexin', 'Cephacillin', 'Keflex', 'Ceporexin')",Medical,"Cefalexin, also spelled cephalexin, is an antibiotic that can treat a number of bacterial infections. It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting the growth of the bacterial cell wall. Cefalexin is a β-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins. It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin, but can be taken by mouth. Cefalexin can treat certain bacterial infections, including those of the middle ear, bone and joint, skin, and urinary tract. It may also be used for certain types of pneumonia and strep throat and to prevent bacterial endocarditis. Cefalexin is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), most Enterococcus, or Pseudomonas. Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections, such as the flu, common cold or acute bronchitis. Cefalexin can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin. However, it is not recommended in those with severe penicillin allergies. Common side effects include stomach upset and diarrhea. Allergic reactions or infections with Clostridioides difficile, a cause of diarrhea, are also possible. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful to the fetus. It can be used in children and those over 65 years of age. Those with kidney problems may require a decrease in dose. Cefalexin was developed in 1967. It was first marketed in 1969 under the brand name Keflex. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 101st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. In Canada, it was the fifth most common antibiotic used in 2013. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == Cefalexin can treat a number of bacterial infections including otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, bone and joint infections, pneumonia, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections. It may be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis. It can also be used for the prevention of recurrent urinary-tract infections. Cefalexin does not treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Cefalexin is a useful alternative to penicillins in patients with penicillin intolerance. For example, penicillin is the treatment of choice for respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus, but cefalexin may be used as an alternative in penicillin-intolerant patients. Caution must be exercised when administering cephalosporin antibiotics to penicillin-sensitive patients, because cross-sensitivity with β-lactam antibiotics has been documented in up to 10% of patients with a documented penicillin allergy. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === It is categorized in category A in Australia meaning that no evidence of harm has been found after being taken by many pregnant women. Use during breastfeeding is generally safe. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects of cefalexin, like other oral cephalosporins, are gastrointestinal (stomach area) disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions. Gastrointestinal disturbances include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, the latter being the most common. Hypersensitivity reactions include skin rashes, urticaria, fever, and anaphylaxis. Pseudomembranous colitis and Clostridioides difficile have been reported with use of cefalexin. Less common and more serious side effects include bruising of the skin and yellowing of the skin or eye whites. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, trouble breathing, or red, blistered, swollen, or peeling skin. Overall, cefalexin allergy occurs in less than 0.1% of patients. Evidence suggests that it is seen in 1% to 10% of patients with a penicillin allergy. == Interactions == Like other β-lactam antibiotics, renal excretion of cefalexin is delayed by probenecid. It is also not recommended to take cefalexin with dofetilide, live Cholera vaccine, warfarin, and cholestyramine. Alcohol consumption reduces the rate at which it is absorbed. Cefalexin also interacts with metformin, an antidiabetic drug, and this can lead to higher concentrations of metformin in the body. Histamine H2 receptor antagonists like cimetidine and ranitidine may reduce the efficacy of cefalexin by delaying its absorption and altering its antimicrobial pharmacodynamics. Zinc and zinc supplements also interact with cefalexin and may reduce the amount of cefalexin in the body. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Cefalexin is a β-lactam antibiotic of the cephalosporin family. It is bactericidal and acts by inhibiting synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. As cefalexin closely resembles d-alanyl-d-alanine, an amino acid ending on the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, it can irreversibly bind to the active site of PBP, which is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. It is most active against gram-positive cocci, and has moderate activity against some gram-negative bacilli. However, some bacterial cells have the enzyme β-lactamase, which hydrolyzes the β-lactam ring, rendering the drug inactive. This contributes to antibacterial resistance towards cefalexin. === Pharmacokinetics === Cefalexin is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with oral administration. Absorption is slightly reduced when it is taken with food and the medication can be taken without regard for meals. Peak levels of cefalexin occur about 1 hour after administration. Maximal levels of cefalexin increase approximately linearly over a dose range of 250 to 1,000 mg. Like most other cephalosporins, cefalexin is not metabolized or otherwise inactivated in the body. The elimination half-life of cefalexin is approximately 30 to 60 minutes in people with normal renal function. Therapeutic levels of cefalexin with oral administration are maintained for 6 to 8 hours. More than 90% of cefalexin is excreted unchanged in the urine within 8 hours. == Society and culture == It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies cefalexin as highly important for human medicine. === Brand names === Cefalexin is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and the Australian Approved Name (AAN), while cephalexin is the British Approved Name (BAN) and the United States Adopted Name (USAN). Brand names for cefalexin include Keflex, Acfex, Cephalex, Ceporex, L-Xahl, Medoxine, Ospexin, Torlasporin, Bio-Cef, Panixine DisperDose, and Novo-Lexin. == Veterinary uses == === Dogs === According to Plumb's Veterinary Medication Guides, cefalexin can be used in treating skin, respiratory tract, and urinary tract infections. Specifically, it can treat pyoderma in dogs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved it for use in humans and dogs but not for other species. Like other drugs approved for human use, cefalexin may be prescribed by veterinarians for animals in certain situations. Cefalexin (Lexylan) is indicated for the treatment of cattle, dogs, and cats in the European Union. == References ==",Ceporexin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00485776225104928), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014235259033739567)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5759396553039551)])","('MEDICAL; ([ar.prvademecum.com](https://ar.prvademecum.com/medicamento/ceporexin-874/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=104, start_index=9, title='CEPOREXIN - Medicamento - PR Vademecum', type='url_citation', url='https://ar.prvademecum.com/medicamento/ceporexin-874/?utm_source=openai')])"
3796,"('Œ±-tocopherol acetate', 'Vitamin e acetate', 'Alpha-tocopherol acetate', 'Tocopherol acetate', 'Alpha-tocopheryl acetate')",Medical,"α-Tocopheryl acetate (alpha-tocopherol acetate), also known as vitamin E acetate, is a form of vitamin E with D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate as the natural form and DL-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate as the synthetic form. DL-indicates the synthetic form where as D- indicates the natural form. It is the ester of acetic acid and α-tocopherol. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in the 2019 outbreak of vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), but there is not yet sufficient evidence to rule out contributions from other chemicals. Vaporization of this ester produces toxic pyrolysis products. == Use in cosmetics == α-Tocopheryl acetate is often used in dermatological products such as skin creams. It is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol. Claims are made for beneficial antioxidant effects. α-Tocopheryl acetate is used as an alternative to tocopherol itself because the phenolic hydroxyl group is blocked, providing a less acidic product with a longer shelf life. It is believed that the acetate is slowly hydrolyzed after it is absorbed into the skin, regenerating tocopherol and providing protection against the sun's ultraviolet rays. Tocopheryl acetate was first synthesized in 1963 by workers at Hoffmann-La Roche. Although there is widespread use of tocopheryl acetate as a topical medication, with claims for improved wound healing and reduced scar tissue, reviews have repeatedly concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support these claims. There are reports of vitamin E-induced allergic contact dermatitis from use of vitamin E derivatives such as tocopheryl linoleate and tocopherol acetate in skin care products. Incidence is low despite widespread use. == Misuse == === Ingredient in vape liquids === On September 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) announced that 10 out of 18, or 56% of the samples of vape liquids sent in by states, linked to the recent vaping-related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. On November 8, 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified vitamin E acetate as a very strong culprit of concern in the vaping-related illnesses, but has not ruled out other chemicals or toxicants as possible causes. The CDC's findings were based on fluid samples from the lungs of 29 patients with vaping-associated pulmonary injury, which provided direct evidence of vitamin E acetate at the primary site of injury in all the 29 lung fluid samples tested. Research suggests when vitamin E acetate is inhaled, it may interfere with normal lung functioning. A 2020 study found that vaporizing vitamin E acetate produced carcinogenic alkenes and benzene, but also exceptionally toxic ketene gas, which may be a contributing factor to the pulmonary injuries. == Chemistry == At room temperature, α-tocopheryl acetate is a fat-soluble liquid. It has 3 chiral centers and thus 8 stereoisomers. It is made by esterifying α-tocopherol with acetic acid. 2R,4R,8R-isomer, also known as RRR-α-tocopheryl acetate, is the most common isomer used for various purposes. This is because α-tocopherol occurs in nature primarily as RRR-α-tocopherol. α-Tocopherol acetate does not boil at atmospheric pressure and begins to degrade at 240 °C. It can be vacuum distilled: it boils at 184 °C at 0.01 mmHg, at 194 °C (0.025 mmHg) and at 224 °C (0.3 mmHg). In practice, it is not degraded notably by air, visible light or UV-radiation. It has a refractive index of 1.4950–1.4972 at 20 °C. α-Tocopherol acetate is hydrolyzed to α-tocopherol and acetic acid under suitable conditions or when ingested by people. == References ==",Alpha-tocopheryl acetate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.2728962302207947), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.00014692598779220134), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.12706512212753296), (' INDUSTR', -0.001013280008919537), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.7447841763496399), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -7.60526381782256e-05), ('ĠPERSON', -0.055403392761945724), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -3.58813522325363e-05), (',', -0.03804749622941017), ('ĠFOOD', -0.34169888496398926), (',', -0.38689926266670227), ('ĠINDU', -0.16614489257335663), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005258775316178799)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.3868711292743683), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -6.2729995988775045e-06), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD; https://www.healthline.com/health/tocopheryl-acetate,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91-Tocopheryl_acetate,https://inci.guide/vitamins-provitamins/tocopheryl-acetate ', [])"

Multifocal demyelination and invasion of inflammatory cells are its primary pathological features. Fasudil has been confirmed to improve experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. However, Fasudil is accompanied by several shortcomings in the clinical practice. Hydroxyfasudil is a metabolite of Fasudil in the body with better pharmaceutical properties. Therefore, we attempted to study the influence of Hydroxyfasudil upon EAE mice. The results demonstrated that Hydroxyfasudil relieved the symptoms of EAE and the associated pathological damage, reduced the adhesion molecules and chemokines, decreased the invasion of peripheral immune cells. Simultaneously, Hydroxyfasudil modified the rebalance of peripheral T cells. Moreover, Hydroxyfasudil shifted the M1 phenotype to M2 polarization, inhibited inflammatory signaling cascades as well as inflammatory factors, and promoted anti-inflammatory factors in the CNS. In the end, mice in the Hydroxyfasudil group expressed more tight junction proteins, indirectly indicating that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was protected. Our results indicate that Hydroxyfasudil may be a prospective treatment for MS. To investigate the effect of hydroxyfasudil, a nonselective Rho-kinase inhibitor, on hypertension-related bladder dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), as there is an increasing evidence that the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) system plays an important role in bladder contraction. Twelve-week-old male SHRs were treated with hydroxyfasudil (1 mg/kg i.p.) once a day for 6 weeks. Wistar rats and SHRs without treatment with hydroxyfasudil were used as controls. Six weeks after the hydroxyfasudil treatment, voiding functions were evaluated by metabolic cages and cystometric studies under urethane anesthesia (1.0 g/kg i.p.). Bladder blood flow (BBF) was estimated by the hydrogen clearance method. The bladder tissue levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and ROCK activity were evaluated by the ELISA method. The SHR showed significant increases in micturition frequency and decreases in single-voided volume in metabolic cages, and significantly increases in micturition frequency and intercontractile interval in cystometric studies. Furthermore, the SHR showed significant increases in the BBF and bladder NGF concentration compared with the Wistar rats. These alterations in the SHR were significantly ameliorated after treatment with hydroxyfasudil, with small changes in blood pressure. However, the maximum detrusor pressures during voiding and the ROCK activities in the experimental bladders were similar in all rats examined. Our data indicate that this dose of hydroxyfasudil was effective on the BBF, whereas it had no significant effect on micturition pressure. These findings suggest that hydroxyfasudil could ameliorate hypertension-related bladder dysfunction in the SHR via improvement of the BBF (248 words). This experimental study evaluated the anti-asthmatic potential of the Rho-kinase inhibitor hydroxyfasudil in the settings of allergen-induced allergen-induced experimental asthma. Chronic allergic airway inflammation was caused by 28 days-sensitisation of guinea pigs with ovalbumin (OVA). Hydroxyfasudil was administered intraperitoneally in two doses for the last two weeks (1 mg/kg b.w.; 10 mg/kg b.w.). The degree of allergic inflammation was determined based on concentrations of inflammatory Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13), Th1 cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) in the lung homogenate and leukocyte count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The markers of remodelling and fibrosis, the growth factors (TGF-β1, EGF), EGF receptor, collagen type III and V were estimated in lung homogenate. The changes in specific airway resistance (sRaw) were used as an in vivo bronchial hyperreactivity parameter. Hydroxyfasudil administration at both doses significantly reduced sRaw after a week of therapy. We observed a decline of IL-13, TNF-α and IFN-γ in lung homogenate and a lower presence of lymphocytes in BALF after 14 days of hydroxyfasudil administration at both tested doses. Hydroxyfasudil 14 days-treatment at both doses effectively reduced the concentrations of TGF-β1, EGF receptors, collagen type III and V in BALF and modulated EGF levels. These findings indicate that RhoA/Rho-kinase is involved in the pathophysiology of allergic airway inflammation and suggest that Rho-kinase inhibitor hydroxyfasudil has therapeutic potential for asthma management.",Hydroxyfasudil,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007101670489646494), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006894134450703859), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16025589406490326)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005530327325686812), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.jns-journal.com/article/S0022-510X%2821%2902179-1/fulltext,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37619413/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasudil,https://www.glpbio.com/hydroxyfasudil.html,https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2004.10.053,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6962995/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4230280/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1572897/ ', [])"

3799,"('Nicardipine (hydrochloride)', 'Nicardipine', 'Nicardipinum', 'Nicardipinum [inn-latin]', 'Nicardipino [inn-spanish]')",Medical,"Nicardipine (Cardene) is a medication used to treat angina and hypertension, especially for hemorrhagic stroke patients. It belongs to the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs). It is also used for Raynaud's phenomenon. It is available in by mouth and intravenous formulations. It has been used in percutaneous coronary intervention. Its mechanism of action and clinical effects closely resemble those of nifedipine and the other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, felodipine), except that nicardipine is more selective for cerebral and coronary blood vessels. It is primarily a peripheral arterial vasodilator, thus unlike the nitrovasodilators (nitroglycerin and nitroprusside), cardiac preload is minimally affected. It has the longest duration among parenteral CCBs. As its use may lead to reflex tachycardia, it is advisable to use it in conjunction with a beta-blocker. In the setting of a ruptured brain aneurysm, nicardipine may be used (if nimodipine is unavailable) to reduce blood pressure and as prevention or treatment against cerebral vasospasm. It was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in 1981. Nicardipine was approved by the FDA in December 1988. The patent for both Cardene and Cardene SR expired in October 1995. == Medical uses == === Hypertensive emergency === Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker used primarily for the management of hypertension and angina. It is particularly effective in the treatment of acute and severe hypertension, including hypertensive emergency. This is due to the rapid onset and short half-life of this drug, which allows for precision in the control of blood pressure. === Other === Nicardipine is also used commonly in the perioperative setting for blood pressure fluctuations during surgery. Other scenarios for usage of Nicardipine include subarachnoid hemorrhage and hypertensive crisis of pregnancy. == Side effects == Nicardipine is associated to a wide range of side effects, due mainly to its vasodilatory effects. Common adverse effects include dizziness, fainting, flushing and peripheral edema. This is a direct result to the relaxation of blood vessels and lower systemic vascular resistance.

3802,"('Sotalol (hydrochloride)', 'Mj 1999', 'Sotalol', 'Beta-cardone', 'Sotalolum')",Medical,"Sotalol, sold under the brand name Betapace among others, is a medication used to treat and prevent abnormal heart rhythms. Evidence does not support a decreased risk of death with long term use. It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include a slow heart rate, chest pain, low blood pressure, feeling tired, dizziness, shortness of breath, problems seeing, vomiting, and swelling. Other serious side effects may include QT prolongation, heart failure, or bronchospasm. Sotalol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor blocker which has both class II and class III antiarrhythmic properties. Sotalol was first described in 1964 and came into medical use in 1974. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 296th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), sotalol can be validly used to maintain a normal heart rhythm in people with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), or very symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter. Due to the risk of serious side effects, the FDA states that sotalol should generally be reserved for people whose ventricular arrhythmias are life-threatening, or whose fibrillation/flutter cannot be resolved using the Valsalva maneuver or another simple method. Sotalol has shown some potential efficacy against symptoms of essential tremor due to its binding to the β2-adrenergic receptor but this remains an off-label use. == Contraindications == According to the FDA, sotalol should not be used in people with a waking heart rate lower than 50 beats per minute. It should not be used in people with sick sinus syndrome, long QT syndrome, cardiogenic shock, uncontrolled heart failure, asthma or a related bronchospastic condition, or people with serum potassium below 4 meq/L. It should only be used in people with a second and third degree AV block if a functioning pacemaker is present. Since sotalol is removed from the body through the kidneys, it should not be used in people with a creatinine clearance rate below 40 mL/min. It is also excreted in breast milk, so mothers should not breastfeed while taking sotalol. Since sotalol prolongs the QT interval, the FDA recommends against using it in conjunction with other medications that prolong the QT interval. Studies have found serious side effects to be more common in individuals also taking digoxin, possibly because of pre-existing heart failure in those people. As with other beta blockers, it may interact with calcium channel blockers, catecholamine-depleting drugs, insulin or antidiabetic drugs, β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and clonidine. Some evidence suggests that sotalol should be avoided in the setting of heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (resulting in the heart squeezing little blood out into the circulation with each pump) due to an increased risk of death. == Adverse effects == Over 10% of oral sotalol users experience fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, nausea, shortness of breath, bradycardia (slow heart rate), a sensation of the heart beating too hard, fast, or irregularly, or chest pain. Higher doses of sotalol increase the risk for all of these possible side effects. In rare cases, the QT prolongation caused by sotalol can lead to the development of life-threatening torsade de pointes (TdP) polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Across several clinical trials, 0.6% of oral sotalol patients with supraventricular abnormal heart rhythms (such as atrial fibrillation) developed TdP. For patients who had a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (abnormal rhythm lasting more than 30 seconds), 4% developed TdP. Risk increases with dosage, female sex, or having a history of an enlarged heart or congestive heart failure. The incidence of TdP for sustained ventricular tachycardia patients was 0% with an 80 mg daily dose, 0.5% at 160 mg, 1.6% at 320 mg, 4.4% at 480 mg, 3.7% at 640 mg, and 5.8% at doses greater than 640 mg. Due to this risk, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires affected individuals to be hospitalized for at least three days in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring upon starting or restarting sotalol. == Pharmacology == === Mechanisms of action === ==== Beta-blocker action ==== Sotalol is a beta blocker and non-selectively binds to both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors preventing activation of the receptors by their stimulatory ligand (catecholamines). It has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Without the binding of catecholamines to the β-adrenergic receptor, the G protein complex associated with the receptor cannot activate production of cyclic AMP, which is responsible for turning on calcium inflow channels. A decrease in activation of calcium channels will therefore result in a decrease in intracellular calcium. In heart cells, calcium is important in generating electrical signals for heart muscle contraction, as well as generating force for this contraction. In consideration of these important properties of calcium, two conclusions can be drawn. First, with less calcium in the cell, there is a decrease in electrical signals for contraction, thus allowing time for the heart's natural pacemaker to rectify arrhythmic contractions. Secondly, lower calcium means a decrease in strength and rate of the contractions, which can be helpful in treatment of abnormally fast heart rates. ==== Type III antiarrhythmic action ==== Sotalol also acts on potassium channels and causes a delay in relaxation of the ventricles. By blocking these potassium channels, sotalol inhibits efflux of K+ ions, which results in an increase in the time before another electrical signal can be generated in ventricular myocytes. This increase in the period before a new signal for contraction is generated, helps to correct arrhythmias by reducing the potential for premature or abnormal contraction of the ventricles but also prolongs the frequency of ventricular contraction to help treat tachycardia. === Pharmacokinetics === Sotalol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. == History == Sotalol was first synthesized in 1960 by A. A. Larsen of Mead-Johnson Pharmaceutical. It was originally recognized for its blood pressure lowering effects and its ability to reduce the symptoms of angina. It was made available in the United Kingdom and France in 1974, Germany in 1975, and Sweden in 1979. It became widely used in the 1980s. In the 1980s, its antiarrhythmic properties were discovered. The United States approved the drug in 1992. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Trade names for Sotalol include Betapace and Betapace AF (Berlex Laboratories), Sotalex and Sotacor (Bristol-Myers Squibb), and Sotylize (Arbor Pharmaceuticals). == References ==",Sotalol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.583032467868179e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -7.86750388215296e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotalol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='Sotalol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotalol?utm_source=openai')])"

Breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to trypan blue due to the negligible systemic exposure of trypan blue in humans following injection and subsequent removal of the drug at the completion of surgical procedures. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their methoxylated analogues (MeO-BDEs) are widely distributed in the environment. The main concern about the presence of PBDEs and MeO-BDEs in fish is due to their potential endocrine disruption effects in the specimens, and their potential risk to the health of human consumers. Considering these concerns, the goal of this study was to investigate the occurrence of PBDEs and MeO-BDEs in muscle tissues of blue shark (BSH), Prionace glauca, and yellowfin tuna (YFT), Thunnus albacares, caught in the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean (EAO), North-eastern Brazilian waters, and to evaluate the potential risk of human exposure by consumption. Muscle tissues of YFT and BSH were extracted using a Soxhlet apparatus and an Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE), respectively. PBDEs and MeO-BDEs were analysed by GC-NCI-MS. Concentrations of PBDEs ranged from not detected (nd) to 10 ng g Polariton organic light-emitting diodes (POLEDs) use strong light-matter coupling as an additional degree of freedom to tailor device characteristics, thus making them ideal candidates for many applications, such as room temperature laser diodes and high-color purity displays. However, achieving efficient formation of and emission from exciton-polaritons in an electrically driven device remains challenging due to the need for strong absorption, which often induces significant nonradiative recombination. Here, we investigate a novel POLED architecture to achieve polariton formation and high-brightness light emission. We utilize the blue-fluorescent emitter material 4,4'-Bis(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)styryl)biphenyl (BSBCz), which exhibits strong absorption and a highly horizontal transition-dipole orientation as well as a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency, even at high doping concentrations.

3804,"('Bromfenac (sodium hydrate)', 'Bromfenac (monosodium salt sesquihydrate)', 'Bromfenac', 'Xibrom', 'Bromfenaco')",Medical,"Bromfenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) marketed in the US as an ophthalmic solution (brand names Prolensa and Bromday, prior formulation brand name Xibrom, which has since been discontinued) by ISTA Pharmaceuticals for short-term, local use. Prolensa and Bromday are the once-daily formulation of bromfenac, while Xibrom was approved for twice-daily administration. In the European Union, the brand name is Yellox. Bromfenac is indicated for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain after cataract surgery. == Medical uses == Bromfenac is indicated for the treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation following cataract extraction. The drug has been shown to reduce macular edema and thickness of the retina (an indicator for inflammation) and improve visual acuity after surgery. == Contraindications == Bromfenac is contraindicated for people with adverse reactions to NSAIDs, such as asthma or rashes. == Side effects == Bromfenac eye drops are generally well tolerated. Comparatively common side effects in clinical studies included abnormal sensations in eye (0.5% of people treated with bromfenac), mild to moderate erosion of the cornea (0.4%), eye pruritus (0.4%), eye pain (0.3%) and redness (0.3%). Serious side effects such as corneal perforation were not reported in studies but only during post-marketing in less than one patient in 1000. == Interactions == No systematic interaction studies have been performed. There are no known cases of interactions with antibiotic eye drops. Blood plasma levels remain very low during bromfenac therapy, so interactions with drugs taken by mouth are unlikely. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === As an NSAID, bromfenac works by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by blocking the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. It preferably acts on COX-2 and only has a low affinity for COX-1. === Pharmacokinetics === Bromfenac is well absorbed through the cornea and reaches highest concentrations in the aqueous humour after 150 to 180 minutes, with a biological half-life of 1.4 hours and high drug levels being maintained for at least 12 hours. It is mainly concentrated in the aqueous humour and conjunctiva, and much less in the lens and vitreous body. Concentrations in the blood plasma are too low to be measured quantitatively. 99.8% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. The enzyme mainly responsible for metabolization of bromfenac is CYP2C9, and metabolites include the lactam and several conjugated compounds. 82% are excreted via the urine, and 13% via the faeces. Compared to amfenac, the halogenation of bromfenac's chemical structure (the bromine atom at C4) increases its penetration into ocular tissues, and increases its potency for COX enzyme inhibition. == Chemistry == Along with indomethacin, diclofenac and others, bromfenac belongs to the acetic acid group of NSAIDs. It is used in form of bromfenac sodium · 1.5 H2O (CAS number: 120638-55-3 ), which is soluble in water, methanol and aqueous bases, insoluble in chloroform and aqueous acids, and melts at 284 to 286 °C (543 to 547 °F) under decomposition. == History == For ophthalmic use, bromfenac has been prescribed more than 20,000,000 times across the world. As an eye drop, it has been available since 2000, starting in Japan where it was sold as Bronuck. It was first FDA approved for use in the United States in 2005, and it was marketed as Xibrom, twice-daily. In October 2010 Bromday received US FDA approval as a new, once-daily formulation. In 2013, Prolensa has also been approved by the FDA. Bromfenac eye drops have been marketed in the European Union since 2011, and are available on worldwide markets with agreements from Bausch & Lomb, Croma-Pharma, and other companies.

3805,"('Seratrodast', 'Aa 2414', 'Bronica', 'Abbott 73001', 'Abbott-73001')",Medical,"Bronica also Zenza Bronica (in Japanese: ゼンザブロニカ) was a Japanese manufacturer of classic medium-format roll film cameras and photographic equipment based in Tokyo, Japan. Their single-lens reflex (SLR) system-cameras competed with Pentax, Hasselblad, Mamiya and others in the medium-format camera market. == History == Before introduction of the first of what would become a dynasty of Zenza Bronica cameras in 1959, the Latinized Zenza Bronica name was already a popular Japanese luxury goods brand of the Shinkodo Works (in Japanese: 新光堂製作所) since 1947, specialized in the production of intricate crafted and decorated personal accessories, such as metal cigarette lighters and cases, cosmetic compacts, and watches, of diverse styles and designs. The company's founder Zenzaburō Yoshino (in Japanese: 吉野善三郎, b. 25 January 1911 — d. 23 November 1988), wherefrom the Latinized Zenza Bronica brand name is derived, was the third son born into a Japanese rice merchant family. At an early age Yoshino showed deep reverence for the technical innovation and mechanics of world-renowned cameras produced by the likes of Leica, Contax and Rollei. Both fascinated and yet increasingly frustrated by the limitations of the cameras produced at that time period, where each camera's merits and demerits were not solved by just one camera, Yoshino visioned creating a high-precision interchangeable single-lens reflex camera modular system of his own design. Yoshino's ambition, however, would require substantial investment, which he gradually self-funded from his family business in transportation and his passion for cameras by the establishment of a small camera store in Tokyo's Kanda district. Yoshino's camera store and his immense familiarity with deluxe foreign cameras became a huge success with photography enthusiasts in Japan, buying and selling luxury Leica and Contax cameras, which also gained popularity with US Army soldiers stationed in Japan after World War II. This formed the funding basis for his founding in 1947 of the Shinkodo Works with a vision of camera production, which at first produced Bronica brand luxury art deco accessories such as cigarette lighters and cases including watches, and positioned Bronica as a luxury brand in Japanese department stores, with popularity thriving among US Army soldiers in Japan. The Shinkodo Works was Yoshino's precursor production base and funding source for what would later serve his Bronica camera and photographic equipment manufacturing; later consolidated under the Zenza Bronica Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha (Zenza Bronica Industries, Inc) company. On 17 January 1952, the Shinkodo Works was directed by Yoshino to begin research and development of the Bronica prototype camera. === Film camera production === The prototype was a modular camera named the ""Yoshino Flex"". In June 1956 the Shinkodo Works created its first handmade example camera, and on reaching perfection in October 1958 with Yoshino's eighth prototype camera, the development costs had reached a sum of 200 million Yen, a huge sum at that time. The final prototype bore the Latinized nameplate ""ZENZA BRONICA""—the Bronica Z (Zen-za) rollfilm camera—and first appeared at the Philadelphia Camera Show in March 1959, where it received ecstatic industry press coverage and left a deep lasting impression of being the world's dream camera. The Bronica Z modular camera system, shortly later with slight modifications renamed the Zenza Bronica D (Deluxe) and successor Bronicas, using large-coverage film format, high-quality Nikkor lenses supplied by the then Japan Optical Industries Co., Ltd., (Nikon Corporation) became instant successes in the deluxe camera market worldwide. The Bronica D was the Japanese answer and first serious challenger to the Swedish Hasselblad cameras, and in several technical ways outclassed the Swedish offerings. Such was the design success of Bronica, that in the United States it attracted influential figures from the photographic industry such as Burt Keppler who met with Yoshino. Bronica later introduced optics and lens units of its own manufacture incorporating Seiko shutters with its later camera designs and held a portfolio of international patents. === Acquisition and product discontinuation === Bronica was eventually acquired by the lens manufacturer Tamron Co., Ltd., in 1998 with emphasis on Bronica's optical lens manufacturing. In May 2000, Tamron introduced under the Bronica brand the RF645 rangefinder camera. Tamron discontinued the brand's single-lens reflex camera models (ETRSi, SQ-Ai, SQ-B and GS-1) between June 2002 and December 2004, sales having suffered from the lack of consideration to a digital camera back and loss of market share to digital photography and digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, particularly for the wedding and portrait photography business which had previously been a heavy user of medium-format photographic film but switched quickly to digital photography for its commercial workflow benefits. Bronica's last model, the RF645 rangefinder camera, was discontinued in September 2005, and marked the termination of the Bronica camera brand business. Bronicas were workhorse photographic film cameras used by professional photographers for many years until the process of digital photography became widely adopted. Bronica cameras are, however, still widely used by photographers—both professional and advanced amateurs—whilst the commercial production of photographic 120 film remains available, in no small part due to superior image quality of 6x4.5, 6x6 and 6x7cm photographic film formats over smaller film (35mm) and digital image sensor formats. === JCII camera museum === The Japan Camera and Optical Instruments Inspection and Testing Institute (JCII) at its camera museum located in Ichibanchō district, central Tokyo, has a selection of Bronica camera models preserved among its museum display collections; as part of the museum's designation ""preserving cameras considered of historical significance"". == Bronica models == Bronica SLR system-cameras employed a modular design: The major components of the camera—lens, body, film-back and viewfinder were separate and interchangeable, providing options to match the specific photography or workflow needs of the photographer. === Classic models === From its start, Bronica introduced a number of 6x6 cm medium-format SLR cameras with focal plane shutter, which used Nikkor lenses from Nikon, until this line was discontinued with the introduction of the successor Bronica SQ-series. These models included: Bronica Z (Zen-za), debuted March 1959 at the Philadelphia Camera Show and renamed Bronica D (Deluxe) in December 1959 with slight modifications; production discontinued March 1961 Bronica S (Standard), introduced April 1961; production discontinued April 1965 Bronica C (Compact), introduced December 1964; production discontinued May 1965 Bronica C2, introduced May 1965; production discontinued September 1972 Bronica S2, introduced July 1965, S2A (introduced 1969), S2A type 2 (introduced 1972); production discontinued September 1977 Bronica EC (Electrical Control), introduced April 1972; production discontinued December 1978 Bronica EC-TL (Electrical Control with Through-the-Lens aperture priority automatic exposure), introduced June 1975, EC-TL II (introduced October 1978); production discontinued March 1980 Notably, the Bronica EC was the first medium-format SLR camera with an electrically operated focal plane shutter (Japan Patent No.: 43/94431 24 December 1968; US Patent No. US3696727), while the EC-TL was the first medium-format camera with Aperture priority automatic exposure (AE). The range of Nikkor lenses for these remarkable cameras reached from 30mm (fisheye) to 1200mm and comprised about 30 lenses. Lens optics supplied by Carl Zeiss in Jena, Tokyo Optical Co., Ltd., Norita optics, Komura-Komuranon (Sankyo Kohki), Schneider Kreuznach, as well as lens optics later manufactured by Bronica itself (Zenzanon) based on designs by Zeiss and Japanese lens manufacturers were available, as well as a wide range of accessories, including different film magazines, bellows, and viewfinders. === ETR series === ETR: Introduced March 1976, production discontinued March 1980. Advanced, compact, modular electronic 6x4.5 cm medium-format SLR camera system with a vast array of finders, film-backs, and other accessories. ETR was an acronym for Electronic, TTL-metering, Reflex. In 1977 the ETR received Japan's Good Design Award. Seventeen lenses with leaf shutters were made for the ETR-system from a fisheye, to four different zooms, to a 500mm super telephoto, to a unique 55mm tilt shift lens. ETR-C: Introduced November 1977, production discontinued December 1980. Identical to the ETR model except film magazine cannot be removed from film-back. ETRS: Introduced October 1978. Improved version of the ETR with an extra contact to support auto-exposure mode with the metered prism finder AE-II and later AE-III. ETRS: A modification introduced July 1982, ETRS production discontinued September 1989. Unnamed change to original ETRS model. Lens release sliding lever latch located to left side of camera side panel, film-backs released using two independent tabs. This version is reputedly referred to as the ""plastic"" body ETRS and film-back, for the change in the side panels of the body and film-backs to polycarbonate. ETRC: Introduced October 1978 (ETRC), production discontinued October 1980 (ETRC) Identical to the ETRS model except film magazine cannot be removed from film-back. ETRSi: Introduced December 1988, production discontinued December 2004. Improved version of the ETRS with mirror lock-up capability. Capable of through-the-lens off-the-filmplane (TTL-OTF) flash exposure. Significantly improved film-back design (Si) with locking darkslide. === SQ series === SQ: Introduced August 1980 as replacement and successor to Bronica's classic and increasingly bulky Nikkor-lens based cameras, production discontinued September 1984. Modular 6x6 cm traditional ""square film"" medium-format SLR camera system with leaf shutter lenses. SQ-A: Introduced January 1982, production discontinued December 1991. The SQ-A was a refinement of the SQ. The contact pin array for the viewfinder was increased from six to ten gold contacts, allowing for auto metering capability with the AE finder S. Also, a mirror lock-up lever was added. The film-backs were modified slightly, with the ISO dial for the original film-backs having white and orange numerals, and the new with silver. The darkslide was changed to the locking style; to lock required both the new grey handle slide and the new silver numeral ISO dial back. All accessories for SQ cameras fit the SQ-A, however the AE finder cannot physically mount on the SQ; a safety defeat pin prevents attachment. SQ-Am: Introduced August 1982, production discontinued March 1991. Motorized film-advance only version of SQ-A body. Uses six additional AA batteries. SQ-Ai: Introduced December 1990, production discontinued December 2003. Added the following functionality to the SQ-A. Ability to add the motor drive SQ-i and off the film (TTL-OTF) metering with select flash guns. These changes required the addition of a circuit board which also required the battery compartment to be ""flattened."" The single 6v cell was replaced with four 1.5 volt ""button"" cells. A bulb 'B' setting was added to the shutter speed selector. The film-back was also modified again with the introduction of the SQ-Ai, relocating the ISO dial to the rear of the film-back (rather than on top) to allow the speed setting to be seen better with a prism attached. Exposure compensation control was also added to the new SQ-Ai film-back, with the ISO range extended to 6400. SQ-B (Basic): Introduced April 1996, production discontinued December 2003. The SQ-B was a manually operating SLR evolved from the SQ-Ai, built to primarily satisfy the needs of professional ""studio"" photographers who work with hand-held light meters, studio or portable flash equipment and various other accessories. Thus, motorized film-advance and through-the-lens metering (TTL) functionality were not present, as well as B (bulb exposure), as found on other SQ-series models. T (time exposure), however, was available when utilizing the appropriate SQ-series Zenzanon-S/PS lenses which incorporated the time (T) exposure lever function; by default the Zenzanon-PS/B 80mm f/2.8 lens which accompanied the SQ-B model did not include this feature. All SQ-series accessories and lenses were interchangeable with the SQ-B with few exceptions. === GS series === GS-1: Introduced April 1983, production discontinued June 2002. Lightweight, electronically controlled, modular 6x7 cm medium-format SLR camera system with leaf shutter lenses, four interchangeable viewfinders, speed grip, and optional film-backs for Polaroid Land pack film, 6x4.5 cm, 6x6 cm, and 6x7 cm rollfilm. 120 and 220 size film-backs available in 6x4.5, 6x6 and 6x7 cm. A 35mm film-back was listed in the camera's marketing materials, but never materialized. Dedicated Flash (G1). The GS-1 uses ""PG""-series lenses in a variety of focal lengths: 50mm, 65mm, 80mm, 100mm, 110mm macro, 150mm, 200mm, 250mm, and 500mm. === RF series === RF645: Introduced May 2000, production discontinued September 2005. Extremely light and compact 6x4.5 cm film format coupled rangefinder camera system with four interchangeable leaf shutter lenses: 45mm, 65mm, 100mm and 135mm. The 135mm Tele Lens soon was discontinued due to calibration problems of the rangefinder-system. Dedicated flash (RF20) and special polarizer kit. == Further reading == ""ブロニカクラブ会報"" [Bronica club newsletter]. Bronica Club Newsletter (in Japanese). No. 1 and 54.

3807,"('Psoralen', 'Ficusin', 'Furocoumarin', 'Psoralene', 'Furo[3,2-g]chromen-7-one')","Food, Medical","The furanocoumarins, or furocoumarins, are a class of organic chemical compounds produced by a variety of plants. Most of the plant species found to contain furanocoumarins belong to a handful of plant families. The families Apiaceae and Rutaceae (citrus family) include the largest numbers of plant species that contain furanocoumarins. The families Moraceae and Fabaceae include a few widely distributed plant species that contain furanocoumarins. Generally, furanocoumarins are most abundant in plants that have flowered and in ripe seeds and fruits. (An exception is the common fig where furanocoumarins are found chiefly in the milky sap of the leaves and shoots but not the fruits.) During the early stages of plant growth, their presence is not easily detected. == Structure == The chemical structure of furanocoumarins consists of a furan ring fused with a coumarin. The furan ring may be fused in various ways, producing several different isomers. The parent compounds of the most common isomers are psoralen and angelicin. Derivatives of these two compounds are referred to respectively as linear and angular furanocoumarins, so called since they exhibit a linear or angular chemical structure. == Biosynthesis == The compounds are biosynthesized partly through the phenylpropanoid pathway and the mevalonate pathway, which is biosynthesized by a coupling of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and 7-hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone). == Effects == === Direct toxicity === Many furanocoumarin compounds are toxic. The phytochemicals enter the nucleus of epithelial cells and form a bond (cross-linking) with the DNA when exposed to UV, which causes cell death and causes inflammation via activation of the arachidonic acid cascade. The result is known as phytophotodermatitis, a serious skin inflammation. Furanocoumarins produced by plants may serve as a defense mechanism against predators such as insects and mammals. It is also likely that furanocoumarins are related to a plant's natural defense against fungal attack. In particular, the linear furanocoumarins (psoralen, bergapten, and methoxsalen), which occur naturally in Apiaceae, Rutaceae, and other plant families, are known to be toxic to fungi. Plants that cause phytophotodermatitis usually contain linear furanocoumarins. Furanocoumarins are found in the sap of plants such as Ammi majus, parsnip, and giant hogweed. At least 36 species of the genus Heracleum in the family Apiaceae are known to contain one or more furanocoumarin compounds. The toxin can sometimes be found even in the most common foods, including carrots, parsley, limes, and lemons, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in the case of a man who manually squeezed a dozen limes and then inadvertently exposed his hand directly to the sunlight without precaution, triggering a severe phytophotodermatitis for several months. The identified culprit was the prolonged exposure of both his hands to lime juice followed by that of sunlight UV. === Medication interactions === Furanocoumarins have other biological effects as well. For example, in humans, bergamottin and 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin are responsible for the ""grapefruit juice effect"", in which these furanocoumarins affect certain P450 liver and gut enzymes, such as the inhibition of CYP3A4 which either activates or deactivates many drugs, thus leading to higher or lower levels in the bloodstream. Furanocoumarins have various effects which can specifically increase or decrease (depending on the drug) the blood levels of many pharmaceuticals in ways that can be life-threatening, so FDA-approved drugs include warnings for grapefruit. == See also == Pyranocoumarin Naringin == References ==",Furocoumarin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0032140801195055246), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.47410818934440613), (' INDUSTR', -0.3139025866985321), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.06415271013975143), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.038068726658821106), ('ĠINDU', -0.5504950284957886), ('ST', -2.753696753643453e-05), ('RI', -2.9802276912960224e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2015904039144516)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Ceftaroline fosamil is a prodrug of ceftaroline. It is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other Gram-positive bacteria. It retains some activity of later-generation cephalosporins having broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria, but its effectiveness is relatively much weaker. It is currently being investigated for community-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infection. Ceftaroline is being developed by Forest Laboratories, under a license from Takeda. Ceftaroline received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin infections on 29 October 2010. In vitro studies show it has a similar spectrum to ceftobiprole, the only other fifth-generation cephalosporin to date, although no head-to-head clinical trials have been conducted. Ceftaroline and ceftobiprole are on an unnamed subclass of cephalosporins by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). It was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. == Clinical use == Ceftaroline is a novel cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with phase III clinical trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections with reported non-inferior efficacy against MRSA compared to vancomycin and aztreonam. In 2009, ceftaroline had completed phase-III clinical trials for community-acquired pneumonia comparing it against ceftriaxone with non-inferior results and similar adverse reaction profile. However, only results for phase-II clinical trials in treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections have been published. Sept 2009 : Phase III trials results reported. On 8 September 2010, the FDA Advisory Committee recommended approval for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections. In October 2010, FDA approval was gained for treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, including MRSA. MRSA can develop resistance to ceftaroline through the alteration of penicillin-binding proteins. Amino acid-altering mutations in the ceftaroline-binding pocket of the transpeptidase region of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) confer resistance to ceftaroline. Ceftaroline- and methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus have been identified in Europe and Asia, but have not been identified in the United States. While cephalosporinases (a type of beta-lactamase that inactivates cephalosporins) confers resistance to other cephalosporins, cephalosporinases have not yet been identified as a mechanism of resistance to ceftaroline. == Safety == The clinical studies indicated ceftaroline was well tolerated. The overall rate of adverse events was comparable between the two treatment groups (The CANVAS I and CANVAS II trials evaluated ceftaroline monotherapy versus vancomycin plus aztreonam in adult subjects with complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.). The overall discontinuation rate for ceftaroline-treated subjects was 2.7% compared to a rate of 3.7% for the comparator group-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions occurring in > 2% of subjects receiving ceftaroline in the pooled phase-III clinical trials were diarrhea, nausea, and rash.: == Contraindications == Known serious hypersensitivity to ceftaroline or other members of the cephalosporin class Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions == Warnings and precautions == The warnings and precautions associated with ceftaroline include: === Hypersensitivity reactions === Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported with beta-lactam antibiotics, including ceftaroline. Exercise caution in people with known hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics including ceftaroline. Before therapy with ceftaroline is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems should be made. If this product is to be given to penicillin- or other beta-lactam-allergic people, caution should be exercised because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial agents has been clearly established. If an allergic reaction to ceftaroline occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions require emergency treatment with epinephrine and other emergency measures, that may include airway management, oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and vasopressors as clinically indicated. === Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea === Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all antibacterial agents including ceftaroline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterials not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. === Development of drug-resistant bacteria === Prescribing ceftaroline in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. === Direct Coombs test seroconversion === In the pooled phase-III CABP trials, 51/520 (9.8%) of subjects treated with ceftaroline compared to 24/534 (4.5%) of subjects treated with ceftriaxone seroconverted from a negative to a positive direct Coombs' test result. No clinical adverse reactions representing hemolytic anemia were reported in any treatment group. If anemia develops during or after treatment with ceftaroline, drug-induced hemolytic anemia should be considered. If drug-induced hemolytic anemia is suspected, discontinuation of ceftaroline should be considered and supportive care should be administered to the patient if clinically indicated. === Interactions === No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with ceftaroline fosamil. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicated that neither ceftaroline fosamil nor ceftaroline inhibits the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Therefore, neither ceftaroline fosamil nor ceftaroline is expected to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by these metabolic pathways in a clinically relevant manner. === Use in specific populations === For pregnant or nursing mothers, ceftaroline fosamil should be used only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or child. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric children has not been studied. Because elderly people 65 years of age or older are more likely to have decreased renal function and ceftaroline is excreted primarily by the kidney, care should be taken in dose selection in this age group as in younger people with impaired renal function. Dosage adjustment is required in people with moderately (30 to ‰¤ 50 mL/min) or severely (< 30 mL/min) impaired renal function. The pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline in people with hepatic impairment have not been established. == Side effects == No adverse reactions occurred in greater than 5% of people receiving ceftaroline. The most common adverse reactions occurring in > 2% of people receiving ceftaroline in the pooled phase-III clinical trials were: Diarrhea Nausea Rash == Chemistry == Ceftaroline fosamil is used in form of the acetate. It is a prodrug that is converted to active metabolite ceftaroline and inactive metabolite ceftaroline-M1. Initial in vitro and in vivo animal studies referred to ceftaroline fosamil acetate as PPI-0903.

3810,"('Cobicistat', 'Cobicistat (gs-9350)', 'Tybost', 'Gs 9350', 'Cobicistat,gs-9350')",Medical,"Cobicistat, sold under the brand name Tybost, is a medication for use in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV/AIDS). Its major mechanism of action is through the inhibition of human CYP3A proteins. Like ritonavir (Norvir), cobicistat is of interest for its ability to inhibit liver enzymes that metabolize other medications used to treat HIV, notably elvitegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor. By combining cobicistat with elvitegravir, higher concentrations of the latter are achieved in the body with lower dosing, theoretically enhancing elvitegravir's viral suppression while diminishing its adverse side-effects. In contrast with ritonavir, the only other booster approved for use as a part of HAART, cobicistat has no anti-HIV activity of its own. Cobicistat is a component of three four-drug, fixed-dose combination HIV treatments. The first, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, is marketed as Stribild and was approved by the FDA in August 2012 for use in the United States. The second, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, is marketed as Genvoya and was approved by the FDA in November 2015 for use in the United States. Both Stribild and Genvoya are owned by Gilead Sciences. The third, cobicistat/darunavir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, is marketed as Symtuza and was FDA approved July 17, 2018 and is owned by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Additionally, there is a fixed-dose combination of cobicistat and the protease inhibitor darunavir (darunavir/cobicistat; marketed as Prezcobix by Janssen Therapeutics), and a fixed-dose combination of cobicistat and protease inhibitor atazanavir (atazanavir/cobicistat; marketed as Evotaz by Bristol-Myers Squibb). Both Prezcobix and Evotaz were approved by the FDA in January 2015. Cobicistat is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A enzymes, including the important CYP3A4 subtype. It also inhibits intestinal transport proteins, increasing the overall absorption of several HIV medications, including atazanavir, darunavir, and tenofovir alafenamide. == Chemistry == Cobicistat is a drug analogue of ritonavir, in which the valine moiety is exchanged for a 2-morpholinoethyl group, and the backbone hydroxyl group is removed. These changes effectively eliminate the anti-HIV activity of ritonavir while preserving its inhibitory effects on the CYP3A isozyme family of proteins. Cobicistat is therefore able to increase plasma concentration of other coadministered anti-HIV drugs without the risk of causing cobicistat-resistant mutations in the HIV virus. === Synthesis === Cobicistat may be synthesized from any number of commercially available starting materials. The synthesis shown below utilizes L-methionine and bromoacetic acid as starting materials. == Discovery and development == Cobicistat was developed through structure-activity relationship studies using ritonavir and desoxyritonavir as lead compounds. These studies were conducted by scientists at Gilead Sciences, and successfully optimized ritonavir into a potent CYP3A inhibitor lacking anti-HIV activity. Cobicistat shows potent, selective inhibition of the CYP3A isozyme family (IC50 0.15 μM) compared to some CYP1A and CYP2C isozymes. As cobicistat was discovered using structure-activity relationship studies, its CYP3A binding is still poorly understood; however, research on the protein-ligand interactions between CYP3A4 and ritonavir analogues demonstrates that CYP 3A4 residues Ile369, Ala370, Met371, as well as Arg105 and Ser119, play an important role in ritonavir analogue inhibition of CYP3A4. == References ==",Tybost,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002656822034623474)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/tybost.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Tybost: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/tybost.html?utm_source=openai')])"

3812,"('Ketotifen (fumarate)', 'Hc 20511 fumarate', 'Ketotifen', 'Ketotifene', 'Zaditor')",Medical,"Ketotifen is an antihistamine medication and a mast cell stabilizer used to treat allergic conditions such as conjunctivitis, asthma, and urticaria (hives). Ketotifen is available in ophthalmic (eye drops or drug-eluting contact lenses) and oral (tablets or syrup) forms: the ophthalmic form relieves eye itchiness and irritation associated with seasonal allergies, while the oral form helps prevent systemic conditions such as asthma attacks and allergic reactions. In addition to treating allergies, ketotifen has shown efficacy in managing systemic mast cell diseases such as mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), which involve abnormal accumulation or activation of mast cells throughout the body. Ketotifen is also used for other allergic-type conditions like atopic dermatitis (eczema) and food allergies. Ketotifen acts by blocking the H1 histamine receptors, which are found on various cells in the body, such as smooth muscle, endothelium, and nerve cells. This blocking prevents the binding of histamine to these receptors and thus reduces the symptoms of histamine-mediated reactions, such as itching, sneezing, wheezing, and swelling. Ketotifen also prevents the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from immune cells (mast cells); this action helps reduce symptoms of conditions (including allergic conditions) by blocking the activation of these cells. In addition to its antihistaminic activity, ketotifen also functions as a leukotriene antagonist, which blocks inflammation-causing chemicals known as leukotrienes; it also acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that regulates blood vessel dilation. Ketotifen can have side effects, including drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, irritability, increased nosebleeds when taken orally, and temporary burning or stinging sensations in the eyes when used in the ophthalmic form. Ketotifen has contraindications for individuals with certain medical conditions, such as acute porphyrias or epilepsy. Controversies surrounding ketotifen include its classification as a first-generation or second-generation antihistamine due to varying criteria of classification. In 2022, it was the 243rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ketotifen, an antihistamine medication and a mast cell stabilizer, is most commonly sold as a salt with fumaric acid, ketotifen fumarate, and is available in two forms: in its ophthalmic form (eye drops or drug-eluting contact lenses), it is used to treat allergic conjunctivitis; in its oral form (tablets or syrup), it is used to prevent asthma attacks or anaphylaxis, as well as various mast cell, allergic-type disorders. Ketotifen ophthalmic solution (eye drops) relieves and prevents eye itchiness and/or irritation associated with most seasonal allergies. It starts working within minutes after administering the drops. Ketotifen in the form of eye drops has not been studied in children under three years old, whereas drug-eluting contact lenses have not been studied in children under eleven years old. Drug-eluting contact lenses, which release ketotifen medication, are used to help prevent itchy eyes caused by allergies. The lenses can also correct vision problems, namely, nearsightedness and farsightedness. These lenses are meant for people who don't have red eyes, can comfortably wear contact lenses, and have less than 1 degree of astigmatism. Oral ketotifen is used to treat asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria (hives), cold-induced urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, exercise-induced urticaria, systemic mast cell diseases such as mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), as well as allergic and nonallergic anaphylaxis. Ketotifen has also shown efficacy in managing angioedema and food allergies. As an antihistamine medication, ketotifen acts by blocking the H1 histamine receptors, which are found on various cells in the body, such as smooth muscle, endothelium, and nerve cells. This blocking prevents the binding of histamine to these receptors and thus reduces the symptoms of histamine-mediated reactions, such as itching, sneezing, wheezing, and swelling. As a mast cell stabilizer to treat MCAS, oral ketotifen prevents the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from mast cells, which are immune cells that react to allergens. Therefore, ketotifen, by blocking a calcium channel essential for mast cell activation, helps reduce symptoms of allergic conditions. These allergic conditions include asthma, hay fever, and conjunctivitis caused by mast cell activation. Calcium channels are proteins in mast cell membranes that allow calcium ions to enter the cell, triggering the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances. When these channels open, calcium floods into the cells, causing them to degranulate. By blocking these channels, ketotifen prevents this process, reducing allergic reactions. In Canada, Europe, and Mexico, oral ketotifen is commonly prescribed for these indications (asthma, hay fever, and conjunctivitis caused by mast cell activation). In patients with MCAS, ketotifen reduces episodes of flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, diarrhea), respiratory symptoms (such as wheezing), and other systemic manifestations. Still, treatment plans for MCAS typically involve a combination of medications targeting different aspects of mast cell activation along with lifestyle modifications to minimize triggers. The maximum antihistamine and mast cell stabilizing effect of oral ketotifen is achieved on long-term administration, and a period of at least 6-12 weeks is necessary for a maximum therapeutic effect to start. The sedation side effect decreases over time during such long-term administration, but the antihistamine and mast cell stabilizing properties persist even if administered for 12 months or longer. Oral ketotifen is available at compounding pharmacies in the United States with a prescription requirement, still, the use of oral ketotifen is only approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults and older children with asthma or allergic conditions. However, ketotifen eye drops are approved in the US for people who are at least three years of age. In the EU, ketotifen oral formulatios (syrup, tables and capsules) are approved by the European Medicines Agency for adult use. In the UK, ketotifen is available as tables and elixir (liquid). Oral ketotifen can be used as a long-term control medication for asthma and wheeze in children, and it has been shown to improve the control of asthma by reducing the need for bronchodilators, decreasing symptoms, preventing exacerbations, and reducing the use of rescue oral steroids, ketotifen has also been found to be effective when used alone or in combination with other medications. Oral ketotifen is an alternative to inhaled therapy for asthma in children, especially for younger children who may have difficulty using inhalers. The mean elimination half-life of oral ketotifen is 12 hours. Besides its anti-histaminic activity, it is also a functional leukotriene antagonist (a medication that blocks the action of leukotrienes, which are chemicals that cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways in some allergic and respiratory conditions) and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (a medication that blocks the enzymes that regulate the levels of cAMP and cGMP, which are molecules that control blood vessel dilation and smooth muscle relaxation in the body). == Contraindications == The eye drops are contraindicated for individuals who have a known hypersensitivity to ketotifen or any other ingredient in the formulation, whereas drug-eluting contact lenses are contraindicated for those who experience irritation from wearing contact lenses. Eye drops are not recommended for use in children under three years of age, whereas drug-eluting contact lenses are not recommended for children under eleven years of age. For oral ketotifen, the contraindication is for known hypersensitivity to any component of the product. Caution should be taken on the following conditions: acute porphyrias (a group of rare disorders that occur when the body cannot make enough of a substance called heme, which is needed for red blood cells to carry oxygen, this causes a build-up of chemicals called porphyrins, which can damage the nerves and the skin) - unlike other histamines, ketotifen appears to be relatively safe in acute porphyria, still, caution should be taken epilepsy (a disorder causing recurrent seizures) - ketotifen may increase the risk of seizures, pyloroduodenal obstruction (a condition where the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine is blocked by something, such as a muscle, an ulcer, a tumor, or a gallstone), susceptibility to angle-closure glaucoma (a condition where the iris, the colored part of the eye, bulges and blocks the drainage of fluid from the eye, causing high pressure and damage to the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain), and urinary retention (inability to urinate). The use of ketotifen eye drops during pregnancy and lactation is considered safe, as absorption through the eye is limited. It is unlikely to cause any adverse effects in breastfeeding infants after maternal use. To minimize the amount of medication transferred to breast milk when using eye drops, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development advises to apply pressure on the tear duct near the corner of the eye for at least one minute and remove any excess solution with a tissue. Ketotifen safety when taken via the oral route (tablets or syrup) during pregnancy and lactation remains unknown; therefore, it is not recommended to use ketotifen orally during these periods until sufficient safety data becomes available. == Side effects == Common side effects of ophthalmic use are eye redness and swelling. Less common are eye discharge, eye discomfort, eye pain, hives, increased itching of eyes, and rash. Ophthalmic use of ketotifen may also cause burning, stinging, or itching of the eyes, blurred vision, or increased sensitivity to light. Side effects of systemic (oral) use include drowsiness, weight gain (5.0–5.4 kilograms (11.0–11.9 lb)), dry mouth, irritability, and increased nosebleeds. Systemic use of ketotifen may also cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, or fatigue. In rare cases, systemic use of ketotifen may cause serious side effects such as anaphylaxis, liver dysfunction, blood disorders, or seizures. Systemic use of ketotifen may interact with other drugs that cause sedation, such as alcohol, antihistamines, opioids, benzodiazepines, or antidepressants. Systemic use of ketotifen may affect the results of some laboratory tests, such as skin tests for allergies or blood glucose levels. == Overdose == The symptoms of ketotifen overdose are dose-dependent and may vary from mild to severe. The onset of symptoms may be delayed for several hours after ingestion, and the duration of symptoms may last for more than 24 hours. The most common symptom of ketotifen overdose is significant sedation. Other symptoms may include confusion, disorientation, agitation, hallucinations, ataxia (impairment of voluntary muscle movement), tremor (involuntary regular muscle contraction), myoclonus (involuntary, irregular muscle twitch), nystagmus (dysfunction of eye movement), dysarthria (poor speech), and slurred speech. Other symptoms of ketotifen overdose may include tachycardia (fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat or pulse), hypotension (low blood pressure), convulsions, hyperexcitability (particularly in children), reversible coma, unusual tiredness or weakness, blurred vision, dizziness or fainting, loss of consciousness. The symptoms of ketotifen overdose may be described according to the affected system of the body. The cardiovascular effects of ketotifen overdose may include tachycardia, hypotension, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. The respiratory effects may include respiratory depression, sleep apnea, and pulmonary edema. The gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and pancreatitis. The renal effects may include acute renal failure and urinary retention. The hepatic effects may include hepatitis and jaundice. The hematologic effects may include anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The neurologic effects of ketotifen overdose may include convulsions, hyperexcitability, coma, and death. The risk of seizures is higher in children, especially those with a history of epilepsy or febrile seizures. The risk of coma and death is higher in adults, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions or concomitant use of other drugs that cause sedation or lower the seizure threshold. In children, ketotifen overdose may lead to toxic encephalopathy with lifelong health consequences. There was a reported case of an overdose in a 4-month-old boy that led to growth retardation and mental deterioration. == Interactions == In systemic (oral) administration, ketotifen has the potential to enhance the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, antihistamines, and alcohol. Interactions have been observed between oral ketotifen and oral hypoglycemic agents, antihistamines, and medications with sedative properties. Oral ketotifen may interact with amphetamine and benzphetamine, which may decrease the activities of ketotifen. The concomitant use of oral ketotifen with amifampridine, bupropion, donepezil, and pitolisant is not recommended. In rare instances, patients who have been administered oral ketotifen with oral antidiabetic agents have exhibited a reversible decrease in thrombocyte count. As such, it is recommended to monitor thrombocyte counts in patients who are concurrently taking oral antidiabetic agents. Systemic use of ketotifen may decrease the effectiveness of benzylpenicilloyl polylysine as a diagnostic agent. Ketotifen may affect the results of some laboratory tests, such as skin tests for allergies or blood glucose levels. Ketotifen may interfere with the skin test reactions by suppressing the histamine response, leading to false-negative results. Ophthalmic use of ketotifen may interact with contact lenses, as the eye drops may contain preservatives that can be absorbed by soft contact lenses and cause eye irritation. == Pharmacology == Ketotifen is a selective antihistamine – that is, an inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor (Ki = 0.166 nM) – and mast cell stabilizer. By preventing the degranulation of mast cells, ketotifen inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes, which are implicated in allergic reactions. Ketotifen action is also based on its inhibition of serotonin release. Ketotifen also plays a role in the prevention of accumulation of eosinophils, which are white blood cells that become active during allergic reactions and infections; as such, ketotifen helps in reducing inflammation this way. In addition, ketotifen has weak anticholinergic (Ki = 204 nM for mAChTooltip muscarinic acetylcholine receptor) and antiserotonergic (Ki = 38.9 nM for 5-HT2A) activity. However, at the dosages in which it is typically used clinically, both the anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activity of ketotifen are said not to be appreciable. Ketotifen is a lipophilic compound that can cross the blood–brain barrier and exert central nervous system effects, such as sedation, weight gain, and anticonvulsant activity. Ketotifen also has peripheral effects, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation, modulation of cytokine production, and enhancement of mucociliary clearance. Ketotifen acts as a mast cell stabilizer by preventing the degranulation and release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and cytokines, from mast cells. Ketotifen also inhibits the activation and migration of eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, which are involved in the inflammatory response and tissue damage in allergic and respiratory diseases. Ketotifen has a dual mode of action as an antihistamine and a mast cell stabilizer, which makes it effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of various allergic and respiratory conditions, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, urticaria, and anaphylaxis. Ketotifen can also reduce the bronchial hyperreactivity and airway inflammation that are characteristic of chronic asthma. Ketotifen has a plasma half-life of about 12 hours. Ketotifen is extensively metabolized in the liver by oxidation and conjugation, and the metabolites are excreted in the urine and feces. The bioavailability of oral ketotifen is about 50% due to hepatic first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentration is reached in about 2 to 4 hours. The pharmacokinetics of ketotifen are not significantly affected by age, gender, or renal impairment, but may be altered by hepatic impairment or concomitant use of other drugs. Ketotifen, like other antihistamines, is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, especially CYP3A4 in the liver. The CYP enzymes are responsible for the oxidation and demethylation of ketotifen, producing the major metabolites norketotifen and 10-hydroxyketotifen. Norketotifen is pharmacologically active and has a similar potency as ketotifen, while 10-hydroxyketotifen is inactive. The metabolites are then conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate and excreted in the urine and feces. == Classification == Ketotifen is a noncompetitive H1-antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. There is no academic consensus on whether ketotifen should be classified as a medication belonging to the first or the second generations of antihistamine drugs; the classification can vary depending on the criteria used and the context of the study, and is primarily based on chemical structure, pharmacological properties, and side effect profiles of an antihistamine drug. First-generation H1 antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, reduce skin reactivity for up to 24 hours, whereas ketotifen suppresses skin reactivity for over five days, a typical duration for the second generation of the class. Ketotifen is a tricyclic, benzocycloheptene-based compound with chemical structures similar to first-generation antihistamines such as azatadine, cyproheptadine, chlorpheniramine, and diphenhydramine, and other compounds with antihistamine properties such as pizotifen. The sedative effects of ketotifen are also a reason for differences in classification. First-generation antihistamines are well known for their sedating side effects due to their ability to penetrate the blood–brain barrier. While ketotifen has some sedative properties, it is generally considered to have a milder sedative effect compared to traditional first-generation antihistamines, so this reduced sedation is one of the reasons why ketotifen is sometimes classified as a second-generation antihistamine. == History == Ketotifen was patented in 1970 and came into medical use in 1976. Ketotifen was developed and patented by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (a part of Novartis), a Swiss company. Ketotifen was approved for medical use in Canada in December 1990. Ketotifen was approved for medical use in the United States in July 1999. TA contact lens with ketotifen was approved for medical use in the United States in 2022. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Ketotifen is sold under various brand names worldwide, depending on country and formulation, with over 200 different names used. In the United States, ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution is marketed under brand name Zaditor, which is owned by Alcon Inc., a Swiss-American pharmaceutical company. === Litigation === There was a litigation related to ketotifen. In 2021, the plaintiff, Edward C. Hanks, brought an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois against the defendants, Ned Hubbard and others, alleging that they violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution by acting with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The plaintiff claimed that he suffered from a chronic eye condition that required medical attention and that the defendant, Dr. Hubbard, prescribed him ketotifen. The plaintiff further claimed that the ketotifen eye drops caused him adverse reactions, such as severe pain, burning, and blurred vision, and that the defendant, Dr. Hubbard, failed to offer him an alternative medication or refer him to an ophthalmologist. The plaintiff also claimed that he sustained permanent eye damage as a result of the ketotifen. The district court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed the district court's judgment on 7 February 2022. == Research == === Anatomy === Human mast cell heterogeneity (diversity) significantly impacts the efficacy of ketotifen in preventing mediator release (mast cell activation). In experiments, ketotifen inhibits mast cells from lung and tonsillar tissues when stimulated via an IgE-dependent histamine release mechanism. However, neither ketotifen nor disodium cromoglycate, another mast cell stabilizer, failed to inhibit mediator release from skin mast cells, that were unresponsive to these stabilizers. Such patterns of mast cell activation suggests the existence of different types of mast cells across various tissues—a topic of ongoing research. === Metabolism === Research directions for ketotifen include the investigation of norketotifen (NK), a metabolite of ketotifen. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and hepatocytes suggest that NK may be the major demethylated hepatic metabolite of ketotifen. Unlike ketotifen, NK does not seem to induce severe sedative effects, potentially allowing for higher doses to be administered without sedation as a limiting factor. Furthermore, NK may probably have potent and dose-dependent inhibition of the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, suggesting potential anti-inflammatory activity. thus, ketotifen can probably be considered a sedating prodrug that converts to NK, a nonsedating metabolite with anti-inflammatory properties, when used as an anti-inflammatory medication. The potential future applications of norketotifen are researched by Emergo Therapeutics, a US company. === Conditions === ==== Increased appetite and weight gain ==== The underlying mechanisms of why ketotifen (similarly to other antihistamine drugs such as astemizole, azelastine) may increase appetite and lead to weight gain in some people, are not fully understood. Different studies have shown conflicting results about the amount of weight gain caused by ketotifen. In one study (postmarketing surveillance), it was found that around 1 to 2 out of every 100 people who took the drug experienced weight gain, with adults gaining about 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) and children over the age of one gaining 2.8–3.3 kilograms (6.2–7.3 lb). However, in another study, adults gained a higher amount of weight: 5.0–5.4 kilograms (11.0–11.9 lb). Ketotifen exhibits a chemical resemblance to pizotifen, a substance known for its appetite-stimulating properties. One proposed mechanism of the increase in appetite involves the inhibitory effect of ketotifen on the production of TNF-α, which is a cytokine that plays a role in regulating energy metabolism. TNF-α can act directly on adipocytes (fat cells) to regulate the release of leptin. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue and acts as a satiety signal by binding to receptors in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits appetite. By reducing TNF-α production, ketotifen may lead to decreased leptin levels, reducing appetite control inhibition. Furthermore, ketotifen's influence on serotonin regulation could be involved in central serotonin disinhibition. Serotonin is known to have suppressant effects on appetite. It is suggested that ketotifen might cause a decrease in serotonin levels due to this regulatory influence. As a result, the decrease in serotonin function may lead to increased food intake tendencies and heightened appetite. Still, these potential mechanisms have been hypothesized based on limited evidence. Studies on mice suggest that caffeine or citrus aurantifolia oil may prevent weight-gain induced by ketotifen, but, this has not been confirmed on human subjects. ==== Irritable bowel syndrome ==== Ketotifen is being studied in context of a possible link between abnormalities in intestinal mast cells and irritable bowel syndrome, but there are no solid results yet. == References == == External links ==",Zaditor,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002828436263371259), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019472938729450107)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/zaditor.html ', [])"

3814,"('Brompheniramine (maleate)', '(¬±)-brompheniramine (maleate)', 'Parabromdylamine', 'Brompheniraminum', 'Bromfeniramina')",Medical," We tested the efficacy of brompheniramine maleate in a large randomized, controlled trial of volunteers with experimental rhinovirus colds. Brompheniramine (12 mg) or placebo was administered at 8:00 A.M. and 8:00 P.M. for < or = 4 days after the onset of symptoms (24, 36, or 48 hours after virus challenge). During the first 3 days of treatment (the first 4 days after virus challenge), nasal secretion weights were lower for infected evaluable subjects receiving brompheniramine (n = 113) than for controls (day 1: 4.3 g vs. 6.8 g; day 2: 4.8 g vs. 7.7 g; and day 3: 3.3 g vs. 5.3 g) (P < or = .03), as were rhinorrhea scores (day 1: 0.6 vs. 0.8; day 2: 0.5 vs. 0.8; and day 3: 0.3 vs. 0.5) (P < .03), sneeze counts (day 1: 1.8 vs. 3.6; day 2: 2.1 vs. 5.1; and day 3: 1.3 vs. 3.3) (P < or = .001), and sneeze severity scores (day 1: 0.3 vs. 0.6; day 2: 0.25 vs. 0.7; and day 3: 0.2 vs. 0.4) (P < .001) (n = 112). Cough counts were lower after day 1 of treatment for the brompheniramine group than for controls (4.7 vs. 7.9) (P = .05) (day 2 after virus challenge), and other symptoms were modestly reduced or were unaffected in the brompheniramine group. Total symptom scores were also lower for the brompheniramine group than for controls on treatment days 1 (4.8 vs. 6.0) (P = .03) and 2 (4.1 vs. 5.6) (days 2 and 3 after virus challenge) (P = .003). Treatment with brompheniramine was associated with the adverse effects of somnolence (n = 3) and confusion (n = 1).

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel study comparing the effectiveness, at recommended doses, of an extended-release formulation of brompheniramine maleate and terfenadine in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Subjects with symptoms of seasonal and/or perennial allergic rhinitis received brompheniramine 12 mg (n = 106), 8 mg (n = 105), terfenadine 60 mg (n = 106), or placebo (n = 53) twice daily for 14 days. On treatment days 3, 7, and 14, symptom severity ratings (i.e., rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, itchy nose, eyes or throat, excessive tearing, postnasal drip) were completed by the physician; subjects and physicians each completed a global efficacy evaluation. Brompheniramine 12 mg and 8 mg and terfenadine were more effective than placebo (p < or = 0.05) on the physicians' global: brompheniramine 12 mg was more effective than terfenadine (p < or = 0.05) on days 7 and 14 and brompheniramine 8 mg on day 3. On the subjects' global evaluation, brompheniramine 12 mg and 8 mg and terfenadine were more effective than placebo (p < or = 0.05); brompheniramine 12 mg was more effective than terfenadine (p < or = 0.05) on days 7 and 14 and brompheniramine 8 mg on day 3. In general, brompheniramine 8 mg was comparable to terfenadine. On days 3 and 7, the total symptom and total nasal symptom severity scores for subjects receiving brompheniramine 12 mg were significantly more improved than for placebo (p < 0.05); terfenadine was not different from placebo; brompheniramine 12 mg was significantly better than terfenadine on day 7 (p < 0.05) for reducing total symptom severity and on days 3, 7, and 14 for reducing total nasal symptom severity. Adverse experiences were reported by 155 (41.9%) of the 370 subjects enrolled in the study. The overall rate of adverse experiences in the brompheniramine 12 mg treatment group (57.5%) was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than for brompheniramine 8 mg (38.1%), terfenadine (31.1%), and placebo (39.6%). In conclusion, an extended-release formulation of brompheniramine 12 mg or 8 mg bid alleviates allergic rhinitis symptoms and brompheniramine 12 mg provides significantly better relief of these symptoms than terfenadine 60 mg bid.",Brompheniramine (maleate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011062010162277147), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00034850722295232117)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682545.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Brompheniramine: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682545.html?utm_source=openai')])"

3816,"('Propidium (iodide)', 'Propidium-iodide', 'Phenanthridinium, 3,8-diamino-5-(3-(diethylmethylammonio)propyl)-6-phenyl-', 'Propidium iodide, 2', 'Kbiogr_000378')",Medical," Propidium iodide (PI) is a small fluorescent molecule that binds to DNA but cannot passively traverse into cells that possess an intact plasma membrane. PI uptake versus exclusion can be used to discriminate dead cells, in which plasma membranes become permeable regardless of the mechanism of death, from live cells with intact membranes. PI is excited by wavelengths between 400 and 600 nm and emits light between 600 and 700 nm, and is therefore compatible with lasers and photodetectors commonly available in flow cytometers. This protocol for PI staining can be used to quantitate cell death in most modern research facilities and universities. The surface of healthy cells is composed of lipids that are asymmetrically distributed on the inner and outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. One of these lipids, phosphatidylserine (PS), is normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and is, therefore, only exposed to the cell cytoplasm. However, during apoptosis lipid asymmetry is lost and PS becomes exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Annexin V, a 36-kDa calcium-binding protein, binds to PS; therefore, fluorescently labeled Annexin V can be used to detect PS that is exposed on the outside of apoptotic cells. Annexin V can also stain necrotic cells because these cells have ruptured membranes that permit Annexin V to access the entire plasma membrane. However, apoptotic cells can be distinguished from necrotic cells by co-staining with propidium iodide (PI) because PI enters necrotic cells but is excluded from apoptotic cells. This protocol describes Annexin V binding and PI uptake followed by flow cytometry to detect and quantify apoptotic and necrotic cells. Studies of cellular apoptosis have been significantly impacted since the introduction of flow cytometry-based methods. Propidium iodide (PI) is widely used in conjunction with Annexin V to determine if cells are viable, apoptotic, or necrotic through differences in plasma membrane integrity and permeability. The Annexin V/PI protocol is a commonly used approach for studying apoptotic cells. PI is used more often than other nuclear stains because it is economical, stable and a good indicator of cell viability, based on its capacity to exclude dye in living cells. The ability of PI to enter a cell is dependent upon the permeability of the membrane; PI does not stain live or early apoptotic cells due to the presence of an intact plasma membrane. In late apoptotic and necrotic cells, the integrity of the plasma and nuclear membranes decreases, allowing PI to pass through the membranes, intercalate into nucleic acids, and display red fluorescence. Unfortunately, we find that conventional Annexin V/ PI protocols lead to a significant number of false positive events (up to 40%), which are associated with PI staining of RNA within the cytoplasmic compartment. Primary cells and cell lines in a broad range of animal models are affected, with large cells (nuclear: cytoplasmic ratios <0.5) showing the highest occurrence. Herein, we demonstrate a modified Annexin V/ PI method that provides a significant improvement for assessment of cell death compared to conventional methods. This protocol takes advantage of changes in cellular permeability during cell fixing to promote entry of RNase A into cells following staining. Both the timing and concentration of RNase A have been optimized for removal of cytoplasmic RNA. The result is a significant improvement over conventional Annexin V/ PI protocols (< 5% events with cytoplasmic PI staining).",Propidium (iodide),PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5767921209335327)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.45616233348846436), ('DU', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.47416871786117554), ('ĠMED', -0.16312898695468903), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008656949736177921)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0649547353386879), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Its side chain is similar to that of glutamic acid, except the carboxylic acid group is replaced by an amide. It is classified as a charge-neutral, polar amino acid. It is non-essential and conditionally essential in humans, meaning the body can usually synthesize sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body's demand for glutamine increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. It is encoded by the codons CAA and CAG. It is named after glutamic acid, which in turn is named after its discovery in cereal proteins, gluten. In human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid. The dietary sources of glutamine include especially the protein-rich foods like beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs, vegetables like beans, beets, cabbage, spinach, carrots, parsley, vegetable juices and also in wheat, papaya, Brussels sprouts, celery, kale and fermented foods like miso. The one-letter symbol Q for glutamine was assigned in alphabetical sequence to N for asparagine, being larger by merely one methylene –CH2– group. Note that P was used for proline, and O was avoided due to similarity with D. The mnemonic Qlutamine was also proposed. == Functions == Glutamine plays a role in a variety of biochemical functions: Protein synthesis, as any other of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids Lipid synthesis, especially by cancer cells. Regulation of acid-base balance in the kidney by producing ammonium Cellular energy, as a source, next to glucose Nitrogen donation for many anabolic processes, including the synthesis of purines Carbon donation, as a source, refilling the citric acid cycle Nontoxic transporter of ammonia in the blood circulation. Integrity of healthy intestinal mucosa, though small randomized trials have shown no benefit in Crohn's disease. === Roles in metabolism === Glutamine maintains redox balance by participating in glutathione synthesis and contributing to anabolic processes such as lipid synthesis by reductive carboxylation. Glutamine provides a source of carbon and nitrogen for use in other metabolic processes. Glutamine is present in serum at higher concentrations than other amino acids and is essential for many cellular functions. Examples include the synthesis of nucleotides and non-essential amino acids. One of the most important functions of glutamine is its ability to be converted into α-KG, which helps to maintain the flow of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, generating ATP via the electron carriers NADH and FADH2. The highest consumption of glutamine occurs in the cells of the intestines, kidney cells (where it is used for acid-base balance), activated immune cells, and many cancer cells. == Production == Glutamine is produced industrially using mutants of Brevibacterium flavum, which gives ca. 40 g/L in 2 days using glucose as a carbon source. === Biosynthesis === Glutamine synthesis from glutamate and ammonia is catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine synthetase. The majority of glutamine production occurs in muscle tissue, accounting for about 90% of all glutamine synthesized. Glutamine is also released, in small amounts, by the lungs and brain. Although the liver is capable of glutamine synthesis, its role in glutamine metabolism is more regulatory than productive, as the liver takes up glutamine derived from the gut via the hepatic portal system. == Uses == === Nutrition === Glutamine is the most abundant naturally occurring, nonessential amino acid in the human body, and one of the few amino acids that can directly cross the blood–brain barrier. Humans obtain glutamine through catabolism of proteins in foods they eat. In states where tissue is being built or repaired, like growth of babies, or healing from wounds or severe illness, glutamine becomes conditionally essential. === Sickle cell disease === In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved L-glutamine oral powder, marketed as Endari, to reduce severe complications of sickle cell disease in people aged five years and older with the disorder. The safety and efficacy of L-glutamine oral powder were studied in a randomized trial of subjects ages five to 58 years old with sickle cell disease who had two or more painful crises within the 12 months prior to enrollment in the trial. Subjects were assigned randomly to treatment with L-glutamine oral powder or placebo, and the effect of treatment was evaluated over 48 weeks. Subjects who were treated with L-glutamine oral powder experienced fewer hospital visits for pain treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or ketorolac (sickle cell crises), on average, compared to subjects who received a placebo (median 3 vs. median 4), fewer hospitalizations for sickle cell pain (median 2 vs. median 3), and fewer days in the hospital (median 6.5 days vs. median 11 days). Subjects who received L-glutamine oral powder also had fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome (a life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease) compared with patients who received a placebo (8.6 percent vs. 23.1 percent). Common side effects of L-glutamine oral powder include constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in the extremities, back pain and chest pain. L-glutamine oral powder received orphan drug designation. The FDA granted the approval of Endari to Emmaus Medical Inc. === Medical food === Glutamine is marketed as medical food and is prescribed when a medical professional believes a person in their care needs supplementary glutamine due to metabolic demands beyond what can be met by endogenous synthesis or diet. == Safety == Glutamine is safe in adults and in preterm infants. Although glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia, both of which have neurological effects, their concentrations are not increased much, and no adverse neurological effects were detected. The observed safe level for supplemental L-glutamine in normal healthy adults is 14 g/day. Adverse effects of glutamine have been described for people receiving home parenteral nutrition and those with liver-function abnormalities. Although glutamine has no effect on the proliferation of tumor cells, it is still possible that glutamine supplementation may be detrimental in some cancer types. Ceasing glutamine supplementation in people adapted to very high consumption may initiate a withdrawal effect, raising the risk of health problems such as infections or impaired integrity of the intestine. == Structure == Glutamine can exist in either of two enantiomeric forms, L-glutamine and D-glutamine. The L-form is found in nature. Glutamine contains an α-amino group which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions and a carboxylic acid group which is in the deprotonated −COO− form, known as carboxylate, under physiological conditions. == Research == Glutamine mouthwash may be useful to prevent oral mucositis in people undergoing chemotherapy but intravenous glutamine does not appear useful to prevent mucositis in the GI tract. Glutamine supplementation was thought to have potential to reduce complications in people who are critically ill or who have had abdominal surgery but this was based on poor quality clinical trials. Supplementation does not appear to be useful in adults or children with Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel disease, but clinical studies as of 2016 were underpowered. Supplementation does not appear to have an effect in infants with significant problems of the stomach or intestines. Some athletes use L-glutamine as supplement. Studies support the positive effects of the chronic oral administration of the supplement on the injury and inflammation induced by intense aerobic and exhaustive exercise, but the effects on muscle recovery from weight training are unclear. Stress conditions for plants (drought, injury, soil salnity) cause the synthesis of such plant enzymes as superoxide dismutase, L-ascorbate oxidase, and Delta 1 DNA polymerase. Limiting this process, initiated by the conditions of strong soil salinity can be achieved by administering exogenous glutamine to plants. The decrease in the level of expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of superoxide dismutase increases with the increase in glutamine concentration. == See also == Isoglutamine Trinucleotide repeat disorder PolyQ tract == References == == External links == Glutamine spectra acquired through mass spectroscopy",Glutamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.08531420677900314), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.048603612929582596), (',', -6.704273118884885e-07), (' MED', -0.0009412388317286968), ('ICAL', -4.320199877838604e-07)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.25142890214920044), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -1.1324817933200393e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.06198565289378166), (',', -0.0007120219524949789), ('ĠMED', -0.0015334049239754677), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006738912779837847)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -1.318681188422488e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -2.236549335066229e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine?utm_source=openai), [americaninternationalingredients.com](https://www.americaninternationalingredients.com/ingredient-categories/amino-acids/l-glutamine/?utm_source=openai), [americaninternationalfoods.com](https://www.americaninternationalfoods.com/ingredient-categories/amino-acids/l-glutamine/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=419, start_index=42, title='Glutamine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=419, start_index=42, title='L-Glutamine - American International Ingredients, Inc.', type='url_citation', url='https://www.americaninternationalingredients.com/ingredient-categories/amino-acids/l-glutamine/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=419, start_index=42, title='L-Glutamine - American International Foods, Inc.', type='url_citation', url='https://www.americaninternationalfoods.com/ingredient-categories/amino-acids/l-glutamine/?utm_source=openai')])"

The decrease in the level of expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of superoxide dismutase increases with the increase in glutamine concentration. == See also == Isoglutamine Trinucleotide repeat disorder PolyQ tract == References == == External links == Glutamine spectra acquired through mass spectroscopy",Glutamin,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.05088400840759277), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -3.1424973713001236e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.05490913987159729), (',', -1.5048530030981055e-06), (' MED', -0.0030984506011009216), ('ICAL', -3.128163257315464e-07)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.46253734827041626), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -1.4662635294371285e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.048611514270305634), (',', -0.0031838936265558004), ('ĠMED', -0.001961690140888095), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002502407180145383)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.06229502707719803)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine?utm_source=openai), [go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00130?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=182, start_index=27, title='Glutamine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=182, start_index=27, title='L-Glutamine: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00130?utm_source=openai')])"
3819,"('Glutamine', 'Glutamic acid 5-amide', 'Levoglutamide', 'Glutamic acid amide', 'H-gln-oh')","Endogenous, Medical","Glutamine (symbol Gln or Q) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Its side chain is similar to that of glutamic acid, except the carboxylic acid group is replaced by an amide. It is classified as a charge-neutral, polar amino acid. It is non-essential and conditionally essential in humans, meaning the body can usually synthesize sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body's demand for glutamine increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. It is encoded by the codons CAA and CAG. It is named after glutamic acid, which in turn is named after its discovery in cereal proteins, gluten. In human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid. The dietary sources of glutamine include especially the protein-rich foods like beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs, vegetables like beans, beets, cabbage, spinach, carrots, parsley, vegetable juices and also in wheat, papaya, Brussels sprouts, celery, kale and fermented foods like miso. The one-letter symbol Q for glutamine was assigned in alphabetical sequence to N for asparagine, being larger by merely one methylene –CH2– group. Note that P was used for proline, and O was avoided due to similarity with D. The mnemonic Qlutamine was also proposed. == Functions == Glutamine plays a role in a variety of biochemical functions: Protein synthesis, as any other of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids Lipid synthesis, especially by cancer cells. Regulation of acid-base balance in the kidney by producing ammonium Cellular energy, as a source, next to glucose Nitrogen donation for many anabolic processes, including the synthesis of purines Carbon donation, as a source, refilling the citric acid cycle Nontoxic transporter of ammonia in the blood circulation. Integrity of healthy intestinal mucosa, though small randomized trials have shown no benefit in Crohn's disease. === Roles in metabolism === Glutamine maintains redox balance by participating in glutathione synthesis and contributing to anabolic processes such as lipid synthesis by reductive carboxylation. Glutamine provides a source of carbon and nitrogen for use in other metabolic processes. Glutamine is present in serum at higher concentrations than other amino acids and is essential for many cellular functions. Examples include the synthesis of nucleotides and non-essential amino acids. One of the most important functions of glutamine is its ability to be converted into α-KG, which helps to maintain the flow of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, generating ATP via the electron carriers NADH and FADH2. The highest consumption of glutamine occurs in the cells of the intestines, kidney cells (where it is used for acid-base balance), activated immune cells, and many cancer cells. == Production == Glutamine is produced industrially using mutants of Brevibacterium flavum, which gives ca. 40 g/L in 2 days using glucose as a carbon source. === Biosynthesis === Glutamine synthesis from glutamate and ammonia is catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine synthetase. The majority of glutamine production occurs in muscle tissue, accounting for about 90% of all glutamine synthesized. Glutamine is also released, in small amounts, by the lungs and brain. Although the liver is capable of glutamine synthesis, its role in glutamine metabolism is more regulatory than productive, as the liver takes up glutamine derived from the gut via the hepatic portal system. == Uses == === Nutrition === Glutamine is the most abundant naturally occurring, nonessential amino acid in the human body, and one of the few amino acids that can directly cross the blood–brain barrier. Humans obtain glutamine through catabolism of proteins in foods they eat. In states where tissue is being built or repaired, like growth of babies, or healing from wounds or severe illness, glutamine becomes conditionally essential. === Sickle cell disease === In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved L-glutamine oral powder, marketed as Endari, to reduce severe complications of sickle cell disease in people aged five years and older with the disorder. The safety and efficacy of L-glutamine oral powder were studied in a randomized trial of subjects ages five to 58 years old with sickle cell disease who had two or more painful crises within the 12 months prior to enrollment in the trial. Subjects were assigned randomly to treatment with L-glutamine oral powder or placebo, and the effect of treatment was evaluated over 48 weeks. Subjects who were treated with L-glutamine oral powder experienced fewer hospital visits for pain treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or ketorolac (sickle cell crises), on average, compared to subjects who received a placebo (median 3 vs. median 4), fewer hospitalizations for sickle cell pain (median 2 vs. median 3), and fewer days in the hospital (median 6.5 days vs. median 11 days). Subjects who received L-glutamine oral powder also had fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome (a life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease) compared with patients who received a placebo (8.6 percent vs. 23.1 percent). Common side effects of L-glutamine oral powder include constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in the extremities, back pain and chest pain. L-glutamine oral powder received orphan drug designation. The FDA granted the approval of Endari to Emmaus Medical Inc. === Medical food === Glutamine is marketed as medical food and is prescribed when a medical professional believes a person in their care needs supplementary glutamine due to metabolic demands beyond what can be met by endogenous synthesis or diet. == Safety == Glutamine is safe in adults and in preterm infants. Although glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia, both of which have neurological effects, their concentrations are not increased much, and no adverse neurological effects were detected. The observed safe level for supplemental L-glutamine in normal healthy adults is 14 g/day. Adverse effects of glutamine have been described for people receiving home parenteral nutrition and those with liver-function abnormalities. Although glutamine has no effect on the proliferation of tumor cells, it is still possible that glutamine supplementation may be detrimental in some cancer types. Ceasing glutamine supplementation in people adapted to very high consumption may initiate a withdrawal effect, raising the risk of health problems such as infections or impaired integrity of the intestine. == Structure == Glutamine can exist in either of two enantiomeric forms, L-glutamine and D-glutamine. The L-form is found in nature. Glutamine contains an α-amino group which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions and a carboxylic acid group which is in the deprotonated −COO− form, known as carboxylate, under physiological conditions. == Research == Glutamine mouthwash may be useful to prevent oral mucositis in people undergoing chemotherapy but intravenous glutamine does not appear useful to prevent mucositis in the GI tract. Glutamine supplementation was thought to have potential to reduce complications in people who are critically ill or who have had abdominal surgery but this was based on poor quality clinical trials. Supplementation does not appear to be useful in adults or children with Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel disease, but clinical studies as of 2016 were underpowered. Supplementation does not appear to have an effect in infants with significant problems of the stomach or intestines. Some athletes use L-glutamine as supplement. Studies support the positive effects of the chronic oral administration of the supplement on the injury and inflammation induced by intense aerobic and exhaustive exercise, but the effects on muscle recovery from weight training are unclear. Stress conditions for plants (drought, injury, soil salnity) cause the synthesis of such plant enzymes as superoxide dismutase, L-ascorbate oxidase, and Delta 1 DNA polymerase. Limiting this process, initiated by the conditions of strong soil salinity can be achieved by administering exogenous glutamine to plants. The decrease in the level of expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of superoxide dismutase increases with the increase in glutamine concentration. == See also == Isoglutamine Trinucleotide repeat disorder PolyQ tract == References == == External links == Glutamine spectra acquired through mass spectroscopy",Levoglutamide,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.13002818822860718), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -1.6240566083070007e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -0.08896128088235855), (',', -1.0206720617134124e-05), (' MED', -0.0019645551219582558), ('ICAL', -3.128163257315464e-07)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.7072197794914246), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.26257264614105225)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.02975071594119072)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL; ([medicinesfaq.com](https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/levoglutamide?utm_source=openai), [foodb.ca](https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB012164?utm_source=openai), [ema.europa.eu](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/orphan-designations/eu-3-12-1011?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=27, title='Levoglutamide: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, FAQ - MedicinesFAQ', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/levoglutamide?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=27, title='Showing Compound Levoglutamide (FDB012164) - FooDB', type='url_citation', url='https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB012164?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=27, title='EU/3/12/1011 - orphan designation for treatment of sickle cell disease | European Medicines Agency (EMA)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/orphan-designations/eu-3-12-1011?utm_source=openai')])"
3820,"('Lercanidipine (hydrochloride)', 'Lercanidipine', 'Masnidipine', 'Lercanadipine', 'Lercanil')",Medical,"Lercanidipine (trade name Zanidip, among others) is an antihypertensive (blood pressure lowering) drug. It belongs to the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which work by relaxing and opening the blood vessels allowing the blood to circulate more freely around the body. This lowers the blood pressure and allows the heart to work more efficiently. The drug acts more slowly than older dihydropyridines. It probably has fewer adverse effects, but a comparatively high potential for drug interactions. It was patented in 1984 and first approved for medical use in 1997. The FDA refused to approve the drug, and lercanidipine is not marketed in the United States. == Medical uses == Lercanidipine is used for the treatment of essential hypertension (high blood pressure). Lercanidipine seems to be a good agent in treating hypertensive patients that also have kidney issues. == Contraindications == Like other dihydropyridines, lercanidipine is contraindicated in unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac failure, shortly after a myocardial infarction, and in patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. It is also contraindicated during pregnancy and in women who may become pregnant, because data regarding safety for the unborn are lacking, as well as in patients with severe liver and renal impairment. The drug must not be combined with strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 or with the immunosuppressant drug ciclosporin. == Adverse effects == Lercanidipine is generally well tolerated; no single adverse effect has been observed in more than 1% of patients treated with this drug. Typical side effects are similar to those of other drugs of this class and include headache, dizziness, tachycardia (fast heartbeat), palpitations, flush, and oedema. Hypersensitivity reactions occur in less than one patient in 10,000. Oedemas are significantly less common under lercanidipine when compared to first-generation dihydropyridines such as nifedipine. For other side effects, data are inconclusive: A study comparing lercanidipine to first-generation drugs found no difference in the frequency of headache and flush, but switching from amlodipine, felodipine or nitrendipine (all at least second generation) to lercanidipine significantly decreased side effects in another study. == Overdose == Overdosing of up to 80 times the usual therapeutic dose has been described. Expected symptoms include severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and reflex tachycardia. Bradycardia (slow heartbeat) can also occur due to blockage of calcium channels in the atrioventricular node of the heart. There is no treatment besides monitoring blood pressure and heart function. Dialysis is likely ineffective because most of the lercanidipine is bound to blood plasma proteins and lipid membranes of cells. == Interactions == The substance is metabolised by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. In a study, the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increased the maximal blood plasma concentrations of lercanidipine by a factor of eight, and the area under the curve by a factor of 15. In another study, ciclosporin increased lercanidipine plasma levels threefold when given at the same time. Other inhibitors of this enzyme, such as itraconazole, erythromycin, and grapefruit juice, are also expected to increase plasma concentrations and thus amplify the antihypertensive effect. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors such as carbamazepine, rifampicin, and St John's wort probably lower plasma levels and effectiveness of lercanidipine. By comparison, amlodipine has a lower potential for CYP3A4 mediated interactions. Lercanidipine increases plasma levels of ciclosporin and digoxin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Like other dihydropyridine class calcium channel blockers, lercanidipine blocks L-type calcium channels in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, relaxing them and thus lowering blood pressure. In contrast to the non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem, it does not significantly act on calcium channels in the atrioventricular node, and therefore does not decrease heart rate, in usual therapeutic doses. === Pharmacokinetics === Lercanidipine is slowly but completely absorbed from the gut. It has a total bioavailability of 10% due to an extensive first-pass effect, or up to 40% if taken after a fatty meal. Highest blood plasma levels are reached after 1.5 to 3 hours. The substance is quickly distributed into the tissues and bound to lipid membranes, where it forms a depot. The circulating fraction is almost completely (>98%) bound to plasma proteins. It is completely metabolized in the liver, mainly via CYP3A4. Elimination half-life is 8 to 10 hours, and the drug does not accumulate. Because of the depot effect, the antihypertensive action lasts for at least 24 hours. 50% is excreted via the urine. == Chemistry == Lercanidipine is used in form of the hydrochloride, which is a slightly yellow crystalline powder and melts at 197 to 201 °C (387 to 394 °F) in crystal form I or 207 to 211 °C (405 to 412 °F) in crystal form II. It is readily soluble in chloroform and methanol, but practically insoluble in water. This high lipophilicity (compared to older dihydropyridines) is intentional because it causes the substance to bind to lipid membranes, allowing for a longer duration of action. The lercanidipine molecule has one asymmetric carbon atom. While the S-enantiomer is more effective than the R-enantiomer, marketed formulations contain a 1:1 mixture of both (i.e., the racemate). === Detection in body fluids === Blood plasma concentrations of lercanidipine can be detected by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry methods. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Diseases Database (DDB): 31597",Masnidipine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.061976537108421326), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.20353896915912628), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.010319212451577187)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09238,https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/10409,https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/lercadip ', [])"
3821,"('Docetaxel', 'Taxotere', 'Docetaxel anhydrous', 'Docetaxol', 'Emdoc')",Medical,"Docetaxel (DTX or DXL), sold under the brand name Taxotere among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes breast cancer, head and neck cancer, stomach cancer, prostate cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. It may be used by itself or along with other chemotherapy medication. It is given by slow injection into a vein. Common side effects include hair loss, cytopenia (low blood cell counts), numbness, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and muscle pains. Other severe side effects include allergic reactions and future cancers. Docetaxel induced pneumotoxicity is also a well recognized adverse effect which has to be identified timely and treated after withholding the drug. Side effects are more common in people with liver problems. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Docetaxel is in the taxane family of medications. It works by disrupting the normal function of microtubules and thereby stopping cell division. Docetaxel was patented in 1986 and approved for medical use in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Docetaxel is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Docetaxel is used in the treatment of various cancers, including breast, lung, prostate, gastric, head and neck, and ovarian cancer. Clinical data have shown docetaxel to have cytotoxic activity against breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, prostate, liver, renal, gastric, and head and neck cancers and melanoma. In hormone-refractory prostate cancer docetaxel improves life expectancy and overall life quality. The optimal dose scheduling of taxanes remains unconfirmed, but most studies find significant mortality benefit following either a three-week or a one-week administration schedule. While a 2010 article in Current Clinical Pharmacology states, ""weekly administration has emerged as the optimal schedule,"" the official docetaxel package insert recommends administration every three weeks. === Outcomes === Treatment with docetaxel increases survival time in people with certain types of cancer. While some clinical trials show median survival times to be increased by approximately only three months, the range of survival time is large. Many people survive beyond five years with treatment from docetaxel, however it is difficult to attribute these findings directly to treatment with docetaxel. Improved median survival time and response indicates that docetaxel slows metastatic cancer progression and can lead to disease-free survival. Conjunctive treatment of prednisone with docetaxel has been shown to lead to improved survival rate as well as improved quality of life and reduction of pain compared with treatments with mitoxantrone. As well as inhibiting mitosis, the presence of docetaxel has been found to lead to the phosphorylation of the oncoprotein bcl-2, which leads to apoptosis of cancer cells that had previously blocked the apoptotic inducing mechanism, leading to tumour regression. Enhanced effects of radiation therapy when combined with docetaxel has been observed in mice. Docetaxel has also been found to have greater cellular uptake and is retained longer intracellularly than paclitaxel allowing docetaxel treatment to be effective with a smaller dose, leading to fewer and less severe adverse effects. === Breast cancer === Docetaxel and paclitaxel have comparable efficacy metastatic breast cancer but paclitaxel has less severe side effects. Additionally, it has been noted that docetaxel is prone to cellular drug resistance via a variety of different mechanisms. === Monitoring and combination use === Docetaxel is administered via a one-hour infusion every three weeks over ten or more cycles. Treatment is given under the supervision of an oncologist. Strict monitoring of blood cell counts, liver function, serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, heart function, oxygen saturation and fluid retention is required detect adverse reactions and toxicity so that treatment can be modified or terminated if necessary. Premedication with corticosteroids is recommended before each administration of docetaxel to reduce fluid retention and hypersensitive reactions. Other medications will often be given to aid pain management and other symptoms. The treatment of breast cancer with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is enhanced by adjuvant treatment with docetaxel. Docetaxel is also used in combination with capecitabine, a DNA synthesis inhibitor. == Side effects == Docetaxel is a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent. As with all chemotherapy, adverse effects are common, and many side effects have been documented. Because docetaxel is a cell-cycle-specific agent, it is cytotoxic to all dividing cells in the body. This includes tumour cells as well as hair follicles, bone marrow and other germ cells. For this reason, common chemotherapy side effects such as hair loss occur; sometimes this can be permanent. North west France are conducting a survey to establish exactly how many people are affected in this way. Independent studies show it could be as high as 6.3%, which puts it in the 'common and frequent' classification. Haematological adverse effects include neutropenia (95.5%), anaemia (90.4%), febrile neutropenia (11.0%) and thrombocytopenia (8.0%). Deaths due to toxicity accounted for 1.7% of the 2045 patients, and incidence was increased (9.8%) in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (liver dysfunction). The use of docetaxel during chemotherapy, especially when given weekly, may lead to complications with the lacrimal drainage system. The mechanism for this problem seems to be secretion of docetaxel by the lacrimal gland which can then cause stenosis, or narrowing, of the punctum and canalicular outflow system. In most cases the primary symptoms is epiphora or tearing. When treated early most patients can avoid the need for surgery, but some cases the only cure is a conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy in which a glass tube is placed to bypass the tear duct. Taxane-induced pneumotoxicity is rare. However, 1–5% of patients taking docetaxel may develop severe pneumotoxicity. Patients may develop exertional breathlessness and desaturation which needs to be detected early. Chest X-Ray may show bilateral opacities and High Resolution CT chest may reveal Organizing Pneumonia (OP) pattern or Non-Specific Organizing Pneumonia (NSIP) pattern or a combination. Docetaxel-induced DPLD is a fatal adverse effect, which can be managed by the cessation of the drug and starting on steroids in adequate doses. Observations of severe side effects in the above 40 phase II and phase III studies were also recorded. Many more side effects have been reported for conjunctive and adjuvant treatment with docetaxel as well as rare post-marketing events. === Contraindications and patient factors === Docetaxel is contraindicated for use with patients with a baseline neutrophil count less than 1500 cells/μL, a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel or polysorbate 80, severe liver impairment and pregnant or breast-feeding women. Side effects are experienced more frequently by patients of 65 years or older, but dosage is usually not decreased. Kidney failure is thought not to be a significant factor for docetaxel dosage adjustment. Patients with hepatic insufficiency resulting in serum bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) should not be administered docetaxel, though this is not a stated contraindication. Dosage should be reduced by 20% in people who develop grade 3 or 4 diarrhea following exposure to docetaxel, hepatotoxicity defined by liver enzymes at levels greater than five times the ULN, and grade 2 palmer-planter toxicity. Paediatric trials of docetaxel have been limited, and so safety of use in patients under 16 years has not been established. === Pregnancy === Based on the limited data available, docetaxel appears to be safe in pregnancy if administered during the second and third trimesters; however, maternal and fetal risks should be weighed against benefits to determine the appropriate course of action. As with all chemotherapeutic agents, docetaxel administered to pregnant animals causes a variety of embryofetal toxicities, including death, when given during the period of organogenesis. Yet adequate studies investigating maternal and fetal effects in humans are lacking. One small systematic review that examined the use of taxanes to treat breast cancer in pregnancy showed that, out of 19 patients, only three congenital malformations occurred. Two cases of cerebral ventriculomegaly observed in the study were documented prior to the administration of chemotherapy, suggesting an alternate cause of congenital malformation. The third case involved pyloric stenosis in an infant whose mother received a combination regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; because the fetus was exposed to multiple drugs in utero, it remains difficult to identify docetaxel as the causative teratogenic agent. Further studies are needed to better assess the safety of docetaxel in pregnancy and determine appropriate dosing in pregnant women. === Drug interactions === Drug interactions may be the result of altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics due to one of the drugs involved. Cisplatin, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, etoposide, and vinblastine are all potentially co-administered with docetaxel and did not modify docetaxel plasma binding in phase II studies. Cisplatin is known to have a complex interaction with some CYPs and has in some events been shown to reduce docetaxel clearance by up to 25%. Anticonvulsants induce some metabolic pathways relevant to docetaxel. CYP450 and CYP3A show increased expression in response to the use of anticonvulsants and the metabolism of docetaxel metabolite M4 is processed by these CYPs. A corresponding increase in clearance of M4 by 25% is observed in patients taking phenytoin and phenobarbital, common anticonvulsants. Erythromycin, ketoconazole and cyclosporine are CYP3A4 inhibitors and therefore inhibit the metabolic pathway of docetaxel. When used with anticonvulsants, which induce CYP3A4, an increased dose of docetaxel may be required. Pre-treatment with corticosteroids has been used to decrease hypersensitivity reactions and oedema in response to docetaxel and has shown no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. The efficacy of docetaxel was improved by treatment with oral capecitabine, and after more than 27 months follow-up the survival benefit has been confirmed. Doxorubicin was combined with docetaxel in one study of 24 patients and resulted in an increased AUC of docetaxel by 50 to 70%, indicating doxorubicin may affect the disposition of docetaxel. Etoposide has also been shown to decrease docetaxel clearance, though patient numbers for this observation have been low. Prednisone given with docetaxel led to improved survival, quality of life and pain management in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. == Chemistry == Docetaxel is of the chemotherapy drug class; taxane, and is a semi-synthetic analogue of paclitaxel (Taxol), an extract from the bark of the rare Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia. Due to scarcity of paclitaxel, extensive research was carried out leading to the formulation of docetaxel – an esterified product of 10-deacetyl baccatin III, which is extracted from the renewable and more readily available leaves of the European yew tree. Docetaxel differs from paclitaxel at two positions in its chemical structure. It has a hydroxyl functional group on carbon 10, whereas paclitaxel has an acetate ester, and a tert-butyl carbamate ester exists on the phenylpropionate side chain instead of the benzamide in paclitaxel. The carbon 10 functional group change causes docetaxel to be more water-soluble than paclitaxel. === Formulations and compositions === Docetaxel is a white powder and is the active ingredient available in 20 mg and 80 mg Taxotere single-dose vials of concentrated anhydrous docetaxel in polysorbate 80. The solution is a clear brown-yellow containing 40 mg docetaxel and 1040 mg polysorbate 80 per mL. 20 mg Taxotere is distributed in a blister carton containing one single-dose vial of Taxotere (docetaxel) preparation in 0.5 mL sterile pyrogen-free anhydrous polysorbate 80, and a single dose Taxotere solvent vial containing 1.5 mL 13% ethanol in saline to be combined and diluted in a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose for administration. 80 mg Taxotere is supplied identically but with 2.0 mL polysorbate 80 and 6.0 mL 13% ethanol in saline. The docetaxel and solvent vials are combined to give a solution of 10 mg/mL and the required dose is drawn from this solution. Vials have an overfill to compensate for liquid loss during preparation, foaming, adhesion to vial walls and the dead volume. 20 mg vials may be stored for 24 months below 25 °C away from light and 80 mg vials for 26 months in the same conditions. Recently Sanofi has got approval for one-vial formulation. With this one-vial formulation, the preparation of the infusion solution is simplified by eliminating the first dilution step. The two-vial and one-vial formulations contain the same drug substance, docetaxel trihydrate, and the same excipients (ethanol, polysorbate 80 and citric acid). The one-vial formulation is administered as an aqueous intravenous solution that contains the same drug substance in the same concentration as the already approved two-vial formulation. The same grade, quality, and quantity of polysorbate 80 are present in the infusion solution of both formulations. The only difference between these two formulations is the quantity of ethanol. === Active regions === A model based on electron crystallographic density and nuclear magnetic resonance deconvolution has been proposed to explain the binding of docetaxel to β-tubulin. In this T-shaped/butterfly model, a deep hydrophobic cleft exists near the surface of the β-tubulin where three potential hydrogen bonds and multiple hydrophobic contacts bind to docetaxel. The hydrophobic pocket walls contain helices H1, H6, H7 and a loop between H6 and H7 that form hydrophobic interactions with the 3’-benzamido phenyl, 3’-phenyl, and the 2-benzoyl phenyl of docetaxel. 3’-phenyl also has contact with β-sheets B8 and B10. The C-8 methyl of docetaxel has Van der Waals interactions with two residues, Thr-276 and Gln-281 near the C-terminal end of β-tubulin. Docetaxel's O-21 experiences electrostatic attraction to Thr-276 and the C-12 methyl has proximity with Leu-371 on the loop between B9 and B10. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption and distribution === Oral bioavailability has been found to be 8% ±6% on its own and, when co-administered with cyclosporine, bioavailability increased to 90% ± 44%. In practice, docetaxel is administered intravenously only to increase dose precision. Evaluation of docetaxel pharmacokinetics in phase II and III clinical studies were with 100 mg/m2 dosages given over one-hour infusions every three weeks. Docetaxel was shown to be greater than 98% plasma protein bound independent of concentration at 37 °C and pH 7.4 Docetaxel's plasma protein binding includes lipoproteins, alpha1 acid glycoprotein and albumin. Alpha1 acid glycoprotein is the most variable of these proteins inter-individually, especially in cancer patients and is therefore the main determinant of docetaxel's plasma binding variability. Docetaxel interacted little with erythrocytes and was unaffected by the polysorbate 80 in its storage medium. Polysorbate 80 may be the cause of hypersensitivity reasons in taxanes as recent studies indicated. The concentration-time profile of docetaxel was consistent with a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model. An initial, relatively rapid decline, with an α half-life of mean 4.5 minutes is representative of distribution to peripheral compartments from the systemic circulation. A β half-life of mean 38.3 minutes and a relatively slow γ half-life of mean 12.2 hours represent the slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment. Administration a 100 mg/m2 dose over a one-hour infusion gave a mean total body clearance of 21 L/h/m2 and a mean steady state volume of distribution of 73.8 L/m2 or 123 L based on the mean BSA (body surface area) of 1.68 m2. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve had a mean value of 2.8 mg.h/L. The Cmax of docetaxel was found to be 4.15 ± 1.35 mg/L. Increased dose resulted in a linear increase of the area under the concentration-time curve and so it is concluded that dose is directly proportional to plasma concentration. === Metabolism and excretion === Docetaxel is mainly metabolised in the liver by the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 subfamilies of isoenzymes. Metabolism is principally oxidative and at the tert-butylpropionate side chain, resulting first in an alcohol docetaxel (M2), which is then cyclised to three further metabolites (M1, M3 and M4). M1 and M3 are two diastereomeric hydroxyoxazolidinones and M4 is an oxazolidinedione. Phase II trials of 577 patients showed docetaxel clearance is related to body surface area and to hepatic enzyme and alpha1 acid glycoprotein plasma levels. The following model represents docetaxel clearance in humans: where CL is total body clearance (L/h), BSA is total body surface area (m2), AAG and ALB represent alpha1 acid glycoprotein and albumin plasma concentrations (g/L) respectively, and AGE is the patients age (years). HEP12 represents a measure of hepatic dysfunction, affecting clearance of docetaxel. This final model accounted for a modest proportion of patients and identified most of the patients varying from the model (population median of CL = 35.6 L/h) as having hepatic dysfunction, indicating hepatic function as the most unpredictable factor with regards to clearance variability. Patients with significant hepatic dysfunction had an approximately 30% decrease in clearance of docetaxel and were also at a higher risk of toxicity poisoning from docetaxel treatment. Clearance has been shown from population pharmacokinetic studies to decrease significantly with age, increased alpha1 acid glycoprotein and albumin concentrations and decreased body surface area. Renal impairment is unlikely to affect metabolism or excretion of docetaxel as renal excretion contributes less than 5% of elimination. Limited data is available for docetaxel use in children with dosage between 55 and 75 mg/m2. Two paediatric studies have taken place that show a mean clearance of 33 L/h/m2 and concentration-time profiles best fitted by a two-compartmental model of distribution and elimination. Mean distribution half-life was 0.09 hours and mean elimination half-life was 1.4 hours in paediatric studies. Biodistribution of 14C-labelled docetaxel in three patients showed the bulk of the drug to be metabolised and excreted in bile to the faeces. Of the radioactively labelled docetaxel administered, 80% was eliminated to the faeces with 5% in the urine over seven days, an indication that urinary excretion of docetaxel is minimal. Saliva contributed minimal excretion and no excretion was detected through pulmonary means. The terminal half-life of docetaxel was determined as approximately 86 hours, through prolonged plasma sampling, contrary to the clinically stated terminal half-life of 10–18 hours. == Mechanism of action == === Molecular target === Docetaxel binds to microtubules reversibly with high affinity and has a maximum stoichiometry of 1 mole docetaxel per mole tubulin in microtubules. This binding stabilizes microtubules and prevents depolymerisation from calcium ions, decreased temperature and dilution, preferentially at the plus end of the microtubule. Docetaxel has been found to accumulate to higher concentration in ovarian adenocarcinoma cells than kidney carcinoma cells, which may contribute to the more effective treatment of ovarian cancer by docetaxel. It has also been found to lead to the phosphorylation of oncoprotein bcl-2, which is apoptosis-blocking in its oncoprotein form. === Modes of action === The cytotoxic activity of docetaxel is exerted by promoting and stabilising microtubule assembly, while preventing physiological microtubule depolymerisation/disassembly in the absence of GTP. This leads to a significant decrease in free tubulin, needed for microtubule formation and results in inhibition of mitotic cell division between metaphase and anaphase, preventing further cancer cell progeny. Because microtubules do not disassemble in the presence of docetaxel, they accumulate inside the cell and cause initiation of apoptosis. Apoptosis is also encouraged by the blocking of apoptosis-blocking bcl-2 oncoprotein. Both in vitro and in vivo analysis show the anti-neoplastic activity of docetaxel to be effective against a wide range of known cancer cells, cooperate with other anti-neoplastic agents activity, and have greater cytotoxicity than paclitaxel, possibly due to its more rapid intracellular uptake. The main mode of therapeutic action of docetaxel is the suppression of microtubule dynamic assembly and disassembly, rather than microtubule bundling leading to apoptosis, or the blocking of bcl-2. === Cellular responses === Docetaxel exhibits cytotoxic activity on breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, gastric, renal and prostate cancer cells. Docetaxel does not block disassembly of interphase microtubules and so does not prevent entry into the mitotic cycle, but does block mitosis by inhibiting mitotic spindle assembly. This can lead to mitotic catastrophe. Resistance to paclitaxel or anthracycline doxorubicin does not necessarily indicate resistance to docetaxel. Microtubules formed in the presence of docetaxel are of a larger size than those formed in the presence of paclitaxel, which may result in improved cytotoxic efficacy. Abundant formation of microtubules and the prevention of replication caused by docetaxel leads to apoptosis of tumour cells and is the basis of docetaxel use as a cancer treatment. Docetaxel activity is significantly greater in ovarian and breast tumours than for lung tumours. == Society and culture == === Discovery, regulation and marketing === Docetaxel is marketed worldwide under the name Taxotere by Sanofi-Aventis as well as Docefrez by Sun Pharma Global and Zytax by Zydus. Annual sales of Taxotere in 2010 were €2.122 billion (US$3.1 billion). The patent expired in 2010. Docetaxel was developed by Rhône-Poulenc Rorer (now Sanofi-Aventis) following from the discoveries of Pierre Potier at CNRS at Gif-sur-Yvette during his work on improvements to the production of paclitaxel (Taxol) using the local European yew. === Costs === In the UK (in 2009) The cost of six cycles (18 weeks) of docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 IV every 21 days is £5,262 (based on an average body surface area 1.75 m2). == References ==",Taxotere,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.649054244509898e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015326907159760594)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/taxotere.html ', [])"

3824,"('Deoxycorticosterone', 'Desoxycortone', 'Desoxycorticosterone', 'Cortexone', 'Deoxycortone')","Endogenous, Medical","11-Deoxycorticosterone (DOC), or simply deoxycorticosterone, also known as 21-hydroxyprogesterone, as well as desoxycortone (INN), deoxycortone, and cortexone, is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland that possesses mineralocorticoid activity and acts as a precursor to aldosterone. It is an active (Na+-retaining) mineralocorticoid. As its names indicate, 11-deoxycorticosterone can be understood as the 21-hydroxy-variant of progesterone or as the 11-deoxy-variant of corticosterone. DOCA is the abbreviation for the ester 11-deoxycorticosterone acetate. == Biological activity == DOC is a potent mineralocorticoid but is virtually devoid of glucocorticoid activity. However, 11β-hydroxylation of DOC produces corticosterone and confers glucocorticoid activity, along with 10-fold reduced mineralocorticoid activity. In addition to its mineralocorticoid activity, DOC has been found to possess one-third to one-tenth the potency of progesterone as a progestogen when administered systematically to rabbits. However, it has no such activity when applied directly to the uterine mucosa of mice. The discrepancy may be related to the fact that DOC can be converted into progesterone in vivo. == Biological role == DOC is a precursor molecule for the production of aldosterone. The major pathway for aldosterone production is in the adrenal glomerulosa zone of the adrenal gland. It is not a major secretory hormone. It is produced from progesterone by 21β-hydroxylase and is converted to corticosterone by 11β-hydroxylase. Corticosterone is then converted to aldosterone by aldosterone synthase. Most of the DOC is secreted by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex which also secretes cortisol, and a small amount by the zona glomerulosa, which secretes aldosterone. DOC stimulates the collecting tubules (the tubules which branch together to feed the bladder) to continue to excrete potassium in much the same way that aldosterone does but not like aldosterone in the end of the looped tubules (distal). At the same time it is not nearly so rigorous at retaining sodium as aldosterone, more than 20 times less. DOC accounts for only 1% of the sodium retention normally In addition to its inherent lack of vigor there is an escape mechanism controlled by an unknown non steroid hormone which overrides DOC's sodium conserving power after a few days just as aldosterone is overridden also. This hormone may be the peptide hormone kallikrein, which is augmented by DOC and suppressed by aldosterone. If sodium becomes very high, DOC also increases urine flow. DOC has about 1/20 of the sodium retaining power of aldosterone, and is said to be as little as one per cent of aldosterone at high water intakes. Since DOC has about 1/5 the potassium excreting power of aldosterone, it probably must have aldosterone's help if the serum potassium content becomes too high. DOC's injections do not cause much additional potassium excretion when sodium intake is low. This is probably because aldosterone is already stimulating potassium outflow. When sodium is low DOC probably would not have to be present, but when sodium rises aldosterone declines considerably, and DOC probably tends to take over. DOC has a similar feedback with respect to potassium as aldosterone. A rise in serum potassium causes a rise in DOC secretion. However, sodium has little effect, and what effect it does have is direct. Angiotensin (the blood pressure hormone) has little effect on DOC, but DOC causes a rapid fall in renin, and therefore angiotensin I, the precursor of angiotensin II. Therefore, DOC must be indirectly inhibiting aldosterone since aldosterone depends on angiotensin II. Sodium, and therefore blood volume, is difficult to regulate internally. That is, when a large dose of sodium threatens the body with high blood pressure, it cannot be resolved by transferring sodium to the intracellular (inside the cell) space. The red cells would have been possible, but that would not change the blood volume. Potassium, on the other hand, can be moved into the large intracellular space, and apparently it is by DOC in rabbits. Thus, a problem in high blood potassium can be resolved somewhat without jettisoning too much of what is sometimes a dangerously scarce mineral that can not be pumped actively independently from sodium. It is imperative to keep total potassium adequate because a deficiency causes the heart to lose force. Movement of potassium into the cells would intensify the sodium problem somewhat because when potassium moves into the cell, a somewhat smaller amount of sodium moves out. Thus, it is desirable to resolve the blood pressure problem as much as possible by the fall in renin above, therefore avoiding loss of sodium, which was usually in very short supply on the African savannas where human ancestors probably evolved. The resemblance of the pattern of the electromotive forces produced by DOC in the kidney tubules to normal potassium intake, and the total dissimilarity of their shape as produced by potassium deficient tubules, would tend to support the above view. The above attributes are consistent with a hormone which is relied upon to unload both excess sodium and potassium. DOC's action in augmenting kallikrein, the peptide hormone thought to be the sodium ""escape hormone,"" and aldosterone's action in suppressing it, is also supportive of the above concept. ACTH has more effect on DOC than it does on aldosterone. This may be to give the immune system control over the electrolyte regulation during diarrhea since during dehydration, aldosterone virtually disappears even though renin and angiotensin rise high. It is because aldosterone disappears that potassium supplements are very dangerous during dehydration and must not be attempted until at least one hour after rehydration so the hormones can reach the nucleus. DOC's primary purpose is to regulate electrolytes. However, it has other effects, such as to remove potassium from leucocytes and muscle, depress glycogen formation and to stimulate copper containing lysyl oxidase enzyme and connective tissue, which attributes may be used by the body to help survive during potassium wasting intestinal diseases. The greater efficiency of DOC in permitting sodium excretion (or perhaps it should be expressed as inefficiency at retention) must be partly through morphological changes in the kidney cells because escape from DOC's sodium retention takes several days to materialize, and when it does, these cells are much more efficient at unloading sodium if sodium is then added than cells accustomed to a prior low intake. Thus, paradoxically, a low salt intake should be protective against loss of sodium in perspiration. Progesterone prevents some of the loss of potassium by DOC. == Additional images == == See also == 11-Deoxycortisol 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone Corticosterone Congenital adrenal hyperplasia == References == == Sources ==",Deoxycortone,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.00016361083544325083), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.451116051815916e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.10086701065301895), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -6.437280717364047e-06), ('OUS', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.1269911527633667), ('ĠMED', -0.0006903410539962351), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00028451209072954953)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.0011828463757410645), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.03804149478673935), (' MED', -5.836499985889532e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL; ([kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/C03205?utm_source=openai), [kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D07792%2BD03698%2BD03699?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=164, start_index=20, title='KEGG COMPOUND: C03205', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/C03205?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=164, start_index=20, title='KEGG DRUG: Desoxycortone', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D07792%2BD03698%2BD03699?utm_source=openai')])"
3825,"('Duloxetine (hydrochloride)', '(s)-duloxetine hydrochloride', 'Duloxetine', '(s)-duloxetine', 'Cymbalta')",Medical,"Duloxetine, sold under the brand name Cymbalta among others, is a medication used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and central sensitization. It is taken by mouth. Duloxetine is a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The precise mechanism for its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects is not known. Common side effects include dry mouth, nausea, feeling tired, dizziness, agitation, sexual problems, and increased sweating. Severe side effects include an increased risk of suicide, serotonin syndrome, mania, and liver problems. Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome may occur if stopped. There are concerns that use during the later part of pregnancy can harm the developing fetus. Duloxetine was approved for medical use in the United States and the European Union in 2004. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 31st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 18 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == The main uses of duloxetine are in major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, neuropathic pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and fibromyalgia. Duloxetine is recommended as a first-line agent for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, as a first-line therapy for fibromyalgia in the presence of mood disorders by the German Interdisciplinary Association for Pain Therapy, as a Grade B recommendation for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy by the American Association for Neurology and as a level A recommendation in certain neuropathic states by the European Federation of Neurological Societies. === Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy === A 2014 Cochrane review concluded that duloxetine is beneficial in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia but that more comparative studies with other medicines are needed. The French medical journal Prescrire concluded that duloxetine is no better than other available agents and has a greater risk of side effects. Whereas duloxetine has shown efficacy in treating painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy by blocking late Nav 1.7 sodium ion channels and increasing norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the central nervous system (CNS) and while improving mean NPRS scores and achieving a ≥50% pain response in more patients compared to placebo, it has been associated with potentially serious adverse reactions including hepatotoxicity, serotonin syndrome, severe skin reactions, increased risk of bleeding, increased blood pressure and sexual dysfunction. === Major depressive disorder === Duloxetine was approved for the treatment of major depression in 2004. A 2025 systematic review assessing the benefits and harms of duloxetine in depression found an average change of 1.81 points on the 53-point Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and a small beneficial effect on quality of life, effects below the review's predefined minimal clinically important differences. There was insufficient data to assess suicide or other serious adverse events. All results assessed were at a high risk of bias. A 2012 Cochrane Review did not find greater efficacy of duloxetine compared to SSRIs and newer antidepressants. Additionally, the review found evidence that duloxetine has increased side effects and reduced tolerability compared to other antidepressants. It thus did not recommend duloxetine as a first-line treatment for major depressive disorder, given the (then) high cost of duloxetine compared to inexpensive off-patent antidepressants and lack of increased efficacy. Duloxetine appears less tolerable than some other antidepressants. Generic duloxetine became available in 2013. === Generalized anxiety disorder === Duloxetine is more effective than placebo in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A review from the Annals of Internal Medicine lists duloxetine among the first line drug treatments along with citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, and venlafaxine. === Neuropathic pain === Duloxetine was approved for the pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) by the US FDA. The response is achieved in the first two weeks on the medication. Duloxetine slightly increased the fasting serum glucose. The comparative efficacy of duloxetine and established pain-relief medications for diabetic peripheral neuropathy is unclear. A systematic review noted that tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and amitriptyline), traditional anticonvulsants and opioids have better efficacy than duloxetine. Duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants have similar tolerability while opioids cause more side effects. Another review in Prescrire International considered the moderate pain relief achieved with duloxetine to be clinically insignificant and the results of the clinical trials unconvincing. The reviewer saw no reason to prescribe duloxetine in practice. The comparative data collected by reviewers in BMC Neurology indicated that amitriptyline, other tricyclic antidepressants, and venlafaxine may be more effective. The authors noted that the evidence in favor of duloxetine is much more solid, however. A Cochrane review concluded that the evidence in support of duloxetine's efficacy in treating painful diabetic neuropathy was adequate and that further trials should focus on comparisons with other medications. A crossover trial found that duloxetine, pregabalin, and amitriptyline offered similar levels of pain relief. Duloxetine also has similar effect on pain relief in diabetic neuropathic pain as gabapentin. Comparing at various doses, the strongest effect on relieving diabetic neuropatic pain is on 120 mg/d dose. Combination treatment of duloxetine and pregabalin offered additional pain relief for people whose pain is not adequately controlled with one medication and was safe. Duloxetine is also an option for the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis patients. === Fibromyalgia and chronic pain === A review of duloxetine found that it reduced pain and fatigue, and improved physical and mental performance compared to placebo. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for the treatment of fibromyalgia in June 2008. It may be useful for chronic pain from osteoarthritis. In November 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved duloxetine to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain, including discomfort from osteoarthritis and chronic lower back pain. === Stress urinary incontinence === Duloxetine failed to receive US approval for stress urinary incontinence amid concerns over liver toxicity and suicidal events; it was approved for this use in the UK, however, where it is recommended as an add-on medication in stress urinary incontinence instead of surgery. The safety and utility of duloxetine in the treatment of incontinence have been evaluated in a series of meta-analyses and practice guidelines. A 2017 meta-analysis found that the harms are at least as great if not greater than the benefits. A 2013 meta-analysis concluded that duloxetine decreased incontinence episodes more than placebo with people about 56% more likely than placebo to experience a 50% decrease in episodes. Adverse effects were experienced by 83% of duloxetine-treated subjects and by 45% of placebo-treated subjects. A 2012 review and practice guideline published by the European Association of Urology concluded that the clinical trial data provides Grade 1a evidence that duloxetine improves but does not cure urinary incontinence and that it causes a high rate of gastrointestinal side effects (mainly nausea and vomiting) leading to a high rate of treatment discontinuation. The National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence recommends (as of September 2013) that duloxetine not be routinely offered as first-line treatment, and that it only be offered as second-line therapy in women wishing to avoid therapy. The guideline further states that women should be counseled regarding the drug's side effects. == Contraindications == The following contraindications are listed by the manufacturer: Hypersensitivity: duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to duloxetine or any of the inactive ingredients. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): concomitant use in patients taking MAOIs is contraindicated. Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma: in clinical trials, Cymbalta use was associated with an increased risk of mydriasis (dilation of the pupil); therefore, its use should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, in which mydriasis can cause sudden worsening. Central nervous system (CNS) acting drugs: given the primary CNS effects of duloxetine, it should be used with caution when it is taken in combination with or substituted for other centrally acting drugs, including those with a similar mechanism of action. Duloxetine and thioridazine should not be co-administered. In addition, the FDA has reported on life-threatening drug interactions that may be possible when co-administered with triptans and other drugs acting on serotonin pathways leading to increased risk for serotonin syndrome. Duloxetine should also be avoided in hepatic impairment such as cirrhosis. == Adverse effects == Nausea, somnolence, insomnia, and dizziness are the main side effects, reported by about 10% to 20% of patients. In a trial for major depressive disorder (MDD), the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events among duloxetine-treated patients were nausea (34.7%), dry mouth (22.7%), headache (20.0%) and dizziness (18.7%), and except for headache, these were reported significantly more often than in the placebo group. In a long-term study of fibromyalgia patients receiving duloxetine, frequency and type of adverse effects was similar to that reported in the MDD trial above. Side effects tended to be mild-to-moderate, and tended to decrease in intensity over time. === Sexual dysfunction === In four clinical trials of duloxetine for the treatment of MDD, sexual dysfunction occurred significantly more frequently in patients treated with duloxetine than those treated with placebo, and this difference occurred only in men. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and anorgasmia (trouble achieving orgasm). Loss of or decreased response to sexual stimuli and ejaculatory anhedonia are also reported. Frequency of treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction were similar for duloxetine and SSRIs when compared in a 6-month observational study in depressed patients. Rates of sexual dysfunction in MDD patients treated with duloxetine versus escitalopram did not differ significantly at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment, although the trend favored duloxetine (33.3% of duloxetine patients experienced sexual side effects compared to 43.6% of those receiving escitalopram and 25% of those receiving placebo). === Increased sweating === Duloxetine may also cause sweating more than usual (hyperhidrosis). The exact mechanism behind why duloxetine increases sweating is still not fully understood. However, a possible explanation is in duloxetine's action on the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic nerves control thermoregulation and sweating in humans; when increased levels of noradrenaline are present (as seen with SNRIs), this can stimulate sweat gland activity, leading to an increase in perspiration. Noradrenaline release may also cause increased serotonin availability that results from inhibiting reuptake. Such release enhances and further facilitates the activation of post-synaptic α-adrenoceptors by noradrenaline, which can stimulate sweat gland activity, leading to more significant amounts of copious liquid secretion mainly at higher duloxetine dosages above certain thresholds. The amount of sweating experienced may be influenced by the noradrenergic tone, which is determined by the interaction between noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Therefore, at higher serum doses or concentrations (above certain thresholds) resulting from therapeutic antidepressant treatment, patients may show more perspiration than at lower doses. === Discontinuation syndrome === During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as brain zap electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. The withdrawal syndrome from duloxetine resembles the SSRI discontinuation syndrome. When discontinuing treatment with duloxetine, the manufacturer recommends a gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to nine weeks' duration of patients with MDD, a systematic evaluation of discontinuation symptoms in patients taking duloxetine following abrupt discontinuation found the following symptoms occurring at a rate greater than or equal to 2% and at a significantly higher rate in duloxetine-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, nausea, headache, paresthesia, vomiting, irritability, and nightmare. In 2012 The Institute for Safe Medical Practices (ISMP) published a report: ""Duloxetine and Serious Withdrawal Symptoms"". The report highlights early clinical studies which found ""abrupt discontinuation showed that withdrawal effects occurred in 40-50% of patients, that 10% of those were severe and approximately half were not resolved when side effects monitoring had ended after one or two weeks"". Withdrawal symptoms listed in 48 case reports (in the first quarter of 2012) included anger, crying, dizziness, and suicidal ideation. The report concluded there was insufficient information and a lack of clear warnings about the effects of discontinuing duloxetine and that in many cases withdrawal symptoms may be ""severe, persistent, or both"", adding ""the prescribing information for physicians and pharmacists does not provide realistic schedules for tapering or a clear picture of the likely incidence of these reactions"". === Suicidality === In the United States all antidepressants, including duloxetine carry a black box warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 2-fold increase in the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase in suicidality in the 18–24 age group. To obtain statistically significant results the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications. As suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical trials are rare, the results for any drug taken separately usually do not reach statistical significance. In 2005, the United States FDA released a public health advisory noting that there had been eleven reports of suicide attempts and three reports of suicidality within the mostly middle-aged women participating in the open-label extension trials of duloxetine for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The FDA described the potential role of confounding social stressors as ""unclear"". The suicide attempt rate in the SUI study population (based on 9,400 patients) was calculated to be 400 per 100,000 person-years. This rate is greater than the suicide attempt rate among middle-aged US women that has been reported in published studies, i.e., 150 to 160 per 100,000 person-years. In addition, one death from suicide was reported in a Cymbalta clinical pharmacology study in a healthy female volunteer without SUI. No increase in suicidality was reported in controlled trials of Cymbalta for depression or diabetic neuropathic pain. === Postmarketing reports === Reported adverse events that were temporally correlated to duloxetine therapy include rash, reported rarely, and the following adverse events, reported very rarely: alanine aminotransferase increased, alkaline phosphatase increased, anaphylactic reaction, angioneurotic edema, aspartate aminotransferase increased, bilirubin increased, glaucoma, hepatotoxicity, hyponatremia, jaundice, orthostatic hypotension (especially at the initiation of treatment), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, syncope (especially at initiation of treatment), and urticaria. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Duloxetine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine (NE) in the central nervous system. Duloxetine increases dopamine (DA) specifically in the prefrontal cortex, where there are few DA reuptake pumps, via the inhibition of NE reuptake pumps (NET), which is believed to mediate the reuptake of DA and NE. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA reuptake transporters, however, and can therefore be considered to be a selective reuptake inhibitor at the 5-HT and NE transporters. Duloxetine undergoes extensive metabolism, but the major circulating metabolites do not contribute significantly to the pharmacologic activity. In vitro binding studies using synaptosomal preparations isolated from rat cerebral cortex indicated that duloxetine was approximately 3 fold more potent at inhibiting serotonin uptake than norepinephrine uptake. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Duloxetine is acid labile, and is formulated with an enteric coating to prevent degradation in the stomach. Duloxetine has good oral bioavailability, averaging 50% after one 60 mg dose. There is an average 2-hour lag until absorption begins with maximum plasma concentrations occurring about 6 hours post-dose. Food or bedtime administration has no significant impact on the Cmax of duloxetine, but delay time to reach peak concentration by 4 hours. This delay is caused by reduced gastrointestinal motility, and reduce area under curve and half-life by only 11% and 18%, respectively; as such, no dose adjustments or time-of-day restrictions are necessary. Depending on condition being treated, duloxetine is taken once a day or twice a day. ==== Distribution ==== Duloxetine is highly bound (>90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Volume of distribution is about 1640 L. ==== Metabolism ==== Duloxetine undergoes predominately hepatic metabolism via two cytochrome P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Circulating metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. Duloxetine is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor. ==== Elimination ==== Duloxetine, administered in a single oral dose of 20 mg or 40 mg has plasma elimination half-life of 10–12 h and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state concentration is usually achieved after 3 days. Only trace amounts (<1%) of unchanged duloxetine are present in the urine and most of the dose (approx. 70%) appears in the urine as metabolites of duloxetine with about 20% excreted in the feces. Smoking is associated with a decrease in duloxetine concentration. == Research directions == Major depressive disorder is believed to be due in part to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines within the central nervous system. Antidepressants including ones with a similar mechanism of action as duloxetine, i.e., serotonin metabolism inhibition, cause a decrease in proinflammatory cytokine activity and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines; this mechanism may apply to duloxetine in its effect on depression but research on cytokines specific to duloxetine therapy is insufficient. Cytokines are immunoregulatory molecules that play a key role in the human immune response. Some cytokines are proinflammatory and contribute to the development of inflammation, while others are anti-inflammatory and help to control the proinflammatory response. Duloxetine can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and may increase the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10), however, mechanisms behind these effects are not well elucidated, there have been mixed findings regarding duloxetine's impact on cytokine production in different contexts, and the results are inconclusive. Duloxetine is being investigated for its potential to decrease opioid use in the perioperative period because duloxetine administration can help reduce opioid consumption and mitigate the risk of opioid-related side effects and dependence. In total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA), duloxetine is researched to provide pain relief; studies demonstrated that it can reduce pain for several weeks post-surgery without an increased risk of adverse drug events, suggesting that duloxetine could be a valuable component of a multimodal management regimen for patients undergoing THA or TKA. Also, duloxetine can reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting after THA or TKA, which are common side effects of anesthesia and opioids: this additional benefit could improve patient comfort and satisfaction, potentially enhancing recovery outcomes. == History == Duloxetine was created by Eli Lilly and Company researchers. David Robertson; David Wong, a co-inventor of fluoxetine; and Joseph Krushinski are listed as inventors on the patent application filed in 1986 and granted in 1990. The first publication on the invention of the racemic form of duloxetine known as LY227942, was made in 1988. The (+)-enantiomer, assigned LY248686, was chosen for further studies, because it inhibited serotonin reuptake in rat synaptosomes to twice the degree of the (–)-enantiomer. This molecule was subsequently named duloxetine. In 2001, Lilly filed a New Drug Application (NDA) for duloxetine with the US Food and Drug Administration. In 2003, however, the FDA ""recommended this application as not approvable from the manufacturing and control standpoint"" because of ""significant cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) violations at the finished product manufacturing facility"" of Eli Lilly in Indianapolis. Additionally, ""potential liver toxicity"" and QTc interval prolongation appeared as a concern. The FDA experts concluded that ""duloxetine can cause hepatotoxicity in the form of transaminase elevations. It may also be a factor in causing more severe liver injury, but there are no cases in the NDA database that clearly demonstrate this. Use of duloxetine in the presence of ethanol may potentiate the deleterious effect of ethanol on the liver."" The FDA also recommended ""routine blood pressure monitoring"", since there was a dose-dependent increase in elevated blood pressure readings, including at the new highest recommended dose of 120 mg ""where 24% of patients had one or more [elevated] blood pressure readings of 140/90 vs. 9% of placebo patients."" After the manufacturing issues were resolved, the liver toxicity warning included in the prescribing information, and the follow-up studies showed that duloxetine does not cause QTc interval prolongation, duloxetine was approved by the FDA for depression and diabetic neuropathy in 2004. In 2007, Health Canada approved duloxetine for the treatment of depression and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Duloxetine was approved for use of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in the EU in 2004. In 2005, Lilly withdrew the duloxetine application for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in the US, stating that discussions with the FDA indicated ""the agency is not prepared at this time to grant approval ... based on the data package submitted."" A year later Lilly abandoned the pursuit of this indication in the US market. The FDA approved duloxetine for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in February 2007. Cymbalta generated sales of nearly US$5 billion in 2012, with $4 billion of that in the US, but its patent protection terminated 1 January 2014. Lilly received a six-month extension beyond 30 June 2013, after testing for the treatment of depression in adolescents, which may produce US$1.5 billion in added sales. The first generic duloxetine was marketed by an Indian pharmaceutical company Dr. Reddy's Laboratories. == See also == List of antidepressants == Explanatory notes == == References ==",Cymbalta,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.960446742392378e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00043704494601115584)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/duloxetine-marketed-cymbalta-information?os=rokuFno_journeysDtruerefappamp19OxfaIID&ref=app&utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=215, start_index=9, title='Duloxetine (marketed as Cymbalta) Information | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/duloxetine-marketed-cymbalta-information?os=rokuFno_journeysDtruerefappamp19OxfaIID&ref=app&utm_source=openai')])"

CA-074 has been utilized in numerous studies to demonstrate the role of this protease in cellular and physiological functions. Cathepsin B in numerous human disease mechanisms involves its translocation from acidic lysosomes of pH 4.6 to neutral pH 7.2 of cellular locations, including the cytosol and extracellular environment. To gain in-depth knowledge of CA-074 inhibition under these different pH conditions, this study evaluated the molecular features, potency, and selectivity of CA-074 for cathepsin B inhibition under acidic and neutral pH conditions. This study demonstrated that CA-074 is most effective at inhibiting cathepsin B at an acidic pH of 4.6 with nM potency, which was more than 100-fold more potent than its inhibition at a neutral pH of 7.2. The pH-dependent inhibition of CA-074 was abolished by methylation of its C-terminal proline, indicating the requirement for the free C-terminal carboxyl group for pH-dependent inhibition. Under these acidic and neutral pH conditions, CA-074 maintained its specificity for cathepsin B over other cysteine cathepsins, displayed irreversible inhibition, and inhibited diverse cleavages of peptide substrates of cathepsin B assessed by profiling mass spectrometry. Molecular docking suggested that pH-dependent ionic interactions of the C-terminal carboxylate of CA-074 occur with His110 and His111 residues in the S2' subsite of the enzyme at pH 4.6, but these interactions differ at pH 7.2. While high levels of CA-074 or CA-074Me (converted by cellular esterases to CA-074) are used in biological studies to inhibit cathepsin B at both acidic and neutral pH locations, it is possible that adjusted levels of CA-074 or CA-074Me may be explored to differentially affect cathepsin B activity at these different pH values. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate the molecular, kinetic, and protease specificity features of CA-074 pH-dependent inhibition of cathepsin B. The complicated multiple sclerosis (MS) can exhibit subacute sight deterioration and can lead to total deprivation of vision. In the current work, we explored the therapeutic outcome of Cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074) against retinopathy and optic neuritis (ON) caused by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by proteolipid protein peptide (PLP) in female SJL/J mice. A daily dose of 10 mg/kg CA-074 was administered to the EAE mice intraperitoneally for 14 days from day 14 post-immunization until day 28. The Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses show inflammation in the optic nerve through the elevation of iNOS and NFkB markers in EAE mice. Optic neuritis was reported which is a consequence of demyelination and axon injury, estimated with the reduction in myelin basic protein (MBP). The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression level was found to be elevated in the retina of EAE mice which confirmed the retinopathy. The administration of CA-074 ameliorated optic neuritis and retinopathy by reducing inflammation. The treatment with CA-074 also reduced the demyelination and axonal injuries in the EAE mice. The findings of this study have shown the protective effect of CA-074 in the case of retinopathy and ON inflicted by EAE in SJL/J mice. Studies using inhibitors that reportedly discriminate between cathepsin B and related lysosomal cysteine proteinases have implicated the enzyme in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. The most popular substance to selectively inhibit cathepsin B in vivo is CA-074Me, the methyl ester of the E-64 derivative CA-074. However, we now have found that CA-074Me inactivates both cathepsin B and cathepsin L within murine fibroblasts. In contrast, exposure of these cells to the parental compound CA-074 leads to the selective inhibition of endogenous cathepsin B, while intracellular cathepsin L remains unaffected. These results indicate that CA-074 rather than CA-074Me should be used to specifically inactivate cathepsin B within living cells.",Ca 074,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.20145466923713684), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.1315677911043167), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3132948577404022)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -6.392202976712724e-06)])","('INFO; https://www.bertin-bioreagent.com/ca-074/,https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/CA-074-Calbiochem%2CEMD_BIO-205530,https://www.targetmol.com/compound/ca_074,https://www.biocrick.com/CA-074-BCC1141.html,https://www.biomol.com/products/chemicals/biochemicals/ca-074-cay24679-500,https://www.selleckchem.com/products/ca-074.html ', [])"

3829,"('Minoxidil', 'Rogaine', 'Loniten', 'Regaine', 'Minoximen')",Medical,"Minoxidil is a medication used for the treatment of high blood pressure and pattern hair loss. It is an antihypertensive and a vasodilator. It is available as a generic medication by prescription in oral tablet form and over-the-counter as a topical liquid or foam. == Medical uses == Minoxidil, when used for hypertension, is generally reserved for use in severe hypertension patients who do not respond to at least two agents and a diuretic. Minoxidil is also generally administered with a loop diuretic to prevent sodium and potassium retention. It may also cause a reflex tachycardia and thus is prescribed with a beta blocker. === Hair loss === Minoxidil, when applied topically, is used for the treatment of hair loss. It is effective in helping promote hair growth in people with androgenic alopecia regardless of sex. Minoxidil must be used indefinitely for continued support of existing hair follicles and the maintenance of any experienced hair regrowth. Low-dose oral minoxidil (LDOM) is used off-label against hair loss and to promote hair regrowth. Oral minoxidil is an effective and well-tolerated treatment alternative for patients having difficulty with topical formulations. == Side effects == Topically applied minoxidil is generally well tolerated, but common side effects include itching of the eyes, general itching, irritation at the treated area, and unwanted hair growth elsewhere on the body. Alcohol and propylene glycol present in some topical preparations may dry the scalp, resulting in dandruff and contact dermatitis. Side effects of oral minoxidil may include swelling of the face and extremities, rapid heartbeat, or lightheadedness. Cardiac lesions, such as focal necrosis of the papillary muscle and subendocardial areas of the left ventricle, have been observed in laboratory animals treated with minoxidil. Pseudoacromegaly is an extremely rare side effect reported with large doses of oral minoxidil. In 2013 or 2014, a seven-year-old girl was admitted to a children's hospital in Toulouse in France after accidentally ingesting a teaspoon of Alopexy (a brand name for minoxidil in France). The child vomited constantly after ingestion and showed hypotension and tachycardia for 40 hours. The authors of the report on the incident stressed that the product should be kept out of reach of children, and urged manufacturers to consider more secure child-resistant packaging. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The mechanism by which minoxidil promotes hair growth is not fully understood. Minoxidil is an adenosine 5'-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener, causing hyperpolarization of cell membranes. Theoretically, by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels, it allows more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to the follicles. Moreover, minoxidil contains a nitric oxide moiety and may act as a nitric oxide agonist. This may cause follicles in the telogen phase to shed, which are then replaced by thicker hairs in a new anagen phase. Minoxidil is a prodrug that is converted by sulfation via the sulfotransferase enzyme SULT1A1 to its active form, minoxidil sulfate. The effect of minoxidil is mediated by adenosine, which triggers intracellular signal transduction via both adenosine A1 receptors and two sub-types of adenosine A2 receptors (A2A and A2B receptors). Minoxidil acts as an activator of the Kir6/SUR2 channel upon selective binding to SUR2. The expression of SUR2B in dermal papilla cells might play a role in the production of adenosine. Minoxidil induces cell growth factors such as VEGF, HGF, IGF-1 and potentiates HGF and IGF-1 actions by the activation of uncoupled sulfonylurea receptor on the plasma membrane of dermal papilla cells. A number of in vitro effects of minoxidil have been described in monocultures of various skin and hair follicle cell types including stimulation of cell proliferation, inhibition of collagen synthesis, and stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, prostaglandin synthesis and leukotriene B4 expression. Minoxidil causes a redistribution of cellular iron through its apparent capacity to bind this metal ion. By binding iron in a Fenton-reactive form, intracellular hydroxyl radical production would ensue, but hydroxyl would be immediately trapped and scavenged by the minoxidil to generate a nitroxyl radical. It is presumed that this nitroxyl radical will be capable of reduction by glutathione to reform minoxidil. Such a process would cycle until the minoxidil is otherwise metabolized and would result in rapid glutathione depletion with glutathione disulphide formation and therefore with concomitant consumption of NADPH/NADH and other reducing equivalents. Minoxidil inhibited PHD by interfering with the normal function of ascorbate, a cofactor of the enzyme, leading to a stabilization of HIF-1α protein and a subsequent activation of HIF-1. In an in vivo angiogenesis assay, millimolar minoxidil increased blood vessel formation in a VEGF-dependent manner. Minoxidil inhibition of PHD occurs via interrupting ascorbate binding to iron. The structural feature of positioning amines adjacent to nitric oxide may confer the ability of millimolar minoxidil to chelate iron, thereby inhibiting PHD. Minoxidil is capable of tetrahydrobiopterin inhibition as a cofactor for nitric oxide synthase. Minoxidil stimulates prostaglandin E2 production by activating COX-1 and prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 but inhibits prostacyclin production. Additionally, expression of the prostaglandin E2 receptor, the most upregulated target gene in the β-catenin pathway of DP cells, was enhanced by minoxidil, which may enable hair follicles to grow continuously and maintain the anagen phase. Due to the anti-fibrotic activity of minoxidil inhibition of enzyme lysyl hydroxylase present in fibroblast may result in the synthesis of a hydroxylysine-deficient collagen. Minoxidil can also potentially stimulate elastogenesis in aortic smooth muscle cells, and in skin fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. In hypertensive rats, minoxidil increases elastin levels in the mesenteric, abdominal, and renal arteries by a decrease in elastase enzyme activity in these tissues. In rats, potassium channel openers decrease calcium influx which inhibits elastin gene transcription through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2)-activator protein 1 signaling pathway. ERK 1/2 increases, through elastin gene transcription, adequately cross-linked elastic fiber content synthesized by smooth muscle cells, and decreases the number of cells in the aorta. Minoxidil possesses α2-adrenergic receptor agonist activity, stimulates the peripheral sympathetic nervous system (SNS) by way of carotid and aortic baroreceptor reflexes. Minoxidil administration also brings an increase in plasma renin activity, largely due to the aforementioned activation of the SNS. This activation of the renin-angiotensin axis further prompts increased biosynthesis of aldosterone; whereas plasma and urinary aldosterone levels are increased early in the course of treatment with minoxidil, over time these values tend to normalize presumably because of accelerated metabolic clearance of aldosterone in association with hepatic vasodilation. Minoxidil may be involved in the inhibition of serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Minoxidil might increase blood-tumor barrier permeability in a time-dependent manner by down-regulating tight junction protein expression and this effect could be related to ROS/RhoA/PI3K/PKB signal pathway. Minoxidil significantly increases ROS concentration when compared to untreated cells. In vitro Minoxidil treatment resulted in a 0.22 fold change for 5α-R2 (p < 0.0001). This antiandrogenic effect of minoxidil, shown by significant downregulation of 5α-R2 gene expression in HaCaT cells, may be one of its mechanisms of action in alopecia. Minoxidil is less effective when the area of hair loss is large. In addition, its effectiveness has largely been demonstrated in younger men who have experienced hair loss for less than 5 years. Minoxidil use is indicated for central (vertex) hair loss only. Two clinical studies are being conducted in the US for a medical device that may allow patients to determine if they are likely to benefit from minoxidil therapy. Conditions such as Cantú syndrome have been shown to mimic the pharmacological properties of minoxidil. == Chemistry == Minoxidil is an odorless, white to off-white, crystalline powder (crystals from methanol-acetonitrile). When heated to decomposition it emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides. It decomposes at 259-261 °C. Solubility (mg/ml): propylene glycol 75, methanol 44, ethanol 29, 2-propanol 6.7, dimethylsulfoxide 6.5, water 2.2, chloroform 0.5, acetone <0.5, ethyl acetate <0.5, diethyl ether <0.5, benzene <0.5, acetonitrile <0.5. p K a = {\displaystyle \mathrm {p} K_{{\ce {a}}}=} 4.61 Minoxidil, 6-amino-1,2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2-imino-4-piperidinopyrimidine, is synthesized from barbituric acid, the reaction of which with phosphorus oxychloride gives 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine. Upon reaction with ammonium, this turns into 2,4-diamino-6-chloropyrimidine. Next, the resulting 2,4-diamino-6-chloropyrimidine undergoes a reaction with 2,4-dichlorophenol in the presence of potassium hydroxide, giving 2,4-diamino-6-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-pyrimidine. Oxidation of this product with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid gives 2,4-diamino-6-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)pyrimidine-3-oxide, the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyl group of which is replaced with a piperidine group at high temperature, giving minoxidil. Another synthesis approach is depicted here: == History == === Initial application === Minoxidil was developed in the late 1950s by the Upjohn Company (later became part of Pfizer) to treat ulcers. In trials using dogs, the compound did not cure ulcers but proved to be a powerful vasodilator. Upjohn synthesized over 200 variations of the compound, including the one it developed in 1963 and named minoxidil. These studies resulted in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approving minoxidil (with the brand name Loniten) in the form of oral tablets to treat high blood pressure in 1979. === Hair growth === When Upjohn received permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to test the new drug as medicine for hypertension they approached Charles A. Chidsey, at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. He conducted two studies, the second study showing unexpected hair growth. Puzzled by this side-effect, Chidsey consulted Guinter Kahn (who while a dermatology resident at the University of Miami had been the first to observe and report hair development on patients using the minoxidil patch) and discussed the possibility of using minoxidil for treating hair loss. Kahn, along with his colleague Paul J. Grant, had obtained a certain amount of minoxidil and conducted their own research, since they were first to make the side effect observation. Neither Upjohn or Chidsey at the time were aware of the side effect of hair growth. The two doctors had been experimenting with a 1% solution of minoxidil mixed with several alcohol-based liquids. Both parties filed patents to use minoxidil for hair loss prevention, which resulted in a decade-long trial between Kahn and Upjohn, which ended with Kahn's name included in a consolidated patent (U.S. #4,596,812 Charles A Chidsey, III and Guinter Kahn) in 1986 and royalties from the company to both Kahn and Grant. Meanwhile, the effect of minoxidil on hair loss prevention was so clear that in the 1980s physicians were prescribing Loniten off-label to their balding patients. In August 1988, the FDA approved minoxidil for treating baldness in men under the brand name ""Rogaine"" (FDA rejected Upjohn's first choice, Regain, as misleading). The agency concluded that although ""the product will not work for everyone"", 39% of the men studied had ""moderate to dense hair growth on the crown of the head"". ""Men's Rogaine"", marketed by Johnson & Johnson went off-patent on January 20, 2006. In 1991, Upjohn made the product available for women. ""Women's Rogaine"", marketed by Johnson & Johnson, went off-patent in February 2014. === Pericardial effusion === Minoxidil has been implicated in causing pericardial effusions including life-threatening cases of cardiac tamponade. There have been case reports dating back to the 1980s describing this phenomenon, including topical. and oral formulations. The frequency of these occurrences has previously been reported at 3% but the true frequency is difficult to determine as a large proportion of patients in this cohort also had renal insufficiency and may have had an effusion preceding the use of minoxidil. == Society and culture == === Economics === In February 1996, the FDA approved both the over-the-counter sale and the production of generic formulations of minoxidil. Upjohn replied to that by lowering prices to half the price of the prescription drug and by releasing a prescription 5% formula of Rogaine in 1997. In 1998, a 5% formulation of minoxidil was approved for nonprescription sale by the FDA. The 5% aerosol foam formula was approved for medical use in the US in 2006. The generic versions of the 5% aerosol foam formula were approved in 2017. In 2017, a study of pharmacy prices in four states for 41 over-the-counter minoxidil products which were ""gender-specified"" found that the mean price for minoxidil solutions was the same for women and men even though the women's formulations were 2% and the men's were 5%, while the mean price for minoxidil foams, which were all 5%, was 40% higher for women. The authors noted this was the first time gender-based pricing had been shown for a medication. === Brand names === As of June 2017, Minoxidil is sold under many brand names worldwide, including but not limited to: Alomax, Alopek, Alopexy, Alorexyl, Alostil, Aloxid, Aloxidil, Anagen, Apo-Gain, Axelan, Belohair, Boots Hair Loss Treatment, Botafex, Capillus, Carexidil, Coverit, Da Fei Xin, Dilaine, Dinaxcinco, Dinaxil, Ebersedin, Eminox, Folcare, Follixil, Guayaten, Hair Grow, Hair-Treat, Hairgain, Hairgaine, Hairgrow, Hairway, Headway, Inoxi, Ivix, Keranique, Lacovin, Locemix, Loniten, Lonnoten, Lonolox, Lonoten, Loxon, M E Medic, Maev-Medic, Mandi, Manoxidil, Mantai, Men's Rogaine, Minodil, Minodril, Minostyl, Minovital, Minox, Minoxi, Minoxidil, Minoxidilum, Minoximen, Minoxiten, Minscalp, Mintop, Modil, Morr, Moxidil, Neo-Pruristam, Neocapil, Neoxidil, Nherea, Nioxin, Noxidil, Oxofenil, Pilfud, Pilogro, Pilomin, Piloxidil, Re-Stim, Re-Stim+, Recrea, Regain, Regaine, Regaxidil, Regro, Regroe, Regrou, Regrowth, Relive, Renobell Locion, Reten, Rexidil, Rogaine, Rogan, Scalpmed, Si Bi Shen, Splendora, Superminox, Trefostil, Tricolocion, Tricoplus, Tricovivax, Tricoxane, Trugain, Tugain, Unipexil, Vaxdil, Vius, Women's Regaine, Xenogrow, Xtreme Boost, Xtreme Boost+, Xue Rui, Ylox, and Zeldilon.

3831,"('Denatonium (benzoate)', 'Denatonium', 'Benzyl-[2-(2,6-dimethylanilino)-2-oxoethyl]-diethylazanium', '[2-[(2,6-dimethylphenyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl]-diethyl-(phenylmethyl)azanium benzoat')",Medical,"Denatonium, usually available as denatonium benzoate (under trade names such as Denatrol, BITTERANT-b, BITTER+PLUS, Bitrex, Bitrix, and Aversion) and as denatonium saccharinate (BITTERANT-s), is the bitterest chemical compound known, with bitterness thresholds of 0.05 ppm for the benzoate and 0.01 ppm for the saccharinate. It was discovered in 1958 during research on local anesthetics by T. & H. Smith of Edinburgh, Scotland, and registered under the trademark Bitrex. Dilutions of as little as 10 ppm are unbearably bitter to most people. Denatonium salts are usually colorless and odorless solids, but are often traded as solutions. They are used as aversive agents (bitterants) to prevent inappropriate ingestion. Denatonium is used in denatured alcohol, antifreeze, preventive nail biting preparations, respirator mask fit-testing, animal repellents, liquid soaps, shampoos, and Nintendo Switch game cards to prevent accidental swallowing or choking by children. It is not known to pose any long-term health risks. The name denatonium reflects the substance's primary use as a denaturant and its chemical nature as a cation, hence -onium as a Neo-Latin suffix. == Structure, synthesis, and physical properties == Denatonium is a quaternary ammonium cation. It is composed as a salt with any of several anions, such as benzoate or saccharinate. It can be obtained by the quaternization of lidocaine, a popular anesthetic, with benzyl chloride or a similar reagent. To obtain other salts, like the benzoate, the formed denatonium chloride is subjected to an anion exchange reaction with sodium benzoate, or first sodium hydroxide to make denatonium hydroxide followed by neutralization with benzoic acid. Other similar compounds are procaine and benzocaine. == Biochemistry == Denatonium in humans is recognized by eight distinct bitter taste receptors: TAS2R4, TAS2R8, TAS2R10, TAS2R39, TAS2R43, TAS2R16, TAS2R46, and TAS2R47, being by far the most sensitive to the compound. Denatonium can act as a bronchodilator by activating bitter taste receptors in the airway smooth muscle. == Applications == The bitterness of the compound guides most applications of denatonium. Denatonium benzoate is used to denature ethanol so that it is not treated as an alcoholic beverage with respect to taxation and sales restrictions. One designation in particular, SD-40B, indicates that ethanol has been denatured using denatonium benzoate. Denatonium is commonly included in placebos used in clinical trials to mimic the bitter taste of certain medications. Denatonium benzoate is an ingredient in certain nail polishes and varnishes designed to discourage nail biting, as the bitter denatonium serves as an aversive. Denatonium also discourages consumption of poisonous alcohols such as methanol and additives such as ethylene glycol. It is also added to many kinds of harmful liquids, including solvents (such as nail polish remover), paints, varnishes, toiletries and other personal care items, special nail polish for preventing nail biting, and various other household products. It is also added to less hazardous aerosol products (such as gas dusters) to discourage inhalant abuse of the volatile vapors. In 1995, the U.S. state of Oregon required that denatonium benzoate be added to products containing sweet-tasting ethylene glycol and methanol such as antifreeze and windshield washer fluid to prevent poisonings of children and animals. In December 2012, U.S. manufacturers voluntarily agreed to add denatonium benzoate to antifreeze sold nationwide. Animals are known to have different sensitivities to the effects of denatonium. It is used in some animal repellents (especially for such large mammals as deer). It has been used to safeguard rat poisons from human consumption, as humans are able to detect denatonium at much lower concentrations than rodents. Nintendo Switch game cartridges are coated in denatonium benzoate to prevent young children from consuming them. Lithium button cells, which can cause severe internal injuries if swallowed, are sometimes coated with denatonium benzoate to discourage small children from swallowing them. == See also == Amarogentin == References ==",Denatonium,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.041314251720905304), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00020389800192788243), (' PERSONAL', -0.016045980155467987), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IN', -0.03570907562971115), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', 0.0), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0005073452484793961), ('ĠPERSON', -0.00930839218199253), ('AL', 0.0), ('ĠCARE', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3869117498397827)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -7.52919222577475e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denatonium?utm_source=openai), [ingredientreviewer.com](https://www.ingredientreviewer.com/ingredient/3734-33-6/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=209, start_index=27, title='Denatonium', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denatonium?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=209, start_index=27, title='What Is Denatonium benzoate? - IngredientReviewer', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ingredientreviewer.com/ingredient/3734-33-6/?utm_source=openai')])"

However, the specific role of SkQ1 in ocular surface epithelial tissue has yet to be explicated. The goal of this study is to identify roles of SkQ1 in conjunctival inflammation and corneal wound healing. To determine the role of SkQ1 in inflammation, human conjunctival epithelial (HCjE) cell cultures were sensitized with pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) followed by treatments with SkQ1. The production of inflammatory biomarker prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cell viability were quantitatively evaluated. To determine the role of SkQ1 in wound healing, human corneal limbus epithelial (HCLE) cell cultures were streaked to create wounds. The wound closure times, ability to support single HCLE cell proliferation and changes of cell migration in the presence of SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), were further compared. The HCjE and HCLE cultures showed no apparent cytotoxicity to SkQ1 in concentrations up to 250 nM (HCjE) or 2500 nM (HCLE). The HCLE cultures showed no toxicity to SkQ1 at all the SkQ1 concentrations tested. SkQ1 significantly suppressed PGE2 production of HCjE at concentrations < 300 nM (24 h) and 50 nM (48 h), apparently being SkQ1 dose and treatment time dependent. The wound closure rates were increased by 4% in 4 h and by 9% after 8-12 h in the presence of 50 nM SkQ1. Furthermore, as little as 25 nM of SkQ1 significantly stimulated HCLE single-cell proliferation. Lastly, the SkQ1-stimulated wound healing was completely abolished by SB203580. Results of the current study demonstrate that SkQ1 exhibits an anti-inflammatory role and can be safely applied to ocular surface epithelium up to a concentration of 300 nM (181 ng/ml) for 24 h. SkQ1 also significantly enhances corneal epithelial wound healing, likely through enhancement of cell proliferation and migration. The data provide solid support for SkQ1 as a promising new therapeutic strategy for treatment of conjunctival inflammation as well as corneal wounds. This study was sponsored by Mitotech SA Pharmaceuticals. The human retina is constantly affected by light of varying intensity, this being especially true for photoreceptor cells and retinal pigment epithelium. Traditionally, photoinduced damages of the retina are induced by visible light of high intensity in albino rats using the LIRD (light-induced retinal degeneration) model. This model allows study of pathological processes in the retina and the search for retinoprotectors preventing retinal photodamage. In addition, the etiology and mechanisms of retina damage in the LIRD model have much in common with the mechanisms of the development of age-related retinal disorders, in particular, with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We have studied preventive and therapeutic effects of Visomitin eye drops (based on the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1) on albino rat retinas damaged by bright light. In the first series of experiments, rats receiving Visomitin for two weeks prior to illumination demonstrated significantly less expressed atrophic and degenerative changes in the retina compared to animals receiving similar drops with no SkQ1. In the second series, the illuminated rats were treated for two weeks with Visomitin or similar drops without SkQ1. The damaged retinas of the experimental animals were repaired much more effectively than those of the control animals. Therefore, we conclude that Visomitin SkQ1-containing eye drops have pronounced preventive and therapeutic effects on the photodamaged retina and might be recommended as a photoprotector and a pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of AMD in combination with conventional medicines.",Visomitin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0015441172290593386), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018192805349826813)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26660938/,https://www.mitotechpharma.com/programs/,https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Визомитин ', [])"
3833,"('Aminophylline', 'Theophylline', 'Elixophyllin', 'Theophyllin', 'Theolair')","Food, Medical","Theophylline, also known as 1,3-dimethylxanthine, is a drug that inhibits phosphodiesterase and blocks adenosine receptors. It is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Its pharmacology is similar to other methylxanthine drugs (e.g., theobromine and caffeine). Trace amounts of theophylline are naturally present in tea, coffee, chocolate, yerba maté, guarana, and kola nut. The name 'theophylline' derives from ""Thea""—the former genus name for tea + Legacy Greek φύλλον (phúllon, ""leaf"") + -ine. == Medical uses == The main actions of theophylline involve: relaxing bronchial smooth muscle increasing heart muscle contractility and efficiency (positive inotrope) increasing heart rate (positive chronotropic) increasing blood pressure increasing renal blood flow anti-inflammatory effects central nervous system stimulatory effect, mainly on the medullary respiratory center The main therapeutic uses of theophylline are for treating: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Asthma infant apnea Blocks the action of adenosine; an inhibitory neurotransmitter that induces sleep, contracts the smooth muscles and relaxes the cardiac muscle. Treatment of post-dural puncture headache. == Performance enhancement in sports == Theophylline and other methylxanthines are often used for their performance-enhancing effects in sports, as these drugs increase alertness, bronchodilation, and increase the rate and force of heart contraction. There is conflicting information about the value of theophylline and other methylxanthines as prophylaxis against exercise-induced asthma. == Adverse effects == The use of theophylline is complicated by its interaction with various drugs and by the fact that it has a narrow therapeutic window (<20 mcg/mL). Its use must be monitored by direct measurement of serum theophylline levels to avoid toxicity. It can also cause nausea, diarrhea, increase in heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms, and CNS excitation (headaches, insomnia, irritability, dizziness and lightheadedness). Seizures can also occur in severe cases of toxicity, and are considered to be a neurological emergency. Its toxicity is increased by erythromycin, cimetidine, and fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin. Some lipid-based formulations of theophylline can result in toxic theophylline levels when taken with fatty meals, an effect called dose dumping, but this does not occur with most formulations of theophylline. Theophylline toxicity can be treated with beta blockers. In addition to seizures, tachyarrhythmias are a major concern. Theophylline should not be used in combination with the SSRI fluvoxamine. == Spectroscopy == === UV-visible === Theophylline is soluble in 0.1N NaOH and absorbs maximally at 277 nm with an extinction coefficient of 10,200 (cm−1 M−1). === Proton NMR === The characteristic signals, distinguishing theophylline from related methylxanthines, are approximately 3.23δ and 3.41δ, corresponding to the unique methylation possessed by theophylline. The remaining proton signal, at 8.01δ, corresponds to the proton on the imidazole ring, not transferred between the nitrogen. The transferred proton between the nitrogen is a variable proton and only exhibits a signal under certain conditions. === 13C-NMR === The unique methylation of theophylline corresponds to the following signals: 27.7δ and 29.9δ. The remaining signals correspond to carbons characteristic of the xanthine backbone. == Natural occurrences == Theophylline is naturally found in cocoa beans. Amounts as high as 3.7 mg/g have been reported in Criollo cocoa beans. Trace amounts of theophylline are also found in brewed tea, although brewed tea provides only about 1 mg/L, which is significantly less than a therapeutic dose. Trace amounts of theophylline are also found in guarana (Paullinia cupana) and in kola nuts. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Like other methylated xanthine derivatives, theophylline is both a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which increases intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP, activates PKA, inhibits TNF-alpha and inhibits leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, antagonizing A1, A2, and A3 receptors almost equally, which explains many of its cardiac effects. Theophylline activates histone deacetylases. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== When theophylline is administered intravenously, bioavailability is 100%. ==== Distribution ==== Theophylline is distributed in the extracellular fluid, in the placenta, in the mother's milk and in the central nervous system. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg. The protein binding is 40%. ==== Metabolism ==== Theophylline is metabolized extensively in the liver. It undergoes N-demethylation via cytochrome P450 1A2. It is metabolized by parallel first order and Michaelis-Menten pathways. Metabolism may become saturated (non-linear), even within the therapeutic range. Small dose increases may result in disproportionately large increases in serum concentration. Methylation to caffeine is also important in the infant population. Smokers and people with hepatic (liver) impairment metabolize it differently. Cigarette and marijuana smoking induces metabolism of theophylline, increasing the drug's metabolic clearance. ==== Excretion ==== Theophylline is excreted unchanged in the urine (up to 10%). Clearance of the drug is increased in children (age 1 to 12), teenagers (12 to 16), adult smokers, elderly smokers, as well as in cystic fibrosis, and hyperthyroidism. Clearance of the drug is decreased in these conditions: elderly, acute congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism and febrile viral illnesses. The elimination half-life varies: 30 hours for premature neonates, 24 hours for neonates, 3.5 hours for children ages 1 to 9, 8 hours for adult non-smokers, 5 hours for adult smokers, 24 hours for those with hepatic impairment, 12 hours for those with congestive heart failure NYHA class I-II, 24 hours for those with congestive heart failure NYHA class III-IV, 12 hours for the elderly. == History == Theophylline was first extracted from tea leaves and chemically identified around 1888 by the German biologist Albrecht Kossel. Seven years later, a chemical synthesis starting with 1,3-dimethyluric acid was described by Emil Fischer and Lorenz Ach. The Traube purine synthesis, an alternative method to synthesize theophylline, was introduced in 1900 by another German scientist, Wilhelm Traube. Theophylline's first clinical use came in 1902 as a diuretic. It took an additional 20 years until it was first reported as an asthma treatment. The drug was prescribed in a syrup up to the 1970s as Theostat 20 and Theostat 80, and by the early 1980s in a tablet form called Quibron. == See also == Theophylline/ephedrine == References == == External links == Media related to Theophylline at Wikimedia Commons",Theolair,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -2.7729658540920354e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.006717267446219921), (' FOOD', -0.011049824766814709)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0029848332051187754), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), (',', -0.006730268709361553), ('ĠFOOD', -0.018417302519083023), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12706612050533295)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;  ', [])"

Promazine was approved for medical use in the United States in the 1950s, although it is no longer commercially available there. == Uses == Promazine is a short-term add-on treatment for psychomotor agitation. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include agitation, amenorrhea, arrhythmias, constipation, drowsiness and dizziness, dry mouth, impotence, tiredness, galactorrhoea, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, insomnia, hypotension, prolonged QT, seizures, tremor, vomiting and weight gain, among others. === Overdose === In overdose, it may cause hypotension, hypothermia, tachycardia, and arrhythmia. Sudden death may occur, although rare. == Other animals == Promazine, given as promazine hydrochloride, is one of the primary tranquilizers used by veterinarians as a pre-anaesthesia injection in horses. It does not provide analgesia and is not a very strong sedative, hence it is used combined with opioids or α2 adrenoreceptor agonists, such as clonidine, or both. It can be used alone when performing a non-painful procedure such as the fitting a horseshoe. Low blood pressure, fast heart rate and paralysis of the penis are side effects. It is also an antiemetic, antispasmodic and hypothermic agent. Additionally it is used to lower blood pressure in animals with laminitis and kidney failure. It is available in the US for veterinary use under the names Promazine and Tranquazine. == Synthesis == == References ==",Sinophenin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.014165864326059818), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.025564473122358322), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.576189398765564)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -5.512236498361744e-07)])","('MEDICAL; ([minclinic.eu](https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/S/Sinophenin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=9, title='MIN — what is Sinophenin used for, medicine in english, dosing, side effects, generic, general information, pharmacology, interactions, contraindications, precautions, overdose, medication, treatment.', type='url_citation', url='https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/S/Sinophenin.html?utm_source=openai')])"
3836,"('Œ¥-aminolevulinic acid (hydrochloride)', 'Aminolevulinic acid', 'Pentanoic acid, 5-amino-4-oxo-', 'Delta-aminolevulinic acid', 'Aladerm')","Endogenous, Medical","δ-Aminolevulinic acid (also dALA, δ-ALA, 5ALA or 5-aminolevulinic acid), an endogenous non-proteinogenic amino acid, is the first compound in the porphyrin synthesis pathway, the pathway that leads to heme in mammals, as well as chlorophyll in plants. 5ALA is used in photodynamic detection and surgery of cancer. == Medical uses == As a precursor of a photosensitizer, 5ALA is also used as an add-on agent for photodynamic therapy. In contrast to larger photosensitizer molecules, it is predicted by computer simulations to be able to penetrate tumor cell membranes. === Cancer diagnosis === Photodynamic detection is the use of photosensitive drugs with a light source of the right wavelength for the detection of cancer, using fluorescence of the drug. 5ALA, or derivatives thereof, can be used to visualize bladder cancer by fluorescence imaging. === Cancer treatment === Aminolevulinic acid is being studied for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in a number of types of cancer. It is not currently a first line treatment for Barrett's esophagus. Its use in brain cancer is currently experimental. It has been studied in a number of gynecological cancers. Aminolevulinic acid is indicated in adults for visualization of malignant tissue during surgery for malignant glioma (World Health Organization grade III and IV). It is used to visualise tumorous tissue in neurosurgical procedures. Studies since 2006 have shown that the intraoperative use of this guiding method may reduce the tumour residual volume and prolong progression-free survival in people with malignant gliomas. The US FDA approved aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA HCL) for this use in 2017. === Intra-operative cancer delineation === Aminolevulinic acid utilization is promising in the field of cancer delineation, particularly in the context of fluorescence-guided surgery. This compound is utilized to enhance the visualization of malignant tissues during surgical procedures. When administered to patients, 5-ALA is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) preferentially in cancer cells, leading to their fluorescence under specific light wavelengths. This fluorescence aids surgeons in real-time identification and precise removal of cancerous tissue, reducing the likelihood of leaving residual tumor cells behind. This innovative approach has shown success in various cancer types, including brain and spine gliomas, bladder cancer, and oral squamous cell carcinoma. == Side effects == Side effects of administration may include liver damage and nerve problems. Hyperthermia may also occur. Deaths have also resulted. == Biosynthesis == In non-photosynthetic eukaryotes such as animals, fungi, and protozoa, as well as the class Alphaproteobacteria of bacteria, it is produced by the enzyme ALA synthase, from glycine and succinyl-CoA. This reaction is known as the Shemin pathway, which occurs in mitochondria. In plants, algae, bacteria (except for the class Alphaproteobacteria) and archaea, it is produced from glutamic acid via glutamyl-tRNA and glutamate-1-semialdehyde. The enzymes involved in this pathway are glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamyl-tRNA reductase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase. This pathway is known as the C5 or Beale pathway. In most plastid-containing species, glutamyl-tRNA is encoded by a plastid gene, and the transcription, as well as the following steps of C5 pathway, take place in plastids. == Importance in humans == === Activation of mitochondria === In humans, 5ALA is a precursor to heme. Biosynthesized 5ALA goes through a series of transformations in the cytosol, finally being converted to protoporphyrin IX inside the mitochondria. This protoporphyrin molecule chelates with iron in presence of enzyme ferrochelatase to produce heme. Heme increases the mitochondrial activity thereby helping in activation of respiratory system Krebs cycle and electron transport chain leading to formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for adequate supply of energy to the body. === Accumulation of protoporphyrin IX === Cancer cells lack or have reduced ferrochelatase activity and this results in accumulation of protoporphyrin IX, a fluorescent substance that can easily be visualized. === Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) === Excess heme is converted in macrophages to biliverdin and ferrous ions by the enzyme HO-1. Biliverdin formed can be further converted to bilirubin and carbon monoxide. Biliverdin and bilirubin are potent antioxidants and regulate important biological processes like inflammation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, fibrosis and angiogenesis. == Plants == In plants, production of 5-ALA is the step on which the speed of synthesis of chlorophyll is regulated. Plants that are fed by external 5-ALA accumulate toxic amounts of chlorophyll precursor, protochlorophyllide, indicating that the synthesis of this intermediate is not suppressed anywhere downwards in the chain of reaction. Protochlorophyllide is a strong photosensitizer in plants. Controlled spraying of 5-ALA at lower doses (up to 150 mg/L) can however help protect plants from stress and encourage growth. == References ==",Aladerm,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.20147804915905), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.1472419600977446e-06), (' END', -2.5776860184123507e-06), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -1.700132997939363e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.5822798609733582), ('ICAL', -4.887569048150908e-06), (',', -0.0009465504554100335), ('ĠEND', -0.0012553200358524919), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10151159763336182)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Blocking ghrelin receptors inhibits ghrelin-induced GH, and increases heart rate, effects that underwent tachyphylaxis with chronic dosing. PF-051940457 has the potential to treat centrally-acting disorders such as insomnia. Ghrelin increases growth hormone secretion, gastric acid secretion, gastric motility and hunger but decreases glucose-dependent insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in humans. Antagonizing the ghrelin receptor has potential as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the aim was to pharmacologically characterize the novel small-molecule antagonist PF-05190457 and assess translational pharmacology ex vivo.

3841,"('Methylmalonic acid', 'Methylpropanedioic acid', 'Methylmalonate', 'Isosuccinic acid', 'Propanedioic acid, methyl-')","Endogenous, Medical","Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a chemical compound from the group of dicarboxylic acids. It consists of the basic structure of malonic acid and also carries a methyl group. The salts of methylmalonic acid are called methylmalonates. == Metabolism == Methylmalonic acid is a by-product of the propionate metabolism pathway. The starting sources for this are the following with the respective approximate contributions to whole body propionate metabolism in brackets: essential amino acids: methionine, valine, threonine and isoleucine (~ 50%) odd-chain fatty acids (~ 30%) propionic acid from bacterial fermentation (~ 20%) cholesterol side chain thymine The propionate derivative, propionyl-CoA, is converted into D-methylmalonyl-CoA by propionyl-CoA carboxylase and then converted into L-methylmalonyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase. Entry into the citric acid cycle occurs through the conversion of L-methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA by L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, whereby vitamin B12 in the form of adenosylcobalamin is required as a coenzyme. This degradation pathway from propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA represents one of the most important anaplerotic pathways of the citric acid cycle. Methylmalonic acid is formed as a by-product of this metabolic pathway when D-methylmalonyl-CoA is cleaved into methylmalonic acid and CoA by D-methylmalonyl-CoA hydrolase. The enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 (ACSF3) is in turn responsible for the conversion of methylmalonic acid and CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA. Intracellular esterases are capable to remove the methyl group (-CH3) from methylmalonic acid and thus generate malonic acid. == Clinical relevance == === Vitamin B12 deficiency === Increased methylmalonic acid levels may indicate a vitamin B12 deficiency. The test is highly sensitive (those with vitamin B12 deficiency almost always have raised levels) but not very specific (those that do not have vitamin B12 deficiency may have raised levels too). Methylmalonic acid is elevated in 90–98% of patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. It has lower specificity since 20–25% of patients over the age of 70 have elevated levels of methylmalonic acid, but 25–33% of them do not have B12 deficiency. For this reason, the testing of methylmalonic acid levels is not routinely recommended in the elderly. === Metabolic diseases === An excess is associated with methylmalonic acidemias. If elevated methylmalonic acid levels are accompanied by elevated malonic acid levels, this may indicate the metabolic disease combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA). By calculating the malonic acid to methylmalonic acid ratio in blood plasma, CMAMMA can be distinguished from classic methylmalonic acidemia. === Cancer === Moreover, methylmalonic acid accumulation in the blood with age has been linked with tumour progression in 2020. === Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine === Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine can also lead to elevated levels of methylmalonic acid due to the competition of bacteria in the absorption process of vitamin B12. This is true of vitamin B12 from food and oral supplementation and can be circumvented by vitamin B12 injections. It is also hypothesized from case studies of patients with short bowel syndrome that intestinal bacterial overgrowth leads to increased production of propionic acid, which is a precursor to methylmalonic acid. It has been shown that in these cases, methylmalonic acid levels returned to normal with the administration of metronidazole. == Measurement == Methylmalonic acid concentrations in blood are measured by gas chromatographic mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and the expected values of methylmalonic acid in healthy people are between 73 and 271 nmol/L. == See also == Malonic acid == References == == Further reading == Vitamin B12, cognition, and brain MRI measures: a cross-sectional examination.",Methylmalonate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0025214420165866613), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.04585053026676178), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.0531076592742465e-06), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.062053438276052475), ('ĠMED', -0.0027668310794979334), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0041068983264267445)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -1.0206720617134124e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmalonic_acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=12, title='Methylmalonic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmalonic_acid?utm_source=openai')])"

It is classified as a pyrophosphate analog DNA polymerase inhibitor. Foscarnet is the conjugate base of a chemical compound with the formula HO2CPO3H2 (Trisodium phosphonoformate). Foscarnet was approved for medical use in 1991. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical use == This phosphonic acid derivative (marketed by Clinigen as foscarnet sodium under the trade name Foscavir) is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes viruses, including drug-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). It is particularly used to treat CMV retinitis. Foscarnet can be used to treat highly treatment-experienced patients with HIV as part of salvage therapy. == Mechanism of action == Foscarnet is a structural mimic of the anion pyrophosphate that selectively inhibits the pyrophosphate binding site on viral DNA polymerases at concentrations that do not affect human DNA polymerases. In individuals treated with the DNA polymerase inhibitors acyclovir or ganciclovir, HSV or CMV particles can develop mutant protein kinases (thymidine kinase or UL97 protein kinase, respectively) that make them resistant to these antiviral drugs. However, unlike acyclovir and ganciclovir, foscarnet is not activated by viral protein kinases, making it useful in acyclovir- or ganciclovir-resistant HSV and CMV infections. However, acyclovir- or ganciclovir-resistant mutants with alterations in viral DNA polymerase may also be resistant to foscarnet. == Administration == Foscarnet is administered by intravenous infusion or intravitreous injection. == Side effects == Nephrotoxicity — increase in serum creatinine levels and renal injury can occur in patients receiving foscarnet. Other nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided. Nephrotoxicity is usually reversible and can be reduced by dosage adjustment and adequate hydration. Electrolyte disturbances — hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia can occur and regular monitoring of electrolytes is necessary to avoid clinical toxicity. Genital ulceration — a less common reported side effect which occurs more in men and usually during induction use of foscarnet. It is most likely a contact dermatitis due to high concentrations of foscarnet in urine. It usually resolves rapidly following discontinuation of the drug.

It is used together with a diabetic diet and exercise. It is not indicated for use by itself in type 1 diabetes. It is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin within half an hour and can last for up to a day. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, low blood sugar, and headache. Other side effects include sleepiness, skin rash, and shakiness. The dose may need to be adjusted in those with liver or kidney disease. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. It works by stimulating the pancreas to release insulin and increases tissue sensitivity to insulin. Glipizide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1984. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 42nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 14 million prescriptions. == Mechanism of action == Glipizide sensitizes the beta cells of pancreatic islets of Langerhans insulin response, meaning that more insulin is released in response to glucose than would be without glipizide ingestion.

3848,"(""Adenosine 5'-triphosphate"", 'Adenosine triphosphate', 'Triphosphaden', 'Atipi', ""Adenosine-5'-triphosphate"")","Endogenous, Medical","Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleoside triphosphate that provides energy to drive and support many processes in living cells, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis. Found in all known forms of life, it is often referred to as the ""molecular unit of currency"" for intracellular energy transfer. When consumed in a metabolic process, ATP converts either to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP. It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA, and is used as a coenzyme. An average adult human processes around 50 kilograms (about 100 moles) daily. From the perspective of biochemistry, ATP is classified as a nucleoside triphosphate, which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate. == Structure == ATP consists of an adenine attached by the #9-nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a sugar (ribose), which in turn is attached at the 5' carbon atom of the sugar to a triphosphate group. In its many reactions related to metabolism, the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged, but the triphosphate is converted to di- and monophosphate, giving respectively the derivatives ADP and AMP. The three phosphoryl groups are labeled as alpha (α), beta (β), and, for the terminal phosphate, gamma (γ). In neutral solution, ionized ATP exists mostly as ATP4−, with a small proportion of ATP3−. === Metal cation binding === Polyanionic and featuring a potentially chelating polyphosphate group, ATP binds metal cations with high affinity. The binding constant for Mg2+ is (9554). The binding of a divalent cation, almost always magnesium, strongly affects the interaction of ATP with various proteins. Due to the strength of the ATP-Mg2+ interaction, ATP exists in the cell mostly as a complex with Mg2+ bonded to the phosphate oxygen centers. A second magnesium ion is critical for ATP binding in the kinase domain. The presence of Mg2+ regulates kinase activity. It is interesting from an RNA world perspective that ATP can carry a Mg ion which catalyzes RNA polymerization. == Chemical properties == Salts of ATP can be isolated as colorless solids. ATP is stable in aqueous solutions between pH 6.8 and 7.4 (in the absence of catalysts). At more extreme pH levels, it rapidly hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate. Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium, with ATP concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of ADP. In the context of biochemical reactions, the P-O-P bonds are frequently referred to as high-energy bonds. == Reactive aspects == The hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate ATP4-(aq) + H2O(l) = ADP3-(aq) + HPO32-(aq) + H+(aq) releases 20.5 kilojoules per mole (4.9 kcal/mol) of enthalpy. This may differ under physiological conditions if the reactant and products are not exactly in these ionization states. The values of the free energy released by cleaving either a phosphate (Pi) or a pyrophosphate (PPi) unit from ATP at standard state concentrations of 1 mol/L at pH 7 are: ATP + H2O → ADP + Pi ΔG°' = −30.5 kJ/mol (−7.3 kcal/mol) ATP + H2O → AMP + PPi ΔG°' = −45.6 kJ/mol (−10.9 kcal/mol) These abbreviated equations at a pH near 7 can be written more explicitly (R = adenosyl): [RO-P(O)2-O-P(O)2-O-PO3]4− + H2O → [RO-P(O)2-O-PO3]3− + [HPO4]2− + H+ [RO-P(O)2-O-P(O)2-O-PO3]4− + H2O → [RO-PO3]2− + [HO3P-O-PO3]3− + H+ At cytoplasmic conditions, where the ADP/ATP ratio is 10 orders of magnitude from equilibrium, the ΔG is around −57 kJ/mol. Along with pH, the free energy change of ATP hydrolysis is also associated with Mg2+ concentration, from ΔG°' = −35.7 kJ/mol at a Mg2+ concentration of zero, to ΔG°' = −31 kJ/mol at [Mg2+] = 5 mM. Higher concentrations of Mg2+ decrease free energy released in the reaction due to binding of Mg2+ ions to negatively charged oxygen atoms of ATP at pH 7. == Production from AMP and ADP == === Production, aerobic conditions === A typical intracellular concentration of ATP may be 1–10 μmol per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism. ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in eukaryotes are (1) glycolysis, (2) the citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation, and (3) beta-oxidation. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, known as cellular respiration, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. ATP production by a non-photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the mitochondria, which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell. ==== Glycolysis ==== In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are also produced, which can be oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle. Glycolysis is viewed as consisting of two phases with five steps each. In phase 1, ""the preparatory phase"", glucose is converted to 2 d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (g3p). One ATP is invested in Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. Steps 1 and 3 of glycolysis are referred to as ""Priming Steps"". In Phase 2, two equivalents of g3p are converted to two pyruvates. In Step 7, two ATP are produced. Also, in Step 10, two further equivalents of ATP are produced. In Steps 7 and 10, ATP is generated from ADP. A net of two ATPs is formed in the glycolysis cycle. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP. ===== Regulation ===== In glycolysis, hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP – the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate. ==== Citric acid cycle ==== In the mitochondrion, pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group, which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every ""turn"" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP guanosine triphosphate (GTP) through substrate-level phosphorylation catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase, as succinyl-CoA is converted to succinate, three equivalents of NADH, and one equivalent of FADH2. NADH and FADH2 are recycled (to NAD+ and FAD, respectively) by oxidative phosphorylation, generating additional ATP. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2–3 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH2 yields between 1–2 equivalents of ATP. The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular oxygen, it is an obligately aerobic process because O2 is used to recycle the NADH and FADH2. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases. The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space. In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH2 through the electron transport chain releases the energy to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This pumping generates a proton motive force that is the net effect of a pH gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient – that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix – yields ATP by ATP synthase. Three ATP are produced per turn. Although oxygen consumption appears fundamental for the maintenance of the proton motive force, in the event of oxygen shortage (hypoxia), intracellular acidosis (mediated by enhanced glycolytic rates and ATP hydrolysis), contributes to mitochondrial membrane potential and directly drives ATP synthesis. Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. ATP outward movement is favored by the membrane's electrochemical potential because the cytosol has a relatively positive charge compared to the relatively negative matrix. For every ATP transported out, it costs 1 H+. Producing one ATP costs about 3 H+. Therefore, making and exporting one ATP requires 4H+. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space. ===== Regulation ===== The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD+ to NADH and the concentrations of calcium, inorganic phosphate, ATP, ADP, and AMP. Citrate – the ion that gives its name to the cycle – is a feedback inhibitor of citrate synthase and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis. ==== Beta oxidation ==== In the presence of air and various cofactors and enzymes, fatty acids are converted to acetyl-CoA. The pathway is called beta-oxidation. Each cycle of beta-oxidation shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and produces one equivalent each of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH2. The acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, while the NADH and FADH2 are used by oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Dozens of ATP equivalents are generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain. ===== Regulation ===== In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase, which is regulated by the availability of its substrate – the reduced form of cytochrome c. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates: 1 2 NADH + cyt c ox + ADP + P i ⇌ 1 2 NAD + + cyt c red + ATP {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}{\ce {NADH}}+{\ce {cyt}}\ {\ce {c_{ox}}}+{\ce {ADP}}+{\ce {P_{i}}}\rightleftharpoons {\frac {1}{2}}{\ce {NAD^+}}+{\ce {cyt}}\ {\ce {c_{red}}}+{\ce {ATP}}} which directly implies this equation: [ c y t c r e d ] [ c y t c o x ] = ( [ N A D H ] [ N A D ] + ) 1 2 ( [ A D P ] [ P i ] [ A T P ] ) K e q {\displaystyle {\frac {[\mathrm {cyt~c_{red}} ]}{[\mathrm {cyt~c_{ox}} ]}}=\left({\frac {[\mathrm {NADH} ]}{[\mathrm {NAD} ]^{+}}}\right)^{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {[\mathrm {ADP} ][\mathrm {P_{i}} ]}{[\mathrm {ATP} ]}}\right)K_{\mathrm {eq} }} Thus, a high ratio of [NADH] to [NAD+] or a high ratio of [ADP] [Pi] to [ATP] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity. An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm. ==== Ketosis ==== Ketone bodies can be used as fuels, yielding 22 ATP and 2 GTP molecules per acetoacetate molecule when oxidized in the mitochondria. Ketone bodies are transported from the liver to other tissues, where acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate can be reconverted to acetyl-CoA to produce reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH2), via the citric acid cycle. Ketone bodies cannot be used as fuel by the liver, because the liver lacks the enzyme β-ketoacyl-CoA transferase, also called thiolase. Acetoacetate in low concentrations is taken up by the liver and undergoes detoxification through the methylglyoxal pathway which ends with lactate. Acetoacetate in high concentrations is absorbed by cells other than those in the liver and enters a different pathway via 1,2-propanediol. Though the pathway follows a different series of steps requiring ATP, 1,2-propanediol can be turned into pyruvate. === Production, anaerobic conditions === Fermentation is the metabolism of organic compounds in the absence of air. It involves substrate-level phosphorylation in the absence of a respiratory electron transport chain. The equation for the reaction of glucose to form lactic acid is: C6H12O6 + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 CH3CH(OH)COOH + 2 ATP + 2 H2O Anaerobic respiration is respiration in the absence of O2. Prokaryotes can utilize a variety of electron acceptors. These include nitrate, sulfate, and carbon dioxide. ==== ATP replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate kinases ==== ATP can also be synthesized through several so-called ""replenishment"" reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the ATP:guanido-phosphotransferase family. === ATP production during photosynthesis === In plants, ATP is synthesized in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. The process is called photophosphorylation. The ""machinery"" is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force. ATP synthase then ensues exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation. Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the Calvin cycle, which produces triose sugars. === ATP recycling === The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 mol/L. The majority of ATP is recycled from ADP by the aforementioned processes. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + ADP remains fairly constant. The energy used by human cells in an adult requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150 mol/L of ATP daily, which means a human will typically use their body weight worth of ATP over the course of the day. Each equivalent of ATP is recycled 1000–1500 times during a single day (150 / 0.1 = 1500), at approximately 9×1020 molecules/s. == Biochemical functions == === Intracellular signaling === ATP is involved in signal transduction by serving as substrate for kinases, enzymes that transfer phosphate groups. Kinases are the most common ATP-binding proteins. They share a small number of common folds. Phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase can activate a cascade such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. ATP is also a substrate of adenylate cyclase, most commonly in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to second messenger, cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes. === DNA and RNA synthesis === ATP is one of four monomers required in the synthesis of RNA. The process is promoted by RNA polymerases. A similar process occurs in the formation of DNA, except that ATP is first converted to the deoxyribonucleotide dATP. Like many condensation reactions in nature, DNA replication and DNA transcription also consume ATP. === Amino acid activation in protein synthesis === Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes consume ATP in the attachment tRNA to amino acids, forming aminoacyl-tRNA complexes. Aminoacyl transferase binds AMP-amino acid to tRNA. The coupling reaction proceeds in two steps: aa + ATP ⟶ aa-AMP + PPi aa-AMP + tRNA ⟶ aa-tRNA + AMP The amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3′-end of the tRNA (the A in the sequence CCA) via an ester bond (roll over in illustration). === ATP binding cassette transporter === Transporting chemicals out of a cell against a gradient is often associated with ATP hydrolysis. Transport is mediated by ATP binding cassette transporters. The human genome encodes 48 ABC transporters, that are used for exporting drugs, lipids, and other compounds. === Extracellular signalling and neurotransmission === Cells secrete ATP to communicate with other cells in a process called purinergic signalling. ATP serves as a neurotransmitter in many parts of the nervous system, modulates ciliary beating, affects vascular oxygen supply etc. ATP is either secreted directly across the cell membrane through channel proteins or is pumped into vesicles which then fuse with the membrane. Cells detect ATP using the purinergic receptor proteins P2X and P2Y. ATP has been shown to be a critically important signalling molecule for microglia - neuron interactions in the adult brain, as well as during brain development. Furthermore, tissue-injury induced ATP-signalling is a major factor in rapid microglial phenotype changes. === Muscle contraction === ATP fuels muscle contractions. Muscle contractions are regulated by signaling pathways, although different muscle types being regulated by specific pathways and stimuli based on their particular function. However, in all muscle types, contraction is performed by the proteins actin and myosin. ATP is initially bound to myosin. When ATPase hydrolyzes the bound ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate, myosin is positioned in a way that it can bind to actin. Myosin bound by ADP and Pi forms cross-bridges with actin and the subsequent release of ADP and Pi releases energy as the power stroke. The power stroke causes actin filament to slide past the myosin filament, shortening the muscle and causing a contraction. Another ATP molecule can then bind to myosin, releasing it from actin and allowing this process to repeat. === Protein solubility === ATP has recently been proposed to act as a biological hydrotrope and has been shown to affect proteome-wide solubility. == Abiogenic origins == Acetyl phosphate (AcP), a precursor to ATP, can readily be synthesized at modest yields from thioacetate in pH 7 and 20 °C and pH 8 and 50 °C, although acetyl phosphate is less stable in warmer temperatures and alkaline conditions than in cooler and acidic to neutral conditions. It is unable to promote polymerization of ribonucleotides and amino acids and was only capable of phosphorylation of organic compounds. It was shown that it can promote aggregation and stabilization of AMP in the presence of Na+, aggregation of nucleotides could promote polymerization above 75 °C in the absence of Na+. It is possible that polymerization promoted by AcP could occur at mineral surfaces. It was shown that ADP can only be phosphorylated to ATP by AcP and other nucleoside triphosphates were not phosphorylated by AcP. This might explain why all lifeforms use ATP to drive biochemical reactions. == ATP analogues == Biochemistry laboratories often use in vitro studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates. Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions. Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead, they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. Caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration. == Medical use == ATP is used intravenously for some heart-related conditions. == History == ATP was discovered in 1929 by Karl Lohmann and Jendrassik and, independently, by Cyrus Fiske and Yellapragada Subba Rao of Harvard Medical School, both teams competing against each other to find an assay for phosphorus. It was proposed to be the intermediary between energy-yielding and energy-requiring reactions in cells by Fritz Albert Lipmann in 1941. It was first synthesized in the laboratory by Alexander Todd in 1948, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1957 partly for this work. The 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Peter Dennis Mitchell for the discovery of the chemiosmotic mechanism of ATP synthesis. The 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was divided, one half jointly to Paul D. Boyer and John E. Walker ""for their elucidation of the enzymatic mechanism underlying the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)"" and the other half to Jens C.

In 2020, it was approved in Brazil only as an adjunctive to the treatment of major depressive disorder. == Side effects == The most common adverse events associated with brexpiprazole (all doses of brexpiprazole cumulatively greater than or equal to 5% vs. placebo) were upper respiratory tract infection (6.9% vs. 4.8%), akathisia (6.6% vs. 3.2%), weight gain (6.3% vs. 0.8%), and nasopharyngitis (5.0% vs. 1.6%). Brexpiprazole can cause impulse control disorders. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Brexpiprazole acts as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. Partial agonists have both blocking properties and stimulating properties at the receptor they bind to. The ratio of blocking activity to stimulating activity determines a portion of its clinical effects. Brexpiprazole has more blocking and less stimulating activity at the dopamine receptors than its predecessor, aripiprazole, which may decrease its risk for agitation and restlessness. Specifically, where aripiprazole has an intrinsic activity or agonist effect at the D2 receptor of 60%+, brexpiprazole has an intrinsic activity at the same receptor of about 45%. For aripiprazole, this means more dopamine receptor activation at lower doses, with blockade being reached at higher doses, while brexpiprazole has the inverse effect because a partial agonist is considered to terminate its motoric side effects due to their agonistic behaviour which gets suppressed earlier with lower dosages when they have less intrinsic value. This is also the reason (nevertheless with the seemingly against-decided competition in the antipsychotic of choice, and this also with the fact, that brexpiprazole fell into the age of development having much more information privileges of considering and adjust of its maximum recommended dose, right under before it went off-label) why through its significant lower value than all other neuroleptics from the 3rd generation (e.g. cariprazine(D3,70% for example), it could be considered as working with some similar efficacy than a full antagonist (like perphenazine) at the D2 receptor, so a receptor occupation of only 68+% at the maximum recommended dose is seen enough (compared with the necessary occupation of 90% at the D2 receptor when administered aripiprazole or cariprazine). What is being surprisingly is to did the effort of evaluating this molecules all nanoMolar affinitys in with at development, because yet, (like transporteraffinity, one can also see in ziprasidone for example) some antipsychotics are capable of blocking transporters. But it turned out that (also together with ziprasidones also weak nanoMolar ability of 112) brexpiprazole has just the weak DAT-transporter nanoMolar affinity of the multiple of 0.8 compared with its affinity at dopamin D2 receptors (meaning that there has to be the 8-fold of the maximum recommended dose to be as sufficient as at this transporters then brexpiprazole does on postsynaptic D2-dopaminreceptors). Brexpiprazole has a high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor, acting as a potent antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors, and a potent partial agonist at dopamine D2 receptors with lower intrinsic activity compared to aripiprazole. In vivo characterization of brexpiprazole shows that it may act as a near-full agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor. This may further underlie a lower potential than aripiprazole to cause treatment-emergent, movement-related disorders such as akathisia due to the downstream dopamine release that is triggered by 5-HT1A receptor agonism. It is also an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT7 receptors, which may contribute to antidepressant effect. It also binds to and blocks the α1A-, α1B-, α1D-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors. The drug has negligible affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and hence has no anticholinergic effects. Although brexpiprazole has less affinity for H1 compared to aripiprazole, weight gain can occur. == History == === Clinical trials === Brexpiprazole was in clinical trials for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. ==== Major depressive disorder ==== ===== Phase II ===== The phase II multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomized 429 adult MDD patients who exhibited an inadequate response to one to three approved antidepressant treatments (ADTs) in the current episode. The study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of brexpiprazole as an adjunctive treatment to standard antidepressant treatment. The antidepressants included in the study were desvenlafaxine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. ===== Phase III ===== A phase III study was in the recruiting stage: ""Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Two Fixed Doses of OPC-34712 as Adjunctive Therapy in the Treatment of Adults With Major Depressive Disorder (the Polaris Trial)"". Its goal is ""to compare the effect of brexpiprazole to the effect of placebo (an inactive substance) as add on treatment to an assigned FDA approved antidepressant treatment (ADT) in patients with major depressive disorder who demonstrate an incomplete response to a prospective trial of the same assigned FDA approved ADT"". Estimated enrollment was 1250 volunteers. ==== Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ==== Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (STEP-A) ==== Schizophrenia ==== ===== Phase I ===== Trial to Evaluate the Effects of OPC-34712 (brexpiprazole) on QT/QTc in Subjects With Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder ===== Phase II ===== A Dose-finding Trial of OPC-34712 in Patients With Schizophrenia ===== Phase III ===== Efficacy Study of OPC-34712 in Adults With Acute Schizophrenia (BEACON) Study of the Effectiveness of Three Different Doses of OPC-34712 in the Treatment of Adults With Acute Schizophrenia (VECTOR) A Long-term Trial of OPC-34712 in Patients With Schizophrenia ==== Agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease ==== The effectiveness of brexpiprazole for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease was determined through two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies. In these studies, participants were required to have a probable diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia; have a score between 5 and 22 on the Mini-Mental State Examination, a test that detects whether a person is experiencing cognitive impairment; and exhibit the type, frequency, and severity of agitation behaviors that require medication. Trial participants ranged between 51 and 90 years of age. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In January 2018, it was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in Japan. === Economics === In November 2011, Otsuka Pharmaceutical and Lundbeck announced a global alliance. === Patents === U.S. patent 8,071,600 WIPO PCT/JP2006/317704 Canadian patent: 2620688 == Research == Brexpiprazole was under development for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as an adjunct to stimulants, but was discontinued for this indication. It reached phase II clinical trials for this use prior to discontinuation. Brexpiprazole has shown promise in clinical trials for the treatment of borderline personality disorder. == References == == External links == Media related to Brexpiprazole at Wikimedia Commons",Rxulti,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6689160474925302e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016819016309455037)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/rxulti ', [])"

The name ropivacaine refers to both the racemate and the marketed S-enantiomer. Ropivacaine hydrochloride is commonly marketed by AstraZeneca under the brand name Naropin. == History == Ropivacaine was developed after bupivacaine was noted to be associated with cardiac arrest, particularly in pregnant women. Ropivacaine was found to have less cardiotoxicity than bupivacaine in animal models. == Clinical use == === Contraindications === Ropivacaine is contraindicated for intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA). However, new data suggested both ropivacaine (1.2-1.8 mg/kg in 40ml) and levobupivacaine (40 ml of 0.125% solution) can be used, because they have less cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity than racemic bupivacaine. === Adverse effects === Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are rare when it is administered correctly. Most ADRs relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, however allergic reactions can rarely occur. Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of ropivacaine mainly result in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects – CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. CNS effects may include CNS excitation (nervousness, tingling around the mouth, tinnitus, tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, seizures followed by depression (drowsiness, loss of consciousness), respiratory depression and apnea). Cardiovascular effects include hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and/or cardiac arrest – some of which may be due to hypoxemia secondary to respiratory depression. === Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis === Ropivacaine is toxic to cartilage and their intra-articular infusions can lead to Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis. === Treatment of overdose === As for bupivacaine, Celepid, a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion, can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anaesthetic overdose in animal experiments and in humans in a process called lipid rescue. == References ==",Ropivacaine hydrochloride,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2159273865108844e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009238027851097286)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ropivacaine-injection-route/description/drg-20065875?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=144, start_index=9, title='Ropivacaine (injection route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ropivacaine-injection-route/description/drg-20065875?utm_source=openai')])"

RTI-194 was additionally evaluated i.g. (3-100 mg/kg) for its ability to prevent footshock-induced reinstatement of responding previously reinforced with 0.5-mg/kg/inf cocaine. RTI-194 significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated U50,488-induced diuresis when given i.g., s.c., and i.p. RTI-194s effectiveness increased 1 week following administration. RTI-212 was ineffective. RTI-230 was ineffective when given i.g., but blocked diuresis at 24 h and 8 days (1, 10, and 30 mg/kg), 15 days (10 and 30 mg/kg), 22 and 29 days (30 mg/kg) following i.p. administration. Footshock reinstated responding in vehicle-but not RTI-194 (30 and 100 mg/kg)-treated rats. RTI-194 and RTI-230 are effective KOR antagonists, and RTI-194 is now included with JDTic as the only reported compounds capable of antagonizing the KOR following oral administration.

LAT-1 (1014 amino acids, 113 KDa coded by the B0457.1 gene) and LAT-2 (1338 amino acids, 147 KDa coded by the B0286.2 gene) are located presynaptically at the neuromuscular junction in Caenorhabditis elegans and share 21% amino acid identity with each other (the amino acid sequence homology LAT-1 shares with rat, bovine and human latrophilins has been shown to be 22, 23 and 21% respectively). Following receptor-ligand binding, a conformational change induced in the receptor activates the Gq protein, freeing the Gqα subunit from the βγ complex. The Gqα protein then goes on to couple-to and activate the signaling molecule phospholipase-C-β, a protein that has been identified as being key to the modulation of regulatory pathways of vesicle release in C.elegans. In its signaling cascade, PLC-β (like other phospholipases) hydrolyses phosphatidylinositolbisphosphate to yield inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). As IP3 receptors have sparse or little distribution throughout the pharyngeal nervous system of C.elegans (one of the tissues where LAT-1 agonists such as α-LTX and emodepside have their most predominant effects) and β-phorbel esters (which mimic the effects of DAG) have been shown to have a stimulatory action on synaptic transmission, it has been concluded that it is the DAG component of the cascade that regulates neurotransmitter release. Indeed, in C.elegans DAG regulates UNC-13, a plasma-membrane associated protein critical for vesicle-mediated neurotransmitter release and mutational studies have shown that two UNC-13 reduction of function mutants show resistance to emodepside, observations supporting this hypothesized mechanism of action. The mechanism by which activation of UNC-13 results in neurotransmitter release (the ultimate result of latrophilin activation) is through interaction with the synaptosomal membrane protein syntaxin, with UNC-13 binding to the N-terminus of syntaxin and promoting the switch from the closed form of syntaxin (which is incompatible with SNARE complex synaptobrevin, SNAP-25 and syntaxin formation) to its open formation so that SNARE complex formation can be achieved, thereby allowing vesicle fusion and release to take place. At a molecular level, the net result of the activation of this pathway, is the spontaneous stimulation of inhibitory PF1-like neuropeptide release (this is suspected due to Emodepside's inhibition of acetylcholine-elicited muscle contraction requiring both calcium ions and extracellular potassium ions, similar to the action of PF1/PF2). Although in experiments on synaptosomes, α-LTX triggered non-calcium dependent exocytosis of vesicles containing acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA, both glutamate and GABA have been ruled out as the sole neurotransmitters responsible for emodepside's action) which then acts on the post-synaptic membrane (i.e. the pharyngeal/muscle membrane) of the nematode, having an inhibitory effect thereby either inducing paralysis or inhibiting pharyngeal pumping, both of which ultimately result in the death of the organism. Mutational studies involving LAT-1 knockout and LAT-2 gene deletion mutants have revealed that the role of latrophilin receptors in the different tissues that they are expressed differs between subtypes, with LAT-1 being expressed in the pharynx of C.elegans (thereby modulating pharyngeal pumping) and LAT-2 having a role in locomotion. In addition to exerting an effect on the nematode via binding to Latrophilin receptors, there is also recent evidence that indicates that emodepside also interacts with the BK potassium channel coded by the gene Slo-1. This protein (see figure for structure) is a member of the 6 transmembrane helix structural class of potassium ion channels with each subunit consisting of 6 transmembrane helices and 1 P domain (this P domain is conserved in all potassium ion channels and forms the selectivity filter that enables the channel to transport potassium ions across the membrane in great preference to other ions). These subunits group together to form high conductance BK-type channels that are gated by both membrane potential and intracellular calcium levels (this calcium ion sensing ability is accommodated by an intracellular tail region on Slo-like subunits that form a calcium ion binding motif consisting of a run of conserved aspartate residues, termed a “calcium bowl”), with their physiological role being to regulate the excitability of neurons and muscle fibres, through the way in which they participate in action potential repolariziation (with potassium ion efflux being used to repolarize the cell following depolarization). The presumable effect that emodepside interaction with these channels would exert on the neuron would be to activate the channel causing potassium ion efflux, hyper-polarization and subsequent inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitter effect (acetylcholine if acting at the neuromuscular junction), having an inhibitory effect on synaptic transmission, the production of postsynaptic action potentials and ultimately muscle contraction (manifesting itself as paralysis or reduced pharyngeal pumping). Which out of Latrophilin receptors and BK-potassium channels is emodepside's primary site of action remains to be completely deduced. Both LAT-1/LAT-2 and slo-1 mutants (reduction/loss of function) show significant resistance to emodepside with it being conceivable that the presence of both is required for emodepside to induce its full effect. == Therapeutic use == The patent for emodepside is owned by the Bayer Health Care group and is sold in combination with another anthelmintic (praziquantel) for topical application under the tradename Profender. == References ==",Emodepside,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001767145935446024), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10022394359111786)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([dndi.org](https://dndi.org/research-development/portfolio/emodepside/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=100, start_index=9, title='Emodepside | DNDi', type='url_citation', url='https://dndi.org/research-development/portfolio/emodepside/?utm_source=openai')])"

Because TRPA1 has been implicated in inflammatory responses, and inflammation and tumorigenesis are stimulated by the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 pathway in hypoxic cancer cells. This study examined the effects of methyl syringate on hypoxia-induced COX-2 in human distal lung epithelial A549 cells. The effect of the methyl syringate on suppression of hypoxia-induced COX-2 in A549 cells were determined by Western blot and/or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The anti-invasive effect of methyl syringate was evaluated on A549 cells using matrigel invasion assay. Methyl syringate suppressed hypoxia-induced COX-2 protein and mRNA expression and promoter activity and reduced hypoxia-induced cell migration and invasion and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. These effects were antagonized by a TRPA1 antagonist, implying their mediation by the TRPA1 pathway. Together, these results indicate that methyl syringate inhibits the hypoxic induction of COX-2 expression and cell invasion through TRPA1 activation. These findings suggest that methyl syringate could be effective to suppress hypoxia-induced inflammation and indicate an additional functional effect of methyl syringate. Several protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), particularly PTPN1, PTPN2, PTPN6, PTPN9, PTPN11, PTPRS, and DUSP9, are involved in insulin resistance. Therefore, these PTPs could be promising targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Our previous studies revealed that PTPN2 and PTPN6 are potential antidiabetic targets. Therefore, the identification of dual-targeting inhibitors of PTPN2 and PTPN6 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment or prevention of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we demonstrate that methyl syringate inhibits the catalytic activity of PTPN2 and PTPN6 in vitro, indicating that methyl syringate acts as a dual-targeting inhibitor of PTPN2 and PTPN6. Furthermore, methyl syringate treatment significantly increased glucose uptake in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, methyl syringate markedly enhanced phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that methyl syringate, a dual-targeting inhibitor of PTPN2 and PTPN6, is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment or prevention of type 2 diabetes.

It is used either by mouth or injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, vomiting, sleepiness, loss of appetite, cough, rash, and joint pain. Serious side effects include allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe for the baby but this use has not been well studied. Mesna is an organosulfur compound. It works by altering the breakdown products of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide found in the urine making them less toxic. Mesna was approved for medical use in the United States in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Chemotherapy adjuvant === Mesna is used therapeutically to reduce the incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis and haematuria when a patient receives ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide for cancer chemotherapy. These two anticancer agents, in vivo, may be converted to urotoxic metabolites, such as acrolein. Mesna assists to detoxify these metabolites by reaction of its sulfhydryl group with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl containing compounds such as acrolein. This reaction is known as a Michael addition. Mesna also increases urinary excretion of cysteine. === Other === Outside North America, mesna is also used as a mucolytic agent, working in the same way as acetylcysteine; it is sold for this indication as Mistabron and Mistabronco. == Administration == It is administered intravenously or orally (through the mouth). The IV mesna infusions would be given with IV ifosfamide, while oral mesna would be given with oral cyclophosphamide. The oral doses must be double the intravenous (IV) mesna dose due to bioavailability issues. The oral preparation allows patients to leave the hospital sooner, instead of staying four to five days for all the IV mesna infusions. == Mechanism of action == Mesna reduces the toxicity of urotoxic compounds that may form after chemotherapy administration. Mesna is a water-soluble compound with antioxidant properties, and is given concomitantly with the chemotherapeutic agents cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Mesna concentrates in the bladder where acrolein accumulates after administration of chemotherapy and through a Michael addition, forms a conjugate with acrolein and other urotoxic metabolites. This conjugation reaction inactivates the urotoxic compounds to harmless metabolites. The metabolites are then excreted in the urine. == Names == It is marketed by Baxter as Uromitexan and Mesnex.

Trade names include Sumithion, a 94.2% solution of fenitrothion. == Health effects == Fenitrothion at sublethal doses affected the motor movement of marsupials, and at acute dose levels it reduced the energy of birds. In chronic (low) dose tests, unexpectedly only the lowest concentration (0.011 microgram/liter) of fenitrothion depressed the growth of an algae, though all of the chronic dose levels used were toxic in other ways to the algae. Just half of fenitrothion's minimally effective dose altered the thyroid structure of a freshwater murrel (the snakehead fish). Cases of non-specific encephalopathy and fatty visceral changes (Reye's syndrome) in children living in the vicinity of fenitrothion-spraying operations invoked the research described latterly in Science, and originally in The Lancet: 2-day-old mice were dosed topically for 11 days with fenitrothion, amongst other substances. After a further 2 days a sublethal dose of encephalomyocarditis virus was injected subcutaneously in known titre.

The possible role of exposure to combinations of insecticides in human viral susceptibility requires further attention.

3862,"('Levomefolate (calcium)',)","Endogenous, Medical"," Neural tube defects are the second most common congenital anomaly in the United States, although their incidence may be decreased by periconception folic acid supplementation. A new oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol plus levomefolate calcium was formulated to decrease the risk of neural tube defects in pregnancies conceived while taking or shortly after discontinuing this pill. Because of its novelty, very few studies have been performed to evaluate the efficacy, side effects and safety related to contraception, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and acne; therefore, literature evaluating similar contraceptives without levomefolate is reviewed. Additionally, we review studies evaluating the addition of levomefolate calcium to oral contraceptives containing 3 mg drospirenone and either 20 or 30 μg ethinyl estradiol. To date, no study has been performed to evaluate the effect this new oral contraceptive has on reducing the incidence of neural tube defects. This new pill has similar contraceptive efficacy, side effect, safety and benefits profile to other drospirenone-containing contraceptives. While also approved to prevent neural tube defects, no studies validate this claim and physician time is better spent counseling women, regardless of contraceptive choice, on the importance of folic acid supplementation during the child-bearing years. Neural tube defects (NTDs) are congenital malformations that occur during early embryonic development. Suboptimal maternal folate status is a well-known risk factor for the occurrence of NTDs, and periconceptional folic acid supplementation has been shown to reduce the risk of NTDs. Folate-supplemented oral contraceptives (OCs) offer a means of improving folate status in women of childbearing potential by increasing their likelihood of having raised folate levels at the time of conception. This study aimed to demonstrate bioequivalence of ethinylestradiol (EE), drospirenone and L-5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (L-5-methyl-THF; active moiety of levomefolate calcium) when taken as a new folate-supplemented OC containing EE/drospirenone/levomefolate calcium, with the respective OC containing EE/drospirenone and a tablet containing levomefolate calcium only. This was a randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study carried out at a single centre in Germany. The study included 45 healthy women (age range 18-38 years). The women were randomly assigned to single doses of (i) EE 0.03 mg/drospirenone 3 mg/levomefolate calcium 0.451 mg (SAFYRAL®), (ii) EE 0.03 mg/drospirenone 3 mg (Yasmin®), and (iii) levomefolate calcium 0.451 mg, administered using a crossover design, with one or more menstrual cycle washout between doses. The primary variables were maximum concentrations (C(max)) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) values for EE, drospirenone and L-5-methyl-THF. The bioavailability of EE and drospirenone was similar after administration of EE/drospirenone/levomefolate calcium and EE/drospirenone. The geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and its 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC values and C(max) were within the pre-specified range (80.00-125.00%) for bioequivalence for EE and drospirenone in both formulations. The bioavailability of L-5-methyl-THF was similar after administration of EE/drospirenone/levomefolate calcium and levomefolate calcium. The respective GMRs and 90% CIs of baseline-uncorrected and -corrected AUC(last) (AUC from time zero to time of last measurable concentration) and C(max) were also within the 80.00-125.00% range. The novel folate-supplemented OC EE/drospirenone/levomefolate calcium is bioequivalent to the established OC Yasmin® (EE/drospirenone components) and to levomefolate calcium (folate component). A new tablet formulation containing 0.02 mg ethinylestradiol/3 mg drospirenone/0.451 mg levomefolate calcium (calcium salt containing 0.416 mg L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) was assessed for bioequivalence compared to the approved oral contraceptive (OC) tablet containing identical amounts of ethinylestradiol and drospirenone and to a tablet containing 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium. Forty-four subjects received in an intraindividual crossover design single doses of the new tablet formulation or the established ethinylestradiol/drospirenone tablet or the levomefolate calcium tablet. Bioequivalence was demonstrated for ethinylestradiol, drospirenone and L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (active moiety of levomefolate calcium) between the investigated tablet formulations. The geometric mean ratios of the AUC((0-tlast)) and C(max) values for all three compounds and their 90% confidence intervals were well within the 80%-125% range generally accepted to demonstrate bioequivalence.
