1588,"('Riboflavin (phosphate sodium)', ""Riboflavin 5'-phosphate sodium"", 'Vitamin b2 phosphate sodium salt', 'Flavin mononucleotide', ""Riboflavin 5'-phosphate"")","Food, Medical","Flavin mononucleotide (FMN), or riboflavin-5′-phosphate, is a biomolecule produced from riboflavin (vitamin B2) by the enzyme riboflavin kinase and functions as the prosthetic group of various oxidoreductases, including NADH dehydrogenase, as well as a cofactor in biological blue-light photo receptors. During the catalytic cycle, various oxidoreductases induce reversible interconversions between the oxidized (FMN), semiquinone (FMNH•), and reduced (FMNH2) forms of the isoalloxazine core. FMN is a stronger oxidizing agent than NAD and is particularly useful because it can take part in both one- and two-electron transfers. In its role as blue-light photo receptor, (oxidized) FMN stands out from the 'conventional' photo receptors as the signaling state and not an E/Z isomerization. It is the principal form in which riboflavin is found in cells and tissues. It requires more energy to produce, but is more soluble than riboflavin. In cells, FMN occurs freely circulating but also in several covalently bound forms. Covalently or non-covalently bound FMN is a cofactor of many enzymes playing an important pathophysiological role in cellular metabolism. For example dissociation of flavin mononucleotide from mitochondrial complex I has been shown to occur during ischemia/reperfusion brain injury during stroke. == Food additive == Flavin mononucleotide is also used as an orange-red food colour additive, designated in Europe as E number E101a. E106, a very closely related food dye, is riboflavin-5′-phosphate sodium salt, which consists mainly of the monosodium salt of the 5′-monophosphate ester of riboflavin. It is rapidly turned to free riboflavin after ingestion. It is found in many foods for babies and young children as well as jams, milk products, and sweets and sugar products. == See also == Flavin adenine dinucleotide == References == == External links == FMN in the EBI Macromolecular Structure Database",Flavin mononucleotide,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.006018506363034248), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00026169343618676066), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -2.696889623621246e-06)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.17104493081569672), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.003197915619239211), ('ĠEND', -0.010778306052088737), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011847150744870305)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.001170225441455841), (' FOOD', -3.380904672667384e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_mononucleotide?utm_source=openai), [go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03247?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=194, start_index=27, title='Flavin mononucleotide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_mononucleotide?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=194, start_index=27, title='Flavin mononucleotide: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03247?utm_source=openai')])"

A solid scientific rationale and an increasing body of clinical evidence fully support the use of an antimuscarinic agent combined with a β-agonist in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this article, we focus on the development of an inhaled fixed dose combination (FDC) of two 24-h bronchodilators, umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol (UMEC/VI) (ANORO). Several pivotal clinical trials have documented the impact of this combination on lung function and other outcome measures such as quality of life, dyspnea, rescue medication use and exercise capacity, with no clinically meaningful treatment-related changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory parameters. These results allow us to predict that UMEC/VI will have a role in the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It remains to determine its impact on exacerbations.

It also forms nonfluorescent intercalative complexes with double-stranded nucleic acids. The physicochemical properties of the dye and its complexes with nucleic acids and history of the development of this dye as a biological stain are described. The application of DAPI as a DNA-specific probe for flow cytometry, chromosome staining, DNA visualization and quantitation in histochemistry and biochemistry is reviewed. The mechanisms of DAPI-nucleic acid complex formation including minor groove binding, intercalation and condensation are discussed. A number of fluorescent stains are available that label DNA and allow easy visualization of the nucleus in interphase cells and chromosomes in mitotic cells, including Hoechst, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), ethidium bromide, propidium iodide, and acridine orange. Although not as bright as the vital Hoechst stains for DNA, DAPI has greater photostability. It is believed that DAPI associates with the minor groove of double-stranded DNA, with a preference for the adenine-thymine clusters. Cells must be permeabilized and/or fixed for DAPI to enter the cell and to bind DNA. Fluorescence increases approximately 20-fold when DAPI is bound to double-stranded DNA. This protocol describes the use of DAPI to label nuclear DNA of cells grown in culture. The fluorescent dye DAPI is useful for its association with and consequent amplification of an ∼460 nm emission maximum upon binding to dsDNA. Labelling with higher DAPI concentrations is a technique used to reveal Pi polymers [polyphosphate (polyP)], with a red-shift to ∼520-550 nm fluorescence emission. DAPI-polyP emissions of ∼580 nm are also generated upon 415 nm excitation. Red-shifted DAPI emission has been associated with polyP and RNA and has more recently been reported with polyadenylic acid (polyA), specific inositol phosphates (IPs) and heparin. We find that amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) also demonstrates red-shifted DAPI emission at high DAPI concentrations. This DAPI spectral shift has been attributed to DAPI-DAPI electrostatic interactions enabled by molecules with high negative charge density that increase the local DAPI concentration and favour DAPI molecular proximity, as observed by increasing the dye/phosphate ratio. Excitation of dry DAPI (∼360 nm) confirmed a red-shifted DAPI emission. Whereas enzymatic approaches to modify substrates can help define the nature of DAPI fluorescence signals, multiple approaches beyond red-shifted DAPI excitation/emission are advised before conclusions are drawn about DAPI substrate identification.",Dapi,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5759711861610413)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.16975137591362), ('DU', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31336307525634766)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAPI,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8580206/,https://hellobio.com/dapi.html ', [])"

Therapeutic options for AML that are relapsed or refractory to front-line chemotherapy are limited, and the development of effective agents for this indication is an unmet need. The aminopeptidase-inhibitor tosedostat (CHR-2797) is a novel metalloenzyme inhibitor that blocks a critical step in the protein degradation and re-synthesizes intracellular pathway. This orally bioavailable agent has shown promising activity in vitro and in early clinical trials for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. This review summarizes the development of tosedostat to date. Specifically, the authors review the literature on its mechanism of action, pharmacoepidemiology and the currently available preclinical and clinical data. Tosedostat is an oral agent with a novel mechanism of action. Early trials of tosedostat in relapsed/refractory elderly AML have shown encouraging results in a population with an overall very poor prognosis. This is particularly noted in patients with a prior history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and hypomethylating-agent (HMA) use. Additional studies of tosedostat in rationally designed combinations with cytarabine and HMAs in advanced MDS and refractory AML populations are ongoing. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy evaluation is similarly ongoing, and patient selection will be an important consideration in the continued development of this promising compound.

In our laboratories, we have discovered that it possesses analgesic properties. Extensive  Acute myeloid leukemia is most often diagnosed in patients older than 60 years of age. Overall, these patients have a poor prognosis, partly because they are typically unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy regimens traditionally offered to younger individuals. Furthermore, responses attained in these older patients are not durable, with most experiencing relapse within 1-2 years. Therefore, new strategies are needed to improve the outcome of older patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Tosedostat is an orally available aminopeptidase inhibitor shown to have activity in leukemia.

Topical olumacostat glasaretil application decreases hamster ear sebaceous gland size and shows efficacy in treating patients with acne vulgaris. Olumacostat glasaretil-mediated sebum suppression may reduce Propionibacterium acnes growth and biofilm formation, comedogenesis, and inflammation. Olumacostat glasaretil (OG) inhibits acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, the enzyme responsible for the first, rate-limiting step in de novo fatty acid synthesis. OG inhibited in vitro human sebocyte lipid production and reduced in vivo sebaceous gland size in hamster ears. Safety and efficacy of OG 7.5% gel were evaluated in patients with moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris. Patients were randomized (1:1) to twice-daily application of OG or vehicle for 12 weeks. Efficacy was measured through changes in lesion counts and improvement in acne severity scores. A total of 108 patients received OG (n = 53) or vehicle (n = 55); these groups had mean baseline counts of 29.7 and 28.6 inflammatory and 40.9 and 38.8 noninflammatory lesions, respectively. At week 12, OG treatment showed greater reductions from baseline in inflammatory lesions (-63.9% vs -45.9%; P = .0006) and noninflammatory lesions (-48.1% vs -28.8%; P = .0025), and more patients with greater than or equal to 2-grade improvement in investigator global assessment score (24.5% vs 7.3%; P = .0070) than vehicle. Application-site adverse events (typically mild or moderate intensity) were more common with OG. Larger trials are needed to optimize OG dosing and confirm the current results. OG was well tolerated and showed evidence of efficacy, suggesting further development is warranted. Olumacostat glasaretil (OG) is a small molecule inhibitor of acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (ACC), the enzyme that controls the first rate-limiting step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Inhibition of ACC activity in the sebaceous glands is designed to substantially affect sebum production, because over 80% of human sebum components contain fatty acids. OG inhibits de novo lipid synthesis in primary and transformed human sebocytes. TrueMass Sebum Panel analyses showed a reduction in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acyl chains across lipid species, including di- and triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, and wax esters in OG-treated sebocytes. There was no shift to shorter acyl chain lengths observed, suggesting that the fatty acid chain elongation process was not affected. OG is a pro-drug of the ACC inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid and was designed to enhance delivery in vivo. Topical application of OG but not 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid significantly reduced hamster ear sebaceous gland size, indicating that this pro-drug approach was critical to obtain the desired activity in vivo. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses of hamster ear extracts showed that OG treatment increased ACC levels and the ratio of acetyl-CoA to free CoA in these animals, indicating increased fatty acid oxidation. These changes are consistent with ACC inhibition. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging showed that OG applied onto Yorkshire pig ears accumulated in sebaceous glands relative to the surrounding dermis. Sebaceous gland ACC represents an attractive therapeutic target given its central role in formation of sebum, a key factor in acne pathogenesis.",Olumacostat glasaretil,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.613945101387799e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003847335756290704), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02978038601577282)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28259683/,https://pharmafile.com/news/dermira-terminates-acne-drug-after-phase-3-failure-wiping-667m-market-value/,https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/dermira-dumps-acne-drug-after-phase-3-flubs ', [])"
1601,"('Probucol', 'Lorelco', 'Biphenabid', 'Bisphenabid', 'Lurselle')",Medical,"Probucol, sold under the trade name Lorelco among others, is an lipid-lowering agent initially developed for the treatment of coronary artery disease. Clinical use was discontinued in some countries after it was found that the drug may have the undesired effect of lowering HDL-C in patients with a previous history of heart disease. It may also cause QT interval prolongation. Probucol was originally developed as an industrial antioxidant added to tires to maximize their longevity. == Medical uses == In Japan, it is approved for ""hyperlipidemia (including familial hypercholesterolemia and xanthomas)"". In China, it is approved for hypercholesterolemia. == Adverse effects == During both clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance, most adverse effects were limited to the digestive system and the skin. Those included diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, rash, and itching. For each of these effect, the incidence was between 0.1% and 1% (""uncommon""). QT prolongation was noted as rare (< 0.1%) in the package inserts. Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, LDH), elevated BUN, reduction in red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelet count, elevated creatine kinase are also possible. The Chinese package insert states that ALT, AST, bilirubin, uric acid, and BUN elevations are transient. Possible serious adverse effects include ventricular arrhythmia (Torsades de pointes), syncope, gastrointestinal bleeding, peripheral neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis. The frequency of these are unknown. == Drug interactions == May reduce the blood concentration of cyclosporin (unknown mechanism). There exist reports of significantly declined HDL-C with clofibrate (unknown mechanism). Risk of arrhythmia is elevated when used with other drugs that can cause arrhythmia, especially tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines. Potentiates the effect of diabetic medications and coumarin anticoagulants. == Mechanism of action == Probucol lowers the level of cholesterol in the bloodstream by increasing the rate of LDL catabolism. Specifically, this happens by changing the structure of LDL, among other effects. The LDL receptor is not involved: it works in rabbits and humans without a working LDL receptor (homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia). It also enhances the excretion of cholesterol into bile. It is able to lower LDL-C by 10-20%. It is also a powerful antioxidant. At a low dose (insufficient to affect LDL-C or HDL-C levels), it prevents the oxidation of cholestrol in LDLs. This might slow the formation of foam cells, which form atherosclerotic plaques. It partially does this by increasing PON1 activity, thus increasing the antioxidant properties of HDL. Probucol also lowers HDL-C (HDL cholesterol, i.e. the amount of cholesterol found in HDLs) by about 30%. This has historically caused its discontinuation from several Western countries. This has several causes: It inhibits ABCA1-dependent cholesterol transport (but not SR-BI–mediated efflux), which moves cholesterol from cells such as macrophages into HDL. It increases CETP activity by lowering the amount of ANGPTL3. This also causes an increase in preβ1-HDL (lipid-poor particles) and a decrease in HDL phospholipids. It increases HDL absorption by the liver via SR-BI. Recall that one of the functions of HDL is reverse cholesterol transport (moving cholesterol from peripheral tissues into the liver). Inhibition of ABCA1 would be detrimental to the process, whereas enhancing CETP and SR-BI activities is beneficial for the transport function. Overall, probucol increases the capacity for reverse cholesterol transport, so the observed HDL-C reduction does not lead to a decrease in a patient's cholesterol-removing ability. The adverse effect of QT prolongation is possibly due to inhibition of hERG trafficking. == Pharmacokinetics == Oral absorption is limited and erratic. Food increases absorption. With a single oral dose of 250 mg, tmax is at 18 hours post-ingestion. If taken daily, 3 to 4 months are required to reach steady-state concentrations. The tissue distribution of probucol has been studied in rats, dogs, and monkeys using a 14C-labelled version of the drug. In rats, a single 100 mg/kg dose results in liver, adrenal glands, and brown fat concentrations at 3–10× plasma concentration and central nervous system, gonad, and eye concentrations at 1/7–1/20× plasma concentration. In rats, 21 days of continuous 100 mg/kg/d feeding results in accumulation in brown fat, adrenal glands, liver, and adipose tissue at 10–46× plasma concentration and central nervous system, gonad, and eye concentrations at 1–1/2× plasma concentration. == Research == Probucol has been found to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties via several different mechanisms. These properties have led to research into the drug's potential capacity to treat sensorineural hearing loss related to oxidative stress, as well as formulations to improve the delivery of the drug into the ear. After promising test results in mouse models, probucol is under study at Weston Brain Institute of McGill University as a possible aid in delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The protocol for a future Australian Phase II study was published in 2022. Novel packaging methods have been tried to optimize the pharmacokinetic properties of probucol – the goal is usually to produce a more stable absorption profile and to reduce absorption by cardiac muscle cells. Some show promise in lab animals, but have not yet been tested in humans. === Analogues === A number of probucol analogues have been tested in animal models by researchers seeking to optimize aspects of probucol's action while reducing its side effects. Succinobucol, the succinate ester of probucol, failed to demonstrate a useful degree of efficacy in clinical trials targeting acute coronary syndrome. BO-653, another analogue, failed its phase II trial targeting atherosclerosis treatment and prevention of post-angioplasty restenosis. == Society and culture == In Japan, Probucol was available under both the Lorelco brand name, the Sinlestal brand name, and the generic ""TOWA"" brand. In January 2021, Towa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. announced that it would discontinue the sale of Probucol Tablets 250 mg ""TOWA"" due to various circumstances. == References ==",Lurselle,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0007218453683890402), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0007105246186256409), (' INDUSTR', -0.0011761783389374614), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.04473275691270828), ('ICAL', -7.986990567587782e-06), (',', -0.10111948847770691), ('ĠINDU', -0.0022724061273038387), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019194527994841337)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/lurselle,https://db.idrblab.net/ttd/data/drug/details/d0h2dq ', [])"
1602,"('Glucosamine (hydrochloride)', 'Glucosamine hydrochloride', 'Chitosamine hydrochloride', '(2r,3r,4s,5r)-2-amino-3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyhexanal', 'Aldehydo-d-glucosamine')","Endogenous, Medical","Glucosamine (C6H13NO5) is an amino sugar and a prominent precursor in the biochemical synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Glucosamine is part of the structure of two polysaccharides, chitosan and chitin. Glucosamine is one of the most abundant monosaccharides. Produced commercially by the hydrolysis of shellfish exoskeletons or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as corn or wheat, glucosamine has many names depending on country. Although a common dietary supplement, there is little evidence that it is effective for relief of arthritis or pain, and is not an approved prescription drug in the United States. == Dietary supplement == Oral glucosamine is a dietary supplement and is not a prescription drug in the United States. Glucosamine is marketed as a supplement to support the structure and function of joints, and the marketing is targeted to people with osteoarthritis. Commonly sold forms of glucosamine are glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine chondroitin, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetylglucosamine. Of the three commonly available forms of glucosamine, only glucosamine sulfate is given a ""likely effective"" rating for treating osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is often sold in combination with other supplements such as chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane. Glucosamine, along with commonly used chondroitin, is not routinely prescribed to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, as there is insufficient evidence that this treatment is helpful. As is common with heavily promoted dietary supplements, the claimed benefits of glucosamine are based principally on clinical and laboratory studies. Clinical studies on glucosamine efficacy are divided, with some reporting relief from arthritic pain and stiffness, while others report no benefit above placebo. As of 2015, there is no evidence that consumption of glucosamine by sport participants prevents or limits joint damage after injury. == Adverse effects and drug interactions == Glucosamine with or without chondroitin elevates the international normalized ratio (INR) in individuals who are taking the blood thinner, warfarin. It may also interfere with the efficacy of chemotherapy for treating cancer symptoms. Adverse effects are mild and infrequent and may include stomach upset, constipation, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Since glucosamine is usually derived from the shells of shellfish, it may be unsafe for those with shellfish allergy. Many manufacturers of glucosamine derived from shellfish include a warning that those with a seafood allergy should consult a healthcare professional before taking the product. Alternatively, non-shellfish-derived forms of glucosamine are available. Another concern has been that the extra glucosamine could contribute to diabetes by interfering with the normal regulation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, but several investigations found no evidence that this occurs. Other studies conducted in lean or obese subjects concluded that oral glucosamine at standard doses does not affect insulin resistance. == Biochemistry == Glucosamine is naturally present in the shells of shellfish, animal bones, bone marrow, and fungi. D-Glucosamine is made naturally in the form of glucosamine-6-phosphate, and is the biochemical precursor of all nitrogen-containing sugars. Specifically in humans, glucosamine-6-phosphate is synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine by glutamine—fructose-6-phosphate transaminase as the first step of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. The end-product of this pathway is uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is then used for making glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. As the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate is the first step for the synthesis of these products, glucosamine may be important in regulating their production; however, the way that the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is actually regulated, and whether this could be involved in contributing to human disease remains unclear. == Manufacturing == Most glucosamine is manufactured by processing chitin from the shells of shellfish including shrimp, lobsters, and crabs. To meet the demands of vegetarians and others with objections to shellfish, manufacturers have brought glucosamine products to market made using fungus Aspergillus niger and from fermenting corn. == History == Glucosamine was first prepared in 1876 by Georg Ledderhose by the hydrolysis of chitin with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The stereochemistry was not fully determined until the 1939 work of Walter Haworth. == Legal status == === United States === In the United States, glucosamine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use in humans. Since glucosamine is classified as a dietary supplement in the United States, evidence of safety is required by FDA regulations, but evidence of efficacy is not required so long as it is not advertised as a treatment for a medical condition. In 2004, the FDA declared there was insufficient evidence for supplement manufacturers to state that glucosamine was effective for treating arthritis, joint degeneration, or cartilage deterioration, a position remaining in effect as of 2018. === Europe === In most of Europe, glucosamine is approved as a medical drug and is sold in the form of glucosamine sulfate. In this case, evidence of safety and efficacy is required for the medical use of glucosamine and several guidelines have recommended its use as an effective and safe therapy for osteoarthritis. The Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee has granted glucosamine sulfate a level of toxicity of 5 in a 0-100 scale, and recent OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) guidelines for hip and knee osteoarthritis indicate an acceptable safety profile. By 2014, the OARSI did not recommend glucosamine for disease modification, and considered it ""uncertain"" for symptom relief, in knee osteoarthritis. === Class-action lawsuits === In 2013, without admitting fault, manufacturer Rexall Sundown and NBTY agreed to pay up to US$2 million to settle consumer claims related to the wording of certain claims on the packaging of glucosamine bottles sold at Costco under the Kirkland label. In August 2012, a class-action lawsuit was filed in New York claiming that 21st Century Healthcare, Inc. had falsely advertised that its ""Glucosamine 750 Chondroitin 600 Triple Strength"" dietary supplements would restore lost cartilage. In April 2013, a San Diego man launched a proposed class-action lawsuit in California Federal Court accusing Nutramax Laboratories, Walmart and Rite Aid of falsely advertising the effectiveness of glucosamine. == Research == === Humans === Because glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of cartilage, research has focused on the potential for supplemental glucosamine to improve cartilage structure and alleviate arthritis, but there is little evidence from clinical trials that it is effective for alleviating arthritis pain. ==== Bioavailability ==== Two studies measured the concentrations of glucosamine in the synovial fluid and plasma after oral administration of glucosamine sulfate to both healthy volunteers and people with osteoarthritis. In the first study, glucosamine sulfate was given to healthy volunteers in doses of 750, 1,500, or 3,000 mg once daily. In the second study, oral glucosamine sulfate capsules (1,500 mg) were given daily for two weeks to 12 people with osteoarthritis. Glucosamine concentrations in plasma and synovial fluid increased significantly from baseline levels, and the levels in the two fluids were highly correlated. The authors interpreted that these levels could be biologically advantageous to articular cartilage, but the levels are still ten to one hundred times lower than required to positively influence the cartilage (chondrocytes) to build new tissue. Glucosamine sulfate uptake in synovial fluid may be as much as 20%, or it could be negligible, indicating no biological significance. == Veterinary medicine == === Dogs === Some studies have shown efficacy of glucosamine supplementation for dogs with osteoarthritis pain, particularly in combination with other nutraceuticals like chondroitin, while others have not. A trial of oral combination capsules (glucosamine, chondroitin, and manganese ascorbate) in dogs with osteoarthritis found no benefit on either gait analysis or subjective assessments by the veterinarian or owner. === Horses === The use of glucosamine in equine medicine exists, but one meta-analysis judged extant research too flawed to be of value in guiding treatment of horses. A number of studies have measured the bioavailability of glucosamine after oral administration to horses. When given as a single oral dose (9 g) with or without chondroitin sulfate (3 g) to ten horses, glucosamine (hydrochloride) was detected in the blood with a maximum level of 10.6±6.9 μg/mL at two hours after dosing. Another study examined both the serum and the joint synovial fluid after nasogastric (oral) or intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg glucosamine hydrochloride to eight adult horses. Although joint fluid concentrations of glucosamine reached 9–15 μmol/L following intravenous dosing, it was only 0.3–0.7 μmol/L with nasogastric dosing. The authors calculated that these glucosamine synovial fluid levels achieved by the oral route were 500 times lower than that required to have a positive effect on the metabolism of cartilage cells. A follow-up study by the same research group compared glucosamine sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride at the same dose (20 mg/kg) in eight horses and found a higher fluid concentration with the sulfate preparation (158 ng/mL compared to 89 ng/mL one hour post oral dose). They concluded that these higher synovial fluid levels obtained with the sulfate derivative were still too low to have a relevant biological effect on articular cartilage. A three-month trial of an oral dosage regime of a commercial preparation of glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane was performed in veteran horses with no effect on gait stiffness, with exercise alone in the control group being effective. The intravenous use of a combination of N-acetylglucosamine, pentosan polysulfate and sodium hyaluronate in horses with surgically-induced osteoarthritis saw improvements in X-ray changes to the cartilage but not histologically or in biochemical outcomes, suggesting more evidence is needed for this combination and route of administration. == See also == Chitobiose == References == == External links == Glucosamine and Chondroitin for Osteoarthritis Pain, Arthritis Foundation Glucosamine, DailyMed, U.S. National Library of Medicine MedFacts Natural Products",Glucosamine hydrochloride,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.2180086374282837), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.014172795228660107), (' END', -0.6134929656982422), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -1.5094070477061905e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.10029950737953186), (' PERSONAL', -0.006844192277640104), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.11849517375230789), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0025475923903286457), ('ĠMED', -1.3417893648147583), ('ICAL', -4.768360213347478e-06), (',', -0.47429436445236206), ('ĠEND', -0.4591255784034729), ('OG', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04865318909287453)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.005234952084720135), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.676292231422849e-05), (' FOOD', -9.014684110297821e-06)])","('Glucosamine hydrochloride is classified as FOOD and PERSONAL CARE.

Voglibose was discovered in 1981, and was first launched in Japan in 1994, under the trade name BASEN, to improve postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus. Postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) is primarily due to first phase insulin secretion. Alpha glucosidase inhibitors delay glucose absorption at the intestine level and thereby prevent sudden surge of glucose after a meal. There are three major drugs which belong to this class, acarbose, miglitol and voglibose, of which voglibose is the newest. == Efficacy == A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

Transesterification of isomaltotriose and palmitic acid vinyl ester, catalyzed by the metalloprotease thermolysin, was performed in organic solvents. The process parameters (reaction time and temperature) were optimized to achieve the highest yield of isomaltotriose palmitate (IP). The water content of the reaction system played a key role in the acylation of isomaltotriose. Dimethyl sulfoxide was thought to be the most suitable reaction medium by taking the degree of substitution of the modified isomaltotriose into account. The optimum reaction time, temperature, water content, and enzyme concentration were 24h, 45°C, 40%, and 0.05%, respectively, under which the product yield was as high as 89.7%. The enzyme operational stability study showed that thermolysin retained 51.5% of its initial activity for the synthesis of IP (even after repeated use for 72h). Moreover, test results showed that the emulsifying capacity and emulsion stability of IP are 107.5mL oil/g ester and 16.3%, respectively. An isomaltotriose-producing endo-dextranase was simply purified from cell-free culture broth of a Fusarium sp. by ethanol fractionation and consecutive column chromatographies using DEAE-Toyopearl and Bio-Gel P-100. The purified enzyme was judged to be homogeneous on PAGE and SDS-PAGE as well as isoelectric focusing. The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be about 69 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme is an acidic protein with a pI of 4.6. The optimum pH and temperature were pH 6.5 and 35 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was completely stable over the range of pH 4.5-11.8 at 4 degrees C for 24 h and at temperatures below 45 degrees C. Inactivation of the enzyme was found to be partial with 5 mM Cu2+, being about 70% inhibition and complete with 5 mM of Fe3+, Hg2+, Ag+ or NBS. The enzyme split dextran in an endo-lytic action to produce a large amount of isomaltotriose and a slight amount of isomaltose and glucose. The anomeric configurations of the reaction products formed by the enzyme were alpha-form, indicating that the alpha-glycoside linkages in the substrate are retained.

ACA is an effective reversible inhibitor of calcium-activated chloride channels and, to a lesser extent, cAMP-activated chloride channels, without affecting L-type calcium channels. Calcium-activated chloride channels are believed to be involved in developing arrhythmia. == Arrhythmia == Arrhythmia is a cardiac disease which is characterized by an irregular heartbeat. Some forms of arrhythmia are dangerous and life-threatening, while others are comparably minor. Heart cells (cardiac myocytes) contract due to an increase in the charge across the membrane (depolarization), which generates an action potential. Irregular contractions can cause arrhythmia to occur. == Calcium-activated chloride channels == The calcium-activated chloride channel is present in cardiac myocytes of many species, such as rabbit and pig, but their presence in human cardiac myocytes is under debate. Some have provided evidence that these channels are present in human atrial cells, while others have failed to find similar results. The calcium-activated chloride channel is an important component in the early phase of repolarization (bringing the charge across the membrane back to normal) of cardiac muscle cells, contributing to the plateau formation during an action potential. While the heart is at rest, the chloride channel current can be activated, causing an outward flow of chloride, inducing a depolarizing current. This current is generally large enough to generate an action potential, called a delayed after-depolarization. Delayed after-depolarizations can lead to arrhythmias. Since the chloride channel is bound and activated by calcium, this tends to occur more often in cells that are already under calcium stress. The calcium-activated chloride current is also doubled when stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system, likely due to an increase in calcium release, although the channel could potentially be under a direct control by the sympathetic nervous system. == Treatment of arrhythmia == Due to the ability of the calcium-activated chloride channel to generate arrhythmias, blockage of the channel may result in antiarrythmogenic action. Blocking the calcium current reduces delayed after-depolarization amplitudes enough to prevent generation of an action potential. ACA has been shown to inhibit the calcium-activated chloride current, but this effect is reversible upon removal of the drug. ACA may also inhibit hyperpolarization of the cell, prolonging the action potential. ACA has potential as an antiarrhythmogenic treatment, as well as a tool to further study chloride channels. == References ==",N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.04858816787600517), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.2030189037322998), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.160254567861557)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-%28p-Amylcinnamoyl%29anthranilic_acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=115, start_index=6, title='N-(p-Amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-%28p-Amylcinnamoyl%29anthranilic_acid?utm_source=openai')])"
1608,"('Monensin sodium salt', 'Monensin a sodium salt', 'Monensin', 'Monensic acid', 'Monensin a')",Medical,"Monensin is a polyether antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces cinnamonensis. It is widely used in ruminant animal feeds. The structure of monensin was first described by Agtarap et al. in 1967, and was the first polyether antibiotic to have its structure elucidated in this way. The first total synthesis of monensin was reported in 1979 by Kishi et al. == Mechanism of action == Monensin A is an ionophore related to the crown ethers with a preference to form complexes with monovalent cations such as: Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Ag+, and Tl+. Monensin A is able to transport these cations across lipid membranes of cells in an electroneutral (i.e. non-depolarizing) exchange, playing an important role as an Na+/H+ antiporter. Recent studies have shown that monensin may transport sodium ion through the membrane in both electrogenic and electroneutral manner. This approach explains ionophoric ability and in consequence antibacterial properties of not only parental monensin, but also its derivatives that do not possess carboxylic groups. It blocks intracellular protein transport, and exhibits antibiotic, antimalarial, and other biological activities. The antibacterial properties of monensin and its derivatives are a result of their ability to transport metal cations through cellular and subcellular membranes. == Uses == Monensin is used extensively in the beef and dairy industries to prevent coccidiosis, increase the production of propionic acid and prevent bloat. Furthermore, monensin, but also its derivatives monensin methyl ester (MME), and particularly monensin decyl ester (MDE) are widely used in ion-selective electrodes. In laboratory research, monensin is used extensively to block Golgi transport. == Toxicity == Monensin has some degree of activity on mammalian cells and thus toxicity is common. This is especially pronounced in horses, where monensin has a median lethal dose 1/100 that of ruminants. Accidental poisoning of equines with monensin is a well-documented occurrence which has resulted in deaths. == References ==",Monensic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.055338967591524124), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.776684582233429), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.02985108457505703), ('ĠMED', -0.07102520018815994), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1006169468164444)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.08493901044130325), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The antitumor efficacy of Tegavivint was evaluated in vitro using established OS and PDX-derived cell lines. Use of an ex vivo three-dimensional pulmonary metastasis assay assessed targeting of β-catenin activity during micro- and macrometastatic development. The in vivo activity of Tegavivint was evaluated using chemoresistant and metastatic OS PDX models. Gene and protein expression were quantified by quantitative Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or immunoblot analysis. Bone integrity was determined via microCT. All statistical tests were two-sided. Tegavivint exhibited antiproliferative activity against OS cells in vitro and actively reduced micro- and macrometastatic development ex vivo. Multiple OS PDX tumors (n = 3), including paired patient primary and lung metastatic tumors with inherent chemoresistance, were suppressed by Tegavivint in vivo. We identified that metastatic lung OS cell lines (n = 2) exhibited increased stem cell signatures, including enhanced concomitant aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) and β-catenin expression and downstream activity, which were suppressed by Tegavivint (ALDH1: control group, mean relative mRNA expression = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68 to 1.22 vs Tegavivint group, mean = 0.011, 95% CI = 0.0012 to 0.056, P < .001; β-catenin: control group, mean relative mRNA expression = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.36 vs Tegavivint group, mean = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.52, P < .001). ALDH1high PDX-derived lung OS cells, which demonstrated enhanced metastatic potential compared with ALDHlow cells in vivo, were sensitive to Tegavivint. Toxicity studies revealed decreased bone density in male Tegavivint-treated mice (n = 4 mice per group). Tegavivint is a promising therapeutic agent for advanced stages of OS via its targeting of the β-catenin/ALDH1 axis. Over the last three decades changes in the treatment paradigm for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) have led to a significant increase in overall survival. Despite this, the majority of patients relapse after one or more lines of treatment while acquiring resistance to available therapies. Panobinostat, a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in 2015 for patients with relapsed MM but how to incorporate panobinostat most effectively into everyday practice remains unclear. Dysregulation of the Wnt canonical pathway, and its key mediator β-catenin, has been shown to be important for the evolution of MM and the acquisition of drug resistance, making it a potentially attractive therapeutic target. Despite concerns regarding the safety of Wnt pathway inhibitors, we have recently shown that the β-catenin inhibitor Tegavivint is deliverable and effective in in vivo models of MM. In this study we show that the combination of low concentrations of panobinostat and Tegavivint have significant in vitro and in vivo anti-MM effects including in the context of proteasome inhibitor resistance, by targeting both aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration and the down-regulation of down-stream β-catenin targets including myc, cyclinD1, and cyclinD2.

This open-label Phase I study enrolled healthy volunteers and patients with severe RI aged 18 - 65 years. All subjects received a single infusion of sodium chloride injection with 500 mg morinidazole. Plasma and urine concentration of morinidazole and one of its metabolites (M4-1) were evaluated by using HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS/MS respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by Phoenix WinNonlin 6.0 software. 22 individuals (healthy: n = 11, severe RI: n = 11) received morinidazole. In both groups, maximum plasma concentration of morinidazole was reached within 1 hour, while the tmax of M4-1 differed greatly. Both AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of morinidazole were 1.4 times higher in patients with severe RI, while M4-1 were over 7 times higher than healthy groups. Renal excretion of unchanged morinidazole was decreased by 65% in patients with RI, and M4-1 was decreased by 72%. Apparent correlation between CLcr and CL, AUC, t1/2 and CLr were seen in two groups. A single dose of 500 mg morinidazole is well tolerated. Changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of morinidazole and M4-1 are seen in patients with RI and may be clinically important.

1611,"('Vinorelbine (ditartrate)', ""Nor-5'-anhydrovinblastine ditartrate"", 'Vinorelbine')",Medical,"Vinorelbine (NVB), sold under the brand name Navelbine among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. It is given by injection into a vein or by mouth. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, pain at the site of injection, vomiting, feeling tired, numbness, and diarrhea. Other serious side effects include shortness of breath. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Vinorelbine is in the vinca alkaloid family of medications. It is believed to work by disrupting the normal function of microtubules and thereby stopping cell division. Vinorelbine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1994. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Vinorelbine is approved for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. It is used off-label for other cancers such as metastatic breast cancer and for aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). It is also active in rhabdomyosarcoma. == Side effects == Vinorelbine has a number of side-effects that can limit its use: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (a progressive, enduring and often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs), lowered resistance to infection, bruising or bleeding, anaemia, constipation, vomitings, diarrhea, nausea, tiredness and a general feeling of weakness (asthenia), inflammation of the vein into which it was injected (phlebitis). Seldom severe hyponatremia is seen. Less common effects are hair loss and allergic reaction. == Pharmacology == The antitumor activity is due to inhibition of mitosis through interaction with tubulin. == History == Vinorelbine was invented by the pharmacist Pierre Potier and his team from the CNRS in France in the 1980s and was licensed to the oncology department of the Pierre Fabre Group. The drug was approved in France in 1989 under the brand name Navelbine for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. It gained approval to treat metastatic breast cancer in 1991. Vinorelbine received approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 1994 sponsored by Burroughs Wellcome Company. Pierre Fabre Group now markets Navelbine in the U.S., where the drug went generic in February 2003. In most European countries, vinorelbine is approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. In the United States it is approved only for non-small cell lung cancer. === Sources === The Madagascan periwinkle Catharanthus roseus L. is the source for a number of important natural products, including catharanthine and vindoline and the vinca alkaloids it produces from them: leurosine and the chemotherapy agents vinblastine and vincristine, all of which can be obtained from the plant. The newer semi-synthetic chemotherapeutic agent vinorelbine, which is used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer and is not known to occur naturally. However, it can be prepared either from vindoline and catharanthine or from leurosine, in both cases by synthesis of anhydrovinblastine. The leurosine pathway uses the Nugent–RajanBabu reagent in a highly chemoselective de-oxygenation of leurosine. Anhydrovinblastine is then reacted sequentially with N-bromosuccinimide and trifluoroacetic acid followed by silver tetrafluoroborate to yield vinorelbine. == Oral formulation == An oral formulation has been marketed and registered in most European countries. It has similar efficacy as the intravenous formulation, but it avoids venous toxicities of an infusion and is easier to take.

1613,"('Enalapril (maleate)', 'Enalapril', 'Vasotec', 'Enalaprilum', 'Enalaprila')",Medical,"Enalapril, sold under the brand name Vasotec among others, is an ACE inhibitor medication used to treat high blood pressure, diabetic kidney disease, and heart failure. For heart failure, it is generally used with a diuretic, such as furosemide. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Onset of effects are typically within an hour when taken by mouth and last for up to a day. Common side effects include headache, tiredness, feeling lightheaded with standing, and cough. Serious side effects include angioedema and low blood pressure. Use during pregnancy is believed to result in harm to the baby. It is in the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor family of medications. Enalapril was patented in 1978, and came into medical use in 1984. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 141st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medicine. == Medical uses == Enalapril is used to treat hypertension, symptomatic heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. ACE-inhibitors (including enalapril) have demonstrated ability to reduce the progression and worsening of existing chronic kidney disease in the presence of proteinuria/microalbuminuria (protein in the urine, a biomarker for chronic kidney disease). This renal protective effect is not seen in the absence of proteinuria/microalbuminuria, including in diabetic populations. The benefit has been particularly demonstrated in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes, and is likely to be seen in other populations (although further studies and subgroup analyses of existing studies are needed) It is widely used in chronic kidney failure. Furthermore, enalapril is an emerging treatment for psychogenic polydipsia. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, enalapril led to decreased water consumption (determined by urine output and osmolality) in 60% of patients. == Side effects == The most common side effects of enalapril include increased serum creatinine (20%), dizziness (2–8%), low blood pressure (1–7%), syncope (2%), and dry cough (1–2%). The most serious common adverse event is angioedema (swelling) (0.68%) which often affects the face and lips, endangering the patient's airway. Angioedema can occur at any point during treatment with enalapril, but is most common after the first few doses. Angioedema and fatality therefrom are reportedly higher among black people. Agranulocytosis has been observed with Enalapril. Some evidence suggests enalapril will cause injury and death to a developing fetus. In pregnancy, enalapril may result in damage to the fetus's kidneys and resulting oligohydramnios (not enough amniotic fluid). Enalapril is secreted in breast milk and is not recommended for use while breastfeeding. == Mechanism of action == Normally, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II constricts blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. Enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, inhibits ACE. Inhibition of ACE decreases levels of angiotensin II, leading to less vasoconstriction and decreased blood pressure. == Pharmacokinetics == Pharmacokinetic data of enalapril: Onset of action: about 1 hour Peak effect: 4–6 hours Duration: 12–24 hours Absorption: ~60% Metabolism: prodrug, undergoes biotransformation to enalaprilat == Structure activity relationship == Enalapril has an L-proline moiety as a part of the molecule which is responsible for the oral bioavailability of the drug. It is a pro-drug, which means that it exerts its function after being metabolized. The ""-OCH2CH3"" part of the molecule will split during the metabolism and at the carbon will be a carboxylate, which then interacts with the Zn+2 site of the ACE enzyme. This structural feature and mechanism of metabolism that must occur before the drug can inhibit the enzyme explains why it has a greater duration of action than another similar drug used for the same indication, Captopril. Duration of effect is dose-related; at recommended doses, antihypertensive and haemodynamic effects have been shown to be maintained for at least 24 hours. Enalapril has a slower onset of action than Captopril but a greater duration of action. However, unlike Captopril, Enalapril does not have a thiol moiety. == History == Squibb developed the first ACE inhibitor, captopril, but it had adverse effects such as a metallic taste (which, as it turned out, was due to the sulfhydryl group). Merck developed enalapril as a competing product.: 12–13 Enalaprilat was developed first, partly to overcome these limitations of captopril. The sulfhydryl moiety was replaced by a carboxylate moiety, but additional modifications were required in its structure-based design to achieve a potency similar to captopril. Enalaprilat, however, had a problem of its own in that it had poor oral availability. This was overcome by the Merck researchers through the esterification of enalaprilat with ethanol to produce enalapril. Merck introduced enalapril to market in 1981; it became Merck's first billion dollar-selling drug in 1988. The patent expired in 2000, opening the way for generics. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In September 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a pediatric use marketing authorization for the medicinal product Aqumeldi, intended for the treatment of heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years of age.

We tested 7 major secondary metabolites from wheat for their effect on trichothecene production in liquid cultures of F. graminearum producing trichothecene 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON). 2,4-Dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA) benzoxazinoid completely abolished toxin production without any apparent effect on fungal growth. DIMBOA strongly affected the expression of Tri6, encoding a major transcriptional regulator of several genes of the trichothecene biosynthesis pathway. DIMBOA also repressed expression of Tri5, encoding trichodiene synthase, the first enzyme in the trichothecene biosynthesis pathway. Thus, DIMBOA could play an important role against the accumulation of trichothecenes in wheat grain. Breeding or engineering of wheat with increased levels of benzoxazinoids could provide varieties with increased resistance against trichothecene contamination of grain and lower susceptibility to FHB. Cyclic hydroxamic acids present in some species of Gramineae have been reported to be important in resistance of these plants to fungi and insects. Since the nonglucosylated forms of these acids are unstable in aqueous solution, in vitro methods for the measurement of their antibiotic properties have been difficult. Kinetics of the decomposition of 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA), the major hydroxamate in corn (Zea mays L.) extracts, were studied in buffered aqueous solutions from pH 5 to 7.5 at temperatures from 20 to 80 C. Kinetics were apparently first order under all conditions tested; energies of activation (24 to 28 kcal/mol) were nearly pH-independent. DIMBOA decomposed rapidly (half-life = 5.3 hours at 28 C, pH 6.75) relative to the time required for many procedures which have been used to demonstrate the biological activity of DIMBOA. The rate of disappearance of inhibitory activity of DIMBOA toward Erwinia carotovora was indistinguishable from the rate of decomposition of DIMBOA. Contrary to reports, yields of 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA) were not quantitative. Gas-liquid chromatography analytical procedures were developed for quantitation of trimethylsilyl and acetyl derivatives of MBOA. As measured by ultraviolet spectroscopy and/or gas-liquid chromatography, conversion of DIMBOA to MBOA ranged from 40 to 75% of theoretical in aqueous buffers, bacterial growth medium, and ethyl acetate extracts of corn tissue resuspended in buffer. Yields varied with temperature, pH, and constituents in the medium. Benzoxazinoids have been described as important allelochemicals from Gramineae as well as Acanthaceae, Rannunculaceae, and Scrophulariaceae plants. Several bioactivities have been described and evaluated for these compounds, including fungistatic, antifeedant, and phytotoxic. In ongoing studies about allelochemicals as natural herbicide models, the description of soil dynamics in phytotoxic agents has high importance, because the possible biotransformations developed by soil microorganisms could yield compounds with modified biological properties, affecting the overall allelopathic capability of the producer plant in a direct manner. Thus, a complete degradation study has been carried out for 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-(2H)-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA) and 6-methoxybenzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (MBOA) in two soils cultivated with Triticum aestivum L. varieties (cv. Astron and cv. Ritmo). The main purpose was to identify degradation products and to elucidate biotransformation dynamics. Results show DIMBOA to degrade rapidly, yielding MBOA in both studied soils at different doses (t(1/2) = 31 +/- 1 h, n = 12) and reaching high conversions (80 +/- 4 h, n = 42). MBOA, an intermediate in the degradation pathway from DIMBOA to 2-amino-7-methoxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one (AMPO), was more resistant toward biodegradation (t(1/2) = 5 +/- 1 days, n = 6).

At one time, it was commonly referred to as M&B 693. Sulfapyridine is no longer prescribed for treatment of infections in humans. However, it may be used to treat linear IgA disease and has use in veterinary medicine. It is a good antibacterial drug, but its water solubility is very pH dependent. Thus there is a risk of crystallization within the bladder or urethra, which could lead to pain or blockage. As with other sulfonamides, there is a significant risk of agranulocytosis, and this, rather than the development of resistance by bacteria, is the main reason for its decline in use. == History == M&B 693 was one of the first generation of sulfonamide antibiotics. It was discovered by Lionel Whitby at the British firm May & Baker Ltd and logged in their Test Book on 2 November, 1937 under Code No M&B 693. During the aftermath to the disastrous convoy SC7, in October 1940, Surgeon-Lieutenant John Robertson, RN, of HMS Leith, saved the life of Commodore Lachlan MacKinnon, from the torpedoed Assyrian, who had developed pneumonia, by giving him M&B 693, despite Robertson never having used it before and not knowing the required dosage. M&B 693 was successfully used to treat Winston Churchill's bacterial pneumonia. The same source records that in 1944 M&B 693 also saved Nero, the Royal Circus lion, from pneumonia. It could either be taken in tablet form or the powder could be placed in wounds. It was used so widely during the Second World War that May & Baker had difficulty keeping up with demand. It was later largely superseded by penicillin and other sulfonamides. == Related medications == The drug sulfasalazine is structurally one molecule of mesalamine linked to one molecule of sulfapyridine with an azo chemical linker. == References ==",Streptosilpyridine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001961701549589634), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0074106561951339245), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20154060423374176)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://db.idrblab.net/ttd/data/drug/details/d0d4cy,https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/110510/,https://www.epa.govt.nz/database-search/new-zealand-inventory-of-chemicals-nzioc/view/CCBF3EE1-13A6-4F21-B3E2-68807C3E9697,https://www.chemicalregister.com/Shenyang_Yumu_Industrial_Co_Ltd/Supplier/sid26916.htm,https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/sulfapyridine,https://www.fishersci.ca/shop/products/sulfapyridine-tci-america/s007125g,https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/articles/10/146 ', [])"

It acts as a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor. == Medical use == Valbenazine is used to treat tardive dyskinesia in adults. Tardive dyskinesia is a drug-induced neurological injury characterized by involuntary movements. The clinical trials that led to the approval of valbenazine by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were six weeks in duration. An industry-sponsored study has studied the use of valbenazine for up to 48 weeks, in which it was found to be safe and effective for maintaining short-term (6 week) improvements in tardive dyskinesia. == Contraindications == There are no contraindications for the use of valbenazine according to the prescribing information. == Adverse effects == Side effects may include sleepiness or QT prolongation. Significant prolongation has not yet been observed at recommended dosage levels, however, those taking inhibitors of the liver enzymes CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 – or who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers – may be at risk for significant prolongation. Valbenazine has not been effectively studied in pregnancy, and it is recommended that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding avoid use of valbenazine. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Valbenazine is known to cause reversible reduction of dopamine release by selectively inhibiting pre-synaptic human vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2). In vitro, valbenazine shows great selectivity for VMAT2 and little to no affinity for VMAT1 or other monoamine receptors. Although the exact cause of tardive dyskinesia is unknown, it is hypothesized that it may result from neuroleptic-induced dopamine hypersensitivity because it is exclusively associated with the use of neuroleptic drugs. By selectively reducing the ability of VMAT2 to load dopamine into synaptic vesicles, the drug reduces overall levels of available dopamine in the synaptic cleft, ideally alleviating the symptoms associated with dopamine hypersensitivity. The importance of valbenazine selectivity inhibiting VMAT2 over other monoamine transporters is that VMAT2 is mainly involved with the transport of dopamine, and to a much lesser extent other monoamines such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine. This selectivity is likely to reduce the likelihood of ""off-target"" adverse effects which may result from the upstream inhibition of these other monoamines. === Pharmacokinetics === Valbenazine is a prodrug which is an ester of [+]-α-dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) with the amino acid L-valine. It is extensively hydrolyzed to the active metabolite DTBZ. Plasma protein binding of valbenazine is over 99%, and that of DTBZ is about 64%. The biological half-life of both valbenazine and DTBZ is 15 to 22 hours. Liver enzymes involved in inactivation are CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and CYP2D6. The drug is excreted, mostly in form of inactive metabolites, via the urine (60%) and the feces (30%). == Society and culture == === Legal status === Valbenazine is produced by Neurocrine Biosciences. Valbenazine is the first medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, in April 2017. === Economics === While Neurocrine Biosciences does not hold a final patent for valbenazine or elagolix, they do hold a patent for the VMAT2 inhibitor [9,10-dimethoxy-3-(2-methylpropyl)-1H,2H,3H,4H,6H,7H,11bH-pyrido-[2,1-a]isoquinolin-2-yl]methanol and related compounds, which includes valbenazine. === Names === The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) is valbenazine.: 114 == Research == Valbenazine is being studied for the treatment of Tourette's syndrome. == References == == Further reading == Patel RS, Mansuri Z, Motiwala F, Saeed H, Jannareddy N, Patel H, et al.

Acebilustat, a leukotriene B4 inhibitor, has potential to reduce inflammation and symptom duration. In a single-center trial spanning Delta and Omicron variants, outpatients were randomized to 100 mg/d of oral acebilustat or placebo for 28 days. Patients reported daily symptoms via electronic query through day 28 with phone follow-up on day 120 and collected nasal swab samples on days 1-10. The primary outcome was sustained symptom resolution to day 28. Secondary 28-day outcomes included time to first symptom resolution, area under the curve (AUC) for longitudinal daily symptom scores, duration of viral shedding through day 10, and symptoms on day 120. Sixty participants were randomized to each study arm. At enrollment, the median duration was 4 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days), and the median number of symptoms was 9 (7-11). Most patients (90%) were vaccinated, with 73% having neutralizing antibodies. A minority of participants (44%; 35% in the acebilustat arm and 53% in placebo) had sustained symptom resolution at day 28 (hazard ratio, 0.6 [95% confidence interval, .34-1.04]; P = .07 favoring placebo). There was no difference in the mean AUC for symptom scores over 28 days (difference in mean AUC, 9.4 [95% confidence interval, -42.1 to 60.9]; P = .72). Acebilustat did not affect viral shedding or symptoms at day 120. Sustained symptoms through day 28 were common in this low-risk population. Despite this, leukotriene B4 antagonism with acebilustat did not shorten symptom duration in outpatients with COVID-19. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT04662060. There is a significant unmet need for safe and effective anti-inflammatory treatment for cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of acebilustat, a leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor, and its effect on inflammation biomarkers in patients with cystic fibrosis. Seventeen patients with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis were enrolled and randomized into groups receiving placebo or doses of 50 mg or 100 mg acebilustat administered orally, once daily for 15 days. Sputum neutrophil counts were reduced by 65% over baseline values in patients treated with 100 mg acebilustat. A modestly significant 58% reduction vs. placebo in sputum elastase was observed with acebilustat treatment. Favorable trends were observed for reduction of serum C-reactive protein and sputum neutrophil DNA in acebilustat-treated patients. No changes in pulmonary function were observed. Acebilustat was safe and well tolerated. The results of this study support further clinical development of acebilustat for treatment of cystic fibrosis. Acebilustat is a new once-daily oral antiinflammatory drug in development for treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) and other diseases. It is an inhibitor of leukotriene A4 hydrolase; therefore, production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in biological fluids provides a direct measure of the pharmacodynamic (PD) response to acebilustat treatment. Here we compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and PD between CF patients and healthy volunteers, and investigate the food effect and CYP3A4 induction in healthy volunteers.

High-fat diet (HFD)-derived fatty acid is associated with the activation of chronic inflammation in T2DM. PF-04620110, which is currently in phase 1 clinical trials as a selective acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1) inhibitor, is a potent anti-diabetic agent that may be important for the regulation of chronic inflammation in T2DM. However, the mechanisms by which PF-04620110 regulates fatty acid-induced chronic inflammation remain unclear. PF-04620110 was used in vitro and in vivo. DGAT1-targeting gRNAs were used for deletion of mouse DGAT1 via CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) system. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was measured by immunoblot or cytokine analysis  Here we show that PF-04620110 suppressed fatty acid-induced nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat-containing receptor (NLR), pyrin-domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in macrophages. In contrast, PF-04620110 did not change the activation of the NLR family, CARD-domain-containing 4 (NLRC4), or the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes. Moreover, PF-04620110 inhibited K⁺ efflux and the NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation, which are required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. PF-04620110 reduced the production of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and blood glucose levels in the plasma of mice fed HFD. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of DGAT1 suppressed fatty acid-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our results suggest that PF-04620110 suppresses fatty acid-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this study, we developed a method for the determination of PF-04620110 (2-{(1r,4r)-4-[4-(4-amino-5-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrimido[5,4-f][1,4]oxazepin-6(5H)-yl)phenyl]cyclohexyl}acetic acid), a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT-1) inhibitor, in rat plasma and validated it using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Rat plasma samples were processed following a protein precipitation method by using acetonitrile and were then injected into an LC-MS/MS system for quantification. PF-04620110 and imipramine (internal standard) were separated using a Hypersil Gold C18 column, with a mixture of acetonitrile and 10 mm ammonium formate (90:10, v/v) as the mobile phase. The ion transitions monitored in positive-ion mode [M + H](+) of multiple-reaction monitoring were m/z 397.0 → 260.2 for PF-04620110 and m/z 280.8 → 86.0 for imipramine. The detector response was specific and linear for PF-04620110 at concentrations within the range 0.05-50 µg/mL and the signal-to-noise ratios for the samples were ≥10. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy of the method matched the acceptance criteria for assay validation. PF-04620110 was stable under various processing and/or handling conditions. PF-04620110 concentrations in the rat plasma samples could be measured up to 24 h after intravenous or oral administration of PF-04620110, suggesting that the assay is useful for pharmacokinetic studies in rats. Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 (DGAT-1) catalyzes the final committed step in the biosynthesis of triglycerides. DGAT-1 knockout mice have been shown to be resistant to diet-induced obesity and have increased insulin sensitivity.

Herein, we report the discovery and characterization of a potent and selective DGAT-1 inhibitor PF-04620110 (3). Compound 3 inhibits DGAT-1 with an IC50 of 19 nM and shows high selectivity versus a broad panel of off-target pharmacologic end points.

1624,"('(z)-thiothixene', 'Thiothixene', 'Cis-thiothixene', 'Tiotixene', 'Navane')",Medical,"Tiotixene, or thiothixene is a typical antipsychotic agent currently sold under the brand name Navane which is predominantly utilised to treat acute and chronic schizophrenia. Beyond its primary indication, it can exhibit a variety of effects common to neuroleptic drugs including anxiolytic, anti-depressive, and anti-aggressive properties. The drug was first synthesized and marketed in 1967 under the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. While the usage of the drug has declined in recent decades, the drug continues to be manufactured and prescribed in the US and Canada. Being a member of the thioxanthene class, it is chemically related to other typical neuroleptic agents such as chlorprothixene, clopenthixol, flupenthixol, and zuclopenthixol. Tiotixene also shares structural similarities with thioproperazine and pipotiazine, which are members of the phenothiazine class. == Medical uses == Tiotixene is a widely used drug for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mania, and behavioural disturbances. The drug regulates behaviour and thoughts, and can also exhibit an anti-depressive effect. The side effect profile is similar to related antipsychotic agents, displaying weight gain, mental distress, and inability to sit still. Other possible symptoms include anticholinergic side effects such as insomnia, blurred vision, and dry mouth. Less frequently encountered side effects are drug-induced movement disorders such as Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. The results of various dose-response studies (10–60 mg) indicate a stimulating effect at lower doses, which diminishes as higher doses are administered. Overall, the efficacy of thiothixene when compared to other antipsychotic drugs was evaluated to be at least as effective regardless of the optimum dosage. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === As common with tricyclic psychotherapeutic agents, tiotixene is rapidly and extensively absorbed. Peak serum concentration of the drug is achieved after 1–3 hours. After absorption, the compound and its metabolites are spread widely throughout the body. The drug's metabolism proceeds rapidly and primarily in the liver. Although N-demethyltiotixene was identified as its major metabolite, the metabolic mechanisms remain elusive. After metabolism, most of the material is excreted through the faeces. === Pharmacodynamics === Tiotixene shares its mechanism with related thioxanthenes which are all fundamentally used to control schizophrenia. Their mechanism of action involves the inhibition of different receptors, including 5-HT (serotonin), dopaminergic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors. Blocking these receptors results in a reduction of synaptic levels of dopamine, serotonin, and other neurotransmitters that are involved with abnormal excitement in the brain during psychoses. This reduction of abnormal neurotransmission activity tends to alleviate the psychotic indications associated with schizophrenia. Tiotixene acts primarily as a highly potent antagonist of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (subnanomolar affinity). It is also an antagonist of the histamine H1, α1-adrenergic, and serotonin 5-HT7 receptors (low nanomolar affinity), as well as of various other receptors to a much lesser extent (lower affinity). It does not have any anticholinergic activity. Antagonism of the D2 receptor is thought to be responsible for the antipsychotic effects of tiotixene. === Toxicology === Thiothixene has demonstrated toxicity in animal studies and isolated human tissue, displaying cytotoxic effects against various cell types. Observed toxic effects included growth inhibition of mouse fibroblasts, inhibition of protein synthesis by human glioma cells, and inhibition of leukocyte DNA synthesis. Other compounds within the thioxanthene class have demonstrated hepatotoxicity in rodent experiments, and although anecdotal reports of thiothixene-induced liver failure exist, scientific data regarding the correlation lacks. The absence of observational or longitudinal human studies on thiothixene in published literature precludes drawing conclusions regarding the significance of toxic effects at therapeutic dosages. == Chemistry == Thiothixene is a tricyclic compound consisting of a thioxanthene core with a (4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propylidene side chain. Several methods for the synthesis of thiothixene are described in literature, which all rely on varying thioxanthone derivatives upon which the (4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propylidene side chain is constructed. Wyatt et al. described the synthesis of thiothixene via four different routes, three of which originated from the previous findings from Muren et al. One method described the synthesis of thiothixene by acetylation of 9-lithio-N,N-dimethylthioxanthene-2-sulfonamide. After acetylation, a condensation reaction, and an amine exchange the intermediate ketone was obtained. This intermediate was then converted into E- and Z-thiothixene through reduction with NaBH4, followed by dehydration using POCl3-pyridine. Another method described by Muren et al. was performed using N,N-dimethylsulfamoyl-Z-thioxanthen-9-one as starting material. The introduction of the piperazinylpropylidene side chain was performed by a Wittig reaction. Following this, the methylation of the piperazinylpropylidene side chain was executed using various alkylating agents, yielding E- and Z-thiothixene. The last method described by Wyatt et al, adapted from the study described by Muren and Bloom, used potassium benzenethiolate and 2-bromo-5-dimethylsulfamoylbenzoic acid as starting material. The resulting acid was treated with copper and PPA to form the thioxanthone intermediate. This ketone intermediate was then treated with the addition of the piperazinylpropylidene side chain and the loss of a water molecule to form Z- and E-Thiothixene. The fourth method originating from D.C Hobbs involved condensing thiophenol with 2-chloro-5-dimethylsulfamoylbenzoic acid in an alkaline DMF solution at 130–140 °C. After a ring closure reaction with polyphosphoric acid at 70 °C, the ketone intermediate (N,N-dimethylsulfamoyl-Z-thioxanthen-9-one) was obtained. A wittig reaction was employed to connect the intermediate with the piperazinylpropylidene side chain, leading to the formation of both Z- and E-thiothixene isomers. == References ==",Navane,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2159273865108844e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016127715934999287)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1625,"('Adenine', 'Vitamin b4', 'Adenin', 'Adeninimine', 'Leuco-4')","Endogenous, Medical","Adenine (, ) (symbol A or Ade) is a purine nucleotide base. It is one of the nucleobases in the nucleic acids, DNA and RNA. The shape of adenine is complementary to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA. In cells adenine, as an independent molecule, is rare. It is almost always covalently bound to become a part of a larger biomolecule. Adenine has a central role in cellular respiration. It is part of adenosine triphosphate which provides the energy that drives and supports most activities in living cells, such as protein synthesis, chemical synthesis, muscle contraction, and nerve impulse propagation. In respiration it also participates as part of the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and Coenzyme A. It is also part of adenosine, adenosine monophosphate, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and S-adenosylmethionine. == Structure == Adenine forms several tautomers, compounds that can be rapidly interconverted and are often considered equivalent. However, in isolated conditions, i.e. in an inert gas matrix and in the gas phase, mainly the 9H-adenine tautomer is found. == Biosynthesis == Purine metabolism involves the formation of adenine and guanine. Both adenine and guanine are derived from the nucleotide inosine monophosphate (IMP), which in turn is synthesized from a pre-existing ribose phosphate through a complex pathway using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. == Manufacturing method == Patented August 20, 1968, the current recognized method of industrial-scale production of adenine is a modified form of the formamide method. This method heats up formamide under 120 degree Celsius conditions within a sealed flask for 5 hours to form adenine. The reaction is heavily increased in quantity by using a phosphorus oxychloride (phosphoryl chloride) or phosphorus pentachloride as an acid catalyst and sunlight or ultraviolet conditions. After the 5 hours have passed and the formamide-phosphorus oxychloride-adenine solution cools down, water is put into the flask containing the formamide and now-formed adenine. The water-formamide-adenine solution is then poured through a filtering column of activated charcoal. The water and formamide molecules, being small molecules, will pass through the charcoal and into the waste flask; the large adenine molecules, however, will attach or ""adsorb"" to the charcoal due to the van der Waals forces that interact between the adenine and the carbon in the charcoal. Because charcoal has a large surface area, it is able to capture the majority of molecules that pass a certain size (greater than water and formamide) through it. To extract the adenine from the charcoal-adsorbed adenine, ammonia gas dissolved in water (aqua ammonia) is poured onto the activated charcoal-adenine structure to liberate the adenine into the ammonia-water solution. The solution containing water, ammonia, and adenine is then left to air dry, with the adenine losing solubility due to the loss of ammonia gas that previously made the solution basic and capable of dissolving adenine, thus causing it to crystallize into a pure white powder that can be stored. == Function == Adenine is one of the two purine nucleobases (the other being guanine) used in forming nucleotides of the nucleic acids. In DNA, adenine binds to thymine via two hydrogen bonds to assist in stabilizing the nucleic acid structures. In RNA, which is used for protein synthesis, adenine binds to uracil. Adenine forms adenosine, a nucleoside, when attached to ribose, and deoxyadenosine when attached to deoxyribose. It forms adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a nucleoside triphosphate, when three phosphate groups are added to adenosine. Adenosine triphosphate is used in cellular metabolism as one of the basic methods of transferring chemical energy between chemical reactions. ATP is thus a derivative of adenine, adenosine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and adenosine diphosphate. == History == In older literature, adenine was sometimes called Vitamin B4. Due to it being synthesized by the body and not essential to be obtained by diet, it does not meet the definition of vitamin and is no longer part of the Vitamin B complex. However, two B vitamins, niacin and riboflavin, bind with adenine to form the essential cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), respectively. Hermann Emil Fischer was one of the early scientists to study adenine. It was named in 1885 by Albrecht Kossel after Greek ἀδήν aden ""gland"", in reference to the pancreas, from which Kossel's sample had been extracted. Experiments performed in 1961 by Joan Oró have shown that a large quantity of adenine can be synthesized from the polymerization of ammonia with five hydrogen cyanide (HCN) molecules in aqueous solution; whether this has implications for the origin of life on Earth is under debate. On August 8, 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting building blocks of DNA and RNA (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) may have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space. In 2011, physicists reported that adenine has an ""unexpectedly variable range of ionization energies along its reaction pathways"" which suggested that ""understanding experimental data on how adenine survives exposure to UV light is much more complicated than previously thought""; these findings have implications for spectroscopic measurements of heterocyclic compounds, according to one report. == References == == External links == Vitamin B4 MS Spectrum",Leuco-4,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.003091081976890564), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00015872348740231246), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL', [('EN', -0.7511162757873535), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.625213477993384e-05), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.10061349719762802), ('ĠINDU', -0.5425021648406982), ('ST', -1.6689160474925302e-05), ('RI', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('AL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12753213942050934)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Leuco-sulphur-brown-4,https://drugs-about.com/drugs-l/leuco-4.html,https://drugs-about.com/drugs-l/leuco-4-injections.html,https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/L/Leuco-4.html,https://www.sfatulmedicului.ro/medicamente/leuco-4-comprimate_13203,https://herbovedam.com/products/leuco,https://www.chemimpex.com/products/38620,https://drugs-about.com/drugs-l/leuco.html,https://patents.justia.com/patent/20190177546,https://www.tcichemicals.com/US/en/p/M0344,https://patents.justia.com/patent/20190112560 ', [])"

1627,"('Leuprolide (acetate)', 'Leuprorelin (acetate)', 'Leuprorelin', 'Leuprolide', 'Eligard')",Medical,"Leuprorelin, also known as leuprolide, is a manufactured version of a hormone used to treat prostate cancer, breast cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, for early puberty, or as part of transgender hormone therapy. It is given by injection into a muscle or under the skin. Leuprorelin is in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue family of medications. It works by decreasing gonadotropins and therefore decreasing testosterone and estradiol. Common side effects include hot flashes, unstable mood, trouble sleeping, headaches, and pain at the site of injection. Other side effects may include high blood sugar, allergic reactions, and problems with the pituitary gland. Use during pregnancy may harm foetal development. Leuprorelin was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1985. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is sold under the brand name Lupron among others. == Medical uses == Leuprorelin may be used in the treatment of hormone-responsive cancers such as prostate cancer and breast cancer. It may also be used for estrogen-dependent conditions such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids. It may be used for precocious puberty in both males and females, and to prevent premature ovulation in cycles of controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). This use is controversial since the Lupron label advises against using the drug when one is considering pregnancy, due to a risk of birth defects. It may be used to reduce the risk of premature ovarian failure in women receiving cyclophosphamide for chemotherapy. Along with triptorelin and goserelin, it has been used to delay puberty in transgender youth until they are old enough to begin hormone replacement therapy. Researchers have recommended puberty blockers after age 12, when the person has developed to Tanner stages 2–3, and then cross-sex hormones treatment at age 16. This use of the drug is off-label, however, not having been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and without data on long-term effects of this use. They are also sometimes used as alternatives to antiandrogens like spironolactone and cyproterone acetate for suppressing testosterone production in transgender women. It also is used for suppressing estrogen production in transgender men. It is considered a possible treatment for paraphilias. Leuprorelin has been tested as a treatment for reducing sexual urges in pedophiles and other cases of paraphilia. == Side effects == Common side effects of leuprorelin injection include redness/burning/stinging/pain/bruising at the injection site, hot flashes (flushing), increased sweating, night sweats, tiredness, headache, upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, impotence, testicular shrinkage, constipation, stomach pain, breast swelling or tenderness, acne, joint/muscle aches or pain, trouble sleeping (insomnia), reduced sexual interest, vaginal discomfort/dryness/itching/discharge, vaginal bleeding, swelling of the ankles/feet, increased urination at night, dizziness, breakthrough bleeding in a female child during the first two months of leuprorelin treatment, weakness, chills, clammy skin, skin redness, itching, or scaling, testicle pain, impotence, depression, or memory problems. The rates of gynecomastia with leuprorelin have been found to range from 3 to 16%. A cohort of women that were prescribed leuprorelin to delay precocious puberty as children has developed osteoporosis and brittle teeth at an unexpected rate; However, the FDA has not established that these conditions were caused by leuprorelin. === Lupron ""flare"" === During the initial phase of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy in individuals assigned male at birth, there is a notable phenomenon known as the ""flare."" This occurs when testosterone levels temporarily surge by approximately 50% within the first 1 to 2 weeks of therapy. This increase is a response to the initial stimulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the LHRH agonist, leading to a rise in testosterone levels before they begin to decrease as intended. For individuals receiving LHRH agonists as part of gender-affirming care, this temporary increase in testosterone can be particularly distressing, exacerbating gender dysphoria and discomfort. To manage and mitigate these effects, healthcare providers often prescribe antiandrogens during this phase to help block the unwanted increase in testosterone and alleviate the associated distress. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Leuprorelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue acting as an agonist at pituitary GnRH receptors. GnRH receptor agonists initially increase the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary and increased serum estradiol and testosterone levels via the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis). However, normal functioning of this axis requires pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus. Continuous exposure to an agonist such as leuprorelin for several weeks causes pituitary GnRH receptors to become desensitised and no longer responsive. This desensitisation is the objective of leuprorelin therapy because it ultimately reduces LH and FSH secretion, leading to hypogonadism and a dramatic reduction in estradiol and testosterone levels regardless of sex. === Available forms === Leuprorelin is available in the following forms, among others: Short-acting daily intramuscular injection (Lupron) Long-acting depot intramuscular injection (Lupron Depot) Long-acting depot subcutaneous injection (Eligard) Long-acting subcutaneous injection (Fensolvi) Long-acting subcutaneous implant (Viadur) Long-acting leuprolide mesylate (Camcevi) for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Leuprolide acetate and norethindrone acetate co-packaged pack (Lupaneta Pack) == Chemistry == The peptide sequence is Pyr-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Leu-Leu-Arg-Pro-NHEt (Pyr = L-pyroglutamyl). == History == Leuprorelin was discovered and first patented in 1973 and was introduced for medical use in 1985. It was initially marketed only for daily injection, but a depot injection formulation was introduced in 1989. === Approvals === Lupron injection was approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced prostate cancer on 9 April 1985. Lupron depot for monthly intramuscular injection was approved by the FDA for palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer on 26 January 1989. Viadur was approved by the FDA for palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer on 6 March 2000. Eligard was approved by the FDA for palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer on 24 January 2002. Fensolvi was approved by the FDA for children with central precocious puberty on 4 May 2020. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 24 March 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Camcevi, intended for the treatment of the cancer of the prostate in adult men when the cancer is ""hormone-dependent"", which means that it responds to treatments that reduce the levels of the hormone testosterone. The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare S.L.U. Leuprorelin was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2022. === Names === Leuprorelin is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while leuprorelin acetate is its BANMTooltip British Approved Name and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, leuprolide acetate is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, leuprorelina is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, and leuproréline is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. It is also known by its developmental code names A-43818, Abbott-43818, DC-2-269, and TAP-144. Leuprorelin is marketed by Bayer AG under the brand name Viadur, by Tolmar under the brand names Eligard and Fensolvi, and by TAP Pharmaceuticals (1985–2008), by Varian Pharmed( Previously named Varian Darou Pajooh) under the brand name Leupromer and Abbott Laboratories (2008–present) under the brand name Lupron. === Legal history === In October 2001, the US Department of Justice, states attorneys general, and TAP Pharmaceutical Products, a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, settled criminal and civil charges against TAP related to federal and state medicare fraud and illegal marketing of the drug leuprorelin. TAP paid a total of $875 million, which was a record high at the time. The $875 million settlement broke down to $290 million for violating the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, $559.5 million to settle federal fraud charges for overcharging Medicare, and $25.5 million reimbursement to 50 states and Washington, D.C., for filing false claims with the states' Medicaid programs. The case arose under the False Claims Act with claims filed by Douglas Durand, a former TAP vice president of sales, and Joseph Gerstein, a doctor at Tufts University's HMO practice. Durand, Gerstein, and Tufts shared $95 million of the settlement. There have since been various suits concerning leuprorelin use, none successful. They either concern the oversubscription of the drug or undue warning about the side effects. Between 2010 and 2013, the FDA updated the Lupron drug label to include new safety information on the risk of thromboembolism, loss of bone density and convulsions. The FDA then asserted that the benefits of leuprorelin outweigh its risks when used according to its approved labeling. Since 2017, the FDA has been evaluating leuprorelin's connection to pain and discomfort in musculoskeletal and connective tissue. == Research == As of 2006, leuprorelin was under investigation for possible use in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. A by mouth formulation of leuprorelin is under development for the treatment of endometriosis. It was also under development for the treatment of precocious puberty, prostate cancer, and uterine fibroids, but development for these uses was discontinued. The formulation has the tentative brand name Ovarest. As of July 2018, it is in phase II clinical trials for endometriosis. == Veterinary use == Leuprorelin is frequently used in ferrets for the treatment of adrenal disease. Its use has been reported in a ferret with concurrent primary hyperaldosteronism, and one with concurrent diabetes mellitus. It is also used to treat pet parrots with chronic egg laying behavior. == References == == Further reading ==",Eligard,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.4927710657939315e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024958669673651457)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([eligard.com](https://eligard.com/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=64, start_index=9, title='ELIGARD for the management of advanced prostate cancer', type='url_citation', url='https://eligard.com/?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a peptide analog that has been shown to increase gap junction intercellular conductance in cardiac muscle cells. Gap junctions are protein channels that are responsible for conducting electrical impulses between cells in the heart to maintain normal rhythm. Gap junction modulation is a promising and novel mechanism of action for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. Its peptide sequence is Ac-D-Tyr-D-Pro-D-Hyp-Gly-D-Ala-Gly-NH2. == Indications == Rotigaptide is being studied for its antiarrhythmic effects, specifically for treating atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm. The irregular rhythm, results from abnormal electrical impulses in the heart. The irregularity can be continuous or intermittent. In atrial fibrillation, multiple impulses travel through the atria at the same time. Instead of a coordinated contraction, the atrial contractions are irregular, disorganized and very rapid. These irregular impulses reach the AV node in rapid succession, but not all of them make it past the AV node. Therefore, the ventricles beat slower in an irregular rhythm. The resulting rapid, irregular heartbeat causes an irregular pulse and sometimes a sensation of fluttering in the chest. == Mechanism of action == The exact mechanism of action of rotigaptide is not completely understood. However, rotigaptide is believed to exert its effects on cardiomyocyte gap junctions through phosphorylation events. Each gap junction is composed of a series of connexons close to each other. Each connexon is made up of 6 functional units (connexins) that associate together to form a channel between adjacent cells. Rotigaptide acts at connexins, preferentially to connexin 43 (Cx43). Treatment with rotigaptide has been shown to activate various protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms to cause the phosphorylation of Cx43, which aids in proper function of the connexon. This allows for a smoother conduction to pass through the myocytes to propagate a synchronous contraction. This has been shown to reduce the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. == Limitations == A potential limitation for this drug is that animals being used for studies are most commonly anesthetized with isoflurane, which has been shown to be a partial gap junction uncoupler and thus would negate the effects of rotigaptide. However, this effect can be only minor, as one study showed that a low dose of isoflurane was kept continuous over the progression of the study, indicating that the dose was not high enough to uncouple rotigaptide. Therefore, it may be unlikely that isoflurane plays a role in the results presented. == References ==",Rotigaptide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.435795901576057e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001213171985000372)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotigaptide,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17845503/,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB13067 ', [])"
1629,"('Sofalcone', 'Solon', 'Sofalcona', 'Sofalconum', 'Sofalcone [inn:jan]')",Medical,"Solon (; Ancient Greek: Σόλων; c. 630 – c. 560 BC) was an archaic Athenian statesman, lawmaker, political philosopher, and poet. He is one of the Seven Sages of Greece and credited with laying the foundations for Athenian democracy. Solon's efforts to legislate against political, economic and moral decline resulted in his constitutional reform overturning most of Draco's laws. Solon's reforms included debt relief later known and celebrated among Athenians as the seisachtheia (shaking off of burdens). He is described by Aristotle in the Athenian Constitution as ""the first people's champion"". Demosthenes credited Solon's reforms with starting a golden age. Modern knowledge of Solon is limited by the fact that his works only survive in fragments and appear to feature interpolations by later authors. It is further limited by the general paucity of documentary and archaeological evidence covering Athens in the early 6th century BC. Ancient authors such as Philo of Alexandria, Herodotus, and Plutarch are the main sources, but wrote about Solon long after his death. Fourth-century BC orators, such as Aeschines, tended to attribute to Solon all the laws of their own, much later times. == Biography == === Early life and ancestry === Solon was born in Athens around 630 BC. His family was distinguished in Attica as they belonged to a noble or Eupatrid clan. Solon's father was probably Execestides. If so, his lineage could be traced back to Codrus, the last King of Athens. According to Diogenes Laërtius, he had a brother named Dropides, who was an ancestor (six generations removed) of Plato. According to Plutarch, Solon was related to the tyrant Pisistratus, for their mothers were cousins. Solon was eventually drawn into the unaristocratic pursuit of commerce. === Defeat of Megara === When Athens and its neighbor and rival in the Saronic Gulf, Megara, were contesting the possession of Salamis, Solon was made leader of the Athenian forces. After repeated disasters, Solon was able to improve the morale of his troops through a nationalist poem he wrote about the island. Supported by Pisistratus, he defeated the Megarians either by means of a cunning trick or more directly through heroic battle around 595 BC. The Megarians, however, refused to give up their claim. The dispute was referred to the Spartans, who eventually awarded possession of the island to Athens on the strength of the case that Solon put to them. Plutarch professes admiration of Solon's elegy. The same poem was said by Diogenes Laërtius to have stirred Athenians more than any other verses that Solon wrote: One fragment describes assorted breads and cakes: They drink and some nibble honey and sesame cakes (itria), others their bread, other gouroi mixed with lentils. In that place, not one cake was unavailable of all those that the black earth bears for human beings, and all were present unstintingly. === Archonship === According to Diogenes Laertius, in 594 BC, Solon was chosen archon, or chief magistrate. Solon repealed all of Draco's laws except those relating to homicide. During Solon's time, many Greek city-states had seen the emergence of tyrants, opportunistic noblemen who had taken power on behalf of sectional interests. Solon was described by Plutarch as having been temporarily awarded autocratic powers by Athenian citizens on the grounds that he had the wisdom to sort out their differences for them in a peaceful and equitable manner. Some modern scholars believe these powers were in fact granted some years after Solon had been archon, when he would have been a member of the Areopagus and probably a more respected statesman by his peers. As archon, Solon discussed his intended reforms with some friends. Knowing that he was about to cancel all debts, these friends took out loans and promptly bought some land. Suspected of complicity, Solon complied with his own law and released his own debtors, amounting to five talents (or 15 according to some sources). His friends never repaid their debts. === Travels === After completing his work of reform, Solon surrendered his extraordinary authority and traveled abroad for ten years, so that the Athenians could not induce him to repeal any of his laws. Within four years of Solon's departure, the old social rifts re-appeared, but with some new complications. There were irregularities in the new governmental procedures, elected officials sometimes refused to stand down from their posts and occasionally important posts were left vacant. It has even been said that some people blamed Solon for their troubles. Eventually one of Solon's relatives, Pisistratus, ended the factionalism by force, thus instituting an unconstitutionally gained tyranny. In Plutarch's account, Solon accused Athenians of stupidity and cowardice for allowing this to happen. Solon's first stop in his travels was Egypt. There, according to Herodotus, he visited the Pharaoh of Egypt, Amasis II. According to Plutarch, he spent some time and discussed philosophy with two Egyptian priests, Psenophis of Heliopolis and Sonchis of Sais. A character in two of Plato's dialogues, Timaeus and Critias, claims Solon visited Neith's temple at Sais and received from the priests there an account of the history of Atlantis. Next, Solon sailed to Cyprus, where he oversaw the construction of a new capital for a local king, in gratitude for which the king named it Soloi. Solon's travels finally brought him to Sardis, capital of Lydia. According to Herodotus and Plutarch, he met with Croesus and gave the Lydian king advice, which Croesus failed to appreciate until it was too late. Croesus had considered himself to be the happiest man alive and Solon had advised him, ""Count no man happy until he be dead."" The reasoning was that at any minute, fortune might turn on even the happiest man and make his life miserable. It was only after he had lost his kingdom to the Persian king Cyrus, while awaiting execution, that Croesus acknowledged the wisdom of Solon's advice. === Death and legacy === After his return to Athens, Solon became a staunch opponent of Pisistratus. In protest, and as an example to others, Solon stood outside his own home in full armour, urging all who passed to resist the machinations of the would-be tyrant. His efforts were in vain. Solon died shortly after Pisistratus usurped by force the autocratic power that Athens had once freely bestowed upon him. Solon died in Cyprus around the age of 70 and, in accordance with his will, his ashes were scattered around Salamis, the island where he was born. Pausanias listed Solon among the Seven Sages, whose aphorisms adorned Apollo's temple in Delphi. Stobaeus in the Florilegium relates a story about a symposium where Solon's young nephew was singing a poem of Sappho's: Solon, upon hearing the song, asked the boy to teach him to sing it. When someone asked, ""Why should you waste your time on it?"", Solon replied, ""ἵνα μαθὼν αὐτὸ ἀποθάνω"", ""So that I may learn it before I die."" Ammianus Marcellinus, however, told a similar story about Socrates and the poet Stesichorus, quoting the philosopher's rapture in almost identical terms: ut aliquid sciens amplius e vita discedam, meaning ""in order to leave life knowing a little more"". == Historical rivalries == The social and political upheavals that characterized Athens in Solon's time have been variously interpreted by historians from ancient times to the present day. The historical account of Solon's Athens has evolved over many centuries into a set of contradictory stories or a complex story that might be interpreted in a variety of ways. As further evidence accumulates, and as historians continue to debate the issues, Solon's motivations and the intentions behind his reforms will continue to attract speculation. Two contemporary historians have identified three distinct historical accounts of Solon's Athens, emphasizing quite different rivalries: economic and/or ideological rivalry, regional rivalry, and rivalry between aristocratic clans. These different accounts provide a convenient basis for an overview of the issues involved. === Economic and ideological === Economic and ideological rivalry is a common theme in ancient sources. This sort of account emerges from Solon's poems, in which he casts himself in the role of a noble mediator between two intemperate and unruly factions. This same account is substantially taken up about three centuries later by the author of the Aristotelian Athenaion Politeia but with an interesting variation: ... there was conflict between the nobles and the common people for an extended period. For the constitution they were under was oligarchic in every respect and especially in that the poor, along with their wives and children, were in slavery to the rich...All the land was in the hands of a few. And if men did not pay their rents, they themselves and their children were liable to be seized as slaves. The security for all loans was the debtor's prison up to the time of Solon. He was the first people's champion. Here Solon is presented as a partisan in a democratic cause whereas, judged from the viewpoint of his own poems, he was instead a mediator between rival factions. A still more significant variation in the ancient historical account appears in the writing of Plutarch in the late 1st – early 2nd century AD: Athens was torn by recurrent conflict about the constitution. The city was divided into as many parties as there were geographical divisions in its territory. For the party of the people of the hills was most in favour of democracy, that of the people of the plain was most in favour of oligarchy, while the third group, the people of the coast, which preferred a mixed form of constitution somewhat between the other two, formed an obstruction and prevented the other groups from gaining control. === Regional === Regional rivalry is a theme commonly found among modern scholars. ""The new picture which emerged was one of strife between regional groups, united by local loyalties and led by wealthy landowners. Their goal was to take control of the central government at Athens and with it dominate over their rivals from other districts of Attica.""Regional factionalism was inevitable in a relatively large territory such as Athens possessed. In most Greek city states, a farmer could conveniently reside in a town and travel to and from his fields every day. According to Thucydides, on the other hand, most Athenians continued to live in rural settlements right up until the Peloponnesian War. The effects of regionalism in a large territory could be seen in Laconia, where Sparta had gained control through intimidation and resettlement of some of its neighbours and enslavement of the rest. Attika in Solon's time seemed to be moving towards a similarly ugly solution with many citizens in danger of being reduced to the status of helots. === Clan === Rivalry between clans is a theme recently developed by some scholars, based on an appreciation of the political significance of kinship groupings. According to this account, bonds of kinship rather than local loyalties were the decisive influence on events in archaic Athens. An Athenian belonged not only to a phyle or tribe and one of its subdivisions, the phratry or brotherhood, but also to an extended family, clan or genos. It has been argued that these interconnecting units of kinship reinforced a hierarchic structure with aristocratic clans at the top. Thus rivalries between aristocratic clans could engage all levels of society irrespective of any regional ties. In that case, the struggle between rich and poor was the struggle between powerful aristocrats and the weaker affiliates of their rivals or perhaps even with their own rebellious affiliates. == Solon's reforms == Solon's laws were inscribed on axones, large wooden slabs or cylinders attached to a series of axles that stood upright in the Prytaneion. Originally the axones recorded laws enacted by Draco in the late 7th century (traditionally 621 BC). Nothing of Draco's codification has survived except for a law relating to homicide, yet there is consensus among scholars that it did not amount to anything like a constitution. During his visit to Athens, Pausanias, the 2nd century AD geographer reported that the inscribed laws of Solon were still displayed by the Prytaneion. Fragments of the axones were still visible in Plutarch's time but today the only records we have of Solon's laws are fragmentary quotes and comments in literary sources such as those written by Plutarch himself. Moreover, the language of his laws was archaic even by the standards of the fifth century and this caused interpretation problems for ancient commentators. Modern scholars doubt the reliability of these sources and our knowledge of Solon's legislation is therefore actually very limited in its details. Generally, Solon's reforms appear to have been constitutional, economic, moral, and sexual in their scope. This distinction, though somewhat artificial, does at least provide a convenient framework within which to consider the laws that have been attributed to Solon. Some short-term consequences of his reforms are considered at the end of the section. === Constitutional === Depending on how we interpret the historical facts known to us, Solon's constitutional reforms were either a radical anticipation of democratic government, or they merely provided a plutocratic flavour to a stubbornly aristocratic regime, or else the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. Before Solon's reforms, the Athenian state was administered by nine archons appointed or elected annually by the Areopagus on the basis of noble birth and wealth. There was an assembly of Athenian citizens (the Ekklesia) but the lowest class (the Thetes) was not admitted and its deliberative procedures were controlled by the nobles. There therefore seemed to be no means by which an archon could be called to account for breach of oath unless the Areopagus favoured his prosecution. According to the Athenian Constitution, Solon legislated for all citizens to be admitted into the Ekklesia and for a court (the Heliaia) to be formed from all the citizens. The Heliaia appears to have been the Ekklesia, or some representative portion of it, sitting as a jury. By giving common people the power not only to elect officials but also to call them to account, Solon appears to have established the foundations of a true republic. ==== Classes ==== There is consensus among scholars that Solon lowered the requirements – those that existed in terms of financial and social qualifications – which applied to election to public office. The Solonian constitution divided citizens into four political classes defined according to assessable property a classification that might previously have served the state for military or taxation purposes only. The standard unit for this assessment was one medimnos (approximately 12 gallons) of cereals and yet the kind of classification set out below might be considered too simplistic to be historically accurate. Pentakosiomedimnoi valued at 500 medimnoi or more of cereals annually. eligible to serve as strategoi (generals or military governors) Hippeis valued at 300 medimnoi or more annually. approximating to the medieval class of knights, they had enough wealth to equip themselves for the cavalry Zeugitai valued at 200 medimnoi or more annually. approximating to the medieval class of yeoman, they had enough wealth to equip themselves for the infantry (hoplite) Thetes valued up to 199 medimnoi annually or less manual workers or sharecroppers, they served voluntarily in the role of personal servant, or as auxiliaries armed for instance with the sling or as rowers in the navy. According to the Athenian Constitution, only the pentakosiomedimnoi were eligible for election to high office as archons and therefore only they gained admission into the Areopagus. A modern view affords the same privilege to the hippeis. The top three classes were eligible for a variety of lesser posts and only the thetes were excluded from all public office. === Economic === The real motives behind Solon's economic reforms are as questionable as his real motives for constitutional reform. Were the poor being forced to serve the needs of a changing economy, was the economy being reformed to serve the needs of the poor, or were Solon's policies the manifestation of a struggle taking place between poorer citizens and the aristocrats? Solon's economic reforms need to be understood in the context of the primitive, subsistence economy that prevailed both before and after his time. Most Athenians were still living in rural settlements right up to the Peloponnesian War. Opportunities for trade even within the Athenian borders were limited. The typical farming family, even in classical times, barely produced enough to satisfy its own needs. Opportunities for international trade were minimal. It has been estimated that, even in Roman times, goods rose 40% in value for every 100 miles they were carried over land, but only 1.3% for the same distance were they carried by ship and yet there is no evidence that Athens possessed any merchant ships until around 525 BC. Until then, the narrow warship doubled as a cargo vessel. Athens, like other Greek city states in the 7th century BC, was faced with increasing population pressures and by about 525 BC it was able to feed itself only in good years. Solon's reforms can thus be seen to have taken place at a crucial period of economic transition, when a subsistence rural economy increasingly required the support of a nascent commercial sector. The specific economic reforms credited to Solon are these: Fathers were encouraged to find trades for their sons; if they did not, there would be no legal requirement for sons to maintain their fathers in old age. Foreign tradesmen were encouraged to settle in Athens; those who did would be granted citizenship, provided they brought their families with them. Cultivation of olives was encouraged; the export of all other fruits was prohibited. Competitiveness of Athenian commerce was promoted through revision of weights and measures, possibly based on successful standards already in use elsewhere, such as Aegina or Euboia or, according to the ancient account but unsupported by modern scholarship, Argos. ==== Coinage ==== It is generally assumed, on the authority of ancient commentators, that Solon also reformed the Athenian coinage. However, recent numismatic studies now lead to the conclusion that Athens probably had no coinage until around 560 BC, well after Solon's reforms. Nevertheless, there are now reasons to suggest that monetization had already begun before Solon's reforms. By the early sixth century the Athenians were using silver in the form of a variety of bullion silver pieces for monetary payments. Drachma and obol as a term of bullion value had already been adopted, although the corresponding standard weights were probably unstable. ==== Foreign trade ==== Solon's economic reforms succeeded in stimulating foreign trade. Athenian black-figure pottery was exported in increasing quantities and good quality throughout the Aegean between 600 BC and 560 BC, a success story that coincided with a decline in trade in Corinthian pottery. The ban on the export of grain might be understood as a relief measure for the benefit of the poor. However, the encouragement of olive production for export could actually have led to increased hardship for many Athenians to the extent that it led to a reduction in the amount of land dedicated to grain. Moreover, an olive tree produces no fruit for the first six years (but farmers' difficulty of lasting until payback may also give rise to a mercantilist argument in favour of supporting them through that, since the British case illustrates that ""One domestic policy that had a lasting impact was the conversion of 'waste lands' to agricultural use. Mercantilists felt that to maximize a nation's power all land and resources had to be used to their utmost""). === Moral === In his poems, Solon portrays Athens as being under threat from the unrestrained greed and arrogance of its citizens. Even the earth (Gaia), the mighty mother of the gods, had been enslaved. The visible symbol of this perversion of the natural and social order was a boundary marker called a horos, a wooden or stone pillar indicating that a farmer was in debt or under contractual obligation to someone else, either a noble patron or a creditor. ==== Seisachtheia ==== Up until Solon's time, land was the inalienable property of a family or clan and it could not be sold or mortgaged. This was no disadvantage to a clan with large landholdings since it could always rent out farms in a sharecropping system. A family struggling on a small farm however could not use the farm as security for a loan even if it owned the farm. Instead the farmer would have to offer himself and his family as security, providing some form of slave labour in lieu of repayment. Equally, a family might voluntarily pledge part of its farm income or labour to a powerful clan in return for its protection. Farmers subject to these sorts of arrangements were loosely known as hektemoroi indicating that they either paid or kept a sixth of a farm's annual yield. In the event of 'bankruptcy', or failure to honour the contract stipulated by the horoi, farmers and their families could in fact be sold into slavery. Solon's reform of these injustices was later known and celebrated among Athenians as the seisachtheia (shaking off of burdens). As with all his reforms, there is considerable scholarly debate about its real significance. Many scholars are content to accept the account given by the ancient sources, interpreting it as a cancellation of debts, while others interpret it as the abolition of a type of feudal relationship, and some prefer to explore new possibilities for interpretation. The reforms included: annulment of all contracts symbolised by the horoi. prohibition on a debtor's person being used as security for a loan, i.e., debt slavery. release of all Athenians who had been enslaved. The removal of the horoi clearly provided immediate economic relief for the most oppressed group in Attica, and it also brought an immediate end to the enslavement of Athenians by their countrymen. Some Athenians had already been sold into slavery abroad and some had fled abroad to escape enslavement – Solon proudly records in verse the return of this diaspora. It has been cynically observed, however, that few of these unfortunates were likely to have been recovered. It has been observed also that the seisachtheia not only removed slavery and accumulated debt but may also have removed the ordinary farmer's only means of obtaining further credit. The seisachtheia however was merely one set of reforms within a broader agenda of moral reformation. Other reforms included: the abolition of extravagant dowries. legislation against abuses within the system of inheritance, specifically with relation to the epikleros (i.e. a female who had no brothers to inherit her father's property and who was traditionally required to marry her nearest paternal relative in order to produce an heir to her father's estate). entitlement of any citizen to take legal action on behalf of another. the disenfranchisement of any citizen who might refuse to take up arms in times of civil strife, and war, a measure that was intended to counteract dangerous levels of political apathy. Demosthenes claimed that the city's subsequent golden age included ""personal modesty and frugality"" among the Athenian aristocracy. === Sexual === As a regulator of Athenian society, Solon, according to some authors, also formalized its sexual mores. According to a surviving fragment from a work (""Brothers"") by the comic playwright Philemon, Solon established publicly funded brothels at Athens in order to ""democratize"" the availability of sexual pleasure. While the veracity of this comic account is open to doubt, at least one modern author considers it significant that in Classical Athens, three hundred or so years after the death of Solon, there existed a discourse that associated his reforms with an increased availability of heterosexual contacts. Ancient authors also say that Solon regulated pederastic relationships in Athens; this has been presented as an adaptation of custom to the new structure of the polis. According to various authors, ancient lawgivers (and therefore Solon by implication) drew up a set of laws that were intended to promote and safeguard the institution of pederasty and to control abuses against freeborn boys. In particular, the orator Aeschines cites laws excluding slaves from wrestling halls and forbidding them to enter pederastic relationships with the sons of citizens. Accounts of Solon's laws by 4th century orators like Aeschines, however, are considered unreliable for a number of reasons; Attic pleaders did not hesitate to attribute to him (Solon) any law which suited their case, and later writers had no criterion by which to distinguish earlier from later works. Nor can any complete and authentic collection of his statutes have survived for ancient scholars to consult. Besides the alleged legislative aspect of Solon's involvement with pederasty, there were also suggestions of personal involvement. Ancient readers concluded, based on his own erotic poetry, that Solon himself had a preference for boys. According to some ancient authors Solon had taken the future tyrant Pisistratus as his eromenos. Aristotle, writing around 330 BC, attempted to refute that belief, claiming that ""those are manifestly talking nonsense who pretend that Solon was the lover of Pisistratus, for their ages do not admit of it"", as Solon was about thirty years older than Pisistratus. Nevertheless, the tradition persisted. Four centuries later Plutarch ignored Aristotle's skepticism and recorded the following anecdote, supplemented with his own conjectures: And they say Solon loved [Pisistratus]; and that is the reason, I suppose, that when afterwards they differed about the government, their enmity never produced any hot and violent passion, they remembered their old kindnesses, and retained ""Still in its embers living the strong fire"" of their love and dear affection. A century after Plutarch, Aelian also said that Pisistratus had been Solon's eromenos. Despite its persistence, however, it is not known whether the account is historical or fabricated. It has been suggested that the tradition presenting a peaceful and happy coexistence between Solon and Pisistratus was cultivated during the latter's dominion, in order to legitimize his own rule, as well as that of his sons. Whatever its source, later generations lent credence to the narrative. Solon's presumed pederastic desire was thought in antiquity to have found expression also in his poetry, which is today represented only in a few surviving fragments. The authenticity of all the poetic fragments attributed to Solon is however uncertain – in particular, pederastic aphorisms ascribed by some ancient sources to Solon have been ascribed by other sources to Theognis instead. == Poems == It is recorded that Solon wrote poetry for pleasure, as patriotic propaganda, and in defence of his constitutional reform. Solon's verses have come down to us in fragmentary quotations by ancient authors such as Plutarch and Demosthenes, who used them to illustrate their own arguments. It is possible that some fragments have been wrongly attributed to him and some scholars have detected interpolations by later authors. He was also the first citizen of Athens to reference the goddess Athena (fr. 4.1–4). The literary merit of Solon's verse is generally considered unexceptional. Solon's poetry can be said to appear 'self-righteous' and 'pompous' at times and he once composed an elegy with moral advice for a more gifted elegiac poet, Mimnermus. Most of the extant verses show him writing in the role of a political activist determined to assert personal authority and leadership. They have been described by the German classicist Wilamowitz as a ""versified harangue"" (Eine Volksrede in Versen). According to Plutarch, however, Solon originally wrote poetry for amusement, discussing pleasure in a popular rather than philosophical way. Solon's elegiac style is said to have been influenced by the example of Tyrtaeus. He also wrote iambic and trochaic verses, which, according to one modern scholar, are livelier and more direct than his elegies and possibly paved the way for the iambics of Athenian drama. Solon's verses are mainly significant for historical rather than aesthetic reasons, as a personal record of his reforms and attitudes. However, poetry is not an ideal genre for communicating facts and very little detailed information can be derived from the surviving fragments. According to Solon the poet, Solon the reformer was a voice for political moderation in Athens at a time when his fellow citizens were increasingly polarized by social and economic differences: Here translated by the English poet John Dryden, Solon's words define a 'moral high ground' where differences between rich and poor can be reconciled or maybe just ignored. His poetry indicates that he attempted to use his extraordinary legislative powers to establish a peaceful settlement between the country's rival factions: His attempts evidently were misunderstood: == See also == Adultery in Classical Athens Solonia, a genus of flowering plants named after Solon == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == A.

This includes ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma. Latanaprost is applied as eye drops to the eyes. Onset of effects is usually within four hours, and they last for up to a day. Common side effects include blurry vision, redness of the eye, itchiness, and darkening of the iris. Latanoprost is in the prostaglandin analogue family of medications. It works by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes through the uveoscleral tract. Latanoprost was approved for medical use in the United States and the European Union in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Latanoprost is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 67th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. It is available as a fixed-dose combination with netarsudil as netarsudil/latanoprost and with timolol as latanoprost/timolol. == Medical uses == In the United States, latanoprost is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in people with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. === Open-angle glaucoma === In people with ocular hypertension (IOP ≥21 mm Hg) including open-angle glaucoma, treatment with latanoprost reduced IOP levels by 22 to 39% over 1 to 12 months’ treatment. Latanoprost is more effective than timolol 0.5% twice daily in 3 of 4 large (n = 163 to 267) randomised, double-blind trials. Latanoprost demonstrated a stable long-term IOP-lowering effect in 1- or 2-year continuations of these trials, with no sign of diminishing effect during prolonged treatment. Meta-analysis suggests that latanoprost is more effective than timolol in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP). However, it often causes iris pigmentation. While current evidence suggests that this pigmentation is benign, careful lifetime evaluation of patients is still justified. === Closed-angle glaucoma === People who had elevated IOP despite iridotomy and/or iridectomy (including people of Asian descent), latanoprost was significantly more effective than timolol in two double-blind, monotherapy trials (8.2 and 8.8 mm Hg vs 5.2 and 5.7 mm Hg for latanoprost vs timolol at 12 and 2 weeks, respectively). == Adverse effects == Listed from most to least common: > 5–15%: blurred vision, burning and stinging, conjunctival hyperemia, foreign body sensation, itching, increased (brown) pigmentation of the iris (causing heterochromia), punctate epithelial keratopathy 4%: cold or upper respiratory tract infections, flu-like syndrome 1–4%: dry eyes, excessive tearing, eye pain, lid crusting, lid edema, lid erythema (hyperemia), lid pain, photophobia 1–2%: chest pain, allergic skin reactions, arthralgia, back pain, myalgia < 1 % (only severe or life-threatening effects): asthma, herpes keratitis, iritis, keratitis, retinal artery embolus, retinal detachment, toxic epidermal necrolysis, uveitis, vitreous hemorrhage from diabetic retinopathy A single case report links latanoprost use to the progression of keratoconus. Research suggests that wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops can result in shorter eyelashes and a lesser chance of hyperpigmentation in the eyelid, compared to not wiping off excess fluid. === Pregnancy === == Interactions == Interactions are similar to other prostaglandin analogs. Paradoxically, the concomitant use of latanoprost and bimatoprost or other prostaglandins may result in increased intraocular pressure. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce or increase the effect of latanoprost. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Like other prostaglandin analogues, latanoprost acid is an analog of prostaglandin F2α that acts as a selective agonist at the prostaglandin F receptor. Prostaglandins increase the sclera's permeability to aqueous fluid. By giving latanoprorost, it increases prostaglandin's scleral activity, increasing outflow of aqueous fluid and lowering intraocular pressure. The outflow of aqueous fluid would reduce the intraocular pressure in the eye, reducing the likelihood of complications such as optic nerve damage and visual field loss. === Pharmacokinetics === Latanoprost is absorbed well through the cornea. As an ester prodrug, it completely hydrolyses to the active latanoprost acid upon absorption to become biologically active. Highest concentrations of the acid in the aqueous humour are reached two hours after application, lowering of intraocular pressure starts after 3 to 4 hours, with its highest effect found after 8 to 12 hours, and its effect still present for at least 24 hours. When latanoprost acid reaches the circulation, it is quickly metabolised in the liver by fatty acid beta oxidation to 1,2-dinor- and 1,2,3,4-tetranor-latanoprost acid; blood plasma half life is only 17 minutes. The metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidney, with 88% of the topical dose and 98% of an intravenous dose being recovered in the urine respectively. The activation and deactivation pathway is analogous to the one of tafluprost (at least up to the tetranor-metabolite); compare Tafluprost#Pharmacokinetics. == Chemistry == === Stability === Latanoprost exhibits thermal and solar instability. The concentration of latanoprost stored at 50 °C will decrease by 10% every 8.25 days. When stored at 70 °C the concentration will decrease by 10% every 1.32 days. Ultraviolet light, for example in sunlight, causes rapid degradation of latanoprost. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Latanoprost was approved for medical use in the United States and the European Union in 1996. In September 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Catiolanze, intended for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in adults with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and in children from four years and adolescents with elevated intraocular pressure and pediatric glaucoma.

It is a prodrug form of penciclovir with improved oral bioavailability. Famciclovir is marketed under the trade name Famvir (Novartis). Famciclovir was patented in 1983 and approved for medical use in 1994. In 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic version of famciclovir. Generic tablets are manufactured by TEVA Pharmaceuticals and Mylan Pharmaceuticals. == Medical uses == Famciclovir is indicated for the treatment of herpes zoster (shingles), treatment of herpes simplex virus 2 (genital herpes), herpes labialis (cold sores) in immunocompetent patients and for the suppression of recurring episodes of herpes simplex virus 2. It is also indicated for treatment of recurrent episodes of herpes simplex in HIV patients. == Adverse effects == Side effects: mild to extreme stomach upset, headaches, mild fever. == Herpes == === Early treatment === Several studies in humans and mice provide evidence that early treatment with famciclovir soon after the first infection with herpes can significantly lower the chance of future outbreaks. Use of famciclovir in this manner has been shown to reduce the amount of latent virus in the neural ganglia compared to no treatment or treatment with valaciclovir. A review of human subjects treated for five days with famciclovir 250 mg three times daily during their first herpes episode found that only 4.2 percent experienced a recurrence within six months after the first outbreak, a fivefold decrease compared to the 19 percent recurrence in acyclovir-treated patients.

Plasma samples from patients with arterial thrombotic events and diet-induced obese mice were collected to determine the GUDCA concentrations using mass spectrometry. Multiple in vivo murine thrombosis models and in vitro platelet functional assays were conducted to comprehensively evaluate the antithrombotic effects of GUDCA. Moreover, lipidomic analysis was performed to identify the alterations of intraplatelet lipid components following GUDCA treatment. Plasma GUDCA level was significantly decreased in patients with arterial thrombotic events and negatively correlated with thrombotic propensity in diet-induced obese mice. GUDCA exhibited prominent suppressing effects on platelet reactivity as evidenced by the attenuation of platelet activation, secretion, aggregation, spreading, and retraction ( Our study implicated that GUDCA reduces platelet hyperreactivity and improves thrombotic propensity by inhibiting DGKs activity, which is a potentially effective prophylactic approach and promising therapeutic agent for arterial thrombotic events.

This study aimed to investigate the role of GUDCA in the development of atherosclerosis and its potential mechanisms. Methods and Results Human THP-1 macrophages were used to investigate the effect of GUDCA on oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced foam cell formation in vitro. We found that GUDCA downregulated scavenger receptor A1 mRNA expression, reduced oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake, and inhibited macrophage foam cell formation. In an in vivo study, apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were fed a Western diet for 10 weeks to induce atherosclerosis, and then were gavaged once daily with or without GUDCA for 18 weeks. Parameters of systemic metabolism and atherosclerosis were detected. We found that GUDCA improved cholesterol homeostasis and protected against atherosclerosis progression as evidenced by reduced plaque area along with lipid deposition, ameliorated local chronic inflammation, and elevated plaque stability. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing showed that GUDCA administration partially normalized the Western diet-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis.

1637,"('Pantothenic acid (hemicalcium salt)', 'Calcium pantothenate', 'Calcium d-pantothenate', 'Vitamin b5 calcium salt', 'Pantothenic acid')","Food, Medical","Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is a B vitamin and an essential nutrient. All animals need pantothenic acid in order to synthesize coenzyme A (CoA), which is essential for cellular energy production and for the synthesis and degradation of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Pantothenic acid is the combination of pantoic acid and β-alanine. Its name comes from the Greek πάντοθεν pantothen, meaning ""from everywhere"", because pantothenic acid, at least in small amounts, is in almost all foods. Deficiency of pantothenic acid is very rare in humans. In dietary supplements and animal feed, the form commonly used is calcium pantothenate, because chemically it is more stable, and hence makes for longer product shelf-life, than sodium pantothenate and free pantothenic acid. == Definition == Pantothenic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, one of the B vitamins. It is synthesized from the amino acid β-alanine and pantoic acid (see biosynthesis and structure of coenzyme A figures). Unlike vitamin E or vitamin K, which occurs in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, pantothenic acid is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a cofactor for many enzyme processes. == Use in biosynthesis of coenzyme A == Pantothenic acid is a precursor to CoA via a five-step process. The biosynthesis requires pantothenic acid, cysteine, and four equivalents of ATP (see figure). Pantothenic acid is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase. This is the committed step in CoA biosynthesis and requires ATP. A cysteine is added to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase to form 4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). This step is coupled with ATP hydrolysis. PPC is decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase 4′-Phosphopantetheine is adenylated (or more properly, AMPylated) to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase. This final step also requires ATP. This pathway is suppressed by end-product inhibition, meaning that CoA is a competitive inhibitor of pantothenate kinase, the enzyme responsible for the first step. Coenzyme A is necessary in the reaction mechanism of the citric acid cycle. This process is the body's primary catabolic pathway and is essential in breaking down the building blocks of the cell such as carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids, for fuel. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) as acetyl-CoA, and for α-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also required for acylation and acetylation, which, for example, are involved in signal transduction, and various enzyme functions. In addition to functioning as CoA, this compound can act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds; this is a way to transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is also required in the formation of acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is required for fatty acid synthesis. Its synthesis also connects with other vitamins such as thiamin and folic acid. == Dietary recommendations == The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for B vitamins in 1998. At that time, there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs for pantothenic acid. In instances such as this, the Board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), with the understanding that at some later date, AIs may be replaced by more exact information. The current AI for teens and adults ages 14 and up is 5 mg/day. This was based in part on the observation that for a typical diet, urinary excretion was approximately 2.6 mg/day, and that bioavailability of food-bound pantothenic acid was roughly 50%. AI for pregnancy is 6 mg/day. AI for lactation is 7 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months, the AI is 1.8 mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years, the AI increases with age from 2 to 4 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). While for many nutrients, the US Department of Agriculture uses food composition data combined with food consumption survey results to estimate average consumption, the surveys and reports do not include pantothenic acid in the analyses. Less formal estimates of adult daily intakes report about 4 to 7 mg/day. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the US. For women and men over age 11, the Adequate Intake (AI) is set at 5 mg/day. AI for pregnancy is 5 mg/day, for lactation 7 mg/day. For children ages 1–10 years, the AI is 4 mg/day. These AIs are similar to the US AIs. === Safety === As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of pantothenic acid, there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in the United States – that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for pantothenic acid. === Labeling requirements === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For pantothenic acid labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 10 mg, but as of May 2016 it was revised to 5 mg to bring it into agreement with the AI. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by January 2020 for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 2021 for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == === Dietary === Food sources of pantothenic acid include animal-sourced foods, including dairy foods and eggs. Potatoes, tomato products, oat-cereals, sunflower seeds, avocado are good plant sources. Mushrooms are good sources, too. Whole grains are another source of the vitamin, but milling to make white rice or white flour removes much of the pantothenic acid, as it is found in the outer layers of whole grains. In animal feeds, the most important sources are alfalfa, cereal, fish meal, peanut meal, molasses, rice bran, wheat bran, and yeasts. === Supplements === Dietary supplements of pantothenic acid commonly use pantothenol (or panthenol), a shelf-stable analog, which is converted to pantothenic acid once consumed. Calcium pantothenate – a salt – may be used in manufacturing because it is more resistant than pantothenic acid to factors that deteriorate stability, such as acid, alkali or heat. The amount of pantothenic acid in dietary supplement products may contain up to 1,000 mg (200 times the Adequate Intake level for adults), without evidence that such large amounts provide any benefit. According to WebMD, pantothenic acid supplements have a long list of claimed uses, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support any of them. As a dietary supplement, pantothenic acid is not the same as pantethine, which is composed of two pantothenic acid molecules linked by a disulfide bridge. Sold as a high-dose supplement (600 mg), pantethine may be effective for lowering blood levels of LDL cholesterol – a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases – but its long-term effects are unknown, so use should be supervised by a physician. Dietary supplementation with pantothenic acid does not have the cholesterol-lowering effect as pantethine. === Fortification === According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, pantothenic acid deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified. == Absorption, metabolism and excretion == When found in foods, most pantothenic acid is in the form of CoA or bound to acyl carrier protein (ACP). For the intestinal cells to absorb this vitamin, it must be converted into free pantothenic acid. Within the lumen of the intestine, CoA and ACP are hydrolyzed into 4'-phosphopantetheine. The 4'-phosphopantetheine is then dephosphorylated into pantetheine. Pantetheinase, an intestinal enzyme, then hydrolyzes pantetheine into free pantothenic acid. Free pantothenic acid is absorbed into intestinal cells via a saturable, sodium-dependent active transport system. At high levels of intake, when this mechanism is saturated, some pantothenic acid may also be additionally absorbed via passive diffusion. As a whole, when intake increases 10-fold, absorption rate decreases to 10%. Pantothenic acid is excreted in urine. This occurs after its release from CoA. Urinary amounts are on the order of 2.6 mg/day, but decreased to negligible amounts when subjects in multi-week experimental situations were fed diets devoid of the vitamin. == Deficiency == Pantothenic acid deficiency in humans is very rare and has not been thoroughly studied. In the few cases where deficiency has been seen (prisoners of war during World War II, victims of starvation, or limited volunteer trials), nearly all symptoms were reversed with orally administered pantothenic acid. Symptoms of deficiency are similar to other vitamin B deficiencies. There is impaired energy production, due to low CoA levels, which could cause symptoms of irritability, fatigue, and apathy. Acetylcholine synthesis is also impaired; therefore, neurological symptoms can also appear in deficiency; they include sensation of numbness in hands and feet, paresthesia and muscle cramps. Additional symptoms could include restlessness, malaise, sleep disturbances, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. In animals, symptoms include disorders of the nervous, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, reduced growth rate, decreased food intake, skin lesions and changes in hair coat, and alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. In rodents, there can be loss of hair color, which led to marketing of pantothenic acid as a dietary supplement which could prevent or treat graying of hair in humans (despite the lack of any human trial evidence). Pantothenic acid status can be assessed by measuring either whole blood concentration or 24-hour urinary excretion. In humans, whole blood values less than 1 μmol/L are considered low, as is urinary excretion of less than 4.56 mmol/day. == Animal nutrition == Calcium pantothenate and dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) are European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved additives to animal feed. Supplementation is on the order of 8–20 mg/kg for pigs, 10–15 mg/kg for poultry, 30–50 mg/kg for fish and 8–14 mg/kg feed for pets. These are recommended concentrations, designed to be higher than what are thought to be requirements. There is some evidence that feed supplementation increases pantothenic acid concentration in tissues, i.e., meat, consumed by humans, and also for eggs, but this raises no concerns for consumer safety. No dietary requirement for pantothenic acid has been established in ruminant species. Synthesis of pantothenic acid by ruminal microorganisms appears to be 20 to 30 times more than dietary amounts. Net microbial synthesis of pantothenic acid in the rumen of steer calves has been estimated to be 2.2 mg/kg of digestible organic matter consumed per day. Supplementation of pantothenic acid at 5 to 10 times theoretical requirements did not improve growth performance of feedlot cattle. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Bacteria synthesize pantothenic acid from the amino acids aspartate and a precursor to the amino acid valine. Aspartate is converted to β-alanine. The amino group of valine is replaced by a keto-moiety to yield α-ketoisovalerate, which, in turn, forms α-ketopantoate following transfer of a methyl group, then D-pantoate (also known as pantoic acid) following reduction. β-alanine and pantoic acid are then condensed to form pantothenic acid (see figure). === Industrial synthesis === The industrial synthesis of pantothenic acid starts with the aldol condensation of isobutyraldehyde and formaldehyde. The resulting hydroxypivaldehyde is converted to its cyanohydrin derivative. which is cyclised to give racemic pantolactone. This sequence of reactions was first published in 1904. Synthesis of the vitamin is completed by resolution of the lactone using quinine, for example, followed by treatment with the calcium or sodium salt of β-alanine. == History == The term vitamin is derived from the word vitamine, which was coined in 1912 by Polish biochemist Casimir Funk, who isolated a complex of water-soluble micronutrients essential to life, all of which he presumed to be amines. When this presumption was later determined not to be true, the ""e"" was dropped from the name, hence ""vitamin"". Vitamin nomenclature was alphabetical, with Elmer McCollum calling these fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Over time, eight chemically distinct, water-soluble B vitamins were isolated and numbered, with pantothenic acid as vitamin B5. The essential nature of pantothenic acid was discovered by Roger J. Williams in 1933 by showing it was required for the growth of yeast. Three years later Elvehjem and Jukes demonstrated that it was a growth and anti-dermatitis factor in chickens. Williams dubbed the compound ""pantothenic acid"", deriving the name from the Greek word pantothen, which translates as ""from everywhere"". His reason was that he found it to be present in almost every food he tested. Williams went on to determine the chemical structure in 1940. In 1953, Fritz Lipmann shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for his discovery of co-enzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism"", work he had published in 1946. == References ==",Pantothenic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.017843076959252357), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.0020484195556491613), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.02976592257618904), ('ĠEND', -0.47822654247283936), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1270134150981903)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([ods.od.nih.gov](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/pantothenicacid-healthprofessional/?utm_source=openai), [cosmeticsinfo.org](https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/pantothenic-acid/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=227, start_index=21, title='Pantothenic Acid - Health Professional Fact Sheet', type='url_citation', url='https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/pantothenicacid-healthprofessional/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=227, start_index=21, title='Pantothenic Acid - Cosmetics Info', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/pantothenic-acid/?utm_source=openai')])"
1638,"('Candesartan cilexetil', 'Atacand', 'Amias', 'Parapres', 'Kenzen')",Medical,"Candesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker used mainly for the treatment of high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Candesartan has a very low maintenance dose. Like olmesartan, the metabolism of the drug is unusual as it is a cascading prodrug. Candesartan has good bioavailibility and is the most potent by weight of the AT-1 receptor antagonists. It was patented in 1990 and approved for medical use in 1997. == Medical uses == === Hypertension === As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, candesartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Candesartan has an additive antihypertensive effect when combined with a diuretic, such as chlorthalidone. It is available in a fixed-combination formulation with a low dose of the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. Candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination preparations are marketed under various trade names including Atacand Plus, Hytacand, Blopress Plus, Advantec and Ratacand Plus. === Heart failure === In heart failure patients, angiotensin receptor blockers such as candesartan and valsartan may be a suitable option for those who do not tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medicines. Randomised control trials have shown candesartan reduces heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths for patients who have heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%). === Prehypertension === In a four-year randomized controlled trial, candesartan was compared to placebo to see whether it could prevent or postpone the development of full-blown hypertension in people with so-called prehypertension. During the first two years of the trial, half of participants were given candesartan while the other half received placebo; candesartan reduced the risk of developing hypertension by nearly two-thirds during this period. In the last two years of the study, all participants were switched to placebo. By the end of the study, candesartan had significantly reduced the risk of hypertension, by more than 15%. Serious adverse effects were more common among participants receiving placebo than in those given candesartan. === Prevention of atrial fibrillation === In 2005, meta-analysis results showed that angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors considerably reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with coexisting heart failure and systolic left ventricular dysfunction. Specifically, an analysis of the CHARM study showed benefits for Candesartan in reducing new occurrences of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular function. While these studies have demonstrated a potential additional benefit for candesartan when used in patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction, additional studies are required to further elucidate the role of candesartan in the prevention of atrial fibrillation in other population groups. === Diabetic retinopathy === Use of antihypertensive drugs has been demonstrated to slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy; the role of candesartan specifically in reducing progression in type 1 and type 2 diabetes is still up for debate. Results from a 2008 study on patients with type 1 diabetes showed there was no benefit in using candesartan to reduce progression of diabetic retinopathy when compared to placebo. Candesartan has been demonstrated to reverse the severity (cause regression) of mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. The patient populations investigated in these studies were limited to mostly Caucasians and those younger than 75 years of age, so generalization of these findings to other population groups should be done with caution. === Migraine prophylaxis === Candesartan may be helpful in migraine prevention as it has better tolerability and fewer side effects compared to other first line medications. It has been recommended by multiple guidelines for migraine prophylaxis in adults with different levels of recommendations, however further studies on larger populations are needed. == Adverse effects == As with other drugs that inhibit the renin–angiotensin system, if candesartan is taken by pregnant women during the second or third trimester, it can cause injury and in some cases, death of the developing fetus. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in people who take candesartan and are volume-depleted or salt-depleted, as can also occur when diuretics are coadministered. Reduction in renal glomerular filtration rate may occur; people with renal artery stenosis may be at higher risk. Hyperkalemia may occur; people who are also taking spironolactone or eplerenone may be at higher risk. Anemia may occur, due to inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system. As with other angiotensin receptor blockers, candesartan can rarely cause severe liver injury. == Chemistry and pharmacokinetics == Candesartan is marketed as the cyclohexyl 1-hydroxy ethyl carbonate (cilexetil) ester, known as candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan cilexetil is metabolised completely by esterases in the intestinal wall during absorption to the active candesartan moiety. In the first step of the cascading pro-drug mechanism, the carbonate group is hydrolyzed, releasing carbon dioxide. The metabolite at this step is cyclohexanol which, being relatively non-toxic, is advantageous to the design of the drug. The other aspect of the cascading prodrug is the O-CH-CH3 molecule which becomes converted into acetic acid, which is another product from the cascading side reaction. Similar to the insight from cyclohexanol, the metabolite of acetic acid relatively is non-toxic and thus less of a hazard if produced as the drug takes pharmacologic action. The use of a prodrug form increases the bioavailability of candesartan. Despite this, absolute bioavailability is relatively poor at 15% (candesartan cilexetil tablets) to 40% (candesartan cilexetil solution). Its IC50 is 15 μg/kg. Candesartan is not administered in its active form because the administration of the pro-drug would require greater doses and has an unfavorable adverse event profile. == Research == There is ongoing research into several potential benefits of candesartan beyond established indications. Candesartan is being investigated for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. In an early Alzheimer's disease mouse model, candesartan significantly reduced amyloid burden and inflammation and it is being examined as a potential treatment for early Alzheimer's. Rat models indicate that candesartan may have neuroprotective benefits that mitigate certain central mechanisms of ageing and senescence. Additionally, candesartan has shown potential therapeutic applications as an anti-anxiety agent. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, candesartan induced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved both LV function and exercise tolerance with no side effects in patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The unique anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of Candesartan are shown to offer superior renoprotection of chronic renal inflammation, and in ultrahigh doses and in a multidrug context, could be investigated as potentially inducing remission of chronic kidney disease. == History == The compound known as TCV-116 (candesartan) was studied by Japanese scientists using standard laboratory rats. Animal studies were published showing the effectiveness of the compound in 1992–1993, with a pilot study on humans published in the summer of 1993. == Names == The prodrug candesartan cilexetil is marketed by AstraZeneca and Takeda Pharmaceuticals, commonly under the trade names Blopress, Atacand, Amias, and Ratacand. It is available in generic form. == References ==",Amias,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00014828535495325923), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024995533749461174)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

1640,"('Decanoic acid', 'N-decanoic acid', 'N-capric acid', 'Decoic acid', 'Decylic acid')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Capric acid, also known as decanoic acid or decylic acid, is a saturated fatty acid, medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA), and carboxylic acid. Its formula is CH3(CH2)8COOH. Salts and esters of decanoic acid are called caprates or decanoates. The term capric acid is derived from the Latin ""caper / capra"" (goat) because the sweaty, unpleasant smell of the compound is reminiscent of goats. == Occurrence == Capric acid occurs naturally in coconut oil (about 10%) and palm kernel oil (about 4%), otherwise it is uncommon in typical seed oils. It is found in the milk of various mammals and to a lesser extent in other animal fats. Two other acids are named after goats: caproic acid (a C6:0 fatty acid) and caprylic acid (a C8:0 fatty acid). Along with capric acid, these total 15% in goat milk fat. == Production == Capric acid can be prepared from oxidation of the primary alcohol decanol by using chromium trioxide (CrO3) oxidant under acidic conditions. Neutralization of capric acid or saponification of its triglyceride esters with sodium hydroxide yields sodium caprate, CH3(CH2)8CO−2Na+. This salt is a component of some types of soap. == Uses == Capric acid is used in the manufacture of esters for artificial fruit flavors and perfumes. It is also used as an intermediate in chemical syntheses. It is used in organic synthesis and industrially in the manufacture of perfumes, lubricants, greases, rubber, dyes, plastics, food additives and pharmaceuticals. === Pharmaceuticals === Caprate ester prodrugs of various pharmaceuticals are available. Since capric acid is a fatty acid, forming a salt or ester with a drug will increase its lipophilicity and its affinity for adipose tissue. Since distribution of a drug from fatty tissue is usually slow, one may develop a long-acting injectable form of a drug (called a depot injection) by using its caprate form. Some examples of drugs available as a caprate ester include nandrolone (as nandrolone decanoate), fluphenazine (as fluphenazine decanoate), bromperidol (as bromperidol decanoate), and haloperidol (as haloperidol decanoate). == Effects == Capric acid acts as a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist at therapeutically relevant concentrations, in a voltage- and subunit-dependent manner, and this is sufficient to explain its antiseizure effects. This direct inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission by capric acid in the brain contributes to the anticonvulsant effect of the MCT ketogenic diet. Decanoic acid and the AMPA receptor antagonist drug perampanel act at separate sites on the AMPA receptor, and so it is possible that they have a cooperative effect at the AMPA receptor, suggesting that perampanel and the ketogenic diet could be synergistic. Capric acid may be responsible for the mitochondrial proliferation associated with the ketogenic diet, and that this may occur via PPARγ receptor agonism and its target genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Complex I activity of the electron transport chain is substantially elevated by decanoic acid treatment. It should however be noted that orally ingested medium chain fatty acids would be very rapidly degraded by first-pass metabolism by being taken up in the liver via the portal vein, and are quickly metabolized via coenzyme A intermediates through β-oxidation and the citric acid cycle to produce carbon dioxide, acetate and ketone bodies. Whether the ketones, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetone have direct antiseizure activity is unclear. == See also == List of saturated fatty acids List of carboxylic acids Undecylic acid Pelargonic acid, a medium-chain fatty acid, also with antiseizure activity == References ==",Decylic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.2900867164134979), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' INDUSTR', -0.2212507426738739), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.001171056181192398), (' MED', -0.043251749128103256), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.030102822929620743), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -4.053033626405522e-05), ('ĠINDU', -0.08940396457910538), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0031797345727682114), ('ĠMED', -0.003258278826251626), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01816108264029026)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.40271779894828796), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -9.615255839889869e-05), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is a centrally active, intravenously administered (non-orally active) amidated tetrapeptide that acts as a novel and selective modulator of the NMDA receptor. The drug is a rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant as well as robust cognitive enhancer by virtue of its ability to enhance NMDA receptor-mediated signal transduction and synaptic plasticity. == Clinical development == On March 3, 2014, the U.S. FDA granted Fast Track designation to the development of rapastinel as an adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. As of 2015, the drug had completed phase II clinical development for this indication and achieved proof of concept as a rapid-acting antidepressant by demonstrating reduced depressive symptoms at days 1 through 7, as assessed by the HAM-D, without eliciting psychotomimetic or other significant side effects. On January 29, 2016, Allergan (who acquired Naurex in July 2015) announced that rapastinel had received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the U.S. FDA for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. On March 6, 2019, Allergan announced rapastinel failed to differentiate from placebo during phase III trials. Early successful clinical studies of rapastinel in depression spurred the development of next-generation compounds with similar mechanisms of action including apimostinel (GATE-202, NRX-1074), a 2nd generation analog with improved potency, and zelquistinel (GATE-251, AGN-241751), a 3rd generation small molecule with improved potency and high oral bioavailability. == Preclinical development == Rapastinel was originally invented by Joseph Moskal, the co-founder of Naurex, via structural modification of B6B21, a monoclonal antibody that similarly binds to and modulates the NMDA receptor. Rapastinel binds to a novel and unique domain on the NMDA receptor complex that is distinct from the glycine co-agonist binding site. Rapastinel exhibits a biphasic dose response in vitro. At therapeutically relevant concentrations, rapastinel enhances glutamate-mediated NMDA receptor activity, independent of glycine co-agonism, and enhances the magnitude of NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses in the mPFC. Positive modulation of NMDA receptors by rapastinel produces antidepressant effects that are convergent with the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, however, rapastinel has no ketamine-like side effects such as cognitive impairment and psychotomimetic symptoms. In addition to its rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, rapastinel has been shown to enhance memory and learning in both young adult and learning-impaired, aging rat models. It has been shown to increase Schaffer collateral-CA1 long-term potentiation in vitro. In concert with a learning task, rapastinel has also been shown to elevate gene expression of hippocampal NR1, a subunit of the NMDA receptor, in three-month-old rats. Neuroprotective effects have also been demonstrated in Mongolian Gerbils by delaying the death of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus pyramidal neurons under glucose and oxygen-deprived conditions. == See also == List of investigational antidepressants == References == == External links == Rapastinel - AdisInsight Rapastinel (GLYX-13) - Naurex, Inc.

1642,"('Salmeterol', 'Serevent', 'Aeromax', 'Salmeterolum [latin]', 'Gr 33343x')",Medical,"Salmeterol is a long-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) used in the treatment and prevention of asthma symptoms and control of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms. Symptoms of bronchospasm include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing and chest tightness. It is also used to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise (exercise-induced bronchoconstriction). It was patented in 1983 and came into medical use in 1990. It is marketed as Serevent in the US. It is available as a dry-powder inhaler (DPI) that releases a powdered form of the drug. It was previously available as a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) but was discontinued in the US in 2002. It is available as an MDI in other countries as of 2020. == Mechanism of action == Inhaled salmeterol belongs to a group of drugs called beta-2 agonists. These drugs stimulate beta-2 receptors present in the bronchial musculature. This causes them to relax and prevent the onset and worsening of symptoms of asthma. They act on the enzyme adenyl cyclase which increases the concentration of cAMP (Cyclic adenosine monophosphate). This cyclic AMP decreases the smooth muscle tone. This drug is 10,000-times more lipid soluble than the short acting beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist, albuterol. Unlike albuterol, salmeterol becomes dissolved in the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, and its gradual dissociation from the cell membrane provides beta-2 adrenoceptors with a supply of agonist for an extended period of time. The primary noticeable difference of salmeterol from salbutamol, and other short-acting β2 adrenoreceptor agonists (SABAs), is its duration of action. Salmeterol lasts approximately 12 hours in comparison with salbutamol, which lasts about 4–6 hours. When used regularly every day as prescribed, inhaled salmeterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. Formoterol has been demonstrated to have a faster onset of action than salmeterol as a result of a lower lipophilicity, and has also been demonstrated to be more potent—a 12 μg dose of formoterol has been demonstrated to be equivalent to a 50 μg dose of salmeterol. == Medical uses == Salmeterol is used in moderate-to-severe persistent asthma following previous treatment with a short-acting β2 adrenoreceptor agonist (SABA) such as salbutamol (albuterol). LABAs should not be used as a monotherapy, instead, they should be used concurrently with an inhaled corticosteroid, such as beclometasone dipropionate or fluticasone propionate in the treatment of asthma to minimize serious reactions such as asthma-related deaths. Combination of inhaled corticosteroids and salmeterol (LABA) has synergistic action and reduces the frequency of asthma attacks and also makes it less severe. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), LABAs may be used as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids. The Torch study demonstrated benefits in terms of quality of life and lung function of salmeterol alone or in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD In exercise-induced bronchospasm monotherapy may be indicated in patients without persistent asthma. LABAs should not be used to treat acute symptoms. === Pregnancy and lactation === Salmeterol use during pregnancy must be decided based on the risks versus benefits to the mother. There are no well-controlled studies with salmeterol in pregnant women. Some animal studies showed developmental malformation when the mother was given several clinical doses orally. In rats, salmeterol xinafoate is excreted in the milk. However, since there is no data to show excretion of salmeterol in a mother's breast milk, a decision on whether to continue or discontinue therapy should be decided based on the important benefits it provides to the mother. Pregnant and lactating women should consult their doctors before using salmeterol. == Side effects == Due to its vasodilation properties, the common side effects of salmeterol are dizziness, sinus infection, and migraine headaches. Other side effects muscle tremors, hypokalemia due to direct effect on beta-2 receptors on skeletal muscle. In most cases, salmeterol side effects are minor and either do not require treatment or can easily be treated. Certain side effects, however, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately. Some of these more serious side effects include very fast heart rate, high blood pressure, and worsening breathing problems. == Structure-activity relationship == Salmeterol has an aryl alkyl group with a chain length of 11 atoms from the amine. This bulkiness makes the compound more lipophilic and it also makes it selective to β2 adrenergic receptors. == History == Salmeterol, first marketed and manufactured by Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline, GSK) in the 1980s, was released as Serevent in 1990. The product is marketed by GSK under the Allen & Hanburys brand in the UK. In November 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a health advisory, alerting the public to findings that show the use of long-acting β2 agonists could lead to a worsening of symptoms, and in some cases death. While the use of inhaled LABAs are still recommended in asthma guidelines for the resulting improved symptom control, further concerns have been raised. A large meta-analysis of pooled results from 19 trials with 33,826 participants, suggests that salmeterol may increase the small risks of asthma-related deaths, and this additional risk is not reduced with the additional use of inhaled steroids (e.g., as with the combination product fluticasone/salmeterol). This seems to occur because although LABAs relieve asthma symptoms, they also promote bronchial inflammation and sensitivity without warning. == Society and culture == === Names === Combinations of inhaled steroids and these long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread; the most common combination currently in use is fluticasone/salmeterol (brand names Seretide (UK) and Advair (US)). Another combination is budesonide/formoterol (brand name Symbicort). == References == == External links == ""Salmeterol"". Drug Information Portal.

1643,"('Benztropine (mesylate)', 'Benzatropine mesylate', 'Benzotropine mesylate', 'Benztropine methanesulfonate', 'Benztropine')",Medical,"Benzatropine (INN), known as benztropine in the United States and Japan, is a medication used to treat movement disorders like parkinsonism and dystonia, as well as extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics, including akathisia. It is not useful for tardive dyskinesia. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein or muscle. Benefits are seen within two hours and last for up to ten hours. Common side effects include dry mouth, blurry vision, nausea, and constipation. Serious side effect may include urinary retention, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and poor coordination. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Benzatropine is an anticholinergic which works by blocking the activity of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Benzatropine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1954. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 229th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. It is sold under the brand name Cogentin among others. == Medical uses == Benzatropine is used to reduce extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotic treatment. Benzatropine is also a second-line drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It improves tremor, and may alleviate rigidity and bradykinesia. Benzatropine is also sometimes used for the treatment of dystonia, a rare disorder that causes abnormal muscle contraction, resulting in twisting postures of limbs, trunk, or face. == Adverse effects == These are principally anticholinergic: Dry mouth Blurred vision Cognitive changes Drowsiness Constipation Urinary retention Tachycardia Anorexia Severe delirium and hallucinations (in overdose) While some studies suggest that use of anticholinergics increases the risk of tardive dyskinesia (a long-term side effect of antipsychotics), other studies have found no association between anticholinergic exposure and risk of developing tardive dyskinesia, although symptoms may be worsened. Drugs that decrease cholinergic transmission may impair storage of new information into long-term memory. Anticholinergic agents can also impair time perception. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Antihistamine and anticholinergic activity ==== Benzatropine is a centrally acting anticholinergic and antihistamine. In terms of its anticholinergic activity, it is specifically an antimuscarinic and acts a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M3 receptor antagonist. Benzatropine partially blocks cholinergic activity in the basal ganglia. Animal studies have indicated that anticholinergic activity of benzatropine is approximately one-half that of atropine, while its antihistamine activity approaches that of mepyramine. Its anticholinergic effects have been established as therapeutically significant in the management of Parkinsonism. Benzatropine antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine, decreasing the imbalance between the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and dopamine, which may improve the symptoms of early Parkinson's disease. Benzatropine has been also identified, by a high throughput screening approach, as a potent differentiating agent for oligodendrocytes, possibly working through M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors. In preclinical models for multiple sclerosis, benzatropine decreased clinical symptoms and enhanced re-myelination. ==== Atypical dopamine reuptake inhibition ==== In addition to its anticholinergic activity, benztropine has been found to increase the availability of dopamine by blocking its reuptake and storage in central sites, and as a result, increasing dopaminergic activity. Benzatropine and analogues are atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitors, which might make them useful for people with akathisia secondary to antipsychotic therapy. ==== Other actions ==== Benzatropine also acts as a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA). == Other animals == In veterinary medicine, benzatropine is used to treat priapism in stallions. == Naming == Since 1959, benzatropine is the official international nonproprietary name of the medication under the INN scheme, the medication naming system coordinated by the World Health Organization; it is also the British Approved Name (BAN) given in the British Pharmacopoeia, and has been the official nonproprietary name in Australia since 2015. Regional variations of the ""a"" spelling are also used in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, as well as Latin (all medications are assigned a Latin name by WHO). ""Benztropine"" is the official United States Adopted Name (USAN), the medication naming system coordinated by the USAN Council, co-sponsored by the American Medical Association (AMA), the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA). It is also the Japanese Accepted Name (JAN) and was used in Australia until 2015, when it was harmonized with the INN. Both names may be modified to account for the methanesulfonate salt as which the medication is formulated: the modified INN (INNm) and BAN (BANM) is benzatropine mesilate, while the modified USAN is benztropine mesylate. The modified JAN is a hybrid form, benztropine mesilate.

1644,"('Quinolinic acid', 'Pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid', 'Quinolinate', 'Pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylate', 'Pyridine-2,3-carboxylate')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Quinolinic acid (abbreviated QUIN or QA), also known as pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, is a dicarboxylic acid with a pyridine backbone. It is a colorless solid. It is the biosynthetic precursor to niacin. Quinolinic acid is a downstream product of the kynurenine pathway, which metabolizes the amino acid tryptophan. It acts as an NMDA receptor agonist. Quinolinic acid has a potent neurotoxic effect. Studies have demonstrated that quinolinic acid may be involved in many psychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative processes in the brain, as well as other disorders. Within the brain, quinolinic acid is only produced by activated microglia and macrophages. == History == In 1949 L. Henderson was one of the earliest to describe quinolinic acid. Lapin followed up this research by demonstrating that quinolinic acid could induce convulsions when injected into mice brain ventricles. However, it was not until 1981 that Stone and Perkins showed that quinolinic acid activates the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). After this, Schwarcz demonstrated that elevated quinolinic acid levels could lead to axonal neurodegeneration. == Synthesis == One of the earliest reported syntheses of this quinolinic acid was by Zdenko Hans Skraup, who found that methyl-substituted quinolines could be oxidized to quinolinic acid by potassium permanganate. This compound is commercially available. It is generally obtained by the oxidation of quinoline. Oxidants such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and potassium permanganate have been used. Electrolysis is able to perform the transformation as well. Quinolinic acid may undergo further decarboxylation to nicotinic acid (niacin): == Biosynthesis == === From aspartate === Oxidation of aspartate by the enzyme aspartate oxidase gives iminosuccinate, containing the two carboxylic acid groups that are found in quinolinic acid. Condensation of iminosuccinate with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, mediated by quinolinate synthase, affords quinolinic acid. === Catabolism of tryptophan === Quinolinic acid is a byproduct of the kynurenine pathway, which is responsible for catabolism of tryptophan in mammals. This pathway is important for its production of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and produces several neuroactive intermediates including quinolinic acid, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA). Quinolinic acid's neuroactive and excitatory properties are a result of NMDA receptor agonism in the brain. It also acts as a neurotoxin, gliotoxin, proinflammatory mediator, and pro-oxidant molecule. While quinolinic acid cannot pass the BBB, kynurenine, tryptophan and 3-hydroxykynurenine do and subsequently act as precursors to the production of quinolinic acid in the brain. The quinolinic acid produced in microglia is then released and stimulates NMDA receptors, resulting in excitatory neurotoxicity. While astrocytes do not produce quinolinic acid directly, they do produce KYNA, which when released from the astrocytes can be taken in by migroglia that can in turn increase quinolinic acid production. Microglia and macrophages produce the vast majority of quinolinic acid present in the body. This production increases during an immune response. It is suspected that this is a result of activation of indoleamine dioxygenases (to be specific, IDO-1 and IDO-2) as well as tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) stimulation by inflammatory cytokines (mainly IFN-gamma, but also IFN-beta and IFN-alpha). IDO-1, IDO-2 and TDO are present in microglia and macrophages. Under inflammatory conditions and conditions of T cell activation, leukocytes are retained in the brain by cytokine and chemokine production, which can lead to the breakdown of the BBB, thus increasing the quinolinic acid that enters the brain. Furthermore, quinolinic acid has been shown to play a role in destabilization of the cytoskeleton within astrocytes and brain endothelial cells, contributing to the degradation of the BBB, which results in higher concentrations of quinolinic acid in the brain. == Toxicity == Quinolinic acid is an excitotoxin in the CNS. It reaches pathological levels in response to inflammation in the brain, which activates resident microglia and macrophages. High levels of quinolinic acid can lead to hindered neuronal function or even apoptotic death. Quinolinic acid produces its toxic effect through several mechanisms, primarily as its function as an NMDA receptor agonist, which triggers a chain of deleterious effects, but also through lipid peroxidation, and cytoskeletal destabilization. The gliotoxic effects of quinolinic acid further amplify the inflammatory response. Quinolinic acid affects neurons located mainly in the hippocampus, striatum, and neocortex, due to the selectivity toward quinolinic acid by the specific NMDA receptors residing in those regions. When inflammation occurs, quinolinic acid is produced in excessive levels through the kynurenine pathway. This leads to over excitation of the NMDA receptor, which results in an influx of Ca2+ into the neuron. High levels of Ca2+ in the neuron trigger an activation of destructive enzymatic pathways including protein kinases, phospholipases, NO synthase, and proteases. These enzymes will degenerate crucial proteins in the cell and increase NO levels, leading to an apoptotic response by the cell, which results in cell death. In normal cell conditions, astrocytes in the neuron will provide a glutamate–glutamine cycle, which results in reuptake of glutamate from the synapse into the pre-synaptic cell to be recycled, keeping glutamate from accumulating to lethal levels inside the synapse. At high concentrations, quinolinic acid inhibits glutamine synthetase, a critical enzyme in the glutamate–glutamine cycle. In addition, It can also promote glutamate release and block its reuptake by astrocytes. All three of these actions result in increased levels of glutamate activity that could be neurotoxic. This results in a loss of function of the cycle, and results in an accumulation of glutamate. This glutamate further stimulates the NMDA receptors, thus acting synergistically with quinolinic acid to increase its neurotoxic effect by increasing the levels of glutamate, as well as inhibiting its uptake. In this way, quinolinic acid self-potentiates its own toxicity. Furthermore, quinolinic acid results in changes of the biochemistry and structure of the astrocytes themselves, resulting in an apoptotic response. A loss of astrocytes results in a pro-inflammatory effect, further increasing the initial inflammatory response which initiates quinolinic acid production. Quinolinic acid can also exert neurotoxicity through lipid peroxidation, as a result of its pro-oxidant properties. Quinolinic acid can interact with Fe(II) to form a complex that induces a reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), notably the hydroxyl radical •OH. This free radical causes oxidative stress by further increasing glutamate release and inhibiting its reuptake, and results in the breakdown of DNA in addition to lipid peroxidation. Quinolinic acid has also been noted to increase phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell structure, leading to destabilization of the cytoskeleton. == Clinical implications == === Psychiatric disorders === ==== Mood disorders ==== The prefrontal cortices in the post-mortem brains of patients with major depression and bipolar depression contain increased quinolinic acid immunoreactivity compared to the brains of patients never having had depression. The fact that NMDA receptor antagonists possess antidepressant properties suggests that increased levels of quinolinic acid in patients with depression may overactivate NMDA receptors. By inducing increased levels of quinolinic acid in the cerebral spinal fluid with interferon α, researchers have demonstrated that increased quinolinic acid levels correlate with increased depressive symptoms. Increased levels of quinolinic acid might contribute to the apoptosis of astrocytes and certain neurons, resulting in decreased synthesis of neurotrophic factors. With less neurotrophic factors, the astrocyte-microglia-neuronal network is weaker and thus is more likely to be affected by environmental factors such as stress. In addition, increased levels of quinolinic acid could play a role in impairment of the glial-neuronal network, which could be associated with the recurrent and chronic nature of depression. Furthermore, studies have shown that unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) can lead to the metabolism of quinolinic acid in the amygdala and striatum and a reduction in quinolinic acid pathway in the cingulate cortex. Experiments with mice demonstrate how quinolinic acid can affect behavior and act as endogenous anxiogens. For instance, when quinolinic acid levels are increased, mice socialize and groom for shorter periods of time. There is also evidence that increased concentrations of quinolinic acid can play a role in adolescent depression. ==== Schizophrenia ==== Quinolinic acid may be involved in schizophrenia; however, there has been no research done to examine the specific effects of quinolinic acid in schizophrenia. There are many studies that show that kynurenic acid (KYNA) plays a role in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and there has been some research to suggest that 3-hydroxykynurenine (OHK) plays a role in the disease as well. Because quinolinic acid is strongly associated with KYNA and OHK, it may too play a role in schizophrenia. === Conditions related to neuronal death === The cytotoxic effects of quinolinic acid elaborated upon in the toxicity section amplify cell death in neurodegenerative conditions. ==== Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) ==== Quinolinic acid may contribute to the causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Researchers have found elevated levels of quinolinic acid in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), motor cortex, and spinal cord in ALS patients. These increased concentrations of quinolinic acid could lead to neurotoxicity. In addition, quinolinic acid is associated with overstimulating NMDA receptors on motor neurons. Studies have demonstrated that quinolinic acid leads to depolarization of spinal motor neurons by interacting with the NMDA receptors on those cells in rats. Also, quinolinic acid plays a role in mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons. All of these effects could contribute to ALS symptoms. ==== Alzheimer's disease ==== Researchers have found a correlation between quinolinic acid and Alzheimer's disease. For example, studies have found in the post-mortem brains of Alzheimer's disease patients higher neuronal quinolinic acid levels and that quinolinic acid can associate with tau protein. Furthermore, researchers have demonstrated that quinolinic acid increases tau phosphorylation in vitro in human fetal neurons and induces ten neuronal genes including some known to correlate with Alzheimer's disease. In immunoreactivity studies, researchers have found that quinolinic acid immunoreactivity is strongest in glial cells that are located close to amyloid plaques and that there is immunoreactivity with neurofibrillary tangles. ==== Brain ischemia ==== Brain ischemia is characterized by insufficient blood flow to the brain. Studies with ischaemic gerbils indicate that, after a delay, levels of quinolinic acid significantly increase, which correlates with increased neuronal damage. In addition, researchers have found that, after transient global ischaemia, there are microglia containing quinolinic acid within the brain. Following cerebral ischaemia, delayed neuronal death may occur in part because of central microglia and macrophages, which possess and secrete quinolinic acid. This delayed neurodegeneration could be associated with chronic brain damage that follows a stroke. ==== Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) ==== Studies have found that there is a correlation between levels of quinolinic acid in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) severity. About 20% of HIV patients have this disorder. Concentrations of quinolinic acid in the CSF are associated to different stages of HAND. For example, raised levels of quinolinic acid after infection are correlated to perceptual-motor slowing in patients. Then, in later stages of HIV, increased concentrations of quinolinic acid in the CSF of HAND patients correlates with HIV encephalitis and cerebral atrophy. Quinolinic acid has also been found in HAND patients' brains. In fact, the amount of quinolinic acid found in the brain of HAND patients can be up to 300 times greater than that found in the CSF. Neurons exposed to quinolinic acid for long periods of time can develop cytoskeletal abnormalities, vacuolization, and cell death. HAND patients' brains contain many of these defects. Furthermore, studies in rats have demonstrated that quinolinic acid can lead to neuronal death in brains structures that are affected by HAND, including the striatum, hippocampus, the substantia nigra, and non-limbic cortex. Levels of quinolinic acid in the CSF of AIDS patients with AIDS- dementia can be up to twenty times higher than normal. Similar to HIV patients, this increased quinolinic acid concentration correlates with cognitive and motor dysfunction. When patients were treated with zidovudine to decrease quinolinic acid levels, the amount of neurological improvement was related to the amount of quinolinic acid decreased. ==== Huntington's disease ==== In the initial stages of Huntington's disease, patients have substantially increased quinolinic acid levels, in particular in the neostriatum and cortex. These areas of the brain that had the most damage at these stages. The increase in quinolinic acid correlates with the early activation of microglia and increased cerebral 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) levels. Furthermore, these increased levels of quinolinic acid are great enough to produce excitotoxic neuronal damage. Studies have demonstrated that activation of NMDA receptors by quinolinic acid leads to neuronal dysfunction and death of striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN). Researchers utilize quinolinic acid in order to study Huntington's disease in many model organisms. Because injection of quinolinic acid into the striatum of rodents induces electrophysiological, neuropathological, and behavioral changes similar to those found in Huntington's disease, this is the most common method researchers use to produce a Huntington's disease phenotype. Neurological changes produced by quinolinic acid injections include altered levels of glutamate, GABA, and other amino acids. Lesions in the pallidum can suppress effects of quinolinic acid in monkeys injected with quinolinic acid into their striatum. In humans, such lesions can also diminish some of the effects of Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. ==== Parkinson's disease ==== Quinolinic acid neurotoxicity is thought to play a role in Parkinson's disease. Studies show that quinolinic acid is involved in the degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's disease patients. SN degeneration is one of the key characteristics of Parkinson's disease. Microglia associated with dopaminergic cells in the SN produce quinolinic acid at this location when scientists induce Parkinson's disease symptoms in macaques. Quinolinic acid levels are too high at these sites to be controlled by KYNA, causing neurotoxicity to occur. === Other === Quinolinic acid levels are increased in the brains of children infected with a range of bacterial infections of the central nervous system (CNS), of poliovirus patients, and of Lyme disease with CNS involvement patients. In addition, raised quinolinic acid levels have been found in traumatic CNS injury patients, patients with cognitive decline with ageing, hyperammonaemia patients, hypoglycaemia patients, and systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Also, it has been found that people with malaria and patients with olivopontocerebellar atrophy have raised quinolinic acid metabolism. == Treatment focus == Reduction of the excitotoxic effects of quinolinic acid is the subject of on-going research. NMDAr antagonists have been shown to provide protection to motor neurons from excitotoxicity resulting from quinolinic acid production. Kynurenic acid, another product of the kynurenine pathway acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist. Kynurenic acid thus acts as a neuroprotectant, by reducing the dangerous over-activation of the NMDA receptors. Manipulation of the kynurenine pathway away from quinolinic acid and toward kynurenic acid is therefore a major therapeutic focus. Nicotinylalanine has been shown to be an inhibitor of kynurenine hydroxylase, which results in a decreased production of quinolinic acid, thus favoring kynurenic acid production. This change in balance has the potential to reduce hyperexcitability, and thus excitotoxic damage produced from elevated levels of quinolinic acid. Therapeutic efforts are also focusing on antioxidants, which have been shown to provide protection against the pro-oxidant properties of quinolinic acid. Norharmane suppresses the production of quinolinic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine and nitric oxide synthase, thereby acting as a neuroprotectant. Natural phenols such as catechin hydrate, curcumin, and epigallocatechin gallate reduce the neurotoxicity of quinolinic acid, via anti-oxidant and possibly calcium influx mechanisms. COX-2 inhibitors, such as licofelone have also demonstrated protective properties against the neurotoxic effects of quinolinic acid. COX-2 is upregulated in many neurotoxic disorders and is associated with increased ROS production. Inhibitors have demonstrated some evidence of efficacy in mental health disorders such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and Huntington's disease. == See also == Homoquinolinic acid == References ==",Quinolinate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0008773969602771103), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -4.842555426876061e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.08626729249954224), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.10028412193059921), ('ĠMED', -0.1776583045721054), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023252084851264954)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

1647,"('Bosentan', 'Tracleer', 'Actelion', 'Bosentan anhydrous', 'Ro 47-0203')",Medical,"Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is a pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company established in December 1997, headquartered in Allschwil near Basel, Switzerland. The company is part of Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine business segment. Actelion focuses on the manufacture of drugs that treat rare and orphan diseases. Some of the drugs it has produced have been used to treat patients with symptoms related to central nervous system disorders, irregular heart conditions, immune system disorders, and cancer. One of the focuses of Actelion is treating individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a heart condition that leaves patients with a short life expectancy (7–9 years) even with treatment. Actelion scientists were among the first to work in the field of endothelin receptor antagonists. Actelion was initially financed with venture capital provided through a syndicate including Atlas Venture, Sofinnova and HealthCap. Actelion develops and sells drugs in the continents of Asia, Europe, and North and South America. Actelion has 29 operative affiliates globally, including in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, Switzerland, and several EU countries. The Swiss affiliate is located in Baden, the German affiliate in Freiburg, the Austrian one in Vienna, the French one in Paris and the UK affiliate is located in London. In 2006, the company established the Actelion Endothelin Research Award program which supports selected clinical research projects. In January 2017, Johnson & Johnson announced it would purchase the company for $30 billion. Actelion's research and development unit would also be spun off after the acquisition. The new company Idorsia was created from former Actelion drug discovery operations and early-stage clinical development assets and listed in June 2017 on the SIX Swiss Exchange. In 2018, Johnson & Johnson announced they would discontinue the development of one of the phase III drugs it acquired during its purchase of Actelion. == History == Actelion was founded in 1997 by husband and wife team Jean-Paul and Martine Clozel together with three colleagues after F. Hoffmann-La Roche cut their funding for Martine's cardiovascular program. They founded Actelion to work on a drugs for rare diseases and retained the rights to the intellectual property from Roche, including the molecule leading to the development of Tracleer, a drug for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) which became a billion dollar seller. == Acquisitions == === CoTherix === CoTherix was a biopharmaceutical company located in South San Francisco, California. CoTherix focused on licensing, developing, and commercializing therapeutic products for the treatment of cardiopulmonary and other chronic diseases. The company, formerly known as Exhale Therapeutics, Inc., was founded in February 2000 by Gerard Turino, MD, a past president of the American Thoracic Society, and Jerome Cantor, MD, a pulmonary pathologist. CoTherix's commercial product was ""Ventavis (Iloprost)"", an inhaled therapy for pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in December 2004, two months after the company's initial public offering of 5 million shares of common stock. Fasudil, Tracleer, Asahi and Actelion Asahi developed fasudil and entered into a licensing and development agreement with CoTherix in July 2006 to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization in the United States and Europe based on their prior track record in this area. In November 2006, CoTherix and Actelion signed a merger plan, which was subsequently announced publicly; this followed the initiation of negotiations in August 2006. In January 2007, Actelion completed acquisition of all CoTherix stock, and summarily informed Asahi that work on fasudil would be terminated. Now, Actelion had a competitor blockbuster drug on the market, bosentan (Tracleer). Asashi claimed that Actelion's acquisition of CoTherix was directly aimed at removing fasudil as a competitor therapeutic, which it effectively did. Asahi pursued damages against CoTherix and Actelion initially through arbitration of a breach of contract claim, which netted them US$91 million, then in a jury trial, which resulted in an award of US$580 million in compensatory and punitive damages. This case has served as an exemplar of the notion that a company's contractual obligations persist after that company's acquisition. On 20 November 2006, CoTherix agreed to be purchased for $420 million in cash by Actelion of Basel, Switzerland. On 9 January 2007, the deal closed with Actelion paying $13.50 for each share of CoTherix stock. == Revenues == Actelion, headquartered in Switzerland, managed to earn 18.2% more in the year of 2016 than it did in 2015 while reporting an earning of 2,417.9 million Swiss Francs at the end of 2016. After accounting for all costs of production such as raw materials and wages, the company calculated its operating margin (operating profit to net sales ratio) to be 0.5% more in 2016 than it was in 2015. == 'Kickbacks' Scandal == Tracleer was one of the main drugs manufactured and sold by Actelion. It has been used to treat excessively high blood pressure that affect arteries in the lungs and heart. In the years of 2014 and 2015, before Johnson & Johnson acquired the pharmaceutical company, Actelion was accused of pushing up the prices of Tracleer. According to a website known as Goodrx, sixty tablets (one month's supply) of this drug are sold for an average of $14,500. Actelion was able to do this by illegally providing money to Medicare patients in order for them to be able to fulfill their co-payments for the drug Tracleer. Medicare is a healthcare program for adults who are 65 years and older. Most patients have their prescriptions covered by Medicare, but they must still pay a portion of the amount of the prescription, known as a co-payment. By making sure Medicare patients are still paying a certain amount, drug companies are unable to raise their prices to inordinately large amounts. However recently many large drug companies, such as Pfizer, Lundbeck, United Therapeutics and now Actelion have been found to be illegally providing cash assistance to charities that help patients with their co-payments in order to increase the demand for their products. Actelion was able to use the charity organization by the name of Caring Voice Coalition to send money only to those people who were receiving prescriptions of Tracleer. When law enforcement was able to catch onto the illegal activities occurring with this organization with relation to two pharmaceutical companies (Actelion and United Therapeutics), it was banned from partaking in any further Medicare related matters. By ignoring the laws and regulations set by Congress, to prevent pharmaceutical companies from increasing the demand and prices of their drugs, and using information obtained from Caring Voice Coalition to financially support patients who were buying only its own drugs, Actelion was able to increase its drug prices to extraordinarily high amounts (nearly 30% of the inflation rate). Actelion was also complicit in referring patients to Caring Voice Coalition. Many unknowing patients who were gathering information about organizations that might cover their medical needs were being sent to CVC. Illegally, furthering the high demand for their drug. While investigations were taking place, Actelion refused to accept that any criminal activity or misconduct had occurred. It has been forced to pay a $360 million as a settlement to the United States government for the malpractice relating to kickbacks to Medicare patients. == Other Lawsuits == As of October, 2018, it was also caught in two lawsuit by drug buyers who claimed that Actelion was preventing a generic version of Tracleer to be manufactured so that it could stay in charge of the market as the sole supplier of the drug. == Collaborating with Analytics 4 Life == Analytics 4 Life is a company that uses artificial intelligence to develop solutions for medical illnesses while focusing its efforts on coronary artery disease. Actelion has been reported to start working with Analytics 4 Life to use imaging technology with regards to pulmonary hypertension. A study, involving 500 individuals is being conducted to solve this widespread illness. These companies are hoping to be able to accurately assess an individual's cardiac health using imaging technology and thus avoiding the need for an invasive test. Actelion hopes that using this technology will help detect pulmonary hypertension in more people at an earlier age and thus leading to higher chances of success in the treatment. == Medicines == Actelion currently has 10 compounds in its pipeline – including 3 in late-stage development – and 4 medicines on the market for orphan diseases: Tracleer (bosentan): Tracleer is one of Actelions best sellers and provides the most income to the company. Tracleer was the first oral treatment approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare, chronic, life-threatening disorder that severely compromises the functions of the lungs and heart. It is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, see also: Endothelin receptor antagonist. Zavesca (miglustat): is currently the only approved oral treatment for patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is unsuitable. Type 1 Gaucher disease is a rare and debilitating metabolic disorder. Ventavis (iloprost): Ventavis is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group 1) in patients with NYHA Class III or IV symptoms. Veletri (epoprostenol for injection): is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the long-term intravenous treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with the scleroderma spectrum of disease in NYHA Class III and Class IV patients who do not respond adequately to conventional therapy. Some other drugs that have been produced by Actelion's to provide for the PAH (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension) market include: Opsumit (Macitentan): Actelion received approval from the FDA for the manufacture of this drug on 16 January 2019. Opsumit has been manufactured to treat patients with CTEPH (Inoperable Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension) in order to enhance their ability to exercise and boost their PVR (Pulmonary Vascular Resistance). It is an oral medication for ERA (Endothelin Receptor Antagonist) that has been used to slow down the prohibit the advancement of diseases and PAH. Actelion received approval for the manufacture of this drug by the FDA. Opsumit provides Actelion with its second largest source of sales. This product is available in Germany, Switzerland, Canada and Australia and the U.S. 15 March 2019, Actelion reported that while evaluating the effects of this drug on patient with PAH, it found a remarkable improvement in the right ventricle and reduced PVR (Pulmonary Vascular Resistance). Uptravi (Selexipag): Uptravi was originally it was developed by Nippon Shinyaku to treat people suffering from Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. It is used to treat people suffering from PAH along with an advanced form of functional limitation. Uptravi is an oral medication that should be used along with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, an ERA(endothelin receptor antagonist) or with both for maximum effectiveness. Uptravi's popularity in the PAH market has made it the third most sold drug among all of Actelion's total sales. Actelion received approval from the Swiss medic for the manufacture and sale of this drug on 16 August 2016. Valchlor (mechlorethamine): In 2013, Actelion announced that Valchlor could be purchased in the United States. Valchlor is an FDA approved formula drug that can be applied topically every day. It is a gel that can be used to treat IA and IB mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (rate type of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma). It has afflicted around 20,000 U.S. citizens and therefore classifies as an orphan disease. === Pipeline === Late-stage drugs in development by Actelion include: Cadazolid for Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea Macitentan for pediatric PAH and portopulmonary hypertension == Key figures == By January 2011, Actelion had 2,467 employees, 392 in research, 640 in development, and 1017 in sales and marketing.

1649,"('Belumosudil', 'Slx-2119', 'Slx 2119', 'Slx2119', 'Rezurock')",Medical,"Belumosudil, sold under the brand name Rezurock among others, is a medication used for the treatment of chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD). It is in the class of drugs known as serine/threonine kinase inhibitors. Specifically, it is an inhibitor of Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (ROCK2; ROCK-II). ROCK2-mediated signaling pathways are major players in pro- and anti-inflammatory immune cell responses. A study in cultured human cells demonstrated that the drug also has effects on oxidative phosphorylation, WNT signaling, angiogenesis, and KRAS signaling. The most common side effects include infection, tiredness or weakness, nausea, diarrhea, shortness of breath, cough, swelling, bleeding, stomach (abdominal) pain, muscle or bone pain, headache, and high blood pressure. Belumosudil was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2021. The US Food and Drug Administration considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Belumosudil is indicated for the treatment of people aged twelve years and older with chronic graft-versus-host disease (chronic GVHD) after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. Chronic graft-versus-host disease is a complication that can occur after stem cell or bone marrow transplantation in which the transplanted donor cells attack the transplant recipient's body. == History == Originally developed by Surface Logix, Inc, belumosudil was later acquired by Kadmon Corporation. By July 2020, the drug completed Phase II clinical studies for cGvHD, IPF, and psoriasis. Chronic graft-versus-host disease is a complication that can follow allogeneic stem cell or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation where the transplanted cells (graft) attack healthy cells (host). This causes inflammation and fibrosis in multiple tissues. Two cytokines controlled by the ROCK2 signaling pathway, IL-17 and IL-21, have a major role in the chronic graft-versus-host disease response. In a 2016 report using both mouse models and a limited human clinical trial ROCK2 inhibition with belumosudil targeted both the immunologic and fibrotic components of chronic graft-versus-host disease and reversed the symptoms of the disease. In October 2017, belumosudil was granted orphan drug status in the United States for treatment of people with chronic graft-versus-host disease. Efficacy of belumosudil was evaluated in clinical trial NCT03640481, a randomized, open-label, multicenter dose-ranging trial that included 65 patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease who were treated with belumosudil 200 mg taken orally once daily. A total of eighty-three (83) participants were evaluated for safety; therefore, the number of participants representing efficacy findings may differ from the number of participants representing safety findings due to different pools of study participants analyzed for efficacy and safety. The trial was conducted at 28 sites in the United States. On 16 July 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved belumosudil for people aged twelve years and older with chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. == Research == Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic disease where the lining of the lungs become thickened and scarred. Increased ROCK activity has been found in the lungs of humans and animals with IPF. Treatment with belumosudil reduced lung fibrosis in a bleomycin mouse model study. Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin condition where patients experiences eruptions and remissions of thickened, erythematous, and scaly patches of skin. Down-regulation of pro-inflammatory responses was observed with KD025 (belumosudil) treatment in Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. == References ==",Rezurock,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3589766240329482e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00017534149810671806)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.accesswire.com/655903/us-fda-grants-full-approval-of-rezurock-tm-belumosudil-for-the-treatment-of-patients-with-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease-cgvhd,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belumosudil,https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/rezurock ', [])"

1651,"('Pimobendan', 'Ud-cg115', 'Pimobendane', 'Acardi', 'Vetmedin')",Medical,"Pimobendan (INN, or pimobendane), sold under the brand name Vetmedin among others, is a veterinary medication. It is a calcium sensitizer and a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) with positive inotropic and vasodilator effects. Pimobendan is used in the management of heart failure in dogs, most commonly caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease (also previously known as endocardiosis), or dilated cardiomyopathy. Research has shown that as a monotherapy, pimobendan increases survival time and improves quality of life in canine patients with congestive heart failure secondary to mitral valve disease when compared with benazepril, an ACE inhibitor. Under the brand name Acardi, it is available for human use in Japan. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Pimobendan is indicated for the management of the signs of mild, moderate, or severe congestive heart failure in dogs due to clinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM); and for use with concurrent therapy for congestive heart failure (e.g.,furosemide, etc.) as appropriate on a case-by-case basis. It is also indicated for the delay of onset of congestive heart failure in dogs with Stage B2 preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (2019 ACVIM consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of myxomatous mitral valve disease in dogs). == Mechanism of action == Pimobendan is a positive inotrope, and its main function is to increase myocardial contractility. It sensitizes and increases the binding efficiency of cardiac troponin in the myofibril to the calcium ions that are already present in systole. In normal hearts it increases the consumption of oxygen and energy to the same degree as dobutamine but in diseased hearts it may not. Pimobendan also causes peripheral vasodilation by inhibiting the function of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). This results in decreased resistance to blood flow through systemic arterioles, which decreases afterload (decreases the failing heart's workload) and reduces the amount of mitral regurgitation. == Pharmacokinetics == Pimobendan is absorbed rapidly when given via the oral route and has a bioavailability of 60–65%. Food decreases the bioavailability of the aqueous solution although the effect on the tablet form is unknown. It is metabolized into an active metabolite (desmethylpimobendan) by the liver. The parent compound, pimobendan, is a potent calcium sensitizer while desmethylpimobendan is a more potent phosphodiesterase III inhibitor. The half-life of pimobendan in the blood is 0.4 hours, and the half-life of its metabolite is two hours. Elimination is by excretion in the bile and then feces. Pimobendan is 90–95% bound to plasma proteins in circulation. This may have implications in patients with low blood protein levels (hypoproteinemia/hypoalbuminemia) and in patients that are on concurrent therapies that are also highly protein bound. == Combinations == Pimobendan is often used in combination with three other drugs to palliate dogs with heart failure (pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, ascites). These are: Furosemide, a diuretic, to reduce edema and effusion. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist. This has two actions, firstly, as a potassium-sparing diuretic, although its diuretic properties are small compared with those of furosemide. Secondly, it reduces aldosterone-mediated myocardial fibrosis, possibly slowing the progression of heart disease. An ACE inhibitor, often enalapril (brand name Enacard) or benazepril (Fortekor). These drugs inhibit the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme, producing a balanced vasodilation, along with other potentially favorable effects. == Synthesis == The reaction between p-anisoyl chloride [100-07-2] (1) and CID:20516917 (2) gives 4-[4-[(4-Methoxybenzoyl)amino]-3-nitrophenyl]-3-methyl-4-oxobutanoic acid, CID:20516902 (3). The reaction of this with hydrazine gives 5-methyl-6-[3-nitro-4-(4-methoxy-benzoylamino)-phenyl]-3-oxo-4,5-dihydro-2H-pyridazine [74149-73-8]. Catalytic hydrogenation reduces the nitro group giving [74149-74-9] (4). cyclization of the resulting ortho amino amide by means of a strong acid leads to the formation of the corresponding benzimidazole. There is thus obtained pimobendan (5). == References == == Further reading == Lee JA, Allen DG (March 1990). ""Calcium sensitisers"". BMJ. 300 (6724): 551–2. doi:10.1136/bmj.300.6724.551.

In molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, a new sampling scheme was introduced to provide enough samples for both solute and solvent molecules to obtain the average physical properties of the molecules in solution. We sampled the structure of the solute and solvent molecules separately. First, we executed a QM∕MM MD simulation, where we sampled the solute molecule in solution. Next, we chose random solute structures from this simulation and performed classical MD simulation for each chosen solute structure with its geometry fixed. This new scheme allowed us to sample the solute molecule quantum mechanically and sample many solvent structures classically. Excitation energy calculations using the selected samples were carried out by the generalized multiconfigurational perturbation theory. We succeeded in constructing the absorption spectra and realizing the red shift of the absorption spectra found in polar solvents. To understand the motion of C120 in water, we carried out principal component analysis and found that the motion of the methyl group made the largest contribution and the motion of the amino group the second largest. The solvent effect on the absorption spectrum was studied by decomposing it in two components: the effect from the distortion of the solute molecule and the field effect from the solvent molecules. The solvent effect from the solvent molecules shows large contribution to the solvent shift of the peak of the absorption spectrum, while the solvent effect from the solute molecule shows no contribution. The solvent effect from the solute molecule mainly contributes to the broadening of the absorption spectrum. In the solvent effect, the variation in C-C bond length has the largest contribution on the absorption spectrum from the solute molecule. For the solvent effect on the absorption spectrum from the solvent molecules, the solvent structure around the amino group of C120 plays the key role.

The in vitro efficacy of tefinostat was characterised in cell lines and in a cohort of 73 primary AML and CMML samples. Dose-dependent induction of apoptosis and significant growth inhibitory effects were seen in myelomonocytic (M4), monocytic/monoblastic (M5) and CMML samples in comparison to non-monocytoid AML sub-types (p = 0.007). Importantly, no growth inhibitory effects were seen in normal bone marrow CD34+ cells exposed to AML-toxic doses of tefinostat in clonogenic assays. Expression of hCE-1 was measured by intracellular flow cytometry and immunoblotting across the cohort, with highest levels seen in M5 AML patients. hCE-1 levels correlated with significantly increased tefinostat sensitivity (low EC50) as measured by growth inhibition assays (p = 0.001) and concomitant elevation of the mature monocytoid marker CD14+. Strong induction of intracellular histone protein acetylation was observed in tefinostat-responsive samples, as were high levels of the DNA damage sensor γ-H2A.X, highlighting potential biomarkers of patient responsiveness. Synergistic interaction between tefinostat and the current standard treatment cytarabine was demonstrated in dose response and clonogenic assays using simultaneous drug addition in primary samples (median Combination Index value = 0.51). These data provide a strong rationale for the further clinical evaluation of tefinostat in monocytoid-lineage haematological neoplasms including CMML and monocyte-lineage AMLs. Tefinostat (CHR-2845) is a monocyte/macrophage targeted histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). This first-in-human, standard 3 + 3 dose escalating trial of oral, once daily tefinostat was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of tefinostat in relapsed/refractory haematological diseases. Eighteen patients were enrolled at doses of 20-640 mg. Plasma concentrations of tefinostat exceeded those demonstrated to give in vitro anti-proliferative activity. Flow cytometric pharmacodynamic assays demonstrated monocyte-targeted increases in protein acetylation, without corresponding changes in lymphocytes. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were not observed and dose escalation was halted at 640 mg without identification of the maximum tolerated dose. Drug-related toxicities were largely Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1/2 and included nausea, anorexia, fatigue, constipation, rash and increased blood creatinine. A patient with chronic monomyelocytic leukaemia achieved a bone marrow response, with no change in peripheral monocytes. An acute myeloid leukaemia type M2 patient showed a >50% decrease in bone marrow blasts and clearance of peripheral blasts. In conclusion, tefinostat produces monocyte-targeted HDACi activity and is well tolerated, without the DLTs, e.g. fatigue, diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia, commonly seen with non-targeted HDACi.

1657,"('Mercaptopurine',)",Medical,"Mercaptopurine (6-MP), sold under the brand name Purinethol among others, is a medication used for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Specifically it is used to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. For acute lymphocytic leukemia it is generally used with methotrexate. It is taken orally. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, liver toxicity, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other serious side effects include an increased risk of future cancer and pancreatitis. Those with a genetic deficiency in thiopurine S-methyltransferase are at higher risk of side effects. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. Mercaptopurine is in the thiopurine and antimetabolite family of medications. Mercaptopurine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == It is used to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. == Side effects == Some of the adverse reactions of taking mercaptopurine may include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, stomach/abdominal pain, weakness, skin rash, darkening of the skin, and hair loss. Serious adverse reactions include mouth sores, fever, sore throat, easy bruising or bleeding, pinpoint red spots on the skin, yellowing of eyes or skin, dark urine, and painful or difficult urination. Other more serious side effects include black or tarry stools (melena), bloody stools, and bloody urine. Treatment is discontinued in up to 30% of patients due these effects but therapeutic drug monitoring of the biologically active metabolites, i.e. thiopurine nucleotides can help to optimize the efficacy and safety. Clinically, most hospitals resort to on-exchange LC-MS (liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry) but the newly developed approach of porous graphitic carbon based chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry appears superior with respect to patient care in this respect. Symptoms of allergic reaction to mercaptopurine include rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing, and inflammation of the pancreas. In some cases, mercaptopurine may suppress the production of blood cells, both white blood cells and red blood cells. It may be toxic to bone marrow. Quarterly blood counts are necessary for people on mercaptopurine. People should stop taking the medication at least temporarily while considering alternate treatment if there is an unexplained, abnormally large drop in white blood cell count, or any other blood count. Toxicity of mercaptopurine can be linked to genetic polymorphisms in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15), and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA). People with specific allele variants will require dose adjustments, especially for those with homozygous variant genotypes. Large differences of TPMT and NUDT15 among ethnicities in terms of variant allele frequency should be taken into consideration in clinical practice. Caucasian people with a variant allele of the ITPA gene, experience higher rates of febrile neuropenia than people of other ethnic groups, due to differences in allelic frequencies among ethnicities. === Precautions === Mercaptopurine can lower the body's ability to fight off infection. Those taking it should get permission from a doctor to receive immunizations and vaccinations. It is also recommended that, while on the drug, one should avoid those having recently received oral polio vaccine. This drug was formerly not recommended during pregnancy and early evidence indicated pregnant women on the drug (or the related azathioprine) showed a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. There were also anecdotal reports linking mercaptopurine with spontaneous abortion, leading to the US FDA rating both AZA and mercaptopurine as category D drugs. However, Davis et al. 1999 found mercaptopurine, compared to methotrexate, was ineffective as a single-agent abortifacient; every woman in the mercaptopurine arm of the study had fetal cardiac activity at follow-up (two weeks later) and was given a suction abortion. A more recent, larger study, however, performed by the Cancers et Surrisque Associe aux Maladies inflamatoires intestinales En France (CESAME) indicated an overall rate of congenital malformations not significantly greater than the general population in France. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) concluded in a consensus paper in 2010 that while AZA and mercaptopurine have an FDA rating of D, new research in both animals and humans indicates that ""thiopurines are safe and well tolerated during pregnancy."" Mercaptopurine causes changes to chromosomes in animals and humans, though a study in 1990 found, ""while the carcinogenic potential of 6-MP cannot be precluded, it can be only very weak or marginal."" Another study in 1999 noted an increased risk of developing leukemia when taking large doses of 6-MP with other cytotoxic drugs. == Drug interactions == Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that breaks down mercaptopurine. Those taking allopurinol (often used to prevent gout) are at risk for mercaptopurine toxicity. The dose should be reduced or allopurinol should be discontinued. Several published studies have demonstrated that the use of allopurinol in combination with low dose 6-MP helps reduce 6-MP levels, which are toxic to liver tissue, whilst increasing the therapeutic levels of 6-MP for some inflammatory conditions. == Mechanisms of action == Official information from the package insert for purinethol: Mercaptopurine is an antimetabolite antineoplastic; as such it interferes with normal metabolic processes within cells, typically by combining with enzymes, to disrupt DNA and RNA synthesis (cell-cycle S phase-specific) leading to death of rapidly proliferating cells, especially malignant ones. Specifically, Mercaptopurine is a purine antimetabolite or purine antagonist and as such inhibits DNA synthesis by inhibiting the production of the purine containing nucleotides, adenine and guanine, thus halting DNA synthesis. Mercaptopurine also acts as an immunomodulator by inhibiting several pathways in nucleic acid biosynthesis preventing proliferation of cells involved in the determination and amplification of the immune response. Mercaptopurine (6-MP) competes with the purine derivatives hypoxanthine and guanine for the enzyme HGPRT and is itself converted to thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP). TIMP inhibits several chemical reactions involving inosinic acid (IMP), including the conversion of IMP to xanthylic acid (XMP) and the conversion of IMP to adenylic acid (AMP) via adenylosuccinate (SAMP). In addition, 6-methylthioinosinate (MTIMP) is formed by the methylation of TIMP. Both TIMP and MTIMP have been reported to inhibit glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway for purine ribonucleotide synthesis. Experiments indicate that radiolabeled mercaptopurine may be recovered from the DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine. Some mercaptopurine is converted to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) by the sequential actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase, converting TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP). Animal tumors that are resistant to mercaptopurine often have lost the ability to convert mercaptopurine to TIMP. However, it is clear that resistance to mercaptopurine may be acquired by other means as well, particularly in human leukemias. It is not known exactly which of any one or more of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death. 6-MP ribonucleotide inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis and metabolism by inhibiting an enzyme called phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PRPP amidotransferase). Since this enzyme is the rate limiting factor for purine synthesis, this alters the synthesis and function of RNA and DNA. Mercaptopurine interferes with nucleotide interconversion and glycoprotein synthesis. === Pharmacogenetics === The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible, in part, for the inactivation of 6-mercaptopurine. TPMT catalyzes the methylation of 6-mercaptopurine into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine – this methylation prevents mercaptopurine from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and an increased risk of severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving mercaptopurine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of people are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify people with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of mercaptopurine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for mercaptopurine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify people at risk for myelotoxicity. Testing for TPMT activity is an example of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care. == History == 6-MP was discovered by Nobel Prize–winning scientists Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings at Burroughs Wellcome in Tuckahoe, New York, and was clinically developed in collaboration with investigators at Memorial Hospital (now Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City). The collaboration was initiated by Cornelius P. Rhoads, who had run chemical weapons programs for the US Army and had been involved in the work that led to the discovery that nitrogen mustards could potentially be used as cancer drugs, and had become the director of Memorial in 1948. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2012).

1658,"('Geraniol', 'Lemonol', 'Geranyl alcohol', 'Trans-geraniol', '(e)-geraniol')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Geraniol is a monoterpenoid and an alcohol. It is the primary component of citronella oil and is a primary component of rose oil and palmarosa oil. It is a colorless oil, although commercial samples can appear yellow. It has low solubility in water, but it is soluble in common organic solvents. The functional group derived from geraniol (in essence, geraniol lacking the terminal −OH) is called geranyl. == Uses and occurrence == In addition to being found in rose oil, palmarosa oil, and citronella oil, it also occurs in small quantities in geranium, lemon, and many other essential oils. With a rose-like scent, it is commonly used in perfumes and in scents such as peach, raspberry, grapefruit, red apple, plum, lime, orange, lemon, watermelon, pineapple, and blueberry. Geraniol is produced by the scent glands of honeybees to mark nectar-bearing flowers and locate the entrances to their hives. It is also commonly used as an insect repellent, especially for mosquitoes. The scent of geraniol is reminiscent of, but chemically unrelated to, 2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene, also known as geranium taint, a wine fault resulting from fermentation of sorbic acid by lactic acid bacteria. Geranyl pyrophosphate is important in biosynthesis of other terpenes such as myrcene and ocimene. It is also used in the biosynthesis pathway of many cannabinoids in the form of CBGA. == Reactions == In acidic solutions, geraniol is converted to the cyclic terpene α-terpineol. The alcohol group undergoes expected reactions. It can be converted to the tosylate, which is a precursor to the chloride. Geranyl chloride also arises by the Appel reaction by treating geraniol with triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride. It can be oxidized to the aldehyde geranial. Hydrogenation of the two C=C bonds over a nickel catalyst gives tetrahydrogeraniol. == Health and safety == Geraniol is classified as D2B (Toxic materials causing other effects) using the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS). == History == Geraniol was first isolated in pure form in 1871 by the German chemist Oscar Jacobsen (1840–1889). Using distillation, Jacobsen obtained geraniol from an essential oil produced in India which was obtained from the so-called geranium grass. This essence, after which the compound was named, was a 50% cheaper substitute for the essence of the proper geranium flower with a similar, although less delicate, odor. The chemical structure of geraniol was determined in 1919 by the French chemist Albert Verley (1867–1959). == See also == Citronellol Citral Nerol Rhodinol Geranyl pyrophosphate Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate Linalool 8-Hydroxygeraniol Geraniol 8-hydroxylase Bergamottin Perfume allergy == References == == External links == Geraniol MS Spectrum Geraniol properties, animations, links",Geraniol,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.015187017619609833), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' PERSONAL', -8.697387966094539e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('P', -0.5726193189620972), ('ERSON', 0.0), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ĠCARE', -0.00016056202002801), (',', -0.0004349001101218164), ('ĠFOOD', -0.048834167420864105), (',', -0.4741237163543701), ('ĠINDU', -0.018164243549108505), ('ST', -3.540453326422721e-05), ('RI', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023322314023971558)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -5.836499985889532e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -7.505351095460355e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraniol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=21, title='Geraniol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraniol?utm_source=openai')])"

Merr. We previously found that SMI significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in Aβ-intoxicated SH-SY5Y cells. In this study, we performed behavioral tests to analyze cognitive function of WT and APP/PS1 mice treated with or without SMI, and found that SMI could significantly improve the learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, immunofluorescence and ELISA results showed that SMI pretreatment could effectively reduce the deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (26 mg/kg/day for 60 days) and inhibit the secretion of Aβ1-42 in N2a/APPswe cells (10 μM concentration for 24 hours). Mechanistically, SMI enhanced BDNF mRNA expression, elevated the global level of H3AC and H4AC, and increased the expression of P300 in AD models. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation results showed that SMI could increase the levels of H3AC and H4AC at the promoter of BDNF promoter Ⅱ and Ⅳ, indicating that SMI epigenetically regulates BDNF expression through HAT enhancement. To further verify the critical role of P300 by which SMI upregulated histone acetylation in BDNF, AD mice were treated with SMI and C646 simultaneously. Behavioral experiments showed that the improvement effects of SMI on cognitive impairment were abolished after P300 inhibition in APP/PS1 mice. Our research for the first time demonstrated that SMI showed neuroprotective effects by increasing the expression of P300 protein, thus upregulating histone acetylation levels in the promoter region of BDNF and promoting its transcription. Our findings provide an important theoretical basis for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with SMI extracted from Asparagus cochinchinensis (Lour.) Merr. Studies indicated that smilagenin, isolated from Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, could improve cognitive impairment and exhibit neuroprotective activity. On the basis of the structure of smilagenin, a series of derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their neuroprotective effects of H Current therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) only offer limited symptomatic alleviation but fail to hamper the progress of the disease. Thus, it is imperative to establish new approaches aiming at protecting or reversing neurodegeneration in PD.

We reported for the first time that SMI significantly improved the locomotor ability of chronic MPTP/probenecid-lesioned mice. SMI increased the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive and Nissl positive neuron number in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), augmented striatal DA and its metabolites concentration and elevated striatal dopamine transporter density (DAT). In addition, dopamine receptor D2R not D1R was down-regulated by MPTP/probenecid and slightly raised by SMI prevention. What's more, we discovered that SMI markedly elevated striatal glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels in SMI prevented mice.

The aim of this study was to assess the Chk1 kinase inhibitor, MK-8776, for its ability to radiosensitize human tumor cells. Cells derived from NSCLC and HNSCC cancers were tested for radiosensitization by MK-8776. The ability of MK-8776 to abrogate the radiation-induced G2 block was determined using flow cytometry. Effects on repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were determined on the basis of rad51, γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci. Clonogenic survival analyses indicated that MK-8776 radiosensitized p53-defective tumor cells but not lines with wild-type p53. Abrogation of the G2 block was evident in both p53-defective cells and p53 wild-type lines indicating no correlation with radiosensitization. However, only p53-defective cells entered mitosis harboring unrepaired DSBs. MK-8776 appeared to inhibit repair of radiation-induced DSBs at early times after irradiation. A comparison of MK-8776 to the wee1 inhibitor, MK-1775, suggested both similarities and differences in their activities. In conclusion, MK-8776 radiosensitizes tumor cells by mechanisms that include abrogation of the G2 block and inhibition of DSB repair.

CC-115 is a novel antitumoral compound used in phase I clinical trials. However, it is unclear whether CC-115 is effective against lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In the present study, we found that CC-115 induced lytic cell death in A549 and H1650 tumor cells via swelling of cells and formation of large bubbles on the plasma membrane that closely resembled those typical of pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death linked to chemotherapy. We demonstrated that CC-115 exerts antitumor effects in LUAD through gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis by acting as a dual inhibitor of DNA-PK and mTOR. CC-115 can inhibit Akt phosphorylation, impairing its inhibitory effect on Bax, thereby inducing pyroptosis via the Bax-mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. CC-115-induced pyroptosis was abrogated by treatment with the Akt activator SC79 or by depletion of Bax. Importantly, CC-115 significantly upregulated the expression of Bax and GSDME-N in a xenograft mouse model, with a reduction in tumor size. Our results revealed that CC-115 suppresses tumor growth by inducing GSDME-mediated pyroptosis through the Akt/Bax-mitochondrial intrinsic pathway, indicating CC-115 as a promising therapeutic agent for LUAD. Molecularly-targeted agents are still urgently needed for better non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy. CC-115 is a potent DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) dual blocker. We evaluated its activity in different human NSCLC cells. In various primary human NSCLC cells and A549 cells, CC-115 potently inhibited viability, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and hindered cell migration/invasion. Apoptosis was provoked in CC-115-stimulated NSCLC cells. The dual inhibitor, however, was unable to induce significant cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity in the lung epithelial cells. In primary NSCLC cells, CC-115 blocked activation of mTORC1/2 and DNA-PK. Yet, CC-115-induced primary NSCLC cell death was more potent than combined inhibition of DNA-PK plus mTOR. Further studies found that CC-115 provoked robust oxidative injury in primary NSCLC cells, which appeared independent of mTOR-DNA-PK dual blockage. In vivo studies showed that CC-115 oral administration in nude mice remarkably suppressed primary NSCLC cell xenograft growth. In CC-115-treated NSCLC xenograft tissues, mTOR-DNA-PK dual inhibition and oxidative injury were detected. Together, CC-115 potently inhibits NSCLC cell growth. CC-115, a selective dual inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), is undergoing Phase 1 clinical studies. Here we report the characterization of DNA-PK inhibitory activity of CC-115 in cancer cell lines. CC-115 inhibits auto-phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) at the S2056 site (pDNA-PK S2056), leading to blockade of DNA-PK-mediated non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). CC-115 also indirectly reduces the phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) at S1981 and its substrates as well as homologous recombination (HR). The mTOR kinase and DNA-PK inhibitory activity of CC-115 leads to not only potent anti-tumor activity against a large panel of hematopoietic and solid cancer cell lines but also strong induction of apoptosis in a subset of cancer lines. Mechanistically, CC-115 prevents NHEJ by inhibiting the dissociation of DNA-PKcs, X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), and DNA ligase IV from DNA ends. CC-115 inhibits colony formation of ATM-deficient cells more potently than ATM-proficient cells, indicating that inhibition of DNA-PK is synthetically lethal with the loss of functional ATM. In conclusion, CC-115 inhibits both mTOR signaling and NHEJ and HR by direct inhibition of DNA-PK. The mechanistic data not only provide selection of potential pharmacodynamic (PD) markers but also support CC-115 clinical development in patients with ATM-deficient tumors.",Cc 115,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010418349120300263), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00524122454226017)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -3.531315314830863e-06)])","('MEDICAL; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31853198/ ', [])"
1666,"('Piracetam', 'Nootropil', 'Nootropyl', 'Pyracetam', 'Normabrain')",Medical,"Piracetam is a drug that has efficacy in cognitive disorders, vertigo, cortical myoclonus, dyslexia, and sickle cell anemia; sources differ on its usefulness for dementia. Piracetam is sold as a medication in many European countries. Sale of piracetam is not illegal in the United States, although it is not regulated nor approved by the FDA, so it is legally sold for research use only. Piracetam is in the racetams group, with chemical name 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide. It is a cyclic derivative of the neurotransmitter GABA and shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Related drugs include the anticonvulsants levetiracetam and brivaracetam, and the putative nootropics aniracetam and phenylpiracetam. == Efficacy == === Dementia === A 2001 Cochrane review concluded that there was not enough evidence to support piracetam for dementia or cognitive problems. A 2005 review found some evidence of benefit in older subjects with cognitive impairment. In 2008, a working group of the British Academy of Medical Sciences noted that many of the trials of piracetam for dementia were flawed. There is insufficient evidence of piracetam as a treatment for vascular dementia. === Depression and anxiety === Some sources suggest that piracetam's overall effect on lowering depression and anxiety is higher than on improving memory. However, depression is reported to be an occasional adverse effect of piracetam. === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) === Several clinical trials have looked at piracetam's efficacy as a treatment for ADHD. Many of these have found that the drug fails to deliver the same therapeutic effects as current standard treatments for the disorder. However, more than one study has found piracetam to be highly synergistic with standard ADHD therapies, accelerating and potentiating their therapeutic effects. One 2008 clinical trial found that the combination of piracetam and atomoxetine was more effective than atomoxetine alone. While piracetam may be an effective adjuvant therapy for ADHD (when used with specific medications), there is no evidence that it is effective when used in isolation. === Other === Piracetam may facilitate the deformability of erythrocytes in capillary which is useful for cardiovascular disease. Peripheral vascular effects of piracetam have suggested its use potential for vertigo, dyslexia, Raynaud's phenomenon and sickle cell anemia. There is no evidence to support piracetam's use in sickle cell crisis prevention or for fetal distress during childbirth. There is no evidence for benefit of piracetam with acute ischemic stroke, though there is debate as to its utility during stroke rehabilitation. === Anti-vasospasm === Piracetam has been found to diminish erythrocyte adhesion to vascular wall endothelium, making any vasospasm in the capillary less severe. This contributes to its efficacy in promoting microcirculation, including to the brain and kidneys. == Side effects == Symptoms including anxiety, insomnia, irritability, headache, agitation, tremor, and hyperkinesia are occasionally reported. Other reported side effects include somnolence, weight gain, clinical depression, weakness, increased libido, and hypersexuality. According to a 2005 review, piracetam has been observed to have the following side effects: hyperkinesia, weight gain, anxiety, somnolence, depression, and weakness. Piracetam reduces platelet aggregation as well as fibrinogen concentration, and thus is contraindicated to patients with cerebral hemorrhage. === Toxicity === The LD50 for oral consumption in humans has not been determined. The LD50 is 5.6 g/kg for rats and 20 g/kg for mice, indicating extremely low acute toxicity. For comparison, in rats the LD50 of vitamin C is 12 g/kg and the LD50 of table salt is 3 g/kg. == Mechanisms of action == Piracetam's mechanism of action, as with racetams in general, is not fully understood. The drug influences neuronal and vascular functions and influences cognitive function without acting as a sedative or stimulant. Piracetam is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor, although this action is very weak and its clinical effects may not necessarily be mediated by this action. It is hypothesized to act on ion channels or ion carriers, thus leading to increased neuron excitability. GABA brain metabolism and GABA receptors are not affected by piracetam Piracetam increases the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine via muscarinic cholinergic (ACh) receptors, which are implicated in memory processes. Furthermore, piracetam may have an effect on NMDA glutamate receptors, which are involved with learning and memory processes. Piracetam is thought to increase cell membrane permeability. Piracetam may exert its global effect on brain neurotransmission via modulation of ion channels (i.e., Na+, K+). It has been found to increase oxygen consumption in the brain, apparently in connection to ATP metabolism, and increases the activity of adenylate kinase in rat brains. Piracetam, while in the brain, appears to increase the synthesis of cytochrome b5, which is a part of the electron transport mechanism in mitochondria. But in the brain, it also increases the permeability of some intermediates of the Krebs cycle through the mitochondrial outer membrane. Piracetam inhibits N-type calcium channels. The concentration of piracetam achieved in central nervous system after a typical dose of 1200 mg (about 100 μM) is much higher than the concentration necessary to inhibit N-type calcium channels (IC50 of piracetam in rat neurons was 3 μM). == History == Piracetam was first made some time between the 1950s and 1964 by Corneliu E. Giurgea. There are reports of it being used for epilepsy in the 1950s. == Society and culture == In 2009 piracetam was reportedly popular as a cognitive enhancement drug among students. === Legal status === Piracetam is an uncontrolled substance in the United States, meaning it is legal to possess without a license or prescription. Use of piracetam in food, supplements, medical devices, insecticides, infant formula, cosmetics, animal feed, animal drugs, tobacco products, and drugs is unlawful and constitutes an act of misbranding. === Regulatory status === In the United States, piracetam is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Piracetam is not permitted in compounded drugs or dietary supplements in the United States. Like most research chemicals, it has been available over-the-counter, self-regulated, and third-party lab tested by many U.S. companies for decades. Nonetheless it is still, for the purposes of U.S. law, a ""New Drug"" as defined by 21 U.S. Code § 321(p)(1). In the United Kingdom, piracetam is approved as a prescription drug for adults with myoclonus of cortical origin, irrespective of cause, and should be used in combination with other anti-myoclonic therapies. In Japan, piracetam is approved as a prescription drug. In the Czech Republic, piracetam is available without prescription. Piracetam has no DIN in Canada, and thus cannot be sold, but can be imported for personal use in Canada. In Hungary, piracetam was a prescription-only medication, but as of 2020, no prescription is required and piracetam is available as an over-the-counter drug under the name Memoril Mite, and is available in 600 mg pills. == See also == AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator Aniracetam Brivaracetam—an analogue of piracetam with the same additional side chain as levetiracetam and a three–carbon chain. It exhibits greater antiepileptic properties than levetiracetam in animal models, but with a somewhat smaller, although still high, therapeutic range. Ergoloid Levetiracetam—an analogue of piracetam bearing an additional CH3–CH2– sidechain and bearing antiepileptic pharmacological properties through a poorly understood mechanism probably related to its affinity for the vesicle protein SV2A. Oxiracetam Phenylpiracetam—a phenylated analog of the drug piracetam which was developed in 1983 in Russia where it is available as a prescription drug.

1667,"('Fluorescein', 'Resorcinol phthalein', 'Solvent yellow 94', 'Yellow fluorescein', 'Resorcinolphthalein')",Medical,"Fluorescein is an organic compound and dye based on the xanthene tricyclic structural motif, formally belonging to triarylmethine dyes family. It is available as a dark orange/red powder slightly soluble in water and alcohol. It is used as a fluorescent tracer in many applications. The color of its aqueous solutions is green by reflection and orange by transmission (its spectral properties are dependent on pH of the solution), as can be noticed in bubble levels, for example, in which fluorescein is added as a colorant to the alcohol filling the tube in order to increase the visibility of the air bubble contained within. More concentrated solutions of fluorescein can even appear red (because under these conditions nearly all incident emission is re-absorbed by the solution). It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Uses == Fluorescein sodium, the sodium salt of fluorescein, is used extensively as a diagnostic tool in the field of ophthalmology and optometry, where topical fluorescein is used in the diagnosis of globe rupture, corneal abrasions, corneal ulcers and herpetic corneal infections. It is also used in rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting to evaluate the tear layer under the lens. It is available as sterile single-use sachets containing lint-free paper applicators soaked in fluorescein sodium solution. The thyroxine ester of fluorescein is used to quantify the thyroxine concentration in blood. Fluorescein is also known as a color additive (D&C Yellow no. 7). The disodium salt form of fluorescein is known as uranine or D&C Yellow no. 8. Fluorescein is a precursor to the red dye eosin Y by bromination. == Safety == Oral and intravenous use of fluorescein can cause adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, hives, acute hypotension, anaphylaxis and related anaphylactoid reaction, causing cardiac arrest and sudden death due to anaphylactic shock. Intravenous use has the most reported adverse reactions, including sudden death, but this may reflect greater use rather than greater risk. Both oral and topical uses have been reported to cause anaphylaxis, including one case of anaphylaxis with cardiac arrest (resuscitated) following topical use in an eye drop. Reported rates of adverse reactions vary from 1% to 6%. The higher rates may reflect study populations that include a higher percentage of persons with prior adverse reactions. The risk of an adverse reaction is 25 times higher if the person has had a prior adverse reaction. The risk can be reduced with prior (prophylactic) use of antihistamines and prompt emergency management of any ensuing anaphylaxis. A simple prick test may help to identify persons at greatest risk of adverse reaction. == Chemistry == The fluorescence of this molecule is very intense; peak excitation occurs at 495 nm and peak emission at 520 nm. Values for the deprotonated form in basic solution. Fluorescein has a pKa of 6.4, and its ionization equilibrium leads to pH-dependent absorption and emission over the range of 5 to 9. Also, the fluorescence lifetimes of the protonated and deprotonated forms of fluorescein are approximately 3 and 4 ns, which allows for pH determination from nonintensity based measurements. The lifetimes can be recovered using time-correlated single photon counting or phase-modulation fluorimetry. Upon exhaustive irradiation with visible light fluorescein decomposes to release phthalic and formic acids and carbon monoxide, effectively acting as a photoCORM. The remaining resorcinol rings react with singlet oxygen formed in situ to give oxidized, ring-opened products. Fluorescein has an isosbestic point (equal absorption for all pH values) at 460 nm. == Derivatives == Many derivatives of fluorescein are known. Examples are: fluorescein isothiocyanate 1, often abbreviated as FITC, features an isothiocyanate group (−N=C=S) substituent. FITC reacts with the amine groups of many biologically relevant compounds including intracellular proteins to form a thiourea linkage. succinimidyl ester modified fluorescein, i.e. NHS-fluorescein, is another common amine-reactive derivative, yielding amide adducts that are more stable than the aforementioned thioureas. Others: carboxyfluorescein, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester, Pentafluorophenyl esters (PFP), tetrafluorophenyl esters (TFP) are other useful reagents. In oligonucleotide synthesis, several phosphoramidite reagents containing protected fluorescein, e.g. 6-FAM phosphoramidite 2, are used for the preparation of fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides. The extent to which fluorescein dilaurate is broken down to yield lauric acid can be detected as a measure of pancreatic esterase activity. == Synthesis == Approximately 250 tons were produced in the year 2000. The method involves the fusion of phthalic anhydride and resorcinol, similar to the route described by Adolf von Baeyer in 1871. In some cases, acids such as zinc chloride and methanesulfonic acid are employed to accelerate the Friedel-Crafts reaction. == Research == Fluorescein is a fluorophore commonly used in microscopy, in a type of dye laser as the gain medium, in forensics and serology to detect latent blood stains, and in dye tracing. Fluorescein has an absorption maximum at 494 nm and emission maximum of 512 nm (in water). The major derivatives are fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and, in oligonucleotide synthesis, 6-FAM phosphoramidite. === Biosciences === In cellular biology, the isothiocyanate derivative of fluorescein is often used to label and track cells in fluorescence microscopy applications (for example, flow cytometry). Additional biologically active molecules (such as antibodies) may also be attached to fluorescein, allowing biologists to target the fluorophore to specific proteins or structures within cells. This application is common in yeast display. Fluorescein can also be conjugated to nucleoside triphosphates and incorporated into a probe enzymatically for in situ hybridisation. The use of fluorescein amidite, shown below right, allows one to synthesize labeled oligonucleotides for the same purpose. Yet another technique termed molecular beacons makes use of synthetic fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides. Fluorescein-labelled probes can be imaged using FISH, or targeted by antibodies using immunohistochemistry. The latter is a common alternative to digoxigenin, and the two are used together for labelling two genes in one sample. Intravenous or oral fluorescein is used in fluorescein angiography in research and to diagnose and categorize vascular disorders including retinal disease, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory intraocular conditions, and intraocular tumors. It is also being used increasingly during surgery for brain and spine tumors. Diluted fluorescein dye has been used to localise multiple muscular ventricular septal defects during open heart surgery and confirm the presence of any residual defects. === Earth sciences === Fluorescein is used as a rather conservative flow tracer in hydrological tracer tests to help in understanding of water flow of both surface waters and groundwater. The dye can also be added to rainwater in environmental testing simulations to aid in locating and analyzing any water leaks, and in Australia and New Zealand as a methylated spirit dye. As fluorescein solution changes its color depending on concentration, it has been used as a tracer in evaporation experiments. One of its more recognizable uses was in the Chicago River, where fluorescein was the first substance used to dye the river green on St. Patrick's Day in 1962. In 1966, environmentalists forced a change to a vegetable-based dye to protect local wildlife. Fluorescein dye solutions, typically 15% active, are commonly used as an aid to leak detection during hydrostatic testing of subsea oil and gas pipelines and other subsea infrastructure. Leaks can be detected by divers or ROVs carrying an ultraviolet light. === Plant science === Fluorescein has often been used to track water movement in groundwater to study water flow and observe areas of contamination or obstruction in these systems. The fluorescence that is created by the dye makes problem areas more visible and easily identified. A similar concept can be applied to plants because the dye can make problems in plant vasculature more visible. In plant science, fluorescein, and other fluorescent dyes, have been used to monitor and study plant vasculature, particularly the xylem, which is the main water transportation pathway in plants. This is because fluorescein is xylem-mobile and unable to cross plasma membranes, making it particularly useful in tracking water movement through the xylem. Fluorescein can be introduced to a plant's veins through the roots or a cut stem. The dye is able to be taken up into the plant the same way as water and moves from the roots to the top of the plant due to a transpirational pull. The fluorescein that has been taken up into the plant can be visualized under a fluorescent microscope. == See also == Chemical derivatives of fluorescein: Eosin, group of dibromo, or tetrabromo, derivatives of fluorescein Calcein, fluorescent dye and complexometric indicator Fluorescein amidite (FAM), synthetic equivalents of fluorescein used in oligonucleotide synthesis Merbromin, or mercurochrome, organomercuric antiseptic Erythrosine, tetraiodofluorescein Rose bengal, tetrachloro-tetraiodo-fluorescein used as stain in histology DyLight Fluor, a product line of fluorescent dyes Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, a biochemistry laboratory test Other dyes: Rhodamine, family of derivatives of xanthene used as dyes, indicators and fluorescent tracers Methylene blue, blue thiazine dye also used as a medication Haematoxylin, natural stain derived from hearthwood and used in histology Laser dyes Precursor aromatic heterocyclic chromophore structures: Phenothiazine, the chromophore structure in methylene blue Xanthene, aromatic heterocyclic structure present in fluorescein Xanthone Xanthydrol == References == == External links == Absorption and Emission Spectra of Fluorescein in Ethanol and Basic Ethanol at OGI School of Science and Engineering Fluorescein Ionization Equilibria at Invitrogen Absorption spectra and fluorescence emission spectra",Resorcinolphthalein,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.006207958795130253), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0002619318547658622), (' FOOD', -0.46493420004844666), (',', -0.00150390958879143), (' INDUSTR', -0.002494683489203453), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.4725859761238098), ('ICAL', -3.933898824470816e-06), (',', -0.0012432949151843786), ('ĠINDU', -0.03944370895624161), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.3589766240329482e-05), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.47507238388061523)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.25192907452583313)])","('INFO; https://www.britannica.com/technology/fluorescein ', [])"

1670,"('Methocarbamol', 'Robaxin', 'Lumirelax', 'Metocarbamol', 'Parabaxin')",Medical,"Methocarbamol, sold under the brand name Robaxin among others, is a medication used for short-term musculoskeletal pain. It may be used together with rest, physical therapy, and pain medication. It is less preferred in low back pain. It has limited use for rheumatoid arthritis and cerebral palsy. Effects generally begin within half an hour. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein. Common side effects include headaches, sleepiness, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, confusion, and seizures. Use is not recommended in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Because of the risk of injury, skeletal muscle relaxants should generally be avoided in geriatric patients. Methocarbamol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant. How it works is unclear, but it does not appear to affect muscles directly. Methocarbamol was developed in 1956 in the laboratories of A. H. Robins (later acquired by Pfizer). Studies were directed towards the development of propanediol derivatives which possessed muscle relaxant properties superior to those of mephenesin, which had low potency and a short duration of action. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1957. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 126th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. Methocarbamol is available in a fixed-dose combination with ibuprofen as methocarbamol/ibuprofen (sold under the brand name Summit Ultra). == Medical use == Methocarbamol is a muscle relaxant used to treat acute, painful musculoskeletal spasms in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. However, there is limited and inconsistent published research on the medication's efficacy and safety in treating musculoskeletal conditions, primarily neck and back pain. Methocarbamol injection may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular spasms of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the current treatment regimen. It is not useful in chronic neurological disorders, such as cerebral palsy or other dyskinesias. Currently, there is some suggestion that muscle relaxants may improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis; however, there is insufficient data to prove its effectiveness or to answer concerns regarding optimal dosing, choice of muscle relaxant, adverse effects, and functional status. === Comparison to similar agents === The clinical effectiveness of methocarbamol compared to other muscle relaxants is not well known. One trial of methocarbamol versus cyclobenzaprine, a well-studied muscle relaxant, in those with localized muscle spasm found there were no significant differences in their effects on muscle spasm, limitation of motion, or limitation of daily activities. == Contraindications == Contraindications for methocarbamol include: Hypersensitivity to methocarbamol or any of the injection components. For the injectable form, suspected kidney failure or renal pathology, due to large content of polyethylene glycol 300 that can increase pre-existing acidosis and urea retention. == Side effects == Methocarbamol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that has significant potential adverse effects, especially on the central nervous system. Potential side effects of methocarbamol include: Most commonly drowsiness, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and skin rash. Possible clumsiness (ataxia), upset stomach, flushing, mood changes, trouble urinating, itchiness, and fever. Both tachycardia (fast heart rate) and bradycardia (slow heart rate) have been reported. Hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylatic reactions are also reported. May cause respiratory depression when combined with benzodiazepines, barbiturates, codeine, or other muscle relaxants. May cause urine to turn black, blue, or green. While the product label states that methocarbamol can cause jaundice, there is minimal evidence to suggest that methocarbamol causes liver damage. During clinical trials of methocarbamol, there were no laboratory measurements of liver damage indicators, such as serum transaminase (AST/ALT) levels, to confirm hepatotoxicity. Although unlikely, it is impossible to rule out that methocarbamol may cause mild liver injury with use. === Elderly === Skeletal muscle relaxants are associated with an increased risk of injury among older adults. Methocarbamol appeared to be less sedating than other muscle relaxants, most notably cyclobenzaprine but had a similarly increased risk of injury. Methocarbamol is cited along with ""most muscle relaxants"" in the 2012 Beers Criteria as being ""poorly tolerated by older adults, because of anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, increased risk of fractures,"" noting that ""effectiveness dosages tolerated by older adults is questionable."" === Pregnancy === Methocarbamol is labeled by the FDA as a pregnancy category C medication. The teratogenic effects of the medication are not known and should be given to pregnant women only when indicated. === Overdose === There is limited information available on the acute toxicity of methocarbamol. Overdose is observed frequently in conjunction with CNS depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines and will have symptoms of nausea, drowsiness, blurred vision, hypotension, seizures, and coma. There are reported deaths with an overdose of methocarbamol alone or in the presence of other CNS depressants. === Abuse === Unlike other carbamates such as meprobamate and its prodrug carisoprodol, methocarbamol has greatly reduced abuse potential. Studies comparing it to the benzodiazepine lorazepam and the antihistamine diphenhydramine, along with placebo, find that methocarbamol produces increased ""liking"" responses and some sedative-like effects; however, at higher doses dysphoria is reported. It is considered to have an abuse profile similar to, but weaker than, lorazepam. == Interactions == Methocarbamol may inhibit the effects of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in those with myasthenia gravis taking anticholinesterase medications. Methocarbamol may disrupt certain screening tests as it can cause color interference in laboratory tests for 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and in urinary testing for vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The mechanism of action of methocarbamol has not currently been established. Its effect is thought to be localized to the central nervous system rather than a direct effect on skeletal muscles. It does not affect the motor end plate or the peripheral nerve fiber. The efficacy of the medication is likely related to its sedative effect. Alternatively, methocarbamol may act via inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, similarly to carbamate. === Pharmacokinetics === In healthy individuals, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg. The mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. The elimination half-life was longer in the elderly, those with kidney problems, and those with liver problems. === Metabolism === Methocarbamol is the carbamate derivative of guaifenesin, but does not produce guaifenesin as a metabolite, because the carbamate bond is not hydrolyzed metabolically; its metabolism is by Phase I ring hydroxylation and O-demethylation, followed by Phase II conjugation. All the major metabolites are unhydrolyzed carbamates. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol are also excreted in the urine. == Society and culture == Methocarbamol was approved as a muscle relaxant for acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in the United States in 1957. Muscle relaxants are widely used to treat low back pain, one of the most frequent health problems in industrialized countries. Currently, there are more than 3 million prescriptions filled yearly. Methocarbamol and orphenadrine are each used in more than 250,000 U.S. emergency department visits for lower back pain each year. In the United States, low back pain is the fifth most common reason for all physician visits and the second most common symptomatic reason. In 80% of primary care visits for low back pain, at least one medication was prescribed at the initial office visit and more than one third were prescribed two or more medications. The most commonly prescribed drugs for low back pain included skeletal muscle relaxants. Cyclobenzaprine and methocarbamol are on the U.S. Medicare formulary, which may account for the higher use of these products. === Economics === It is relatively inexpensive as of 2016. The generic formulation of the medication is relatively inexpensive, costing less than the alternative metaxalone in 2016. === Marketing === Methocarbamol without other ingredients is sold under the brand name Robaxin in the U.K., U.S., Canada and South Africa; it is marketed as Lumirelax in France, Ortoton in Germany and many other names worldwide. In combination with other active ingredients it is sold under other names: with acetaminophen (paracetamol), under trade names Robaxacet and Tylenol Body Pain Night; with ibuprofen as Robax Platinum; with acetylsalicylic acid as Robaxisal in the U.S. and Canada. However, in Spain the tradename Robaxisal is used for the paracetamol combination instead of Robaxacet. These combinations are also available from independent manufacturers under generic names. == Research == Although opioids are typically first-line treatments in severe pain, several trials suggest that methocarbamol may improve recovery and decrease hospital length of stay in those with muscle spasms associated with rib fractures. However, methocarbamol was less useful in the treatment of acute traumatic pain in general. Long-term studies evaluating the risk of development of cancer in using methocarbamol have not been performed. There are currently no studies evaluating the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or fertility. The safety and efficacy of methocarbamol have not been established in pediatric individuals below the age of 16 except in tetanus. == References ==",Parabaxin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.632542913896032e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000582644424866885), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007784912013448775)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1671,"('Acebutolol (hydrochloride)', 'Acebutolol', 'Acetobutolol', 'Neptal', 'Sectral')",Medical,"Acebutolol, sold under the brand names Sectral among others, is a beta blocker for the treatment of hypertension and arrhythmias. Acebutolol is a cardioselective beta-1 blocker and has intrinsic sympathetic activity. It is commonly used in the treatment of angina. It was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1973. == Medical uses == Hypertension Ventricular and atrial cardiac arrhythmia Acute myocardial infarction in high-risk patients Smith–Magenis syndrome == Contraindications == Stable or unstable angina (due to its partial agonist or ISA activity) == Side effects == The development of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) has been found in 10 to 30% of patients under treatment with acebutolol. A systemic disease with arthralgic pain and myalgias has been observed in 1%. A lupus erythematosus-like syndrome with skin rash and multiforme organ involvement is even less frequent. The incidence of both ANA and symptomatic disease under acebutolol is higher than under propranolol. Female patients are more likely to develop these symptoms than male patients. Some few cases of hepatotoxicity with increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST) have been seen. Altogether, 5 to 6% of all patients treated have to discontinue acebutolol due to intolerable side effects. When possible, the treatment should be discontinued gradually in order to avoid a withdrawal syndrome with increased frequency of angina and even precipitation of myocardial infarction. == Pharmacology == Acebutolol is a cardioselective beta-1 blocker which also considered a partial agonist due to its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). This means it provides low-grade beta stimulation at rest but acting as typical beta-blockers when sympathetic activity is high. Among other drugs in the beta-blocker class, Acebutolol will provide beta-blockade effects to a lesser extent. Due to its cardioselectivity, Acebutolol is more suitable than non-cardioselective beta-blockers, in a patient with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who needs treatment with a beta-blocker. This cardio-specificity will minimize the anti-hypertensive effects as seen with non-specific beta blockers such as Propanalol and Nadolol. (For these reasons, it may be a beta-blocker of choice in inclusion in Polypill strategies). In doses lower than 800 mg daily its constricting effects on the bronchial system and smooth muscle vessels are only 10% to 30% of those observed under propranolol treatment, but there is experimental evidence that the cardioselective properties diminish at doses of 800 mg/day or more. The drug has lipophilic properties and therefore crosses the blood–brain barrier. Acebutolol has no negative impact on serum lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides). No HDL decrease has been observed. In this regard, it is unlike many other beta-blockers which have this unfavourable property. The drug works in hypertensive patients with high, normal, or low renin plasma concentrations, although acebutolol may be more efficient in patients with high or normal renin plasma concentrations. In clinically relevant concentrations, a membrane-stabilizing effect does not appear to play an important role. == Pharmacokinetics == Acebutolol is well absorbed from the GI tract, but undergoes substantial first-pass-metabolization, leading to a bioavailability of only 35% to 50%. Peak plasma levels of acebutolol are reached within 2 to 2.5 hours after oral dosing. Peak levels of the main active metabolite, diacetolol, are reached after 4 hours. Acebutolol has a half-life of 3 to 4 hours, and diacetolol a half-life of 8 to 13 hours. Acebutolol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolization resulting in the desbutyl amine acetolol which is readily converted into diacetolol. Diacetolol is as active as acebutolol (equipotency) and appears to have the same pharmacologic profile. Geriatric patients tend to have higher peak plasma levels of both acebutolol and diacetolol and a slightly prolonged excretion. Excretion is substantially prolonged in patients with renal impairment, and so a dose reduction may be needed. Liver cirrhosis does not seem to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of the parent drug and metabolite. == References == == External links == AHFS Database",Sectral,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.745722592109814e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00035172473872080445)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/sectral.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=80, start_index=9, title='Sectral Uses, Side Effects & Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/mtm/sectral.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1672,"('Indole-3-propionic acid', 'Indolepropionic acid', 'Indolylpropionic acid', 'Beta-indolylpropionate', 'Oxigon')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","3-Indolepropionic acid (IPA), or indole-3-propionic acid, has been studied for its therapeutic value in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. As of 2022 IPA shows potential in the treatment of this disease, though the therapeutic effect of IPA depends on dose and time of therapy initiation. Though promising in some historical clinical trials, IPA is not clinically listed as a useful therapeutic in managing Alzheimer's as of 2023. IPA is an even more potent scavenger of hydroxyl radicals than melatonin, the most potent scavenger of hydroxyl radicals that is synthesized by human enzymes. Similar to melatonin but unlike other antioxidants, it scavenges radicals without subsequently generating reactive and pro-oxidant intermediate compounds. == Occurrence == === Biosynthesis in humans and cellular effects === This compound is endogenously produced by human microbiota and has only been detected in vivo when the species Clostridium sporogenes is present in the gastrointestinal tract. As of April 2016, C. sporogenes, which uses tryptophan to synthesize IPA, is the only species of bacteria known to synthesize IPA in vivo at levels which are subsequently detectable in the blood plasma of the host. C. sporogenes produces IPA via a two step process. Tryptophanse (TnaA) first converts tryptophan into indole. Tryptophan amino transferase (Tam1) then converts indole into IPA. Peptostreptococcus species with a full fldAIBC gene cluster convert tryptophan into IPA and 3-indoleacrylic acid (IA) in vitro and protects against colitis in mice. IA differs from IPA only by a double bond and both enhance IL-10 secretion after LPS stimulation. However, IA does not reduce TNF production after LPS stimulation. It also activates the NRF2 antioxidant pathway and induces the expression of AhR target genes, unlike IPA. === Biosynthesis by soil microbes === IPA is structurally similar to the phytohormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA). Plants may encounter the substance when soil bacteria that produces IPA is present (Clostridium is known to reside in soil). Like auxin, IPA increases the growth of lateral roots and root hairs. However, it seems to inhibit some auxin-related processes such as root gravitation, probably by interfering with the plant's own auxin signaling and/or transport. == Metabolism == IPA can be converted in the liver or kidneys to 3-indoleacrylic acid, which is subsequently conjugated with glycine, forming indolylacryloyl glycine. == History == The neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-amyloid properties of IPA were first reported in 1999. == Research == A study that assessed the effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics – specifically aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines – on the metabolome of rats found that only aminoglycosides reduced plasma concentrations of IPA in rats. In 2017, elevated concentrations of IPA in human blood plasma were found to be correlated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and higher consumption of fiber-rich foods. A separate study found that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery increases the amount of IPA and indole sulfuric acid (ISA) in obese T2D patients. IPA is active in vitro against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other Mycobacterium species. It works as an allosteric inhibitor of tryptophan biosynthesis. == See also == Indolepropionamide Life extension == References ==",Oxigon,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.026004046201705933), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00023083435371518135), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0485982745885849), (' FOOD', -0.010648652911186218)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.4986773133277893), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -8.821448318485636e-06), ('ĠEND', -0.002062933286651969), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.5760575532913208), ('ĠFOOD', -0.025916380807757378), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011185911484062672)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/103526,https://www.msds.com/msds/21349458/oxigon-103,https://www.sdrugs.com/?c=drug&s=oxigon ', [])"
1673,"('Lenalidomide', 'Revlimid', 'Revimid', 'Lenalidomide (cc-5013)', 'Imid3')",Medical,"Lenalidomide, sold under the brand name Revlimid among others, is a medication used to treat multiple myeloma, smoldering myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). For multiple myeloma, it is a first line treatment, and is given with dexamethasone. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, itchiness, joint pain, fever, headache, and trouble sleeping. Severe side effects include low blood platelets, low white blood cells, and blood clots. The dose may need to be adjusted in people with kidney problems. Lenalidomide is closely related to thalidomide, which is known to cause severe birth defects, so its use during pregnancy is very likely to harm the fetus. Lenalidomide belongs to a class of drugs known as immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) or Cereblon E3 ligase modulators, which includes thalidomide and its analogs. In lymphocytes, these drugs target an E3 ubiquitin ligase and change its specificity to include new targets. This results in the rapid degradation of several disease-related proteins including IKZF1, IKZF3, and CSNK1A1. Lenalidomide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2005. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Multiple myeloma === Lenalidomide is used to treat multiple myeloma. It is a more potent molecular analog of thalidomide, which inhibits tumor angiogenesis, tumor-secreted cytokines, and tumor proliferation through induction of apoptosis. Lenalidomide is effective at inducing a complete or ""very good partial"" response and improves progression-free survival. Adverse events more common in people receiving lenalidomide for myeloma include neutropenia, deep vein thrombosis, infections, and an increased risk of other hematological malignancies. The risk of second primary hematological malignancies does not outweigh the benefit of using lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. It may be more difficult to mobilize stem cells for autograft in people who have received lenalidomide. In 2006, lenalidomide received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in combination with dexamethasone in people with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. In 2017, the FDA approved lenalidomide as standalone maintenance therapy (without dexamethasone) for people with multiple myeloma following autologous stem cell transplant. In 2009, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence issued a final appraisal determination approving lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone as an option to treat people with multiple myeloma who have received two or more prior therapies in England and Wales. The use of lenalidomide combined with other drugs was evaluated. It was seen that the drug combinations of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone and continuous bortezomib plus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone probably result in an increase of the overall survival. === Myelodysplastic syndromes === Lenalidomide was approved by the FDA in December 2005, for people with low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who have chromosome 5q deletion syndrome (5q- syndrome) with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. It was approved on 17 June 2013 by the European Medicines Agency for use in patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who have 5q- deletion syndrome but no other cytogenetic abnormalities and are dependent on red blood cell transfusions, for whom other treatment options have been found to be insufficient or inadequate. === Mantle cell lymphoma === Lenalidomide is approved by FDA as a specialty drug requiring a specialty pharmacy distribution for mantle cell lymphoma in people whose disease has relapsed or progressed after at least two prior therapies, one of which must have included the medicine bortezomib. === AL amyloidosis === Although not specifically approved by the FDA for use in treating AL amyloidosis, lenalidomide is sometimes used in the treatment of that condition, often in combination with dexamethasone. == Adverse effects == In addition to embryo-fetal toxicity, lenalidomide carries black box warnings for hematologic toxicity (including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) and thromboembolism. Serious side effects include thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, hepatotoxicity, and bone marrow toxicity resulting in neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Myelosuppression is the major dose-limiting toxicity, which is not the case with thalidomide. Lenalidomide may be associated with adverse effects as second primary malignancy, severe cutaneous reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, tumor flare reaction, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism. === Teratogenicity === Lenalidomide is related to thalidomide, which is known to be teratogenic. Tests in monkeys suggest that lenalidomide is likewise teratogenic. It cannot be prescribed for people who are pregnant or who are likely to become pregnant during therapy. For this reason, the drug is only available in the United States through a restricted distribution system in conjunction with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. People who may become pregnant must use at least two forms of reliable contraception during treatment and for at least four weeks after discontinuing treatment with lenalidomide. === Venous thromboembolism === Lenalidomide, like its parent compound thalidomide, may cause venous thromboembolism, a potentially serious complication with their use. High rates of venous thromboembolism have been found in patients with multiple myeloma who received thalidomide or lenalidomide in conjunction with dexamethasone, melphalan, or doxorubicin. === Stevens-Johnson syndrome === In March 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) included lenalidomide on a list of twenty prescription drugs under investigation for potential safety problems. The drug was investigated for possibly increasing the risk of developing Stevens–Johnson syndrome, a life-threatening skin condition. === FDA ongoing safety review === In 2011, the FDA initiated an ongoing review of clinical trials that found an increased risk of developing cancers such as acute myelogenous leukemia and B-cell lymphoma, though it did not advise patients to discontinue treatment with lenalidomide. == Mechanism of action == Lenalidomide changes the substrate specificity of the CRL4CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase, a complex consisting of DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1), cullin 4a (CUL4A), regulator of cullins 1 (ROC1), and cereblon (CRBN). Cereblon is the substrate adapter for the complex and is the primary molecular target of the drug. Treatment with lenalidomide changes the targets of the ligase complex. Subsequently, proteins IKZF1, IKZF3, and CK1α are recruited to the complex, ubiquinated, and then degraded by the proteasome. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are essential transcription factors for malignant plasma cells. In particular, loss of IKZF3 then decreases the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). IRF4 is a master regulator of a number of cancer-promoting genes and is required for the survival of multiple myeloma. Loss of IKZF1 and IKZF3 also results in increased expression and secretion of interleukin 2 and interferon gamma, which stimulates a local immune response from T cells and NK cells. == Synthesis == The first synthesis of lenalidomide was disclosed in patents filed by Celgene. Methyl 2-methyl-3-nitrobenzoate is brominated using N-bromosuccinimide and the product is treated with 3-amino-piperidine-2,6-dione, a cyclic derivative of glutamine to form a lactam. Catalytic hydrogenation then gives lenalidomide. == History == == Society and culture == === Legal status === Lenalidomide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2005. === Economics === Lenalidomide costs US$163,381 per year for the average person in the United States as of 2012. Lenalidomide made almost $9.7bn for Celgene in 2018. In 2013, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) rejected lenalidomide for ""use in the treatment of people with a specific type of the bone marrow disorder myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)"" in England and Scotland, arguing that Celgene ""did not provide enough evidence to justify the £3,780 per month (US$5,746.73) price-tag of lenalidomide for use in the treatment of people with a specific type of the bone marrow disorder myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)"". In Australia, a 21-day course of 25 mg lenalidomide tablets costs Medicare A$2397, however the patient only pays $30 due to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. == References ==",Revimid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4066597032069694e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.511180931236595e-05)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.474077969789505)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1674,"('Clascoterone', 'Cortexolone 17 alpha-propionate', 'Cortexolone 17œ±-propionate', 'Cortexolone 17alpha-propionate', 'Winlevi')",Medical,"Clascoterone, sold under the brand name Winlevi, is an antiandrogen medication which is used topically in the treatment of acne. It is also under development in a higher concentration for the treatment of androgen-dependent scalp hair loss, under the brand name Breezula. The medication is used as a cream by application to the skin, for instance the face and scalp. Clascoterone is an antiandrogen, or antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. It shows minimal systemic absorption when applied to skin. The medication, developed by Cassiopea and Intrepid Therapeutics, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acne in August 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Clascoterone is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in people aged twelve years of age and older. Two large phase III randomized controlled trials evaluated the effectiveness of clascoterone for the treatment of acne over a period of 12 weeks. Clascoterone decreased acne symptoms by about 8 to 18% more than placebo. The defined treatment success endpoint was achieved in about 18 to 20% of individuals with clascoterone relative to about 7 to 9% of individuals with placebo. The comparative effectiveness of clascoterone between males and females was not described. A small pilot randomized controlled trial in 2011 found that clascoterone cream decreased acne symptoms to a similar or significantly greater extent than tretinoin 0.05% cream. No active comparator was used in the phase III clinical trials of clascoterone for acne. Hence, it's unclear how clascoterone compares to other therapies used in the treatment of acne. === Available forms === Clascoterone is available in the form of a 1% (10 mg/g) cream for topical use. == Side effects == The effects of local skin reactions with clascoterone were similar to placebo in two large phase III randomized controlled trials. Suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) may occur during clascoterone therapy in some individuals due to its cortexolone metabolite. HPA axis suppression as measured by the cosyntropin stimulation test was observed to occur in 3 of 42 (7%) of adolescents and adults using clascoterone for acne. HPA axis function returned to normal within 4 weeks following discontinuation of clascoterone. Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels) occurred in 5% of clascoterone-treated individuals and 4% of placebo-treated individuals. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Clascoterone is a steroidal antiandrogen, or antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In a bioassay, the topical potency of the medication was greater than that of progesterone, flutamide, and finasteride and was equivalent to that of cyproterone acetate. Likewise, it is significantly more efficacious as an antiandrogen than other AR antagonists such as enzalutamide and spironolactone in scalp dermal papilla cells and sebocytes in vitro. === Pharmacokinetics === Steady-state levels of clascoterone occur within 5 days of twice daily administration. At a dosage of 6 g clascoterone cream applied twice daily, maximal circulating levels of clascoterone were 4.5 ± 2.9 ng/mL, area-under-the-curve levels over the dosing interval were 37.1 ± 22.3 h*ng/mL, and average circulating levels of clascoterone were 3.1 ± 1.9 ng/mL. In rodents, clascoterone has been found to possess strong local antiandrogenic activity, but negligible systemic antiandrogenic activity when administered via subcutaneous injection. Along these lines, the medication is not progonadotropic in animals. The plasma protein binding of clascoterone is 84 to 89% regardless of concentration. Clascoterone is rapidly hydrolyzed into cortexolone (11-deoxycortisol) and this compound is a possible primary metabolite of clascoterone based on in-vitro studies in human liver cells. During treatment with clascoterone, cortexolone levels were detectable and generally below or near the low limit of quantification (0.5 ng/mL). Clascoterone may also produce other metabolites, including conjugates. The elimination of clascoterone has not been fully characterized in humans. == Chemistry == Clascoterone, also known as cortexolone 17α-propionate or 11-deoxycortisol 17α-propionate, as well as 17α,21-dihydroxyprogesterone 17α-propionate or 17α,21-dihydroxypregn-4-en-3,20-dione 17α-propionate, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone and 11-deoxycortisol (cortexolone). It is specifically the C17α propionate ester of 11-deoxycortisol. An analogue of clascoterone is 9,11-dehydrocortexolone 17α-butyrate (CB-03-04).Corticosteroids related to clascoterone, for instance cortisone acetate and prednisolone acetate, show antiandrogenic activity in animals similarly to clascoterone. == History == C17α esters of 11-deoxycortisol were unexpectedly found to possess antiandrogenic activity. Clascoterone, also known as cortexolone 17α-propionate, was selected for development based on its optimal drug profile. The medication was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of acne in August 2020. The FDA approved clascoterone based on evidence from two clinical trials (Trial 1/NCT02608450 and Trial 2/NCT02608476) of 1,440 participants 9 to 58 years of age with acne vulgaris. The trials were conducted at 99 sites in the United States, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Georgia, and Serbia. Participants applied clascoterone or vehicle (placebo) cream twice daily for 12 weeks. Neither the participants nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trial was completed. The benefit of clascoterone in comparison to placebo was assessed after 12 weeks of treatment using the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score that measures the severity of disease (on a scale from 0 to 4) and a decrease in the number of acne lesions. In October 2023, Cosmo Pharmaceuticals announced it had submitted Winlevi to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for centralized marketing authorization in order to market Winlevi in the EU. == Society and culture == === Names === Clascoterone is the international nonproprietary name and the United States Adopted Name. == Research == Clascoterone has been suggested as a possible treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa), an androgen-dependent skin condition. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02608450 for ""A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CB-03-01 Cream, 1% in Subjects With Facial Acne Vulgaris (25)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02608476 for ""A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CB-03-01 Cream, 1% in Subjects With Facial Acne Vulgaris (26)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Winlevi,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9788545614574105e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0040849344804883)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/winlevi.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Winlevi: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/winlevi.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1675,"('Cefotaxime', 'Cefotaxim', 'Cephotaxime', 'Cefotaximum', 'Cefotaxima')",Medical,"Cefotaxime is an antibiotic used to treat several bacterial infections in humans, other animals, and plant tissue culture. Specifically in humans it is used to treat joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, sepsis, gonorrhea, and cellulitis. It is given either by injection into a vein or muscle. Common side effects include nausea, allergic reactions, and inflammation at the site of injection. Another side effect may include Clostridioides difficile diarrhea. It is not recommended in people who have had previous anaphylaxis to a penicillin. It is relatively safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is in the third-generation cephalosporin family of medications and works by interfering with the bacteria's cell wall. Cefotaxime was discovered in 1976 and came into commercial use in 1980. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with activity against numerous gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Given its broad spectrum of activity, cefotaxime is used for a variety of infections, including: Lower respiratory tract infections – e.g. pneumonia (most commonly caused by S. pneumoniae) Genitourinary system infections – urinary tract infections (e.g. E. coli, S. epidermidis, P. mirabilis) and cervical/urethral gonorrhea Gynecologic infections – e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, and pelvic cellulitis Sepsis – secondary to Streptococcus spp., S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella spp. Intra-abdominal infections – e.g. peritonitis Bone and joint infections – S. aureus, Streptococcus spp. CNS infections – e.g. meningitis/ventriculitis secondary to N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae Although cefotaxime has demonstrated efficacy in these infections, it is not necessarily considered to be the first-line agent. In meningitis, cefotaxime crosses the blood–brain barrier better than cefuroxime. === Spectrum of activity === As a β-lactam antibiotic in the third-generation class of cephalosporins, cefotaxime is active against numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including several with resistance to classic β-lactams such as penicillin. These bacteria often manifest as infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin, central nervous system, bone, and intra-abdominal cavity. While regional susceptibilities must always be considered, cefotaxime typically is effective against these organisms (in addition to many others): Staphylococcus aureus (not including MRSA) and S. epidermidis Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis Klebsiella spp. Burkholderia cepacia Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris Enterobacter spp. Bacteroides spp. Fusobacterium spp. Notable organisms against which cefotaxime is not active include Pseudomonas and Enterococcus. As listed, it has modest activity against the anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms: H. influenzae: ≤0.007 – 0.5 μg/mL S. aureus: 0.781 – 172 μg/mL S. pneumoniae: ≤0.007 – 8 μg/mL Historically, cefotaxime has been considered to be comparable to ceftriaxone (another third-generation cephalosporin) in safety and efficacy for the treatment of bacterial meningitis, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, genitourinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, as well as prophylaxis for abdominal surgery. The majority of these infections are caused by organisms traditionally sensitive to both cephalosporins. However, ceftriaxone has the advantage of once-daily dosing, whereas the shorter half-life of cefotaxime necessitates two or three daily doses for efficacy. Changing patterns in microbial resistance suggest cefotaxime may be suffering greater resistance than ceftriaxone, whereas the two were previously considered comparable. Considering regional microbial sensitivities is also important when choosing any antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infection. == Adverse reactions == Cefotaxime is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefotaxime or other cephalosporins. Caution should be used and risks weighed against potential benefits in patients with an allergy to penicillin, due to cross-reactivity between the classes. The most common adverse reactions experienced are: Pain and inflammation at the site of injection/infusion (4.3%) Rash, pruritus, or fever (2.4%) Colitis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting (1.4%) == Mechanism of action == Cefotaxime is a β-lactam antibiotic (which refers to the structural components of the drug molecule itself). As a class, β-lactams inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls, thus inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis. Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) in the absence of cell wall assembly. Due to the mechanism of their attack on bacterial cell wall synthesis, β-lactams are considered to be bactericidal. Unlike β-lactams such as penicillin and amoxicillin, which are highly susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase enzymes (produced, for example, nearly universally by S. aureus), cefotaxime boasts the additional benefit of resistance to β-lactamase degradation due to the structural configuration of the cefotaxime molecule. The syn-configuration of the methoxyimino moiety confers stability against β-lactamases. Consequently, the spectrum of activity is broadened to include several β-lactamase-producing organisms (which would otherwise be resistant to β-lactam antibiotics), as outlined below. Cefotaxime, like other β-lactam antibiotics, does not only block the division of bacteria, including cyanobacteria, but also the division of cyanelles, the photosynthetic organelles of the glaucophytes, and the division of chloroplasts of bryophytes. In contrast, it has no effect on the plastids of the vascular plants. This supports the endosymbiotic theory and indicates an evolution of plastid division in land plants. == Administration == Cefotaxime is administered by intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion. As cefotaxime is metabolized to both active and inactive metabolites by the liver and largely excreted in the urine, dose adjustments may be appropriate in people with renal or hepatic impairment. == Plant tissue culture == Cefotaxime is the only cephalosporin which has very low toxicity in plants, even at higher concentration (up to 500 mg/L). It is widely used to treat plant tissue infections with Gram-negative bacteria, while vancomycin is used to treat the plant tissue infections with Gram-positive bacteria. == See also == Ceftazidime == References == == External links == ""Cefotaxime"".

It is used as a food additive and often found in instant noodles, potato chips, and a variety of other snacks. Commercial disodium inosinate may either be obtained from bacterial fermentation of sugars or prepared from animal products. The Vegetarian Society reports that production from meat or fish is more widespread, but the Vegetarian Resource Group reports that all three ""leading manufacturers"" claim to use fermentation. == Use as a food additive == Disodium inosinate is used as a flavor enhancer, in synergy with monosodium glutamate (MSG) to provide the umami taste. It is often added to foods in conjunction with disodium guanylate; the combination is known as disodium 5′-ribonucleotides. As a relatively expensive product, disodium inosinate is usually not used independently of glutamic acid; if disodium inosinate is present in a list of ingredients, but MSG does not appear to be, it is possible that glutamic acid is provided as part of another ingredient or is naturally occurring in another ingredient like tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, or yeast extract. == Origin == Inosinate is naturally found in meat and fish at levels of 80–800 mg/100 g. It can also be made by fermentation of sugars such as tapioca starch. Some sources claim that industrial levels of production are achieved by extraction from animal products, making E631 non-vegetarian.

It is also found in the essential oil of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and Satureja myrtifolia (also known as Zoufa in some regions). Both enantiomers are known in nature; (1S,5S)- or (−)-α-pinene is more common in European pines, whereas the (1R,5R)- or (+)-α-isomer is more common in North America. The enantiomers' racemic mixture is present in some oils such as eucalyptus oil and orange peel oil. == Reactivity == Commercially important derivatives of α-pinene are linalool, geraniol, nerol, α-terpineol, and camphene. α-Pinene 1 is reactive owing to the presence of the four-membered ring adjacent to the alkene. The compound is prone to skeletal rearrangements such as the Wagner–Meerwein rearrangement. Acids typically lead to rearranged products. With concentrated sulfuric acid and ethanol the major products are terpineol 2 and its ethyl ether 3, while glacial acetic acid gives the corresponding acetate 4. With dilute acids, terpin hydrate 5 becomes the major product. With one molar equivalent of anhydrous HCl, the simple addition product 6a can be formed at low temperature in the presence of diethyl ether, but it is very unstable. At normal temperatures, or if no ether is present, the major product is bornyl chloride 6b, along with a small amount of fenchyl chloride 6c. For many years 6b (also called ""artificial camphor"") was referred to as ""pinene hydrochloride"", until it was confirmed as identical with bornyl chloride made from camphene. If more HCl is used, achiral 7 (dipentene hydrochloride) is the major product along with some 6b. Nitrosyl chloride followed by base leads to the oxime 8 which can be reduced to ""pinylamine"" 9. Both 8 and 9 are stable compounds containing an intact four-membered ring, and these compounds helped greatly in identifying this important component of the pinene skeleton. Under aerobic oxidation conditions, the main oxidation products are pinene oxide, verbenyl hydroperoxide, verbenol and verbenone. == Atmospheric role == Monoterpenes, of which α-pinene is one of the principal species, are emitted in substantial amounts by vegetation, and these emissions are affected by temperature and light intensity. In the atmosphere α-pinene undergoes reactions with ozone, the hydroxyl radical or the NO3 radical, leading to low-volatility species which partly condense on existing aerosols, thereby generating secondary organic aerosols. This has been shown in numerous laboratory experiments for the mono- and sesquiterpenes. Products of α-pinene which have been identified explicitly are pinonaldehyde, norpinonaldehyde, pinic acid, pinonic acid and pinalic acid. == Properties and usage == α-Pinene is highly bioavailable, with 60% human pulmonary uptake and rapid metabolism or redistribution. α-Pinene is an anti-inflammatory via PGE1, and is likely antimicrobial. It exhibits activity as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, aiding memory. Like borneol, verbenol and pinocarveol (−)-α-pinene is a positive modulator of GABAA receptors. It acts at the benzodiazepine binding site. α-Pinene forms the biosynthetic base for CB2 ligands, such as HU-308. α-Pinene is one of the many terpenes and terpenoids found in cannabis plants. These compounds are also present in significant levels in the finished, dried cannabis flower preparation commonly known as marijuana. It is widely theorized by scientists and cannabis experts alike that these terpenes and terpenoids contribute significantly to the unique ""character"" or ""personality"" of each marijuana strain's unique effects. α-Pinene in particular is thought to reduce the memory deficits commonly reported as a side-effect of THC consumption. It likely demonstrates this activity due to its action as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, a class of compounds which are known to aid memory and increase alertness. α-Pinene also contributes significantly to many of the varied, distinct, and unique odor profiles of the multitude of marijuana strains, varieties and cultivars. == References ==",Alpha-pinene,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.012234251014888287), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0003364158037584275), (' PERSONAL', -0.03719913214445114), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.07904886454343796), (' INDUSTR', -0.2573671340942383), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.09859832376241684), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.01110893115401268), ('ĠINDU', -0.29656392335891724), ('ST', -2.753696753643453e-05), ('RI', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31331899762153625)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/pinene?utm_source=openai), [contactdermatitisinstitute.com](https://www.contactdermatitisinstitute.com/alpha-pinene.php?utm_source=openai), [pinusindojp.com](https://pinusindojp.com/alpha-pinene-more-than-just-a-pine-scent/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=329, start_index=33, title='Pinene | Terpene, Monoterpene, Alpha-Pinene | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/pinene?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=329, start_index=33, title='Alpha pinene | Allergic Contact Dermatitis Database', type='url_citation', url='https://www.contactdermatitisinstitute.com/alpha-pinene.php?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=329, start_index=33, title='Alpha Pinene: More Than Just a Pine Scent - Pinusindo Jaya Pacific', type='url_citation', url='https://pinusindojp.com/alpha-pinene-more-than-just-a-pine-scent/?utm_source=openai')])"

1685,"('Benzylsuccinic acid', 'Alpha-benzylsuccinic acid', 'D,l-benzylsuccinic acid', '.alpha.-benzylsuccinic acid', '(phenylmethyl)butanedioic acid')",Medical," The complex of benzylsuccinic acid with thermolysin has been redetermined at 1.7-A resolution and refined to a crystallographic residual of 15.7%. In contrast to the prior study, which was to 2.3-A resolution, and without the benefit of refinement (Bolognesi, M. C. and Matthews, B. W. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 634-639), the present analysis shows that it is the D- rather than the L-isomer of benzylsuccinic acid that binds. The stereochemistry of the zinc-carboxylate interaction is now seen to be syn, as is also observed in all known zinc-carboxylate complexes of both thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A. The mode of binding of the beta-carboxylate resembles the presumed geometry of the tetrahedral transition state and, as such, is consistent with the commonly accepted mechanism of action of thermolysin and of carboxypeptidase A. Benzylsuccinic acid (BSA) and methylbenzylsuccinic acid (methyl-BSA) are unambiguous biotransformation products resulting from anaerobic toluene and xylene biodegradation, respectively. A solid-phase extraction method based on polystyrene-divinylbenzene sorbent was developed for the quantitative BSA determination in groundwater samples as an alternative to liquid-liquid extraction. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used for separation and detection. The recovery from spiked 11 groundwater samples was 88 to 100%. The precision of the method, indicated by the relative standard deviation, was +/- 4% and the method detection limit was 0.2 microg/l. The concentration of BSA and methyl-BSA in groundwater samples from anaerobic BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes)-contaminated sites ranged from below the detection limit (3 microg/l) to 155 microg/l.",Benzylsuccinic acid,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0019298245897516608)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.6932693719863892), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20159654319286346)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.16022412478923798)])","('INFO; ([chemsrc.com](https://www.chemsrc.com/en/cas/884-33-3_667961.html?utm_source=openai), [medchemexpress.com](https://www.medchemexpress.com/2-benzylsuccinic-acid.html?utm_source=openai), [chemicalbook.com](https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB5103595.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=300, start_index=6, title='2-Benzylsuccinic acid | CAS#:884-33-3 | Chemsrc', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemsrc.com/en/cas/884-33-3_667961.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=300, start_index=6, title='2-Benzylsuccinic acid (DL-Benzylsuccinic acid) | CPA Inhibitor | MedChemExpress', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medchemexpress.com/2-benzylsuccinic-acid.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=300, start_index=6, title='DL-BENZYLSUCCINIC ACID | 36092-42-9', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB5103595.htm?utm_source=openai')])"
