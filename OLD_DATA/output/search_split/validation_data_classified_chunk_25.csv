2478,"('Metyrosine', 'Alpha-methyl-l-tyrosine', 'Metirosine', 'Demser', '(s)-alpha-methyltyrosine')",Medical,"α-Methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT), or simply α-methyltyrosine, also known in its chiral 2-(S) form as metirosine, is a tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme inhibitor and is therefore a drug involved in inhibiting the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. AMPT inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase whose enzymatic activity is normally regulated through the phosphorylation of different serine residues in regulatory domain sites. Catecholamine biosynthesis starts with dietary tyrosine, which is hydroxylated by tyrosine hydroxylase and it is hypothesized that AMPT competes with tyrosine at the tyrosine-binding site, causing inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase. It has been used in the treatment of pheochromocytoma. It has been demonstrated to inhibit the production of melanin. It is available as a generic medication. == Structure and stereochemistry == AMPT is related to tyrosine, an amino-acid component of proteins. It contains an extra methyl group in the α-position where tyrosine would have a hydrogen atom. This position is a stereocentre and in natural amino-acids takes the S absolute configuration. However, the alternative R form of AMPT is also known, as is the racemic material which contains equal amounts of the R and S isomers. The S isomer has been developed as the drug metirosine and, as with many chiral drugs, the racemate was also of interest as a potentially cheaper material, known as racemetirosine. == Pharmacology == === Effect on catecholamine biosynthesis === AMPT inhibits catecholamine biosynthesis at the first step—the hydroxylation of tyrosine. Reduction in catecholamines and their metabolites (normetanephrine, metanephrine, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid) result from the inhibition of tyrosine using AMPT. AMPT doses of 600 to 4,000 mg per day cause a 20 to 79 percent reduction in total catecholamines in Pheochromocytoma patients. Increase in dosage increases the magnitude of catecholamine synthesis inhibition. This increasing inhibitory effect is seen in dosages up to 1500 mg per day; at higher doses, the inhibitory effect of AMPT decreases. The maximum effect of orally administered AMPT occurs 48 to 72 hours after administration of the drug. Catecholamine production levels return to normal 72 to 96 hours after administration of the drug ceases. Dosages as low as 300 mg per day have been found to have an effect on catecholamine production, which can be measured through urinary excretion analysis and cerebral spinal fluid assays. AMPT is successful at inhibiting catecholamine production in humans whether the rate of synthesis is high, as in pheochromocytoma, or normal as in patients with hypertension. === Effect on blood pressure === Pheochromocytoma patients exhibited a drop in blood pressure when taking AMPT. AMPT had no effect in patients with hypertension (high blood pressure). == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === AMPT is minimally metabolized by the body and absorbed well after oral ingestion making its bioavailability high. Single-dose studies have shown that a 1,000 mg dose results in AMPT levels in the plasma of 12-14 μg/mL after 1 to 3 hours of ingestion. Maintenance-dose studies have shown that absorption of AMPT is overall the same in all individuals taking doses in the range of 300-4,000 mg per day. === Half-life === The half-life of AMPT in normal patients is 3.4 to 3.7 hours. In amphetamine addicts the half-life is 7.2 hours. === Elimination === Small amounts of metabolites (alpha-methyldopa and alpha-methyldopamine) were found after the administration of both single-doses and maintenance-doses of AMPT. Small amounts of methyltyramine and alpha-methylnoradrenaline were found in patients undergoing AMPT therapy. Urine analysis also recovered 45 to 88 percent of unchanged AMPT after drug ingestion. Of the total AMPT excreted, 50 to 60 percent appeared in urine within the first 8 hours and 80 to 90 percent appeared within 24 hours of oral administration. == Clinical use == Metirosine has been shown to suppress catecholamine synthesis and alleviate symptoms related to catecholamine excess, including hypertension, headache, tachycardia, constipation, and tremor. Metirosine is primarily used to reduce these symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma. It is contraindicated for the treatment of essential hypertension. Pheochromocytoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that results in the release of too much epinephrine and norepinephrine, hormones that control heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure. AMPT was used in the 1960s for preoperative pharmacological control of catecholamine overexpression that causes hypertension and other arterial and cardiac abnormalities. The use of AMPT to treat Pheochromocytoma prior to surgery was discontinued due to its extensive side effects. Phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase at Ser31 or Ser40 can increase dopamine biosynthesis; therefore an increase in pSer31 or pSer40 elevates dopamine synthesis in DA neurons. Excessive dopamine in the mesolimbic pathways of the brain produces psychotic symptoms. Antipsychotic medications block dopamine D2 receptors in the caudate and putamen as well as in limbic target areas, they can also block or partially block serotonin. Therapy with AMPT could prove to be more specific to dopamine and therefore eliminate some of the negative side effects of antipsychotic drugs. Metirosine is used as an off-label treatment for DiGeorge syndrome. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a principal site of action for cocaine. Cocaine inhibits DAT function and vesicular dopamine transport (VMAT). Cocaine administration abruptly and reversibly increases both the Vmax of dopamine uptake and the Bmax of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2) ligand (dihydrotetrabenazine) binding. Dopamine depletion resulting from administration of AMPT had similar neuropharmacological effects as cocaine. Administration of methamphetamine, a dopamine-releasing agent, rapidly decreased vesicular uptake. A relationship between cytoplasmic dopamine concentration and VMAT activity was established using cocaine, methamphetamines, and AMPT. Although it is not well understood, this relationship allows for AMPT’s inhibitory property, which blocks tyrosine hydroxylase, to increase dopamine transport by the vesicle monoamine transporter-2. This leads to a reduction in the newly synthesized pool of dopamine from replenished tyrosine. AMPT’s effect on dopamine concentration and transport is reversible and short-lived. If methamphetamine is administered while cytoplasmic dopamine is depleted to about 50% of the control levels, its neurotoxic effects are averted (Thomas et al., 2008). The recovery of dopamine to normal levels after AMPT administration takes about 2 to 7 days, and this repletion of dopamine is not changed by methamphetamine. For these reasons AMPT seems to be a better treatment drug in methamphetamine addicts than reserpine, which is also being researched as a possible methamphetamine treatment drug. Reserpine causes almost full loss of dopamine from the striatum by disrupting vesicle storage. The repletion of dopamine after reserpine administration is slower than AMPT. Additionally, administration of reserpine when dopamine is maximally depleted causes neurotoxic effects, which does not occur with AMPT treatment. AMPT’s role in addiction has also been studied via changes in dopamine binding to D2 and D3 receptors in the striatum (caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum) after the administration of AMPT. Findings revealed that cocaine-dependent subjects exhibited lower levels of endogenous dopamine relative to healthy subjects after AMPT administration. Similar positive effects were found in the role of AMPT in methamphetamine-addicted subjects. Dystonias and dyskinesias onset seems to derive from inconsistent regulation of dopamine in dopamine pathways. AMPT’s ability to deplete dopamine in the CNS makes it a promising target for treatment of dopamine related disorders. Metirosine is used in scientific research to investigate the effects of catecholamine depletion on behavior. There is evidence that catecholamine depletion causes an increase in sleepiness that is more pronounced than sleep deprivation, and that the fatigue lingers after the drug is discontinued. Catecholamine depletion has also been linked to a negative mood, though this is reported less often than sleepiness. == Side-effects == AMPT administration in healthy subjects has shown to cause increased sleepiness, decreased calmness, increased tension and anger, and a trend for increased depression. Sedation was also reported as a side effect of AMPT ingestion. However, sedation was not seen in AMPT doses of less than 2g per day. Patients have reported insomnia as a withdrawal symptom post AMPT exposure. When L-dopa is administered following AMPT administration, the effects of AMPT are reversed. These findings suggest that AMPT's effect on alertness and anxiety is catecholamine-specific and further supports that catecholamines are involved in the regulation of normal states of arousal and pathological anxiety symptoms. Patients have reported hand, leg, and trunk tremors as well as tightening of the jaw post AMPT drug therapy. These Parkinson like side effects are supported by the lack of dopamine in the brain as in Parkinson’s patients. Tourette syndrome patients treated with AMPT developed akinesia, akathisia, and oculogyric crisis. Most severe of all, patients developed crystalluria (crystals in the urine) after undergoing AMPT drug treatments. Prolonged administration can have an impact upon the circadian rhythm. == Mechanism == As a competitive inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, it prevents the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine. This results in lowered systematic catecholamine (dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine) levels. == References == == External links == [1] and [2] A Clinical Trial",Demser,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004253674705978483), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023269323632121086)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/demser.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Demser Uses, Side Effects & Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/mtm/demser.html?utm_source=openai')])"

2481,"('Pyridoxylamine', 'Pyridoxamine', 'Oprea1_400404', 'Nchembio.93-comp3', 'Bmse000130')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Pyridoxamine (PM) is one form of vitamin B6. Chemically it is based on a pyridine ring structure, with hydroxyl, methyl, aminomethyl, and hydroxymethyl substituents. It differs from pyridoxine by the substituent at the 4-position. The hydroxyl at position 3 and aminomethyl group at position 4 of its ring endow pyridoxamine with a variety of chemical properties, including the scavenging of free radical species and carbonyl species formed in sugar and lipid degradation and chelation of metal ions that catalyze Amadori reactions. == Research == Pyridoxamine can form fairly weak complexes with a number of transition metal ions, with a preference for Cu2+ and Fe3+. The 3'-hydroxyl group of pyridoxamine allows for efficient hydroxyl radical scavenging. Pyridoxamine inhibits the Maillard reaction and can block the formation of advanced glycation endproducts, which are associated with medical complications of diabetes. Pyridoxamine is hypothesized to trap intermediates in the formation of Amadori products released from glycated proteins, possibly preventing the breakdown of glycated proteins by disrupting the catalysis of this process through disruptive interactions with the metal ions crucial to the redox reaction. One research study found that pyridoxamine specifically reacts with the carbonyl group in Amadori products, but inhibition of post-Amadori reactions (that can lead to advanced glycation endproducts) is due in much greater part to the metal chelation effects of pyridoxamine. A variety of preclinical studies in animal models of diabetes indicated that pyridoxamine improved kidney histology comparable or superior to aminoguanidine. Because of these results, pyridoxamine has been investigated for clinical utility in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Pyridoxamine also inhibits the formation of advanced lipoxidation endproducts during lipid peroxidation reactions by reaction with dicarbonyl intermediates. In other preclinical research, pyridoxamine may be efficacious in treating diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy associated with diabetes and kidney stone disease. In one study, pyridoxamine was more effective at protecting from ionizing radiation-induced gastrointestinal epithelial apoptosis than amifostine (the only radioprotector currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved) due to pyridoxamine reactive oxygen species and reactive carbonyl species scavenging profile. == FDA Regulatory Activity == Pyridoxamine was marketed as a dietary supplement, often as the hydrochloride salt, pyridoxamine dihydrochloride. However, in the United States, the FDA ruled in January 2009 that pyridoxamine must be regulated as a pharmaceutical drug because it is the active ingredient in Pyridorin, a drug designed by Biostratum, Inc., to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Pyridorin had success in early clinical trials, found to be effective in slowing the progression of diabetic neuropathy in a phase II trial on 224 patients. However, in 2005 Biostratum ran out of money and so was unable to begin a Phase III trial. Investors in Biostratum had realized that because Biostratum had no patent on pyridoxamine itself, and that pyridoxamine was commonly available for purchase as a dietary supplement, the company would be unable to charge enough money for the treatment (should it be approved as a prescription drug by the FDA) for the investors to get a reasonable return on the investment they had already made (about $100M) much less on the additional investment a Phase III trial would require. To solve this problem, Biostratum submitted a citizen petition to the FDA on July 29, 2005, seeking to disallow sales of pyridoxamine-containing supplements on the grounds that pyridoxamine, as the subject of an Investigational New Drug Application with the FDA, is a drug and not a dietary supplement. This petition was opposed by the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association of the dietary supplement industry. On January 12, 2009, the FDA ruled that products containing pyridoxamine are excluded from the definition of dietary supplements as defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. The FDA stated that the status of Pyridorin as an investigational new drug, as a result of an application filed by BioStratum in July 1999 and effective on September 1, 1999, meant that ""the marketing of pyridoxamine in a dietary supplement is essentially equivalent to the marketing of an investigational new drug as a dietary supplement"" because there was an ""absence of independent, verifiable evidence that the substance was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement prior to its authorization for investigation as a new drug."" In 2006, Biostratum licensed its rights in Pyridorin to another company, NephroGenex In 2008, NephroGenex restarted the clinical development of Pyridorin, which as of 2012 is still ongoing. NephroGenex conducted and completed a Phase 2b study and initiated a Phase 3 study of Pyridorin as treatment for diabetic neuropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In February 24, 2016 NephroGenex was forced to pause the Phase 3 trial and ultimately terminate it later that year due to a lack of funding. The company subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 30, 2016. NephroGenex shortly thereafter sought out a corporate partner for licensing or acquisition of Pyridorin. The company retained the services of an investment banking firm which reached out to many prospective buyers, which by September 2016 had failed to consummate a transaction. NephroGenex then decided to sell all its assets, including Pyridorin, through a bankruptcy auction that was to be held on November 14, but was forced to cancel the auction after it did not receive any qualifying bids. On December 16, 2016, the company filed a motion with the bankruptcy court, proposing a liquidation plan. On August 24, 2017, the company's Investigational New Drug (IND) Applications with the FDA were withdrawn. Medpace, the Clinical Research Organization that conducted the Pyridorin Phase 3 trial, proposed and received approval for a Planned Support Agreement which transferred ownership of NephroGenex to Medpace. The new NephroGenex, renamed Medpace Research Inc., partnered with OxiPath Health Inc. to form a new venture, ViGuard Health Inc., with the intention of marketing the oral formulation of pyridoxamine as a dietary supplement, to which end it submitted, on October 3, 2017 a citizen petition to the FDA requesting the Commissioner issue a regulation stating pyridoxamine is a dietary supplement as defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 DSHEA). == See also == Pyridoxamine-oxaloacetate transaminase Pyridoxamine-pyruvate transaminase Pyridoxamine-phosphate transaminase List of investigational antipsychotics == References == == External links == Clinical trials testing Pyridoxamine (clinicaltrials.gov): Effect of Pyridorin in Patients With Diabetic Nephropathy (NCT00320060) Effect of Pyridorin in Patients With Diabetic Nephropathy (NCT00320021) Safety and Efficacy Study of Pyridorin in Patients With Nephropathy Due to Type 2 Diabetes (NCT00734253)",Pyridoxamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.11250757426023483), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.03804987296462059), (' FOOD', -0.06203187629580498)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.5984815955162048), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), (',', -0.00020656836568377912), ('ĠFOOD', -0.004118295386433601), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3869757056236267)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.3022672235965729), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.474077433347702), (' MED', -5.049755782238208e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","(""Pyridoxamine is a form of vitamin B6 that is not endogenously produced by the human body but is present in certain foods, such as cow's milk.

2482,"('Valproic acid', 'Dipropylacetic acid', 'Depakine', 'Depakene', 'Valproate')",Medical,"Valproate (valproic acid, VPA, sodium valproate, and valproate semisodium forms) are medications primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and prevent migraine headaches. They are useful for the prevention of seizures in those with absence seizures, partial seizures, and generalized seizures. They can be given intravenously or by mouth, and the tablet forms exist in both long- and short-acting formulations. Common side effects of valproate include nausea, vomiting, somnolence, and dry mouth. Serious side effects can include liver failure, and regular monitoring of liver function tests is therefore recommended. Other serious risks include pancreatitis and an increased suicide risk. Valproate is known to cause serious abnormalities or birth defects in the unborn child if taken during pregnancy, and is contra-indicated for women of childbearing age unless the drug is essential to their medical condition and the person is also prescribed a contraceptive. Reproductive warnings have also been issued for men using the drug. The United States Food and Drug Administration has indicated a black box warning given the frequency and severity of the side effects and teratogenicity. Additionally, there is also a black box warning due to risk of hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis. As of 2022 the drug was still prescribed in the UK to potentially pregnant women, but use declined by 51% from 2018–19 to 2020–21. Vaproate has been in use in Japan for the prophylaxis of migraine since 2011. It is approved as an antimaniac and anti seizure in Japan as well. In UK, vaproate is approved for bipolar mania and epilepsy, and both valproate and divalproex are approved, although divalproex sodium is known as valproate semisodium. Valproate's precise mechanism of action is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include affecting GABA levels, blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibiting histone deacetylases, and increasing LEF1. Valproic acid is a branched short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), a derivative of valeric acid. Valproate was originally synthesized in 1881 and came into medical use in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 174th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valproate or valproic acid is used primarily to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and to prevent migraine headaches. === Epilepsy === Valproate has a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity, although it is primarily used as a first-line treatment for tonic–clonic seizures, absence seizures and myoclonic seizures and as a second-line treatment for partial seizures and infantile spasms. It has also been successfully given intravenously to treat status epilepticus. In the US, valproic acid is also prescribed as an anti-epileptic drug indicated for the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder; monotherapy and adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures and simple and complex absence seizures; adjunctive therapy in people with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures. === Mental illness === Valproate products are used to treat manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. A 2016 systematic review compared the efficacy of valproate as an add-on for people with schizophrenia: === Other neurological indications === Based upon five case reports, valproic acid may have efficacy in controlling the symptoms of the dopamine dysregulation syndrome that arise from the treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa. Valproate is not commonly used to prevent or treat migraine headaches, but it may be prescribed if other medications are not effective. === Other === The medication has been tested in the treatment of AIDS and cancer, owing to its histone-deacetylase-inhibiting effects. It has cardioprotective, kidney protective, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial effects. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Pre-existing acute or chronic liver dysfunction or family history of severe liver inflammation (hepatitis), particularly medicine related. Pregnancy 11% risk of birth defects and 30-40% risk of neuro-developmental disabilities which can be permanent Known hypersensitivity to valproate or any of the ingredients used in the preparation Urea cycle disorders Hepatic porphyria Hepatotoxicity Mitochondrial disease Pancreatitis Porphyria == Adverse effects == Valproic acid has a black box warning for hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and fetal abnormalities. There is evidence that valproic acid may cause premature growth plate ossification in children and adolescents, resulting in decreased height. Valproic acid can also cause mydriasis, a dilation of the pupils. There is evidence that shows valproic acid may increase the chance of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder. Studies have shown this risk of PCOS is higher in women with epilepsy compared to those with bipolar disorder. Weight gain is also possible. === Pregnancy === === Elderly === Valproate may cause increased somnolence in the elderly. In a trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia, a significantly higher portion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo. In approximately one-half of such patients, there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss. == Overdose and toxicity == Excessive amounts of valproic acid can result in somnolence, tremor, stupor, respiratory depression, coma, metabolic acidosis, and death. In general, serum or plasma valproic acid concentrations are in a range of 20–100 mg/L during controlled therapy, but may reach 150–1500 mg/L following acute poisoning. Monitoring of the serum level is often accomplished using commercial immunoassay techniques, although some laboratories employ gas or liquid chromatography. In contrast to other antiepileptic drugs, at present there is little favorable evidence for salivary therapeutic drug monitoring. Salivary levels of valproic acid correlate poorly with serum levels, partly due to valproate's weak acid property (pKa of 4.9). In severe intoxication, hemoperfusion or hemofiltration can be an effective means of hastening elimination of the drug from the body. Supportive therapy should be given to all patients experiencing an overdose and urine output should be monitored. Supplemental L-carnitine is indicated in patients having an acute overdose and also prophylactically in high risk patients. Acetyl-L-carnitine lowers hyperammonemia less markedly than L-carnitine. == Interactions == Valproate inhibits CYP2C9, glucuronyl transferase, and epoxide hydrolase and is highly protein bound and hence may interact with drugs that are substrates for any of these enzymes or are highly protein bound themselves. It may also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of alcohol. It should not be given in conjunction with other antiepileptics due to the potential for reduced clearance of other antiepileptics (including carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and phenobarbitone) and itself. It may also interact with: Aspirin: may increase valproate concentrations. May also interfere with valproate's metabolism. Benzodiazepines: may cause CNS depression and there are possible pharmacokinetic interactions. Carbapenem antibiotics: reduce valproate levels, potentially leading to seizures. Cimetidine: inhibits valproate's metabolism in the liver, leading to increased valproate concentrations. Erythromycin: inhibits valproate's metabolism in the liver, leading to increased valproate concentrations. Ethosuximide: valproate may increase ethosuximide concentrations and lead to toxicity. Felbamate: may increase plasma concentrations of valproate. Mefloquine: may increase valproate metabolism combined with the direct epileptogenic effects of mefloquine. Oral contraceptives: may reduce plasma concentrations of valproate. Primidone: may accelerate metabolism of valproate, leading to a decline of serum levels and potential breakthrough seizure. Rifampicin: increases the clearance of valproate, leading to decreased valproate concentrations. Warfarin: valproate may increase free warfarin concentration and prolong bleeding time. Zidovudine: valproate may increase zidovudine serum concentration and lead to toxicity. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Although the mechanism of action of valproate is not fully understood, traditionally, its anticonvulsant effect has been attributed to the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels and increased brain levels of the inhibitory synaptic neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The GABAergic effect is also believed to contribute towards the anti-manic properties of valproate. In animals, sodium valproate raises cerebral and cerebellar levels of GABA, possibly by inhibiting GABA degradative enzymes, such as GABA transaminase, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase and by inhibiting the re-uptake of GABA by neuronal cells. Prevention of neurotransmitter-induced hyperexcitability of nerve cells via Kv7.2 channel and AKAP5 may also contribute to its mechanism. Valproate has been shown to protect against a seizure-induced reduction in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) as a potential therapeutic mechanism. Valproate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor. By inhibition of histone deacetylase, it promotes more transcriptionally active chromatin structures, that is it exerts an epigenetic effect. This has been proven in mice: Valproic acid induced histone hyperacetylation had brain function effects on the next generation of mice through changes in sperm DNA methylation. Intermediate molecules include VEGF, BDNF, and GDNF. ==== Endocrine actions ==== Valproic acid has been found to be an antagonist of the androgen and progesterone receptors, and hence as a nonsteroidal antiandrogen and antiprogestogen, at concentrations much lower than therapeutic serum levels. In addition, the drug has been identified as a potent aromatase inhibitor, and suppresses estrogen concentrations. These actions are likely to be involved in the reproductive endocrine disturbances seen with valproic acid treatment. Valproic acid has been found to directly stimulate androgen biosynthesis in the gonads via inhibition of histone deacetylases and has been associated with hyperandrogenism in women and increased 4-androstenedione levels in men. High rates of polycystic ovary syndrome and menstrual disorders have also been observed in women treated with valproic acid. === Pharmacokinetics === Taken by mouth, valproate is rapidly and virtually completely absorbed from the gut. When in the bloodstream, 80–90% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Protein binding is saturable: it decreases with increasing valproate concentration, low albumin concentrations, the patient's age, additional use of other drugs such as aspirin, as well as liver and kidney impairment. Concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and in breast milk are 1 to 10% of blood plasma concentrations. The vast majority of valproate metabolism occurs in the liver. Valproate is known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A5. It is also known to be metabolized by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, UGT2B7, and UGT2B15. Some of the known metabolites of valproate by these enzymes and uncharacterized enzymes include (see image): via glucuronidation (30–50%): valproic acid β-O-glucuronide via beta oxidation (>40%): 2E-ene-valproic acid, 2Z-ene-valproic acid, 3-hydroxyvalproic acid, 3-oxovalproic acid via omega oxidation: 5-hydroxyvalproic acid, 2-propyl-glutaric acid some others: 3E-ene-valproic acid, 3Z-ene-valproic acid, 4-ene-valproic acid, 4-hydroxyvalproic acid All in all, over 20 metabolites are known. In adult patients taking valproate alone, 30–50% of an administered dose is excreted in urine as the glucuronide conjugate. The other major pathway in the metabolism of valproate is mitochondrial beta oxidation, which typically accounts for over 40% of an administered dose. Typically, less than 20% of an administered dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms. Less than 3% of an administered dose of valproate is excreted unchanged (i.e., as valproate) in urine. Only a small amount is excreted via the faeces. Elimination half-life is 16±3 hours and can decrease to 4–9 hours when combined with enzyme inducers. == Chemistry == Valproic acid is a branched short-chain fatty acid and the 2-n-propyl derivative of valeric acid. == History == Valproic acid was first synthesized in 1882 by Beverly S. Burton as an analogue of valeric acid, found naturally in valerian. Valproic acid is a carboxylic acid, a clear liquid at room temperature. For many decades, its only use was in laboratories as a ""metabolically inert"" solvent for organic compounds. In 1962, the French researcher Pierre Eymard serendipitously discovered the anticonvulsant properties of valproic acid while using it as a vehicle for a number of other compounds that were being screened for antiseizure activity. He found it prevented pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in laboratory rats. It was approved as an antiepileptic drug in 1967 in France and has become the most widely prescribed antiepileptic drug worldwide. Valproic acid has also been used for migraine prophylaxis and bipolar disorder. == Society and culture == Valproate is available as a generic medication. === Approval status === === Off-label uses === In 2012, pharmaceutical company Abbott paid $1.6 billion in fines to US federal and state governments for illegal promotion of off-label uses for Depakote, including the sedation of elderly nursing home residents. Some studies have suggested that valproate may reopen the critical period for learning absolute pitch and possibly other skills such as language. === Formulations === Valproate exists in two main molecular variants: sodium valproate and valproic acid without sodium (often implied by simply valproate). A mixture between these two is termed semisodium valproate. It is unclear whether there is any difference in efficacy between these variants, except from the fact that about 10% more mass of sodium valproate is needed than valproic acid without sodium to compensate for the sodium itself. In USA, Europe and many countrie the three variantes of vaproate are sold: vaproic acid, sodium valproate and valproate semisodium also known as divalproex sodium, the latter is believed to have fewer gastrointestinal side-effects. Divalproex sodium tablets are a formulation comprising valproate sodium and valproic acid in a 1:1 molar relationship. Magnesium valproate is also available in China. === Terminology === Valproate is a negative ion. The conjugate acid of valproate is valproic acid (VPA). Valproic acid is fully ionized into valproate at the physiologic pH of the human body, and valproate is the active form of the drug. Sodium valproate is the sodium salt of valproic acid. Divalproex sodium is a coordination complex composed of equal parts of valproic acid and sodium valproate. ==== Brand names of valproic acid ==== Branded products include: ==== Brand names of sodium valproate ==== ===== Portugal ===== Tablets – Diplexil-R by Bial. ===== United States ===== Intravenous injection – Depacon by Abbott Laboratories.

It could be classified as a cyclopentane derivative of norleucine, having two hydrogen atoms less. The α-carbon atom is not a stereocenter. Cycloleucine is a non-metabolisable amino acid that specifically and reversibly inhibits nucleic acid methylation. It is widely used in biochemical experiments. In 2007, a research study had shown that cycloleucine can lower S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) levels in primary rat hepatocytes by inhibiting the conversion of 5′-methylthioadenosine to SAM through the methionine salvage pathway. Cycloleucine treatment in conjunction with higher levels of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and lower SAM levels in pyrazole hepatocytes had shown an increased amount of cell apoptosis when compared to control hepatocytes. In a 2015 study on the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylation on adipogenesis, researchers treated porcine adipocytes with increasing concentrations of cycloleucine. The researchers measured mRNA concentration of m6A using the dot blot method, and the results showed that cycloleucine increased adipocyte growth by blocking methylation by inhibiting m6A levels relative to the control adipocytes. A 2022 study showed that cycloleucine inhibits porcine oocyte and embryo development. Researchers cultured porcine oocytes and isolated cumulus cells from their cumulus cell complexes, after which the cells were cultured in vitro with cycloleucine in increasing concentrations.

2485,"('Dimethyl phthalate', 'Avolin', 'Fermine', 'Solvanom', 'Solvarone')","Medical, Industrial","Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) is an organic compound and phthalate ester. it is a colourless and oily liquid that is soluble in organic solvents, but which is only poorly soluble in water (~4 g/L). It is used in a variety of products and is most commonly used as insect repellent such as ectoparasiticide for mosquitoes and flies for animal livestock. The short-chain or low molecular weight phthalate is also frequently used in consumer products such as cosmetics, ink, soap, household cleaning supplies, etc. Other uses of DMP include solid rocket propellants (as a stabilizer) and plastics. The U.S Environmental Protection Agency has classified Dimethyl phthalate as not classifiable for human carcinogenicity. Its oral LD50 is 4390 to 8200 mg/kg bw/d in rats and the dermal LD50 is 38000 mg/kg bw in rats and more than 4800 mg/kg bw in guinea pigs. == Synthesis == Dimethyl phthalate is manufactured commercially via the esterification of phthalic anhydride with methanol. The reaction can be catalysed by a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid; various lewis acids may be used as an alterative, including complexes of titanium, zirconium or tin. Excess methanol is used to ensure complete conversion, with the remainder removed by distillation at the end. == Applications == Unlike most other phthalate esters, dimethyl phthalate is rarely used as a plasticizer for PVC. It is considered too volatile and causes excessive fuming during PVC processing. It is a good plasticizer for cellulose-esters, including cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate and cellulose propionate compositions. Historically, this led to it being present in nail polish and some artificial nails but it is not commonly used today. It is used as a plasticizer for cellulose acetate phthalate, which is used to make enteric coatings for medicines. Other cosmetic uses include as a fixative for perfumes, although it is not as commonly used as DEP. Dimethyl phthalate is able to dissolve nitrocellulose which made it historically important in some automotive coatings and vanishes. === Insect repellent === DMP can be used as an insect repellent and is especially useful against ixodid ticks responsible for Lyme disease. DMP has been shown to deter species of mosquitoes such as Anopheles stephensi, Culex pipeins and Ades aegypti. == Metabolism/Biotransformation == DMP administered orally in rats largely undergoes phase I biotransformation to monomethyl phthalate (MMP) via hydrolysis in the liver and intestinal mucosa. MMP may also be further hydrolysed to phthalic acid. However, low molecular weight phthalates such as MMP are primarily excreted as monoesters and do not undergo phase II biotransformation processes such as hydroxylation and oxidation unlike the well-known banned molecule DEHP. == Human safety == Acute exposure to DMP via inhalation in humans and animals have shown to result in irritation to the eyes, nose and throat. Although some research has shown the association between the susceptibility of the reproductive system and phthalates esters, most phthalates demonstrate low acute toxicity. The chronic (long term) effects, reproductive effects, and carcinogenicity of DMP on humans and animals have yet to be fully established as compared to some other phthalate esters. This is due to insufficient animal evidence and inadequate lifetime-exposure carcinogenicity studies available. However, DMP does appear to have less potential towards inducing health hazards than other phthalates, such as DEHP and BBP. == Animal toxicity == Studies have shown that DMP is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of rats. After an orally administered dose of 0.1mL of DMP, about 77% of monomethyl phthalate and 8% of DMP have been detected in urine collected for 24 hours from male rats. Acute oral toxicity results in an LD50 of 8,2, 5,2, 2,9, 10,1 and 8,6 mg/kg for rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, chicks, and mice respectively. Another study on Sprague-Dawley albino rats resulted in a lower LD50 of 4,39 mg/kg in females and 5,12 mg/kg in males. Treatment was applied and for dead subjects, necropsy revealed toxic effects in the lungs, stomach and intestines of rats. Based on this animal data, DMP does not fit the definition of ''acute toxic'' under FHSA via oral exposure. === Hematoxicity === At high doses (1000 mg/kg), DMP may cause red blood cells (RBCs) to lose their oxygen-carrying function. In both in vitro and in vivo rat studies, DMP-incubated red blood cells released iron. Iron is the site of oxygen binding for hemoglobin, without it, hemoglobin is unable to bind to oxygen and transport it to the rest of the body. Release of iron from RBCs was not found in RBCs not incubated with DMP, nor at low and medium doses of DMP. One mechanism of iron release is the oxidative stress-induced on RBCs by DMP. A separate study found that the oxidative stress induced by DMP also decreased the immune functions of erythrocytes. The oxidative stress damages the structure and function of erythrocytes, in particular RBC-complement 3b (C3b) receptors. === Hepatotoxicity === Animal studies on oral exposure of DMP in rats have established hepatotoxic effects including increased liver weight, elevated alkaline phosphatase activity and reduced cholesterol and lipid levels. Increased liver weight was identified in rats exposed to DMP concentrations of approximately 1,860 mg/kg-day; heightened alkaline phosphatase activity (indicating liver damage) followed prolonged dosage of 500 mg/kg–day; lowered cholesterol and lipid levels were observed after exposure to 107 mg/kg-day. == Environmental toxicity == Environmental contamination by phthalates, inclusive of DMP, has been a pressing issue for human and marine health. DMP is readily released to the environment could potentially pose harmful risks of exposure on humans. Additionally, pollution of DMP into the environment could also be harmful to micro-organisms and aquatic animals. === Toxic effects on bacteria === A study on the environmental contamination of DMP has a direct influence on the cell function of Pseudomonas fluroescens (P. fluorescens), such as inhibition of growth, reduced glucose utilisation, etc. Results from the study suggest the presence of alterations in gene expressions that are involved in energy metabolism such as ATP-binding cassette transporters. Additionally, inhibition of the Cori cycle and glycolysis pathway by DMP were also observed in the bacteria. P. fluorescens, a Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacterium (PGPR), is an important bacteria found in soil, leaves and water that produces metabolites that allow plants to resist biotic and abiotic stresses. Hence, the release of DMP as waste into the environment should be more carefully considered. Another study shows the ability of DMP to inhibit the growth and glucose utilization of Pseudomonas fluorescens, a species that can cause bacteremia in humans. Most specifically, cell membrane deformation and membrane channels misopening were observed, as well as altered gene expression responsible of energy metabolism. === Aquatic toxicity === The toxicity of DMP on adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) was examined and showed oxidative damage after high concentrations of exposure. There was also found that antioxidant enzymes can be used as biochemical markers to identify the toxicant to be DMP. The LC50 after 96h of exposure was 45.8 mg/L, with 100% of mortality in the 200 mg/L exposure group. After 96h of exposure at high concentrations the activity levels of the primary antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione transferase activities were significantly reduced. This resulted in reduction of gene expression of these enzymes. Antioxidant enzymes act as defenders of cells from oxidant damage from contaminants present as free radicals that can cause enzyme inactivation, DNA and cholesterol damage and peroxidation of unsaturated fats in the cell membrane. The degree of lipid peroxidation in animals can be measured by following the trend in concentration of malondialdehyde, that is a product of lipid peroxidation. That is an indicator of DMP exposure. == Production and Business == Chittajit Mohan Dhar was a pioneer in the production of dimethyl phthalate and benzyl benzoate in India. Chittajit Mohan Dhar (C.M. Dhar) played a crucial role in pioneering the domestic production of Benzyl Benzoate at Perfect Chemical Industries Pvt. Ltd., located at 39 Dum Dum Road, Kolkata, West Bengal. This innovation was essential for defense applications, and by shifting production to Indian soil, the company saved the nation valuable foreign exchange, amounting to ₹1 crore annually. This move significantly reduced India's dependency on imports and demonstrated the company's ability to produce complex chemicals domestically. In addition, under Dhar's leadership, the company manufactured basic dyes such as Methylene Blue, Methyl Violet, Auramine, and Malachite Green, using indigenous plants and equipment. This commitment to self-reliant industrial processes was further evidenced by their production of Dimethyl Phthalate, another critical chemical for defense applications. The company's achievements in the chemical sector were recognized by Professor Humayun Kabir, then Union Minister for Petroleum and Chemical Industries, who visited the factory to commend the rapid progress and the substantial contribution to saving foreign exchange. This visit highlighted the national importance of the company’s advancements and its role in supporting India's industrial and defense sectors. == References ==",Dimethyl phthalate,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.0013271415373310447), ('U', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.006731830071657896), (' PERSONAL', -0.0028256813529878855), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IN', -0.10646706074476242), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', 0.0), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0009713222389109433), ('ĠPERSON', -0.0013318725395947695), ('AL', 0.0), ('ĠCARE', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31346702575683594)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/dimethyl-phthalate-uses-and-toxicity.htm,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_phthalate,https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/dimethyl-phthalate-diethyl-phthalate-and-dibutyl-phthalate/ ', [])"

This agent is similar to doxorubicin in chemotherapeutic activity, but unlike anthracyclines like doxorubicin, it exhibits little cardiotoxicity. In addition to its anthracycline-like activity, a July 2020 seminal article by Su, R et al. at the City of Hope Hospital in Los Angeles, California, USA first identified bisantrene to also be a potent (IC50 = 142nM) inhibitor of the Fat Mass and Obesity (FTO) associated protein, which is a m6A RNA demethylase. The same study found that bisantrene is a weak inhibitor of ALKBH5, which is the only other demethylase, i.e. bisantrene is also a selective inhibitor of FTO. In 2021, bisantrene was demonstrated preclinically to be cardioprotective when administered together with cardiotoxic anthracyclines. A bisantrene combination treatment is currently (as at early 2024) nearing the end of a Phase II clinical trial to assess its efficacy in treating AML in heavily pretreated patients and to assess any adverse side effects, including any cardiotoxicity of the combination. The December 2023 interim findings are given in the History section. == Medical uses == Clinical trials of Bisantrene in the 1980s showed efficacy in a range of leukaemias (including Acute Myeloid Leukaemia), breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. == Adverse Side Effects == High doses of bisantrene (above 200 mg/m2/day) cause adverse side effects typical of anthracycline chemotherapeutics. Common adverse side effects include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and inflammation of the mouth. For a chemotherapy drug, it is considered to have relatively low toxicity. Unlike other anthracycline chemotherapeutics, Bisantrene shows low levels of cardiotoxicity. In a Phase III metastatic breast cancer clinical, patients were exposed to cumulative doses in excess of 5440 mg/m2 without developing cardiac damage. The same study observed significantly lower rates of hair loss and nausea compared to patients given doxorubicin. == Three Mechanisms of Action == Bisantrene has three distinct mechanisms of action. Bisantrene contains an appropriately sized planar electron-rich chromophore to be a DNA intercalating agent, and in vitro, it is a potent inhibitor of DNA and RNA synthesis. Bisantrene is also a potent and selective inhibitor of the FTO enzyme, which is an m6A mRNA demethylase. Bisantrene acts by occupying FTO's catalytic pocket. This is a relatively recent discovery (July 2020). Finally, the University of Newcastle and the Hunter Medical Research Institute found in late 2021 preclinical research that bisantrene has a cardioprotective mechanism of action when administered together with a cardiotoxic drug such as doxorubicin. As at early 2024, the molecular basis for this cardioprotective effect hasn't been announced by the researchers. Bisantrene's cardioprotective mechanism of action is important because ""15 of the 35 commercially available anti-cancer drugs have direct cardiotoxic effects on HCM (human cardiomyocytes)."" According to the Australian Cardiovascular Alliance Cardio-Oncology Working Group , a drug which is simultaneously anticancer and cardioprotective is the ""Holy Grail"" of Cardio-Oncology. == History == Bisantrene was developed by Lederle Laboratories during the 1970s, a subsidiary of American Cyanamid, as a less cardiotoxic alternative to anthracyclines. Across the 1980s and early 1990s, over 40 clinical trials were conducted using Bisantrene. The National Cancer Institute (NCI)] undertook a large scale trial using Bisantrene under the name ""Orange Crush"", including a range of preclinical trials which found bisantrene to be inactive when taken orally, though was found to be efficacy towards some cancer cells intravenous, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous. In the 1980s, forty-four patients with metastatic breast cancer who had undergone extensive combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin and had failed to respond to the combination, were treated with bisantrene. From 40 patients that were evaluated, 9 showed a partial response, and 18 showed the cancer was not progressive but stabilised. Bisantrene was approved for human medical use in France in 1990 to target Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cancers. It has undergone 46 Phase II trials with 1,800 patients to test its efficacy against fighting cancer cells. The drug was delisted in the early 1990s due to a series of pharmaceutical mergers and acquisitions. In November 2019, researchers at the City of Hope Hospital in Los Angeles, California published that a drug with codename ""CS1"" is a potent and specific inihibitor of FTO, a m6A mRNA demethylase. This article didn't identify that ""CS1"" is actually bisantrene. In 2020 at Sheba Hospital, Tel Aviv, Israel, four out of 10 heavily pretreated AML patients responded to bisantrene administered as a single agent. All four of these responding patients had extramedullary disease. In July 2020, researchers at the City of Hope Hospital in Los Angeles, California published that bisantrene (for which they mostly used the codename ""CS1"") is a potent and specific inihibitor of FTO, a m6A mRNA demethylase. The fact that ""CS1"" is actually bisantrene is mentioned near the start of the Discussion section of the article. In 2021, researchers at the University of Chicago used bisantrene (which they referred to as ""CS1"", using the codename adopted by the City of Hope Hospital) to successfully inhibit FTO in a preclinical experiment. In a preclinical trial published in January 2022, researchers at the University of Lille used bisantrene to inhibit FTO in order to test whether an FTO inhibitor could potentially be used to treat disregulation of glucose metabolism in Type 2 diabetes. In 2022 researchers at the University of Texas tested a bisantrene, venetoclax and decitabine combination for AML preclinically. Based on the 2020 clinical study at Sheba Hospital and the two University of Texas pre-clinicals cited above, the most recent clinical trial is the one currently (as at early 2024) underway as a combination treatment for AML in heavily pretreated patients at Sheba Hospital, Tel Aviv, Israel. In the dose-finding stage, three out of six of the heavily pretreated patients were bridged to a bone marrow transplant. Interim results of the expansion stage were announced in December 2023 in a poster presented at the 2023 American Society of Haematologists conference. The results are promising for such heavily pre-treated patients. Six patients recovered sufficiently to be bridged to a bone marrow transplant. No cardiotoxity of the Bisantrene, Fludarabine and Clofarabin combination was observed. In November 2023, researchers at the University of Newcastle and at Race Oncology Limited jointly published a preclinical study in the peer-reviewed journal Blood. It found that bisanantrene is synergistic with the hypomethalating agent decitabine for treatment of AML. The researchers recommended that this combination should proceed to the clinic. == Alternate Names for Bisantrene == === Names === Bisantrene's chemical name is 9, 10-antrhracenedicarboxaldehydebis [(4, 5-dihydro-1H-imidazole-2-yl) hydrazine] dihydrochloride. Bisantrene was given the nickname “Orange Crush” in the 1980s due to its fluorescent orange color when in solution. Bisantrene is also sometimes referred to as ""CS1"" in cancer research journals, starting with the July 2020 seminal article by Su, R et al. The fact that ""CS1"" is actually bisantrene is mentioned near the start of the Discussion section of that article. == References ==",Bisantrene,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.029192859889008e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031861516181379557)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisantrene?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Bisantrene', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisantrene?utm_source=openai')])"
2490,"('Tamoxifen', '(z)-tamoxifen', 'Trans-tamoxifen', 'Crisafeno', 'Soltamox')",Medical,"Tamoxifen, sold under the brand name Nolvadex among others, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to prevent breast cancer in women and men. It is also being studied for other types of cancer. It has been used for Albright syndrome. Tamoxifen is typically taken daily by mouth for five years for breast cancer. Serious side effects include a small increased risk of uterine cancer, stroke, vision problems, and pulmonary embolism. Common side effects include irregular periods, weight loss, and hot flashes. It may cause harm to the baby if taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) and works by decreasing the growth of breast cancer cells. It is a member of the triphenylethylene group of compounds. Tamoxifen was initially made in 1962, by chemist Dora Richardson. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tamoxifen is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 317th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Dysmenorrhea === Dysmenorrhea is the term for menstrual pain, usually centered in the lower abdomen but often spreading to the back and inner thighs. It is a common gynecological condition that can seriously affect daily activities and well-being. Tamoxifen has been identified and used to effectively improve blood flow, reduce uterine contractility and pain in dysmenorrhea patients. === Breast cancer === Tamoxifen is used for the treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive or ER+) breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer; using tamoxifen with an intrauterine system releasing levonorgestrel might increase vaginal bleeding after 1 to 2 years, but reduces somewhat endometrial polyps and hyperplasia, but not necessarily endometrial cancer. Additionally, it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer. It is also approved by the FDA for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. The effectiveness of tamoxifen is primarily influenced by estrogen receptor (ER) status, which was the key predictor of the proportional benefits observed. It has been further approved for the reduction of contralateral (in the opposite breast) cancer. Five years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment significantly lowers the 15-year risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. The overall use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years. In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that raloxifene is also effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer. Updated results after an average of 6.75 years of follow up found that raloxifene retains 76% of tamoxifen's effectiveness in preventing invasive breast cancer, with 45% fewer uterine cancers and 25% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen. === Infertility === Tamoxifen is used for ovulation induction to treat infertility in women with anovulatory disorders. It is given at days three to seven of a woman's cycle. Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) via ER antagonism and thereby increasing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increasing testicular testosterone production. Some animal studies have suggested tamoxifen could have negative effects on sperm quality and prostatic and gonadal health. === Gynecomastia === Benign enlargement of the male breast, whether asymptomatic or painful, is a common condition thought to result from an increased estrogen/testosterone ratio or from heightened estrogenic or reduced androgenic activity via receptor interactions.Tamoxifen is used to prevent and treat gynecomastia. It is taken as a preventative measure in small doses, or used at the onset of any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Current treatments typically involve pain relief through medication or surgery. However, targeting the underlying estrogenic stimulation may offer a more specific therapeutic approach. In a double-blind crossover study, patients were given either a placebo or tamoxifen (10 mg orally twice daily) for one month, in random order. Seven out of ten patients saw a reduction in gynecomastia size with tamoxifen (P < 0.005), and the overall reduction for the group was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No benefits were observed with the placebo (P > 0.1). Additionally, all four patients with painful gynecomastia experienced relief of their symptoms, and no toxicity was noted. Although the breast size reduction was partial, this suggests that longer treatment may be necessary. Follow-up examinations conducted 9 to 12 months after treatment revealed no significant changes, except in two cases: one tamoxifen responder had a recurrence of breast tenderness after six months, and one non-responder developed increased breast size and new tenderness after ten months. Other medications are taken for similar purposes such as clomifene and aromatase inhibitor drugs; which are used in order to try to avoid the hormone-related adverse effects. Overall, tamoxifen appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for selected cases of gynecomastia. === Early puberty === Tamoxifen is useful in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to McCune–Albright syndrome, in both girls and boys. It has been found to decrease growth velocity and the rate of bone maturation in girls with precocious puberty, and hence to improve final height in these individuals. === Available forms === Tamoxifen is available as a tablet or oral solution. == Contraindications == Tamoxifen has a number of contraindications, including known hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or other ingredients, individuals taking concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulant therapy, and women with a history of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). == Side effects == A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. === Endometrial cancer === Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Even though it is an antagonist in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and has been linked to endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for five years. The American Cancer Society lists tamoxifen as a known carcinogen, stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence. === Cardiovascular and metabolic === Tamoxifen treatment of postmenopausal women is associated with beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. Use of tamoxifen has been shown to slightly increase risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. === Liver toxicity === Tamoxifen has been associated with a number of cases of hepatotoxicity. Several different varieties of hepatotoxicity have been reported. Tamoxifen can also precipitate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese and overweight women (not in normal weight women) at an average rate of 40% after a year use with 20 mg/day. == Overdose == Acute overdose of tamoxifen has not been reported in humans. In dose-ranging studies, tamoxifen was administered at very high doses in women (e.g., 300 mg/m2) and was found to produce acute neurotoxicity including tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness. These symptoms occurred within three to five days of therapy and disappeared within two to five days of discontinuation of therapy. No indications of permanent neurotoxicity were observed. QT prolongation was also observed with very high doses of tamoxifen. There is no specific antidote for overdose of tamoxifen. Instead, treatment should be based on symptoms. == Interactions == Patients with variant forms of the gene CYP2D6 may not receive full benefit from tamoxifen because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites. On 18 October 2006, the Subcommittee for Clinical Pharmacology recommended relabeling tamoxifen to include information about this gene in the package insert. Certain CYP2D6 variations in breast cancer patients lead to a worse clinical outcome for tamoxifen treatment. Genotyping therefore has the potential for identification of women who have these CYP2D6 phenotypes and for whom the use of tamoxifen is associated with poor outcomes. Recent research has shown that 7–10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen. Recent studies suggest that taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) can decrease the effectiveness of tamoxifen, as these drugs compete for the CYP2D6 enzyme which is needed to metabolize tamoxifen into its active forms. A U.S. study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in 2009 found that after two years, 7.5% of women who took only tamoxifen had a recurrence, compared with 16% who took either paroxetine, fluoxetine or sertraline, drugs considered to be the most potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. That difference translates to a 120% increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Patients taking the SSRIs Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Luvox (fluvoxamine) did not have an increased risk of recurrence, due to their lack of competitive metabolism for the CYP2D6 enzyme. A newer study demonstrated a clearer and stronger effect from paroxetine in causing the worst outcomes. Patients treated with both paroxetine and tamoxifen have a 67% increased risk of death from breast cancer, from 24% to 91%, depending on the duration of coadministration. Tamoxifen interacts with certain other antiestrogens. The aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide induces the metabolism of tamoxifen. Conversely, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole does not affect the metabolism of tamoxifen. However, tamoxifen induces the metabolism of letrozole and significantly reduces its concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Selective estrogen receptor modulator activity ==== Tamoxifen acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or as a partial agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, with its profile of effects differing by tissue. For instance, tamoxifen has predominantly antiestrogenic effects in the breasts but predominantly estrogenic effects in the uterus and liver. In breast tissue, tamoxifen acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited. A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER agonist (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting osteoclasts, it prevents osteoporosis. When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissues, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs. Tamoxifen is a long-acting SERM, with a nuclear retention of the ER–tamoxifen (or metabolite) complex of greater than 48 hours. It has relatively little affinity for the ERs itself and instead acts as a prodrug of active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen; 4-OHT). These metabolites have approximately 30 to 100 times greater affinity for the ERs than tamoxifen itself. Per one study, tamoxifen had 7% and 6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, whereas afimoxifene had 178% and 338% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Hence, afimoxifene showed 25-fold higher affinity for the ERα and 56-fold higher affinity for the ERβ than tamoxifen. The antiestrogenic potencies of endoxifen and afimoxifene are very similar. However, endoxifen occurs in much higher concentrations than afimoxifene and is now thought to be the major active form of tamoxifen in the body. Tamoxifen binds to ER competitively (with respect to the endogenous agonist estrogen) in tumor cells and other tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. It is a nonsteroidal agent with potent antiestrogenic properties which compete with estrogen for binding sites in breast and other tissues. Tamoxifen causes cells to remain in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal. Tamoxifen binds to ER, the ER/tamoxifen complex recruits other proteins known as co-repressors, and the complex then binds to DNA to modulate gene expression. Some of these proteins include NCoR and SMRT. Tamoxifen function can be regulated by a number of different variables including growth factors. Tamoxifen needs to block growth factor proteins such as ErbB2/HER2 because high levels of ErbB2 have been shown to occur in tamoxifen resistant cancers. Tamoxifen seems to require a protein PAX2 for its full anticancer effect. In the presence of high PAX2 expression, the tamoxifen/ER complex is able to suppress the expression of the pro-proliferative ERBB2 protein. In contrast, when AIB-1 expression is higher than PAX2, tamoxifen/ER complex upregulates the expression of ERBB2 resulting in stimulation of breast cancer growth. Tamoxifen is antigonadotropic in postmenopausal women and partially suppresses levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in such women. However, it has progonadotropic effects in premenopausal women and increases estrogen levels by 6-fold in them. Due to the nature of tamoxifen as a competitive ER ligand, this increase in estrogen levels is liable to interfere with the antiestrogenic efficacy of tamoxifen. The effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer Ki-67 expression, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and IGF-1 levels are dose-dependent across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day in women with breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels by 17 to 38% in women and men. Suppression of IGF-1 production in the liver is a well-known action of estrogens and SERMs. A 10 mg/day dosage of tamoxifen is nearly as effective as a 20 mg/day dosage in suppressing IGF-1 levels. ==== Other activities ==== Afimoxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) with relatively low affinity. Its affinity for the receptor is in the range of 100 to 1,000 nM, relative to 3 to 6 nM for estradiol. In addition to its activity as a SERM, afimoxifene binds to both the estrogen-related receptor β and estrogen-related receptor γ and is an antagonist of the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ). Norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), another active metabolite of tamoxifen, has been found to act as a potent competitive aromatase inhibitor (IC50 = 90 nM), and may also be involved in the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen. In addition to its activity as a SERM, tamoxifen is a potent and selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and is active in this regard at therapeutic concentrations. This action is thought to underlie the efficacy of tamoxifen in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Tamoxifen is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. In 2018, it was discovered that tamoxifen directly interacts with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and acts as an atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). It has weak potency (54% inhibition of dopamine uptake at 10 μM) and lacks any stimulant or depressant effects when administered by itself. However, tamoxifen dose-dependently blocks amphetamine-mediated dopamine release and psychostimulant-like effects in animals. This unusual profile of DRI activity has made tamoxifen of potential interest as a starting point for structural modification to develop novel pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of stimulant use disorder. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Tamoxifen is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the intestines with oral administration. The oral bioavailability of tamoxifen is approximately 100%, which is suggestive of minimal first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Following intake, peak levels of tamoxifen occur after three to seven hours. Steady state levels of tamoxifen are reached typically after 3 to 4 weeks but possibly up to 16 weeks of daily administration. Steady state levels of afimoxifene are achieved after 8 weeks of daily tamoxifen administration. Peak levels of tamoxifen after a single 40 mg oral dose were 65 ng/mL and steady state levels at 20 mg/day were 310 ng/mL. Levels of tamoxifen show clear dose dependency across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day. Endoxifen levels are approximately 5 to 10 times higher than afimoxifene levels, with large interindividual variability. Endoxifen levels have been reported as 10.8 to 15.9 ng/mL at steady state in CYP2D6 normal metabolizers during therapy with 20 mg/day tamoxifen. The most abundant metabolites of tamoxifen in terms of circulating concentrations are N-desmethyltamoxifen, N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen, (Z)-endoxifen, and tamoxifen N-oxide. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of tamoxifen is 50 to 60 L/kg and its clearance has been estimated as 1.2 to 5.1 L/hour. High concentrations of tamoxifen have been found in breast, uterus, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, and ovary tissue in animals and humans. Levels of tamoxifen in the uterus have been found to be 2- to 3-fold higher than in the circulation and in the breasts 10-fold higher than in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of tamoxifen and afimoxifene is greater than 99%. A majority of tamoxifen is bound to albumin. Albumin alone binds 98.8% of tamoxifen while other plasma proteins are not greatly involved. ==== Metabolism ==== Tamoxifen is a prodrug and is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 into active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen). Conversion of tamoxifen by N-demethylation into N-desmethyltamoxifen, which is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, is responsible for approximately 92% of tamoxifen metabolism. Conversely, 4-hydroxylation of tamoxifen into afimoxifene is responsible for only about 7% of tamoxifen metabolism. Following its formation, N-desmethyltamoxifen is oxidized into several other metabolites, the most notable of which is endoxifen. Another active metabolite, norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), is formed via N-demethylation of endoxifen or 4-hydroxylation of N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites undergo conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Tamoxifen may inhibit its own metabolism. ==== Elimination ==== Tamoxifen has a long elimination half-life of typically 5 to 7 days, with a range of 4 to 11 days. Similarly, the half-life of afimoxifene is 14 days. Conversely, the half-life of endoxifen is 50 to 70 hours (2–3 days). The long half-lives of tamoxifen and afimoxifene are attributed to their high plasma protein binding as well as to enterohepatic recirculation. Upon discontinuation of treatment, levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites persist in the circulation for at least 6 weeks. Tamoxifen is excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces, while small amounts are eliminated in urine. == Chemistry == Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal SERM of the triphenylethylene family and was structurally derived from diethylstilbestrol-like estrogens and antiestrogens such as chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol. Initially, clomifene was synthesized, and tamoxifen was developed subsequently. Tamoxifen is closely related structurally to other triphenylethylenes, such as clomifene, nafoxidine, ospemifene, toremifene, and numerous others. Other SERMs, like raloxifene, are structurally distinct from tamoxifen and other triphenylethylenes. == History == In the late 1950s, pharmaceutical companies were actively researching a newly discovered class of anti-estrogen compounds in the hope of developing a morning-after contraceptive pill. Arthur L Walpole was a reproductive endocrinologist who led such a team at the Alderley Park research laboratories of ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was there in 1962 that chemist Dora Richardson first synthesized tamoxifen, back then known as ICI-46,474, when she was looking to create triphenylethylene derivatives for the contraceptive pill project that her team was researching. This compound was originally created to work as an estrogen inhibitor, but instead was found to stimulate ovulation in participants of the drug testing trial. Walpole and his colleagues filed a UK patent covering this compound in 1962, but patent protection on this compound was repeatedly denied in the US until the 1980s. Tamoxifen did eventually receive marketing approval as a fertility treatment, but the class of compounds never proved useful in human contraception. A link between estrogen and breast cancer had been known for many years, but cancer treatments were not a corporate priority at the time, and Walpole's personal interests were important in keeping support for the compound alive in the face of this and the lack of patent protection. It was only when Walpole threatened to leave his position that corporate decided to allow trials and testing for tamoxifen as a drug that could be used to treat breast cancer. Without Walpole's effort towards defending the work that his team had done in discovering a possibly revolutionary source for breast cancer treatment, tamoxifen could have become a discarded or under-researched idea. Walpole's team consisted of Dora Richardson and G. A. Snow, who worked on the chemistry portion of the project, along with G. E. Paget and J. K. Walley, who focused primarily on the biological side. Tamoxifen is one of three drugs in an anti-angiogenetic protocol developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that angiogenesis – the growth of new blood vessels – plays a significant role in the development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on angiogenesis inhibitors have been underway since 1992 using many different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of celecoxib, doxycycline, and tamoxifen – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol. Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties. Other antiestrogens, such as ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) and clomifene (MRL-41), were assessed for treatment of breast cancer and found to be effective before tamoxifen, but were plagued with toxicity issues. The first clinical study of tamoxifen took place at the Christie Hospital in 1971, and showed a convincing effect in advanced breast cancer, but nevertheless ICI's development programme came close to termination when it was reviewed in 1972. In an unpublished article from the early days of the trial, Dora Richardson documented her team's excitement about tamoxifen's effects in counteracting infertility problems and the early positive effects found in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this work was not well received by everyone, as the team was supposed to be looking for a contraceptive pill. Tamoxifen's further development may have been bolstered by a second clinical study by Harold W.C. Ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Ward's study showed a more definitive response to the drug at a higher dosage. Walpole also may have helped to convince the company to market tamoxifen for late stage breast cancer in 1973. He was also instrumental in funding V. Craig Jordan to work on tamoxifen. In 1972, ICI Pharmaceuticals Division abandoned development of tamoxifen for financial reasons. The drug was subsequently reinvented from a failed contraceptive, to become tamoxifen, the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and the pioneering medicine for chemprevention for high-risk women. Two books, Estrogen Action, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Women's Health (Imperial College Press 2013) and Tamoxifen: Pioneering Medicine in Breast Cancer (Springer 2013) tell this story. 1980 saw the publication of the first trial to show that tamoxifen given in addition to chemotherapy improved survival for patients with early breast cancer. In advanced disease, tamoxifen is now only recognized as effective in ER+ patients, but the early trials did not select ER+ patients, and by the mid-1980s the clinical trial picture was not showing a major advantage for tamoxifen. Nevertheless, tamoxifen had a relatively mild side-effect profile, and a number of large trials continued. The pharmacology of SERMs was discovered, defined, and deciphered during the 1980s. A clinical strategy was described that led to the creation of SERMs as a group of multifunctional medicines aimed at the treatment or prevention of many conditions in postmenopausal women, e.g. osteoporosis and breast cancer. The early sales of tamoxifen in both the UK and in the U.S. far exceeded ICI's original estimate, but despite this, at the annual portfolio review ICI's board members still asserted that ""there was no market for cancer"", leaving the drug's marketing success to rely on its clinical results and clinicians' and scientists' interests in it. Shortly after, Dora Richardson published a history of tamoxifen that, unusually for that type of paper, included personal accounts and letters from patients who attributed their healing to the drug. This testimony from cancer patients using tamoxifen helped to shape and push forward research, by justifying it both morally and scientifically to corporations. It was not until 1998 that the meta-analysis of the Oxford-based Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed definitively that tamoxifen was effective for early breast cancer. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Tamoxifen is marketed under the brand names Nolvadex and Soltamox, and a variety of other brand names throughout the world. === Economics === Global sales of tamoxifen in 2001 were approximately $1.02 billion. Since the expiration of the patent in 2002, it is widely available as a generic drug around the world. As of 2004, tamoxifen was the world's largest selling hormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer. == Research == In McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) tamoxifen has been used to treat premature puberty and the consequences of premature puberty. Tamoxifen has been seen to decrease rapid bone maturation which is the result of excessive estrogen and alter predicted adult height (PAH). The same effects have also been seen in short pubertal boys. However, one in vitro study in 2007 and later an in vivo study in 2008 have shown that tamoxifen induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researchers to express concern giving tamoxifen to growing individuals. Tamoxifen has been studied in the treatment of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal fibrosis and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis. It has also been proposed as part of a treatment plan for Riedel's thyroiditis. Tamoxifen is used as a research tool to trigger tissue-specific gene expression in many conditional expression constructs in genetically modified animals including a version of the Cre-Lox recombination technique. While widely used in transgenic research, the strong anabolic effect of tamoxifen on bone might confound this approach, especially as it relates to bone-targeted constructs. Tamoxifen may be effective in the treatment of mania in people with bipolar disorder. This is thought to be due to blockade of protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme that regulates neuron activity in the brain. Researchers believe PKC is overactive during the mania in bipolar patients. As of September 2019, endoxifen, a major active metabolite of tamoxifen with a 4-fold more potent PKC inhibition, was in phase III clinical trials for bipolar disorder. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2014).

2493,"('N-dodecyl-œ≤-d-maltoside', 'Lauryl maltoside', 'N-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside', 'Dodecyl maltoside', 'Dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside')",Medical," The present study confirms the previous reports that detergents can facilitate the reactivation of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) denatured rhodanese (Tandon, S. and Horowitz, P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15615-15618; Tandon, S. and Horowitz, P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4486-4491). Here, we report the effect of the detergent, lauryl maltoside, on the reactivation of several enzymes other than rhodanese. For this study we used five different enzymes each having a single polypeptide chain, namely: adenosine deaminase; 3-phosphoglyceric phosphokinase; myokinase; 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; and phosphoglucomutase. The regain of enzyme activity was used to monitor refolding. Like rhodanese, these enzymes were denatured in 6 M GdmCl and diluted into a buffer containing various concentrations of lauryl maltoside. The effect of lauryl maltoside on reactivating these proteins depended on the specific enzyme used. For example, in the presence of lauryl maltoside, reactivation of adenosine deaminase increased to 98%, while phosphoglucomutase could not be reactivated significantly. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of lauryl maltoside was measured under the present experimental conditions using 2-(p-toluidinyl)naphthalene 6-sulfonate (TNS) as an apolar fluorescent probe, and gave a value of 0.085 mg.ml-1 in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). The reactivating effect of lauryl maltoside was not generally related to its CMC. In some cases an induction period was observed before the enzyme attained its steady-state velocity. This might suggest the presence of intermediate(s) in the refolding pathway that could have been stabilized by the detergent. These findings indicate that 'non-denaturing' detergents may be useful for assisting reactivation of enzymes, although the optimum conditions will have to be determined for each individual case. For the first time, the enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase; EC 2.8.1.1) has been renatured from 6 M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) by direct dilution of the denaturant at relatively high protein concentrations. This has been made possible by using the nonionic detergent dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside (lauryl maltoside). Lauryl maltoside concentration dependence of the renaturation and reactivation time courses were studied using 50 micrograms/ml rhodanese. There was no renaturation at lauryl maltoside (less than 0.1 mg/ml), and the renaturability increased, apparently cooperatively, up to 5 mg/ml detergent. This may reflect weak binding of lauryl maltoside to intermediate rhodanese conformers. The renaturability began to decrease above 5 mg/ml lauryl maltoside and was significantly reduced at 20 mg/ml. Individual progress curves of product formation, for rhodanese diluted into lauryl maltoside 90 min before assay, showed induction phases as long as 7 min before an apparently linear steady state. The induction phase increased with lauryl maltoside concentration and could even be observed in native controls above 1 mg/ml detergent. These results are consistent with suggestions that refolding of GdmCl-denatured rhodanese involves an intermediate with exposed hydrophobic surfaces that can partition into active and inactive species. Further, lauryl maltoside can stabilize those surfaces and prevent aggregation and other hydrophobic interaction-dependent events that reduce the yield of active protein. The rhodanese-lauryl maltoside complex could also form with native enzyme, thus explaining the induction phase with this species. Finally, it is suggested that renaturation of many proteins might be assisted by lauryl maltoside or other ""nondenaturing"" detergents. Interaction of lauryl maltoside (LM) surfactant with bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) has been studied by NMR techniques. Detailed 2-D (1)H and (13)C NMR techniques were used to assign the NMR signals of the surfactant nuclei. Paramagnetic dipolar shift of the surfactant (13)C NMR signals were used to identify the atoms close to the enzyme. The diamagnetic carbon monoxide complex of CcO did not cause any shift in the surfactant NMR spectra suggesting that the paramagnetic centres of the native CcO cause the shifts by dipolar interactions. The results showed that the polar head groups of the surfactant comprised of two maltoside rings are more affected, while the hydrophobic tail groups did not show any significant change on binding of the surfactant to the enzyme. This indicated that surfactant head groups possibly bind to the enzyme surface and the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant forms micelles and remains away from the enzyme. Based on the results, we propose that the membrane bound enzyme is possibly stabilised in aqueous solution by association with the micelles of the neutral surfactant so that the polar heads of the micelles bind to the polar surface of the enzyme. These micelles might form a 'belt like' structure around the enzyme helping it to remain monodispersed in the active form.",Lauryl maltoside,PUBMED,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.02976229228079319), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.47840774059295654), ('DU', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.387005478143692)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.330317884683609), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.16022524237632751), (' PERSONAL', -3.5597102396423e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6250583/?utm_source=openai), [agscientific.com](https://agscientific.com/products/detergents/detergents-a-z/n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltopyranoside-1-g.html?utm_source=openai), [invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/dodecyl-maltoside.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=327, start_index=12, title='Alkyl glycoside detergents: a simpler synthesis and their effects on kinetic and physical properties of cytochrome c oxidase - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6250583/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=327, start_index=12, title='D-1304-1GM - n-Dodecyl-Beta-D-maltopyranoside, 1 G', type='url_citation', url='https://agscientific.com/products/detergents/detergents-a-z/n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltopyranoside-1-g.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=327, start_index=12, title='Dodecyl maltoside | surfactant agent | CAS# 69227-93-6 | InvivoChem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/dodecyl-maltoside.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Two minor peptides were also identified as [1-aspartic acid, 5-valine, 9-glycine] angiotensin I (II) and [5-valine, 9-glycine] angiotensin I-(3-10)-octapeptide (III). These structures were further confirmed by comparison of these peptides on high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) with the synthetic peptides and the tryptic and chymotryptic digests of the synthetic and natural angiotensins. In the rat pressor bioassays, the synthetic decapeptides I and II possessed 45.4 and 52.2%, respectively, of the pressor activity of [1-aspartic acid, 5-isoleucine] angiotensin II. The pressor activity of I and II was blocked with the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Study of the conversion of asparaginyl decapeptide into aspartyl decapeptide in eel plasma indicated that the presence of thimerosal (sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate) in the incubation mixture inhibited the conversion of I into II. These results suggest that (a) I is the natural form of angiotensin inherent in the American eel while II may be formed during incubation with plasma; (b) eel plasma contains an enzyme which is capable of converting asparaginyl angiotensins into aspartyl angiotensins; and (c) pressor activity of I and II is due to their conversion into the corresponding octapeptides. In a previous work when thimerosal was not included in the incubation mixture, the major peptide produced by incubation of Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) plasma with its kidney extract was identified as II.

2496,"('Tobramycin', 'Nebramycin factor 6', 'Deoxykanamycin b', 'Nebramycin 6', 'Nebcin')",Medical,"Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from Streptomyces tenebrarius that is used to treat various types of bacterial infections, particularly Gram-negative infections. It is especially effective against species of Pseudomonas. It was patented in 1965, and approved for medical use in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 281st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Tobramycin does not pass the gastro-intestinal tract, so for systemic use it can only be given intravenously or by injection into a muscle. Eye drops and ointments (tobramycin only, Tobrex, or combined with dexamethasone, sold as Tobradex) and nebulised formulations both have low systemic absorption. The formulation for injection is branded Nebcin. The nebulised formulation (brand name Tobi) is indicated in the treatment of exacerbations of chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Tobramycin eye drops (with or without dexamethasone) are indicated in the treatment of superficial infections of the eye, such as bacterial conjunctivitis. Tobramycin, in its injectable form, is also indicated for various severe or life-threatening infections caused by susceptible strains: sepsis, meningitis, lower respiratory tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, skin infections, bone infections, and skin structure infections, complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections. === Spectrum of susceptibility === Tobramycin has a narrow spectrum of activity and is active against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and various Gram-negative bacteria. Clinically, tobramycin is frequently used to eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients. The following represents the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility data for a few strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Pseudomonas aeruginosa - <0.25 μg/mL – 92 μg/mL Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) – 0.5 μg/mL - >512 μg/mL Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) – 0.5 μg/mL – 2 μg/mL The MIC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, KP-1, is 2.3±0.2 μg/mL at 25 °C [unpublished]. == Contraindications == Tobramycin is contraindicated in people with hypersensitivity against aminoglycoside antibiotics. The Infusion is also contraindicated in people with myasthenia gravis. == Side effects == Like other aminoglycosides, a major side effect for tobramycin is ototoxicity or a loss of equilibrioception, or both in genetically susceptible individuals. Other side effects include nephrotoxicity, neuromuscular toxicity, and hypersensitivity reactions. Nephrotoxicity can be particularly worrisome when multiple doses accumulate over the course of a treatment or when the kidney concentrates urine by increasing tubular reabsorption during sleep. Adequate hydration may help prevent excess nephrotoxicity and subsequent loss of renal function. For these reasons parenteral tobramycin needs to be carefully dosed by body weight, and its serum concentration monitored. Tobramycin is thus said to be a drug with a narrow therapeutic index. == Interactions == Muscle relaxants and diethylether can add to the neuromuscular blocking effects of tobramycin. Methoxyflurane, when used as an inhalational anesthetic, can aggravate the nephrotoxic effects of injected tobramycin. Likewise, combining injected tobramycin with other nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs can lead to more adverse effects; examples include amphotericin B, ciclosporin, cisplatin, vancomycin, and the diuretic furosemide. Other diuretics can also increase the risk for side effects because they raise tobramycin concentrations in the body fluids. Combining tobramycin with beta-lactam antibiotics can be desirable because of their synergistic effects. However, when they are given through the same drip, as well as in people with reduced kidney function, they can react with each other to form antibiotically inactive amides. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tobramycin works by binding to a site on the bacterial 30S and 50S ribosome, preventing formation of the 70S complex. As a result, mRNA cannot be translated into protein, and cell death ensues. Tobramycin also binds to RNA-aptamers, artificially created molecules to bind to certain targets. However, there seems to be no indication that Tobramycin binds to natural RNAs or other nucleic acids. The effect of tobramycin can be inhibited by metabolites of the Krebs (TCA) cycle, such as glyoxylate. These metabolites protect against tobramycin lethality by diverting carbon flux away from the TCA cycle, collapsing cellular respiration, and thereby inhibiting Tobramycin uptake and thus lethality. === Pharmacokinetics === Tobramycin is not absorbed in the gut. When given as infusion, it is distributed in the extracellular fluid. It can accumulate in the kidney's tubular cells and in the lymph of the inner ear. Only low concentrations reach the central nervous system and breast milk. Tobramycin passes the placenta: in the fetus, 20% of the mother's concentrations have been measured. The substance is neither bound to plasma proteins, nor is it metabolized. It is excreted in unchanged form via the kidneys with a biological half-life of about 2 to 3 hours. Elimination from deep compartments such as the renal cortex follows after 8 to 12 hours. In newborns the half-life is 4.6 hours on average; in those with a low birth weight it is as long as 8.7 hours on average. People with reduced kidney function also have a longer half-life for tobramycin, while in those with severe burns it can be shorter. == Society and culture == Tobramycin was patented in 1965, and approved for medical use in 1974. Tobramycin is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, tobramycin was the 281st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 600,000 prescriptions. Tobrex eye drops are a 0.3% tobramycin sterile ophthalmic solution produced by Alcon Pharmaceuticals.

2498,"('Butylated hydroxytoluene', 'Butylhydroxytoluene', 'Ionol', 'Dibunol', 'Stavox')","Food, Medical, Personal Care, Industrial","Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), also known as dibutylhydroxytoluene, is a lipophilic organic compound, chemically a derivative of phenol, that is useful for its antioxidant properties. BHT is widely used to prevent free radical-mediated oxidation in fluids (e.g. fuels, oils) and other materials, and the regulations overseen by the U.S. F.D.A.—which considers BHT to be ""generally recognized as safe""—allow small amounts to be added to foods. Despite this, and the earlier determination by the National Cancer Institute that BHT was noncarcinogenic in an animal model, societal concerns over its broad use have been expressed. BHT has also been postulated as an antiviral drug, but as of December 2022, use of BHT as a drug is not supported by the scientific literature and it has not been approved by any drug regulatory agency for use as an antiviral. == Natural occurrence == Phytoplankton, including the green algae Botryococcus braunii, as well as three different cyanobacteria (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Microcystis aeruginosa and Oscillatoria sp.) are capable of producing BHT as a natural product. The fruit lychee also produces BHT in its pericarp. Several fungi (for example Aspergillus conicus) living in olives produce BHT. == Production == === Industrial production === The chemical synthesis of BHT in industry has involved the reaction of p-cresol (4-methylphenol) with isobutylene (2-methylpropene), catalyzed by sulfuric acid: CH3(C6H4)OH + 2 CH2=C(CH3)2 → ((CH3)3C)2CH3C6H2OH Alternatively, BHT has been prepared from 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol by hydroxymethylation or aminomethylation followed by hydrogenolysis. == Reactions == The species behaves as a synthetic analog of vitamin E, primarily acting as a terminating agent that suppresses autoxidation, a process whereby unsaturated (usually) organic compounds are attacked by atmospheric oxygen. BHT stops this autocatalytic reaction by converting peroxy radicals to hydroperoxides. It effects this function by donating a hydrogen atom: RO2• + ArOH → ROOH + ArO• RO2• + ArO• → nonradical products where R is alkyl or aryl, and where ArOH is BHT or related phenolic antioxidants. Each BHT consumes two peroxy radicals. The electron-donating alkyl groups on the ortho and para positions of BHT increase the electron density of the phenolic hydroxyl moiety through the inductive effect and the hyperconjugation effect, reduce the bond dissociation energy of the phenolic hydroxyl group, and enhance its reactivity to lipid free radicals. Meanwhile, the phenoxy radical generated by BHT is stabilized due to the delocalization of unpaired electrons around the aromatic ring and the steric hindrance effect of ortho tert-butyl groups. Isobutene is one of the possible degradation products formed by BHT oxidation with computational studies suggesting that there are two possible mechanism that can lead to isobutene formation with the OH addition pathways at the C2 site of BHT more likely to result in isobutene formation than pathways of H abstracts from the t-butyl group. == Applications == BHT is listed by the NIH Hazardous Substances Data Bank under several categories in catalogues and databases, such as food additive, household product ingredient, industrial additive, personal care product/cosmetic ingredient, pesticide ingredient, plastic/rubber ingredient and medical/veterinary/research. === Food additive === BHT is primarily used as an antioxidant food additive. In the United States, it is classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) based on a National Cancer Institute study from 1979 in rats and mice. It is approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration: For example, 21 CFR § 137.350(a)(4) allows BHT up to 0.0033% by weight in ""enriched rice"", while 9 CFR § 381.147](f)(1) allows up to 0.01% in poultry ""by fat content"". It is permitted in the European Union under E321. BHT is used as a preservative ingredient in some foods. With this usage BHT maintains freshness or prevents spoilage; it may be used to decrease the rate at which the texture, color, or flavor of food changes. Some food companies have voluntarily eliminated BHT from their products or have announced that they were going to phase it out. === Antioxidant === BHT is also used as an antioxidant in products such as metalworking fluids, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, rubber, transformer oils, and embalming fluid. In the petroleum industry, where BHT is known as the fuel additive AO-29 (Innospec), it is used in hydraulic fluids, turbine and gear oils, and jet fuels. BHT is also used to prevent peroxide formation in organic ethers and other solvents and laboratory chemicals. It is added to certain monomers as a polymerisation inhibitor to facilitate their safe storage. Some additive products contain BHT as their primary ingredient, while others contain the chemical merely as a component of their formulation, sometimes alongside butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). === Cosmetics === The European Union restricts the use of BHT in mouthwash to 0.001% concentration, in toothpaste to 0.01% concentration, and to 0.8% in other cosmetics. == Health effects == Like many closely related phenol antioxidants, BHT has low acute toxicity (e.g., the desmethyl analog of BHT, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, has an LD50 of >9 g/kg). The US Food and Drug Administration classifies BHT as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food preservative when used in an approved manner. In 1979, the National Cancer Institute determined that BHT was noncarcinogenic in a mouse model. The World Health Organization discussed a possible link between BHT and cancer risk in a 1986 report concluding there is limited evidence for carcinogenicity from animal studies. Primary research studies in the 1970s–1990s reported both potential for increased risk and potential for decreased risk in the area of oncology. A review report published in 2002 noted that BHT has shown anticarcinogenic effects, no effect, or tumor promoting effects depending on animal species and target organ considered. Because of this uncertainty, the Center for Science in the Public Interest puts BHT in its ""caution"" column and recommends avoiding it. Based on various, disparate primary research reports, BHT has been suggested to have anti-viral activity, and the reports divide into various study types. First, there are studies that describe virus inactivation—where treatment with the chemical results in disrupted or otherwise inactivated virus particles. The action of BHT in these is akin to the action of many other organic compounds, e.g., quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolics, and detergents, which disrupt viruses by insertion of the chemical into the virus membrane, coat, or other structure, which are established methods of viral disinfection secondary to methods of chemical oxidation and UV irradiation. In addition, there is a report of BHT use, topically against genital herpes lesions, a report of inhibitory activity in vitro against pseudorabies (in cell culture), and two studies, in veterinary contexts, of use of BHT to attempt to protect against virus exposure (pseudorabies in mouse and swine, and Newcastle in chickens). The relevance of other reports, regarding influenza in mice, is not easily discerned. Notably, this series of primary research reports does not support a general conclusion of independent confirmation of the original research results, nor are there critical reviews appearing thereafter, in secondary sources, for the various host-virus systems studied with BHT. Hence, at present, the results do not present a scientific consensus in favour of the conclusion of the general antiviral potential of BHT when dosed in humans. Moreover, as of March 2020, no guidance from any of the internationally recognized associations of infectious disease specialists had advocated use of BHT products as an antiviral therapy or prophylactic. == References == == External links == Chemistry of BHA and BHT Food Preservatives CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards",Butylhydroxytoluene,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.08956342190504074), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' INDUSTR', -0.5759974122047424), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -4.36574100604048e-06), (' PERSONAL', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.09115961939096451), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -6.639736966462806e-05), ('ĠINDU', -0.3133799135684967), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0009140365873463452), ('ĠPERSON', -6.210611172718927e-05), ('AL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.0847986231965479e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20143282413482666)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.031622741371393204), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.3132977783679962), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -1.1472419600977446e-06), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD,PERSONAL CARE,INDUSTRIAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/inactive/butylated-hydroxytoluene-304.html?utm_source=openai), [sup.ai](https://sup.ai/articles/science/understanding-butylated-hydroxytoluene-bht-and-its-uses?utm_source=openai), [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/butylated-hydroxytoluene?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=375, start_index=31, title='Butylated Hydroxytoluene: What is it and where is it used?', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/inactive/butylated-hydroxytoluene-304.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=375, start_index=31, title='Understanding Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) and Its Uses', type='url_citation', url='https://sup.ai/articles/science/understanding-butylated-hydroxytoluene-bht-and-its-uses?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=375, start_index=31, title='Butylated Hydroxytoluene - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics', type='url_citation', url='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/butylated-hydroxytoluene?utm_source=openai')])"

2502,"('Azacitidine', 'Ladakamycin', 'Azacytidine', 'Vidaza', 'Mylosar')",Medical,"Azacitidine, sold under the brand name Vidaza among others, is a medication used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloid leukemia, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. It is a chemical analog of cytidine, a nucleoside in DNA and RNA. Azacitidine and its deoxy derivative, decitabine (also known as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) were first synthesized in Czechoslovakia as potential chemotherapeutic agents for cancer. The most common adverse reactions in children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia include pyrexia, rash, upper respiratory tract infection, and anemia. == Medical uses == Azacitidine is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, for which it received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 19 May 2004. In two randomized controlled trials comparing azacitidine to supportive treatment, 16% of subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome who were randomized to receive azacitidine had a complete or partial normalization of blood cell counts and bone marrow morphology, compared to none who received supportive care, and about two-thirds of patients who required blood transfusions no longer needed them after receiving azacitidine. Azacitidine is also indicated for the treatment of myeloid leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The combination of azacitidine and venetoclax is also approved for AML. == Mechanism of action == Azacitidine is a chemical analogue of the nucleoside cytidine, which is present in DNA and RNA. It is thought to have antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms – at low doses, by inhibiting of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and at high doses, by its direct cytotoxicity to abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA, resulting in cell death. Azacitidine is a ribonucleoside, so it is incorporated into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. In contrast, decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a deoxyribonucleoside, so it can only incorporate into DNA. Azacitidine's incorporation into RNA leads to the disassembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and inhibition of the production of proteins. Its incorporation into DNA leads to covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequently leads to cytotoxicity. It has been shown effective against human immunodeficiency virus in vitro and human T-lymphotropic virus. === Inhibition of methylation === After azanucleosides such as azacitidine have been metabolized to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-triphosphate (aka, decitabine-triphosphate), they can be incorporated into DNA and azacytosine can be substituted for cytosine. Azacytosine-guanine dinucleotides are recognized as substrate by the DNA methyltransferases, which catalyze the methylation reaction by a nucleophilic attack. This results in a covalent bond between the carbon-6 atom of the cytosine ring and the enzyme. The bond is normally resolved by beta-elimination through the carbon-5 atom, but this latter reaction does not occur with azacytosine because its carbon-5 is substituted by nitrogen, leaving the enzyme covalently bound to DNA and blocking its DNA methyltransferase function. In addition, the covalent protein adduction also compromises the functionality of DNA and triggers DNA damage signaling, resulting in the degradation of trapped DNA methyltransferases. As a consequence, methylation marks become lost during DNA replication. == Toxicity == Azacitidine causes anemia (low red blood cell counts), neutropenia (low white blood cell counts), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), and patients should have frequent monitoring of their complete blood counts, at least prior to each dosing cycle. The dose may have to be adjusted based on nadir counts and hematologic response. It can also be hepatotoxic in patients with severe liver impairment, and patients with extensive liver tumors due to metastatic disease have developed progressive hepatic coma and death during azacitidine treatment, especially when their albumin levels are less than 30 g/L. It is contraindicated in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors. Kidney toxicity, ranging from elevated serum creatinine to kidney failure and death, have been reported in patients treated with intravenous azacitidine in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for conditions other than myelodysplastic syndrome. Renal tubular acidosis developed in five patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (an unapproved use) treated with azacitidine and etoposide, and patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk for renal toxicity. Azacitidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted by the kidneys, so patients with chronic kidney disease should be closely monitored for other side effects, since their levels of azacitidine may progressively increase. Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, azacitidine can cause severe fetal damage. Sexually active women of reproductive potential should use contraception while receiving azacitidine and for one week after the last dose, and sexually active men with female partners of reproductive potential should use contraception during treatment and for three months following the last dose. A study undertaken to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of a single-day exposure to Azacytidine (5-AzaC) on neurobehavioral abnormalities in mice found, that the inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-AzaC treatment causes neurodegeneration and impairs extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation and the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated (Arc) protein expression in neonatal mice and induces behavioral abnormalities in adult mice, as DNA methylation-mediated mechanisms appear to be necessary for the proper maturation of synaptic circuits during development, and disruption of this process by 5-AzaC could lead to abnormal cognitive function. Azacitidine can also cause nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, redness at its injection sites, constipation, bruising, petechiae, rigors, weakness, abnormally low potassium levels in the bloodstream, and many other side effects, some of which can be severe or even fatal. == History == The efficacy of azacitidine to treat juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia was evaluated in AZA-JMML-001 (NCT02447666), an international, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and activity of azacitidine prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in 18 pediatric patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. == Research == Azacitidine can be used in vitro to remove methyl groups from DNA. This may weaken the effects of gene silencing mechanisms that occur prior to methylation. Certain methylations are believed to secure DNA in a silenced state, and therefore demethylation may reduce the stability of silencing signals and confer relative gene activation. Azacitidine induces tumor regression on isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutant glioma xenografts in mice. In research, 5-azacitidine is commonly used for promoting cardiomyocyte differentiation of adult stem cells. However, it has been suggested that this drug has a compromised efficacy as a cardiac differentiation factor because it promotes the transdifferentiation of cardiac cells to skeletal myocytes. Azacitidine also has antiviral effects in animal studies as well as its anti-cancer actions, but has not been tested for clinical use. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02447666 for ""Study With Azacitidine in Pediatric Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Mylosar,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06264884769916534), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01429589930921793)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO; ', [])"
2503,"('Lidocaine', 'Lignocaine', 'Xylocaine', 'Lidoderm', 'Anestacon')",Medical,"Lidocaine, also known as lignocaine and sold under the brand name Xylocaine among others, is a local anesthetic of the amino amide type. It is also used to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. When used for local anaesthesia or in nerve blocks, lidocaine typically begins working within several minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area. It is often used mixed with a small amount of adrenaline (epinephrine) to prolong its local effects and to decrease bleeding. If injected intravenously, it may cause cerebral effects such as confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low blood pressure and an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. This means it works by blocking sodium channels thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When injected near nerves, the nerves cannot conduct signals to or from the brain. Lidocaine was discovered in 1946 and went on sale in 1948. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 262nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Local numbing agent === The efficacy profile of lidocaine as a local anaesthetic is characterized by a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Lidocaine is one of the most commonly used local anaesthetics in dentistry. It can be administered in multiple ways, most often as a nerve block or infiltration, depending on the type of treatment carried out and the area of the mouth worked on. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures. There is tentative evidence for topical lidocaine for neuropathic pain and skin graft donor site pain. As a local numbing agent, it is used for the treatment of premature ejaculation. An adhesive transdermal patch containing a 5% concentration of lidocaine in a hydrogel bandage, is approved by the US FDA for reducing nerve pain caused by shingles. The transdermal patch is also used for pain from other causes, such as compressed nerves and persistent nerve pain after some surgeries. === Heart arrhythmia === Lidocaine is a common class-1b antiarrhythmic drug; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (for acute myocardial infarction, digoxin poisoning, cardioversion, or cardiac catheterization) if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated. Lidocaine should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventive dose is no longer recommended after a myocardial infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing. === Epilepsy === A 2013 review on treatment for neonatal seizures recommended intravenous lidocaine as a second-line treatment, if phenobarbital fails to stop seizures. === Other === Intravenous lidocaine infusions are also used to treat chronic pain and acute surgical pain as an opiate sparing technique. The quality of evidence for this use is poor so it is difficult to compare it to placebo or an epidural. Inhaled lidocaine can be used as a cough suppressor acting peripherally to reduce the cough reflex. This application can be implemented as a safety and comfort measure for people needing intubation, as it reduces the incidence of coughing and any tracheal damage it might cause when emerging from anaesthesia. A 2019 systematic review of the literature found that intraurethral lidocaine reduces pain in men who undergo cystoscopic procedures. Lidocaine, along with ethanol, ammonia, and acetic acid, may also help in treating jellyfish stings, both numbing the affected area and preventing further nematocyst discharge. For gastritis, drinking a viscous lidocaine formulation may help with the pain. A 2021 study found that lidocaine 5% spray on glans penis 10-20 minutes prior to sexual intercourse significantly improves premature ejaculation. Another study found that lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% is effective in premature ejaculation and 20 minutes of application time before sexual intercourse. == Adverse effects == Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are rare when lidocaine is used as a local anesthetic and is administered correctly. Most ADRs associated with lidocaine for anesthesia relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, and allergic reactions only rarely occur. Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of lidocaine mainly results in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects – CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. ADRs by individual organ systems are: CNS excitation: nervousness, agitation, anxiety, apprehension, tingling around the mouth (circumoral paraesthesia), headache, hyperesthesia, tremor, dizziness, pupillary changes, psychosis, euphoria, hallucinations, and seizures CNS depression with increasingly heavier exposure: drowsiness, lethargy, slurred speech, hypoesthesia, confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnoea. Cardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, flushing, venous insufficiency, increased defibrillator threshold, edema, and/or cardiac arrest – some of which may be due to hypoxemia secondary to respiratory depression. Respiratory: bronchospasm, dyspnea, respiratory depression or arrest Gastrointestinal: metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, agita, and diarrhea Ears: tinnitus Eyes: local burning, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal epithelial changes/ulceration, diplopia, visual changes (opacification) Skin: itching, depigmentation, rash, urticaria, edema, angioedema, bruising, inflammation of the vein at the injection site, irritation of the skin when applied topically Blood: methemoglobinemia Allergy ADRs associated with the use of intravenous lidocaine are similar to the toxic effects of systemic exposure above. These are dose-related and more frequent at high infusion rates (≥3 mg/min). Common ADRs include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremor, and/or paraesthesia. Infrequent ADRs associated with the use of lidocaine include: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, muscle twitching, seizures, coma, and/or respiratory depression. It is generally safe to use lidocaine with vasoconstrictors such as adrenaline, including in regions such as the nose, ears, fingers, and toes. While concerns of tissue death, if used in these areas, have been raised, the evidence does not support these concerns. The use of lidocaine for spinal anesthesia may lead to an increased risk of transient neurological symptoms, a painful condition that is sometimes experienced immediately after surgery. There is some weak evidence to suggest that the use of alternative anesthetic medications such as prilocaine, procaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or levobupivacaine may decrease the risk of a person developing transient neurological symptoms. Low-quality evidence suggests that 2‐chloroprocaine and mepivacaine when used for spinal anesthetic have a similar risk of the person developing transient neurological symptoms as lidocaine. === Interactions === Any drugs that are also ligands of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 can potentially increase serum levels and potential for toxicity or decrease serum levels and the efficacy, depending on whether they induce or inhibit the enzymes, respectively. Drugs that may increase the chance of methemoglobinemia should also be considered carefully. Dronedarone and liposomal morphine are both absolutely a contraindication, as they may increase the serum levels, but hundreds of other drugs require monitoring for interaction. === Contraindications === Absolute contraindications for the use of lidocaine include: Heart block, second or third degree (without pacemaker) Severe sinoatrial block (without pacemaker) Serious adverse drug reaction to lidocaine or amide local anesthetics Hypersensitivity to corn and corn-related products (corn-derived dextrose is used in the mixed injections) Concurrent treatment with quinidine, flecainide, disopyramide, procainamide (class I antiarrhythmic agents) Prior use of amiodarone hydrochloride Adams–Stokes syndrome Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome Lidocaine viscous is not recommended by the FDA to treat teething pain in children and infants. Exercise caution in people with any of these: Hypotension not due to arrhythmia Bradycardia Accelerated idioventricular rhythm Elderly Ehlers–Danlos syndromes; efficiency of local anesthetics can be reduced Pseudocholinesterase deficiency Intra-articular infusion (this is not an approved indication and can cause chondrolysis) Porphyria, especially acute intermittent porphyria; lidocaine has been classified as porphyrogenic because of the hepatic enzymes it induces, although clinical evidence suggests it is not. Bupivacaine is a safe alternative in this case. Impaired liver function – people with lowered hepatic function may have an adverse reaction with repeated administration of lidocaine because the drug is metabolized by the liver. Adverse reactions may include neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, nausea, muscle twitches, vomiting, or seizures). === Overdosage === Overdoses of lidocaine may result from excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children (who are more susceptible to overdose), accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or from prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgery. The maximum safe dose is 3 mg per kg. Such overdoses have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults (local anesthetic systemic toxicity). Symptoms include central nervous system manifestations such as numbness of the tongue, dizziness, tinnitus, visual disturbances, convulsions, reduced consciousness progressing to coma, as well as respiratory arrest and cardiovascular disturbances. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. Lidocaine is often given intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parenteral feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more common. === Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis === Lidocaine in large amounts may be toxic to cartilage and intra-articular infusions can lead to postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by prolonging the inactivation of the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for action potential propagation. With sufficient blockage, the voltage-gated sodium channels will not open and an action potential will not be generated. Careful titration allows for a high degree of selectivity in the blockage of sensory neurons, whereas higher concentrations also affect other types of neurons. The same principle applies to this drug's actions in the heart. Blocking sodium channels in the conduction system, as well as the muscle cells of the heart, raises the depolarization threshold, making the heart less likely to initiate or conduct early action potentials that may cause an arrhythmia. === Pharmacokinetics === When used as an injectable it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. MEGX has a longer half-life than lidocaine, but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker. The volume of distribution is 1.1 L/kg to 2.1 L/kg, but congestive heart failure can decrease it. About 60% to 80% circulates bound to the protein alpha1 acid glycoprotein. The oral bioavailability is 35% and the topical bioavailability is 3%. Lidocaine efficacy may be reduced in tissues that are inflamed, due to competing inflammatory mediators. The elimination half-life of lidocaine is biphasic and around 90 min to 120 min in most people. This may be prolonged in people with hepatic impairment (average 343 min) or congestive heart failure (average 136 min). Lidocaine is excreted in the urine (90% as metabolites and 10% as unchanged drug). == Chemistry == === Molecular structure and conformational flexibility === Lidocaine's 1,5-dimethylbenzene group gives it hydrophobic properties. In addition to this aromatic unit, lidocaine has an aliphatic section comprising amide, carbonyl, and enyl groups. Lidocaine exhibits a remarkable degree of conformational flexibility, resulting in more than 60 probable conformers. This adaptability arises from the high lability of the amide and ethyl groups within the molecule. These groups can undergo shifts in their positions, leading to significant variations in the overall molecular configuration. === Influence of temperature and pressure on conformational preference === The dynamic transformation of lidocaine conformers in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) highly depends on external factors such as pressure and temperature. Alterations in these conditions can lead to distinct conformations, impacting the molecule's physicochemical properties. One notable consequence of these variations is the particle size of lidocaine when produced through micronization using scCO2. Changes in the position of the amide group within the molecule can trigger a redistribution of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, affecting the outcome of the micronization process and the resultant particle size. == Veterinary use == Lidocaine is commonly used in veterinary medicine in both companion and production animals around the world and is listed as an essential veterinary medicine by the World Veterinary Association and also the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.[1] In veterinary medicine, it is commonly used as a local anaesthetic both as an injectable or topical product. It provides excellent local anaesthesia when given by local infiltration into a tissue or via specific nerve blocks. These are commonly applied to nerves of the head, limbs, thorax, and spine. It can also be used to treat ventricular arrhythmias when given intravenously. In most veterinary species, when given via injection, it has a rapid onset of action (2-10 minutes) with a duration of action of 30-60 minutes. In veterinary species, its metabolism is much the same as humans with rapid metabolism in the liver to the major metabolites MEGX (monoethylglycine xylidide) and GX (glycine xylidide) that retain partial activity against sodium channels. These compounds are further metabolized to monoethylglycine and xylidide, respectively. Toxicity in animals is similar to that seen in humans with both toxicity to the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system observed. General the CNS signs are seen first with agitation and muscle twitching seen before the cardiovascular signs of hypotension, myocardial depression, and arrhythmias. Further CNS depression will result from higher doses with seizures and convulsions and eventually apnea and death. It is a component of the veterinary drug Tributame along with embutramide and chloroquine used to carry out euthanasia on horses and dogs. == History == Lidocaine, the first amino amide–type local anesthetic (previous were amino esters), was first synthesized under the name 'xylocaine' by Swedish chemist Nils Löfgren in 1943. His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anesthesia experiments on himself. It was first marketed in 1949. == Society and culture == === Dosage forms === Lidocaine, usually in the form of its hydrochloride salt, is available in various forms including many topical formulations and solutions for injection or infusion. It is also available as a transdermal patch, which is applied directly to the skin. === Names === Lidocaine is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), and Australian Approved Name (AAN), while lignocaine is the former BAN and AAN. Both the old and new names will be displayed on the product label in Australia until at least 2023. Xylocaine is a brand name, referring to the major synthetic building block 2,6-xylidine. The ""ligno"" prefix is chosen because ""xylo"" means wood in Greek while ""ligno"" means the same in Latin. The ""lido"" prefix instead refers to the fact that the drug is chemically related to acetanilide. === Recreational use === As of 2021, lidocaine is not listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as a substance whose use is banned in sport. It is used as an adjuvant, adulterant, and diluent to street drugs such as cocaine and heroin. It is one of the three common ingredients in site enhancement oil used by bodybuilders. === Adulterant in cocaine === Lidocaine is often added to cocaine as a diluent. Cocaine and lidocaine both numb the gums when applied. This gives the user the impression of high-quality cocaine when in actuality the user is receiving a diluted product. === Compendial status === Japanese Pharmacopoeia 15 United States Pharmacopeia 31 == References == == External links == ""Lidocaine Transdermal Patch"".

2505,"('Etodolac', 'Etodolic acid', 'Lodine', 'Ultradol', 'Lodine xl')",Medical,"Etodolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1985. It was approved in the U.S. in 1991. == Medical uses == NSAIDs are used for the management of mild to moderate pain, fever, and inflammation. They work by reducing the levels of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that are responsible for pain and the fever and tenderness that occur with inflammation. Etodolac blocks the cyclooxygenase (abbrev. COX) enzymes which form prostanoids, resulting in lower concentrations of prostaglandins. As a consequence, inflammation, pain and fever are reduced. Etodolac is 179 times more selective at blocking COX-2 than COX-1. Unlike rofecoxib, both etodolac and celecoxib can fully inhibit COX-1 and are designated as having ""preferential selectivity"" toward COX-2. The R-enantiomer of etodolac is inactive against COX enzymes, but inhibits beta-catenin levels in hepatoma cells. In the UK, Etodolac is licensed for the treatment of inflammation and pain caused by osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. == Interactions == Etodolac should be avoided by patients with a history of asthma attacks, hives, or other allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs. Rare but severe allergic reactions have been reported in such individuals. It also should be avoided by patients with peptic ulcer disease or poor kidney function, since this medication can worsen both conditions. Etodolac is used with caution in patients taking blood thinning medications (anticoagulants), such as warfarin (Coumadin), because it increases the risk of bleeding. Patients taking both lithium and etodolac may develop toxic blood lithium levels. Additionally, etodolac has been found to interact with certain anti-depressant medications, such as sertraline or fluoxetine, which can increase risks of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular conditions. Patients also taking ciclosporin (Sandimmune) can develop kidney toxicity. Use in children has not been adequately studied. Etodolac is not habit-forming. NSAIDs should be discontinued prior to elective surgery because of a mild interference with clotting that is characteristic of this group of medicines. Etodolac is best discontinued at least four days in advance of surgery. Etodolac metabolites may also cause a false positive bilirubin result on a urinalysis test. [1] == Pregnancy and nursing == Etodolac is generally avoided during pregnancy and nursing. NSAIDs may cause adverse cardiovascular effects in the fetus during pregnancy. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == Brand names == Etodolac is manufactured by Almirall Limited under the brand name Lodine SR and by Meda Pharmaceuticals under the name Eccoxolac. Generic etodolac is also available. Etodolac is also sold under several brand names, including: Etogesic (India) Etova (India) Dualgan / Sodolac (Portugal) Etodin (South Korea) Etofree (India) Etopan (Israel) Flancox (Brazil) Haipen (Japan) Lodine (France, Switzerland, United States) Proxym (S Etodolac) (India) Dolarit, Edolar, Etol (Turkey) Lonene (Indonesia, Taiwan) Etodine (Egypt) Etodin Fort (Bulgaria) == References == == External links ==",Lodine xl,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008144637104123831), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019433676498010755)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.03804149478673935)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/cons/lodine-xl.html ', [])"
2506,"('Ginsenoside rb2', 'Ginsenoside c', 'Ginsenosiderb2', 'Ginsenoside-rb2', '(20s)-ginsenoside rb2')",Medical," Ginsenosides (GS) derived from Panax ginseng can regulate protein acetylation to promote mitochondrial function for protecting cardiomyocytes. However, the potential mechanisms of GS for regulating acetylation modification are not yet clear. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanisms of GS in regulating protein acetylation and identify ginsenoside monomer for fighting myocardial ischemia-related diseases. The 4D-lable free acetylomic analysis was employed to gain the acetylated proteins regulated by GS pretreatment. The co-immunoprecipitation assay, immunofluorescent staining, and mitochondrial respiration measurement were performed to detect the effect of GS or ginsenoside monomer on acetylated protein level and mitochondrial function. RNA sequencing, site-specific mutation, and shRNA interference were used to explore the downstream targets of acetylation modificationby GS. Cellular thermal shift assay and surface plasmon resonance were used for identifying the binding of ginsenoside with target protein. In the cardiomyocytes of normal, oxygen glucose deprivation and/or reperfusion conditions, the acetylomic analysis identified that the acetylated levels of spliceosome proteins were inhibited by GS pretreatment and SF3A2 acetylation at lysine 10 (K10) was significantly decreased as a potential target of GS. Ginsenoside Rb2 was identified as one of the active ginsenoside monomers for reducing the acetylation of SF3A2 (K10), which enhanced mitochondrial respiration against myocardial ischemic injury in in vivo and in vitro experiments. RNA-seq analysis showed that ginsenoside Rb2 promoted alternative splicing of mitochondrial function-related genes and the level of fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (Fscn1) was obviously upregulated, which was dependent on SF3A2 acetylation. Critically, thermodynamic, kinetic and enzymatic experiments demonstrated that ginsenoside Rb2 directly interacted with p300 for inhibiting its activity. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying cardiomyocyte protection of ginsenoside Rb2 by inhibiting p300-mediated SF3A2 acteylation for promoting Fscn1 expression, which might be a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemic diseases. Ginsenoside Rb2 is an active protopanaxadiol-type saponin, widely existing in the stem and leave of ginseng. Rb2 has recently been the focus of studies for pharmaceutical properties. This paper provides an overview of the preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetics for Rb2, which exhibit poor absorption, rapid tissue distribution and slow excretion through urine. Pharmacological studies indicate a beneficial role of Rb2 in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, obesity, tumor, photoaging, virus infection and cardiovascular problems. The underlying mechanism is involved in an inhibition of oxidative stress, ROS generation, inflammation and apoptosis via regulation of various cellular signaling pathways and molecules, including AKT/SHP, MAPK, EGFR/SOX2, TGF-β1/Smad, SIRT1, GPR120/AMPK/HO-1 and NF-κB. This work would provide a new insight into the understanding and application of Rb2. However, its therapeutic effects have not been clinically evaluated. Further studies should be aimed at the clinical treatment of Rb2. Ginsenoside Rb2, a major active component of  We performed a senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining assay to confirm cellular senescence in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). The regulatory effects of Rb2 on autophagy were evaluated by analyzing the expression of autophagy marker proteins, such as microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain (LC) 3 and p62, using immunoblotting. Autophagosome and autolysosome formation was monitored using transmission electron microscopy. Autophagic flux was analyzed using tandem-labeled GFP-RFP-LC3, and lysosomal function was assessed with Lysotracker. We performed RNA sequencing to identify potential target genes related to HDF rejuvenation mediated by Rb2. To verify the functions of the target genes, we silenced them using shRNAs. Rb2 decreased β-galactosidase activity and altered the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in senescent HDFs. Rb2 markedly induced the conversion of LC3-Ⅰ to LC3-Ⅱ and LC3 puncta. Moreover, Rb2 increased lysosomal function and red puncta in tandem-labeled GFP-RFP-LC3, which indicate that Rb2 promoted autophagic flux. RNA sequencing data showed that the expression of DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator 2 (DRAM2) was induced by Rb2. In autophagy signaling, Rb2 activated the AMPK-ULK1 pathway and inactivated mTOR.  Rb2 reverses cellular senescence by activating autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR pathway and induction of DRAM2, suggesting that Rb2 might have potential value as an antiaging agent.",Ginsenoside rb2,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('MED', -0.2970312535762787), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0003362966235727072), (' PERSONAL', -0.5764175057411194), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.02327529713511467), (' FOOD', -0.0007272057700902224)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.38798949122428894), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), (',', -0.005250236950814724), ('ĠFOOD', -0.08452361822128296), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31332385540008545)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE;  ', [])"

We used a rat model of I/R injury with the right iliolumbar artery and oxidative stress model of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. The effects of Rb3 on skin flap tissue and endothelial cell survival, STING-IRF3 pathway activation, and endothelial cell adhesion were measured. Following reperfusion, the survival rate of rat perforator flaps in the Rb3-treated group gradually increased with increasing Rb3 concentration. The treatment also reduced the amount of STING protein, phosphorylated IRF3, and P-selectin in skin flap tissue, with this change being most obvious in microvascular endothelial cells. In vitro, activated IRF3 binds to the P-selectin promoter and induces P-selectin expression. Our results suggest that Rb3 plays a role in reducing I/R flap damage through negatively regulating STING-IRF3 activation to limit leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. The objective of the study was to determine the anti-osteoclastogenic potential of ginsenoside Rb3 for the treatment of periodontitis. The anti-osteoclastogenic effect was determined using RANKL-induced RAW264.7 cells and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages followed by TRAP and phalloidin staining. Expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes and proteins were examined by qPCR and WB. Activation of signaling pathways was detected by WB and IHC techniques. Experimental periodontitis rat model was built up by gingival injections of P. gingivalis LPS. After 21 days of Rb3 treatment, rats were sacrificed for micro-CT, IHC, H&E, and TRAP staining analyses. Rb3 dramatically inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Nfatc1, Mmp9, Ctsk, Acp5 mRNA, and MMP9, CTSK proteins were dose-dependently downregulated by Rb3 pretreatment. WB results revealed that Rb3 suppressed activations of p38 MAPK, ERK, and p65 NF-κB, and the inhibition of ERK was most pronounced. Consistently, IHC analysis revealed that p-ERK was highly expressed in alveolar bone surface, blood vessels, odontoblasts, and gingival epithelia, which were notably suppressed by Rb3 treatment. H&E staining and micro-CT analyses showed that Rb3 significantly attenuated gingivitis and alveolar bone resorption in rats. Rb3 inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and attenuates P. gingivalis LPS-induced gingivitis and alveolar bone resorption in rats via ERK/NF-κB signaling pathway. A causal relationship between ginsenoside Rb3 (G-Rb3) and improved inflammation and cardiac function has not been established. To determine which specific signaling pathways were involved in G-Rb3 improvement of inflammation and myocardial function. In vivo, we found that G-Rb3 decreased the levels of both nuclear factor κB (NF-κB p65) and CD45, an inflammatory marker. G-Rb3 also enhanced key proteins of the contraction unit (cardiac troponin protein I (cTnI) and α-actinin) to improve cardiac function. G-Rb3 inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation in vitro, as verified by western blot and IF. When NF-κB p65 was overexpressed, a decrease in cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) and SERCA2a expression, while no statistical significance was observed in the expressions of cAMP, PKA, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKⅡ) in each group. The NF-κB p65 plasmid blocked the SERCA2a promoter, as verified by the luciferase reporter system, and G-Rb3 truncated the NF-κB p65 block on the SERCA2a promoter. qPCR was also used to confirm that G-Rb3 increased the mRNA of SERCA2a. In conclusion, we confirmed that the mechanisms of G-Rb3 on ventricular systolic dysfunction causing inflammation are not via the cAMP/PKA pathway, but via suppressing the blockage of NF-κB p65 on the SERCA2a promoter and increasing the SERCA2a expression.",Ginsenoside rb3,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.2016075700521469), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.387493759393692), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.47431203722953796), ('ĠEND', -0.6497659087181091), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07904551178216934)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ginsenoside-Rb3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874114000192,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9483152/ ', [])"
2508,"('Hydroxymethylfurfural', 'Hydroxymethylfurfurole', 'Hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde', 'Hydroxymethylfurfuralaldehyde', 'Aes-103')","Food, Medical","Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), also known as 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural, is an organic compound formed by the dehydration of reducing sugars. It is a white low-melting solid (although commercial samples are often yellow) which is highly soluble in both water and organic solvents. The molecule consists of a furan ring, containing both aldehyde and alcohol functional groups. HMF can form in sugar-containing food, particularly as a result of heating or cooking. Its formation has been the topic of significant study as HMF was regarded as being potentially carcinogenic to humans. However, so far in vivo genotoxicity was negative. No relevance for humans concerning carcinogenic and genotoxic effects can be derived. HMF is classified as a food improvement agent and is primarily being used in the food industry in form of a food additive as a biomarker as well as a flavoring agent for food products. It is also produced industrially on a modest scale as a carbon-neutral feedstock for the production of fuels and other chemicals. == Production and reactions == HMF was first reported in 1875 as an intermediate in the formation of levulinic acid from sugar and sulfuric acid. This remains the classical route, with 6-carbon sugars (hexoses) such as fructose undergoing acid catalyzed poly-dehydration. When hydrochloric acid is used 5-chloromethylfurfural is produced instead of HMF. Similar chemistry is seen with 5-carbon sugars (pentoses), which react with aqueous acid to form furfural. The classical approach tends to suffer from poor yields as HMF continues to react in aqueous acid, forming levulinic acid. As sugar is not generally soluble in solvents other than water, the development of high-yielding reactions has been slow and difficult; hence while furfural has been produced on a large scale since the 1920s, HMF was not produced on a commercial scale until over 90 years later. The first production plant coming online in 2013. Numerous synthetic technologies have been developed, including the use of ionic liquids, continuous liquid-liquid extraction, reactive distillation and solid acid catalysts to either remove the HMF before it reacts further or to otherwise promote its formation and inhibit its decomposition. === Derivatives === HMF itself has few applications. It can however be converted into other more useful compounds. Of these the most important is 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, which has been proposed as a replacement for terephthalic acid in the production of polyesters. HMF can be converted to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), a liquid that is a potential biofuel with a greater energy content than bioethanol. Hydrogenation of HMF gives 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Acid-catalysed hydrolysis converts HMF into gamma-hydroxyvaleric acid and gamma-valerolactone, with loss of formic acid. == Occurrence in food == HMF is practically absent in fresh food, but it is naturally generated in sugar-containing food during heat-treatments like drying or cooking. Along with many other flavor- and color-related substances, HMF is formed in the Maillard reaction as well as during caramelization. In these foods it is also slowly generated during storage. Acid conditions favour generation of HMF. HMF is a well known component of baked goods. Upon toasting bread, the amount increases from 14.8 (5 min.) to 2024.8 mg/kg (60 min). It is also formed during coffee roasting, with up to 769 mg/kg. It is a good wine storage time−temperature marker, especially in sweet wines such as Madeira and those sweetened with grape concentrate arrope. HMF can be found in low amounts in honey, fruit-juices and UHT-milk. Here, as well as in vinegars, jams, alcoholic products or biscuits, HMF can be used as an indicator for excess heat-treatment. For instance, fresh honey contains less than 15 mg/kg—depending on pH-value and temperature and age, and the codex alimentarius standard requires that honey have less than 40 mg/kg HMF to guarantee that the honey has not undergone heating during processing, except for tropical honeys which must be below 80 mg/kg. Higher quantities of HMF are found naturally in coffee and dried fruit. Several types of roasted coffee contained between 300 – 2900 mg/kg HMF. Dried plums were found to contain up to 2200 mg/kg HMF. In dark beer 13.3 mg/kg were found, bakery-products contained between 4.1 – 151 mg/kg HMF. It can be found in glucose syrup. HMF can form in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), levels around 20 mg/kg HMF were found, increasing during storage or heating. This is a problem for American beekeepers because they use HFCS as a source of sugar when there are not enough nectar sources to feed honeybees, and HMF is toxic to them. Adding bases such as soda ash or potash to neutralize the HFCS slows the formation of HMF. Depending on production-technology and storage, levels in food vary considerably. To evaluate the contribution of a food to HMF intake, its consumption-pattern has to be considered. Coffee is the food that has a very high relevance in terms of levels of HMF and quantities consumed. HMF is a natural component in heated food but usually present in low concentrations. The daily intake of HMF may underlie high variations due to individual consumption-patterns. It has been estimated that the intakes range between 4 mg - 30 mg per person per day, while an intake of up to 350 mg can result from, e.g., beverages made from dried plums. == Biomedical == A major metabolite in humans is 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid (HMFA), also known as Sumiki's acid, which is excreted in urine. HMF bind intracellular sickle hemoglobin (HbS). Preliminary in vivo studies using transgenic sickle mice showed that orally administered 5HMF inhibits the formation of sickled cells in the blood. Under the development code Aes-103, HMF has been considered for the treatment of sickle cell disease. == Quantification == Today, HPLC with UV-detection is the reference-method (e.g. DIN 10751–3). Classic methods for the quantification of HMF in food use photometry. The method according to White is a differential UV-photometry with and without sodium bisulfite-reduction of HMF. Winkler photometric method is a colour-reaction using p-toluidine and barbituric acid (DIN 10751–1). Photometric test may be unspecific as they may detect also related substances, leading to higher results than HPLC-measurements. Test-kits for rapid analyses are also available (e.g. Reflectoquant HMF, Merck KGaA). == Other == HMF is an intermediate in the titration of hexoses in the Molisch's test. In the related Bial's test for pentoses, the hydroxymethylfurfural from hexoses may give a muddy-brown or gray solution, but this is easily distinguishable from the green color of pentoses. Acetoxymethyl furfural (AMF) is also bio-derived green platform chemicals as an alternative to HMF. == References ==",Aes-103,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.35635989904403687), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -4.961759259458631e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.12742169201374054), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0031860284507274628), (' MED', -0.0017144508892670274), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.17608103156089783), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00022516099852509797), ('ĠINDU', -0.20245349407196045), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -8.22540732769994e-06), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.005242885090410709), ('ĠMED', -0.004545712377876043), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006859445478767157)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.048587486147880554)])","('INFO; https://cansar.ai/compound/23612/synopsis/overview,https://www.genengnews.com/news/baxter-buys-aesrx-adding-phase-ii-sickle-cell-compound/ ', [])"

2510,"('Adrenocorticotropic hormone (1-13)',)","Endogenous, Medical"," In order to better understand the roles that melanocortin receptors (cMCRs) and melanocortin-2 receptor accessory proteins (cMRAP1 and cMRAP2) play in the HPA axis and hypothalamus, adrenal gland and hypothalamus mRNA from 1day-old white leghorn chicks (Gallus gallus), were analyzed by real-time PCR. mRNA was also made for kidney, ovary, and liver. Mrap1 mRNA could be detected in adrenal tissue, but not in any of the other tissues, and mrap2 mRNA was also detected in the adrenal gland. Finally, all five melanocortin receptors mRNAs could be detected in the adrenal gland; mc2r and mc5r mRNAs were the most abundant. To evaluate any potential interactions between MRAP1 and the MCRs that may occur in adrenal cells, individual chick mcr cDNA constructs were transiently expressed in CHO cells either in the presence or absence of a chick mrap1 cDNA, and the transfected cells were stimulated with hACTH(1-24) at concentrations ranging from 10 ENKORTEN is newly registered drug in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Combination has immunomodulatory effects. Method of selective immunomodulation with antigens and peptides in immunological mediated diseases and malignant tumors is directed towards long-term remission without so many adverse effects characteristic for immunosuppressive drugs. Adverse reactions registered for so long with ENKORTEN were mild, reversible and usually developed during and immediately after drug application.

We now find that neither Dyn A-(1-13) (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) nor NMDA (4 mg/kg, i.v.) elicits ACTH release in postnatal lambs. This led us to hypothesize that Dyn A-(1-13) and NMDA might act to release placental ACTH. However, the ability of Dyn A-(1-13), NMDA, and the kappa-opioid receptor agonist U-50488H (1 mg/kg, i.v.) to release ACTH was lost after either fetal hypophysectomy (n = 4) or hypothalamo-pituitary disconnection (n = 4). These results indicate that neither the placenta nor the fetal pituitary is the site of action for these agonists and suggest a hypothalamic or suprahypothalamic site of action. Furthermore, the release of ACTH by Dyn A-(1-13) and NMDA was abolished after pretreatment with indomethacin, suggesting that they might cause the release of a prostanoid, possibly from the placenta, that subsequently acts at the hypothalamus or serves as a permissive factor in the action of Dyn A-(1-13) and NMDA at the hypothalamus.",Adrenocorticotropic hormone (1-13),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.05168356001377106), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.01417032815515995), (' END', -1.3856492842023727e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.236549335066229e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.5769778490066528), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.062013890594244), ('ĠEND', -0.026812033727765083), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011090421117842197)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.10637649893760681), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0019286326132714748), (' MED', -9.615255839889869e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenocorticotropic_hormone,https://www.glpbio.com/acth-1-13-adrenocorticotropic-hormone-1-13.html,https://lktlabs.com/product/adrenocorticotropic-hormone-1-13-human/ ', [])"
2511,"('Aprotinin',)",Medical,"The drug aprotinin (Trasylol, previously Bayer and now Nordic Group pharmaceuticals), is a small protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), or basic trypsin inhibitor of bovine pancreas, which is an antifibrinolytic molecule that inhibits trypsin and related proteolytic enzymes. Under the trade name Trasylol, aprotinin was used as a medication administered by injection to reduce bleeding during complex surgery, such as heart and liver surgery. Its main effect is the slowing down of fibrinolysis, the process that leads to the breakdown of blood clots. The aim in its use was to decrease the need for blood transfusions during surgery, as well as end-organ damage due to hypotension (low blood pressure) as a result of marked blood loss. The drug was temporarily withdrawn worldwide in 2007 after studies suggested that its use increased the risk of complications or death; this was confirmed by follow-up studies. Trasylol sales were suspended in May 2008, except for very restricted research use. In February 2012 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific committee reverted its previous standpoint regarding aprotinin, and has recommended that the suspension be lifted. Nordic became distributor of aprotinin in 2012. == Chemistry == Aprotinin is a monomeric (single-chain) globular polypeptide derived from bovine lung tissue. It has a molecular weight of 6512 Da and consists of 16 different amino acid types arranged in a chain 58 residues long that folds into a stable, compact tertiary structure of the 'small SS-rich"" type, containing 3 disulfides, a twisted β-hairpin and a C-terminal α-helix. The amino acid sequence for bovine BPTI is RPDFC LEPPY TGPCK ARIIR YFYNA KAGLC QTFVY GGCRA KRNNF KSAED CMRTC GGA. There are 10 positively charged lysine (K) and arginine (R) side chains and only 4 negative aspartate (D) and glutamates (E), making the protein strongly basic, which accounts for the basic in its name. (Because of the usual source organism, BPTI is sometimes referred to as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.) The high stability of the molecule is due to the 3 disulfide bonds linking the 6 cysteine members of the chain (Cys5-Cys55, Cys14-Cys38 and Cys30-Cys51). The long, basic lysine 15 side chain on the exposed loop (at top left in the image) binds very tightly in the specificity pocket at the active site of trypsin and inhibits its enzymatic action. BPTI is synthesized as a longer, precursor sequence, which folds up and then is cleaved into the mature sequence given above. BPTI is the classic member of the protein family of Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors. Its physiological functions include the protective inhibition of the major digestive enzyme trypsin when small amounts are produced, by cleavage of the trypsinogen precursor during storage in the pancreas. == Mechanism of drug action == Aprotinin is a competitive inhibitor of several serine proteases, specifically trypsin, chymotrypsin and plasmin at a concentration of about 125,000 IU/ml, and kallikrein at 300,000 IU/ml. Its action on kallikrein leads to the inhibition of the formation of factor XIIa. As a result, both the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and fibrinolysis are inhibited. Its action on plasmin independently slows fibrinolysis. == Drug efficacy == In cardiac surgery with a high risk of significant blood loss, aprotinin significantly reduced bleeding, mortality and hospital stay. Beneficial effects were also reported in high-risk orthopedic surgery. In liver transplantation, initial reports of benefit were overshadowed by concerns about toxicity. In a meta-analysis performed in 2004, transfusion requirements decreased by 39% in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. In orthopedic surgery, a decrease of blood transfusions was likewise confirmed. == Drug safety == There have been concerns about the safety of aprotinin. Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) occurs at a rate of 1:200 in first-time use, but serology (measuring antibodies against aprotinin in the blood) is not carried out in practice to predict anaphylaxis risk because the correct interpretation of these tests is difficult. Thrombosis, presumably from overactive inhibition of the fibrinolytic system, may occur at a higher rate, but until 2006 there was limited evidence for this association. Similarly, while biochemical measures of renal function were known to occasionally deteriorate, there was no evidence that this greatly influenced outcomes. A study performed in cardiac surgery patients reported in 2006 showed that there was indeed a risk of acute renal failure, myocardial infarction and heart failure, as well as stroke and encephalopathy. The study authors recommend older antifibrinolytics (such as tranexamic acid) in which these risks were not documented. The same group updated their data in 2007 and demonstrated similar findings. In September 2006, Bayer A.G. was faulted by the FDA for not revealing during testimony the existence of a commissioned retrospective study of 67,000 patients, 30,000 of whom received aprotinin and the rest other anti-fibrinolytics. The study concluded aprotinin carried greater risks. The FDA was alerted to the study by one of the researchers involved. Although the FDA issued a statement of concern they did not change their recommendation that the drug may benefit certain subpopulations of patients. In a Public Health Advisory Update dated October 3, 2006, the FDA recommended that ""physicians consider limiting Trasylol use to those situations in which the clinical benefit of reduced blood loss is necessary to medical management and outweighs the potential risks"" and carefully monitor patients. On October 25, 2007, the FDA issued a statement regarding the ""Blood conservation using antifibrinolytics"" (BART) randomized trial in a cardiac surgery population. The preliminary findings suggest that, compared to other antifibrinolytic drugs (epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid) aprotinin may increase the risk of death. On October 29, 2006 the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that aprotinin may have serious kidney and cardiovascular toxicity. The producer, Bayer, reported to the FDA that additional observation studies showed that it may increase the chance for death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure and strokes. FDA warned clinicians to consider limiting use to those situations where the clinical benefit of reduced blood loss is essential to medical management and outweighs the potential risks. On November 5, 2007, Bayer announced that it was withdrawing Aprotinin because of a Canadian study that showed it increased the risk of death when used to prevent bleeding during heart surgery. Two studies published in early 2008, both comparing aprotinin with aminocaproic acid, found that mortality was increased by 32 and 64%, respectively. One study found an increased risk in need for dialysis and revascularisation. No cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy transmission by aprotinin have been reported, although the drug was withdrawn in Italy due to fears of this. == In vitro use == Small amounts of aprotinin can be added to tubes of drawn blood to enable laboratory measurement of certain rapidly degraded proteins such as glucagon. In cell biology aprotinin is used as an enzyme inhibitor to prevent protein degradation during lysis or homogenization of cells and tissues. Aprotinin can be labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The conjugate retains its antiproteolytic and carbohydrate-binding properties and has been used as a fluorescent histochemical reagent for staining glycoconjugates (mucosubstances) that are rich in uronic or sialic acids. == History == Initially named ""kallikrein inactivator"", aprotinin was first isolated from cow parotid glands in 1930. and independently as a trypsin inhibitor from bovine pancreas in 1936. It was purified from bovine lung in 1964. As it inhibits pancreatic enzymes, it was initially used in the treatment for acute pancreatitis, in which destruction of the gland by its own enzymes is thought to be part of the pathogenesis. Its use in major surgery commenced in the 1960s. BPTI is one of the most thoroughly studied proteins in terms of structural biology, experimental and computational dynamics, mutagenesis, and folding pathway. It was one of the earliest protein crystal structures solved, in 1970 in the laboratory of Robert Huber, and it's substrate-like interaction mode deciphered in the context of the bovine trypsin complex in 1974. It later also became famous being the first protein to have its structure determined by NMR spectroscopy, in the laboratory of Kurt Wuthrich at the ETH in Zurich in the early 1980s. Because it is a small, stable protein whose structure had been determined at high resolution by 1975, it was the first macromolecule of scientific interest to be simulated using molecular dynamics computation, in 1977 by J. Andrew McCammon and Bruce Gelin, in the Karplus group at Harvard. That study confirmed the then-surprising fact found in the NMR work that even well-packed aromatic sidechains in the interior of a stable protein can flip over rather rapidly (microsecond to millisecond time scale). Rate constants were determined by NMR for the hydrogen exchange of individual peptide NH groups along the chain, ranging from too fast to measure on the most exposed surface to many months for the most buried hydrogen-bonded groups in the center of the β sheet, and those values also correlate fairly well with degree of motion seen in the dynamics simulations. BPTI was important in the development of knowledge about the process of protein folding, the self-assembly of a polypeptide chain into a specific arrangement in 3D. The problem of achieving the correct pairings among the 6 Cys sidechains was shown to be especially difficult for the two buried, close-together SS near the BPTI chain termini, requiring a non-native intermediate for folding the mature sequence in vitro (it was later discovered that the precursor sequence folds more easily in vivo). BPTI was the cover image on a protein folding compendium volume by Thomas Creighton in 1992. == Current findings == One scientific study in rats reported that treatment with aprotinin prevents disruption of the blood–brain barrier during the C. neoformans infection.

2512,"('Argipressin', 'Vasopressin', 'Arg8-vasopressin')",Medical,"Human vasopressin, also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH), arginine vasopressin (AVP) or argipressin, is a hormone synthesized from the AVP gene as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and is converted to AVP. It then travels down the axon terminating in the posterior pituitary, and is released from vesicles into the circulation in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality). AVP has two primary functions. First, it increases the amount of solute-free water reabsorbed back into the circulation from the filtrate in the kidney tubules of the nephrons. Second, AVP constricts arterioles, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises arterial blood pressure. A third function is possible. Some AVP may be released directly into the brain from the hypothalamus, and may play an important role in social behavior, sexual motivation and pair bonding, and maternal responses to stress. Vasopressin induces differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes and promotes heart muscle homeostasis. It has a very short half-life, between 16 and 24 minutes. == Physiology == === Function === Vasopressin regulates the tonicity of body fluids. It is released from the posterior pituitary in response to hypertonicity and causes the kidneys to reabsorb solute-free water and return it to the circulation from the tubules of the nephron, thus returning the tonicity of the body fluids toward normal. An incidental consequence of this renal reabsorption of water is concentrated urine and reduced urine volume. AVP released in high concentrations may also raise blood pressure by inducing moderate vasoconstriction. AVP also may have a variety of neurological effects on the brain. It may influence pair-bonding in voles. The high-density distributions of vasopressin receptor AVPr1a in prairie vole ventral forebrain regions have been shown to facilitate and coordinate reward circuits during partner preference formation, critical for pair bond formation. A very similar substance, lysine vasopressin (LVP) or lypressin, has the same function in pigs and its synthetic version was used in human AVP deficiency, although it has been largely replaced by desmopressin. ==== Kidney ==== Vasopressin has three main effects which are: Increasing the water permeability of distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and cortical collecting tubules (CCT), as well as outer and inner medullary collecting duct (OMCD & IMCD) in the kidney, thus allowing water reabsorption and excretion of more concentrated urine, i.e., antidiuresis. This occurs through increased transcription and insertion of water channels (Aquaporin-2) into the apical membrane of collecting tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells. Aquaporins allow water to move down their osmotic gradient and out of the nephron, increasing the amount of water re-absorbed from the filtrate (forming urine) back into the bloodstream. This effect is mediated by V2 receptors. Vasopressin also increases the concentration of calcium in the collecting duct cells, by episodic release from intracellular stores. Vasopressin, acting through cAMP, also increases transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene, thus increasing the total number of aquaporin-2 molecules in collecting duct cells. Increasing permeability of the inner medullary portion of the collecting duct to urea by regulating the cell surface expression of urea transporters, which facilitates its reabsorption into the medullary interstitium as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the connecting tubule, cortical collecting duct, and outer medullary collecting duct. Acute increase of sodium absorption across the ascending loop of Henle. This adds to the countercurrent multiplication which aids in proper water reabsorption later in the distal tubule and collecting duct. The hormone vasopressin also stimulates the activity of NKCC2. Vasopressin stimulates sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the nephron by activating signaling pathways. Vasopressin increases the traffic of NKCC2 to the membrane and phosphorylates some serine and threonine sites on the cytoplasmic N-terminal of the NKCC2 located in the membrane, increasing its activity. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water reabsorption in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate. ==== Central nervous system ==== Vasopressin released within the brain may have several actions: Vasopressin is released into the brain in a circadian rhythm by neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Vasopressin released from posterior pituitary is associated with nausea. Recent evidence suggests that vasopressin may have analgesic effects. The analgesia effects of vasopressin were found to be dependent on both stress and sex. === Regulation === ==== Gene regulation ==== Vasopressin is regulated by AVP gene expression which is managed by major clock controlled genes. In this circadian circuit known as the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL), Per2 protein accumulates and is phosphorylated by CK1E. Per2 subsequently inhibits the transcription factors Clock and BMAL1 in order to reduce Per2 protein levels in the cell. At the same time, Per2 also inhibits the transcription factors for the AVP gene in order to regulate its expression, the expression of vasopressin, and other AVP gene products. Many factors influence the secretion of vasopressin: Ethanol (alcohol) reduces the calcium-dependent secretion of AVP by blocking voltage-gated calcium channels in neurohypophyseal nerve terminals in rats. Angiotensin II stimulates AVP secretion, in keeping with its general pressor and pro-volumic effects on the body. Atrial natriuretic peptide inhibits AVP secretion, in part by inhibiting Angiotensin II-induced stimulation of AVP secretion. Cortisol inhibits secretion of antidiuretic hormone. === Production and secretion === The physiological stimulus for secretion of vasopressin is increased osmolality of the plasma, monitored by the hypothalamus. A decreased arterial blood volume, (such as can occur in cirrhosis, nephrosis, and heart failure), stimulates secretion, even in the face of decreased osmolality of the plasma: it supersedes osmolality, but with a milder effect. In other words, the unloading of arterial baroreceptors when the arterial blood volume is low stimulates vasopressin secretion despite the presence of hypoosmolality (hyponatremia). The AVP that is measured in peripheral blood is almost all derived from secretion from the posterior pituitary gland (except in cases of AVP-secreting tumours). Vasopressin is produced by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). It then travels down the axon through the infundibulum within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood. There are other sources of AVP, beyond the hypothalamic magnocellular neurons. For example, AVP is also synthesized by parvocellular neurosecretory neurons of the PVN, transported and released at the median eminence, from which it travels through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates corticotropic cells synergistically with CRH to produce ACTH (by itself it is a weak secretagogue). === Vasopressin during surgery and anaesthesia === Vasopressin concentration is used to measure surgical stress for evaluation of surgical techniques. Plasma vasopressin concentration is elevated by noxious stimuli, predominantly during abdominal surgery, especially at gut manipulation, traction of viscera, as well as abdominal insufflation with carbon dioxide during laparoscopic surgery. === Receptors === Types of AVP receptors and their actions: === Structure and relation to oxytocin === The vasopressins are peptides consisting of nine amino acids (nonapeptides). The amino acid sequence of arginine vasopressin (argipressin) is Cys-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Arg-Gly-NH2, with the cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond and the C-terminus of the sequence converted to a primary amide. Lysine vasopressin (lypressin) has a lysine in place of the arginine as the eighth amino acid, and is found in pigs and some related animals, whereas arginine vasopressin is found in humans. The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of the vasopressins: It is also a nonapeptide with a disulfide bridge and its amino acid sequence differs at only two positions. The two genes are located on the same chromosome separated by a relatively small distance of less than 15,000 bases in most species. The magnocellular neurons that secrete vasopressin are adjacent to magnocellular neurons that secrete oxytocin, and are similar in many respects. The similarity of the two peptides can cause some cross-reactions: oxytocin has a slight antidiuretic function, and high levels of AVP can cause uterine contractions. Comparison of vasopressin and oxytocin neuropeptide families: == Medical use == Vasopressin is used to manage anti-diuretic hormone deficiency. Vasopressin is used to treat diabetes insipidus related to low levels of antidiuretic hormone. It is available as Pressyn. Vasopressin has off-label uses and is used in the treatment of vasodilatory shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Vasopressin agonists are used therapeutically in various conditions, and its long-acting synthetic analogue desmopressin is used in conditions featuring low vasopressin secretion, as well as for control of bleeding (in some forms of von Willebrand disease and in mild haemophilia A) and in extreme cases of bedwetting by children. Terlipressin and related analogues are used as vasoconstrictors in certain conditions. Use of vasopressin analogues for esophageal varices commenced in 1970. Vasopressin infusions are also used as second line therapy for septic shock patients not responding to fluid resuscitation or infusions of catecholamines (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine) to increase the blood pressure while sparing the use of catecholamines. These argipressins have much shorter elimination half-life (around 20 minutes) comparing to synthetic non-arginine vasopresines with much longer elimination half-life of many hours. Further, argipressins act on V1a, V1b, and V2 receptors which consequently lead to higher eGFR and lower vascular resistance in the lungs. A number of injectable arginine vasopressins are currently in clinical use in the United States and in Europe. === Pharmacokinetics === Vasopressin is administered through an intravenous device, intramuscular injection or a subcutaneous injection. The duration of action depends on the mode of administration and ranges from thirty minutes to two hours. It has a half life of ten to twenty minutes. It is widely distributed throughout the body and remains in the extracellular fluid. It is degraded by the liver and excreted through the kidneys. Arginin vasopressins for use in septic shock are intended for intravenous use only. === Side effects === The most common side effects during treatment with vasopressin are dizziness, angina, chest pain, abdominal cramps, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, trembling, fever, water intoxication, pounding sensation in the head, diarrhoea, sweating, paleness, and flatulence. The most severe adverse reactions are myocardial infarction and hypersensitivity. === Contraindications === The use of lysine vasopressin is contraindicated in the presence of hypersensitivity to beef or pork proteins, increased BUN and chronic kidney failure. It is recommended that it be cautiously used in instances of perioperative polyuria, sensitivity to the drug, asthma, seizures, heart failure, a comatose state, migraine headaches, and cardiovascular disease. === Interactions === alcohol - may lower the antidiuretic effect carbamazepine, chloropropamide, clofibrate, tricyclic antidepressants and fludrocortisone may raise the antidiuretic effect lithium, demeclocycline, heparin or norepinephrine may lower the antidiuretic effect vasopressor effect may be higher with the concurrent use of ganglionic blocking medications === Deficiency === Decreased AVP release (neurogenic — i.e. due to alcohol intoxication or tumour) or decreased renal sensitivity to AVP (nephrogenic, i.e. by mutation of V2 receptor or AQP) leads to diabetes insipidus, a condition featuring hypernatremia (increased blood sodium concentration), polyuria (excess urine production), and polydipsia (thirst). === Excess === Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH) in turn can be caused by a number of problems. Some forms of cancer can cause SIADH, particularly small cell lung carcinoma but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs have been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, oxytocin (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug vincristine. It has also been associated with fluoroquinolones (including ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation. Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists. == History == Vasopressin was elucidated and synthesized for the first time by Vincent du Vigneaud. == Animal studies == Evidence for an effect of AVP on monogamy vs polygamy comes from experimental studies in several species, which indicate that the precise distribution of vasopressin and vasopressin receptors in the brain is associated with species-typical patterns of social behavior. In particular, there are consistent differences between monogamous species and polygamous species in the distribution of AVP receptors, and sometimes in the distribution of vasopressin-containing axons, even when closely related species are compared. == Human studies == Vasopressin has shown nootropic effects on pain perception and cognitive function. Vasopressin also plays a role in autism, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. == See also == Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) Oxytocin Vasopressin receptor Vasopressin receptor antagonists Copeptin Anterior pituitary Hypothalamus Atrial natriuretic peptide: When the atrium stretches, blood pressure is considered to be increased and sodium is excreted to lower blood pressure. Renin-angiotensin system: When the blood flow through the juxtaglomerular apparatus decreases, blood pressure is considered low, and the adrenal cortex secretes aldosterone to increase sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct, thereby increasing blood pressure. Bainbridge reflex: In response to stretching of the right atrium wall, heart rate increases, lowering venous blood pressure. Baroreflex: When the stretch receptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus increase, the blood pressure is considered to be elevated and the heart rate decreases to lower blood pressure. == References == == Further reading ==",Vasopressin,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.01838708482682705), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.596781946020201e-05), (' MED', -7.584239938296378e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.6693395972251892), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('OUS', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -5.054346183896996e-05), ('ĠMED', -1.764281842042692e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00013445904187392443)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.1269395500421524), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin_%28medication%29 ', [])"
2513,"('Castor oil',)","Medical, Personal Care","Castor oil is a vegetable oil pressed from castor beans, the seeds of the plant Ricinus communis. The seeds are 40 to 60 percent oil. It is a colourless or pale yellow liquid with a distinct taste and odor. Its boiling point is 313 °C (595 °F) and its density is 0.961 g/cm3. It includes a mixture of triglycerides in which about 90 percent of fatty acids are ricinoleates. Oleic acid and linoleic acid are the other significant components. Some 270,000–360,000 tonnes (600–800 million pounds) of castor oil are produced annually for a variety of uses. Castor oil and its derivatives are used in the manufacturing of soaps, lubricants, hydraulic and brake fluids, paints, dyes, coatings, inks, cold-resistant plastics, waxes and polishes, nylon, and perfumes. == Etymology == The name probably comes from a confusion between the Ricinus plant that produces it and another plant, the Vitex agnus-castus. An alternative etymology, though, suggests that it was used as a replacement for castoreum. == History == Use of castor oil as a laxative is attested to in the c. 1550 BCE Ebers Papyrus, and it was in use several centuries earlier. Midwifery manuals from the 19th century recommended castor oil and 10 drops of laudanum for relieving ""false pains."" == Composition == Castor oil is well known as a source of ricinoleic acid, a monounsaturated, 18-carbon fatty acid. Among fatty acids, ricinoleic acid is unusual in that it has a hydroxyl functional group on the 12th carbon atom. This functional group causes ricinoleic acid (and castor oil) to be more polar than most fats. The chemical reactivity of the alcohol group also allows chemical derivatization that is not possible with most other seed oils. Because of its ricinoleic acid content, castor oil is a valuable chemical in feedstocks, commanding a higher price than other seed oils. As an example, in July 2007, Indian castor oil sold for about US$0.90/kg ($0.41/lb), whereas U.S. soybean, sunflower, and canola oils sold for about $0.30/kg ($0.14/lb). == Human uses == Castor oil has been used orally to relieve constipation or to evacuate the bowel before intestinal surgery. The laxative effect of castor oil is attributed to ricinoleic acid, which is produced by hydrolysis in the small intestine. Use of castor oil for simple constipation is medically discouraged because it may cause violent diarrhea. === Food and preservative === In the food industry, food-grade castor oil is used in food additives, flavorings, candy (e.g., polyglycerol polyricinoleate in chocolate), as a mold inhibitor, and in packaging. Polyoxyethylated castor oil (e.g., Kolliphor EL) is also used in the food industries. In India, Pakistan, and Nepal, food grains are preserved by the application of castor oil. It stops rice, wheat, and pulses from rotting. For example, the legume pigeon pea is commonly available coated in oil for extended storage. === Emollient === Castor oil has been used in cosmetic products included in creams and as a moisturizer. It is often combined with zinc oxide to form an emollient and astringent, zinc and castor oil cream, which is commonly used to treat infants for nappy rash. === Medicine === Castor oil is used as a vehicle for serums administering steroid hormones such as estradiol valerate via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. === Alternative medicine === Despite the lack of evidence, castor oil is sometimes claimed to be able to cure diseases. According to the American Cancer Society, ""available scientific evidence does not support claims that castor oil on the skin cures cancer or any other disease."" === Childbirth === Despite some undesirable side effects, castor oil is used for labor induction. There is no high-quality research proving that ingestion of castor oil results in cervical ripening or induction of labor; there is, however, evidence that taking it causes nausea and diarrhea. A systematic review of ""three trials, involving 233 women, found there has not been enough research done to show the effects of castor oil on ripening the cervix or inducing labour or compare it to other methods of induction. The review found that all women who took castor oil by mouth felt nauseous. More research is needed into the effects of castor oil to induce labour."" Castor oil is still used for labor induction in environments where modern drugs are not available; a review of pharmacologic, mechanical, and ""complementary"" methods of labor induction published in 2024 by the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology stated that castor oil's physiological effect is poorly understood but ""given gastrointestinal symptomatology, a prostaglandin mediation has been suggested but not confirmed."" According to Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation: A Reference Guide to Fetal and Neonatal Risk (2008), castor oil should not be ingested or used topically by pre-term pregnant women. There is no data on the potential toxicity of castor oil for nursing mothers. === Punishment === Since children commonly strongly dislike the taste of castor oil, some parents punished children with a dose of it. Physicians recommended against the practice because it may associate medicines with punishment and make children afraid of the doctor. === Use in torture === A heavy dose of castor oil could be used as a humiliating punishment for adults. Colonial officials used it in the British Raj (India) to deal with recalcitrant servants. Belgian military officials prescribed heavy doses of castor oil in Belgian Congo as a punishment for being too sick to work. Castor oil was also a tool of punishment favored by the Falangist and later Francoist Spain during and following the Spanish Civil War. Its use as a form of gendered violence to repress women was especially prominent. This began during the war where Nationalist forces would specifically target Republican-aligned women, both troops and civilians, who lived in Republican-controlled areas. The forced drinking of castor oil occurred alongside sexual assault, rape, torture and murder of these women. Its most notorious use as punishment came in Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini. It was a favorite tool used by the Blackshirts to intimidate and humiliate their opponents. Political dissidents were force-fed large quantities of castor oil by fascist squads so as to induce bouts of extreme diarrhea in the victims. This technique was said to have been originated by Gabriele D'Annunzio or Italo Balbo. This form of torture was potentially deadly, as the administration of the castor oil was often combined with nightstick beatings, especially to the rear, so that the resulting diarrhea would not only lead to dangerous dehydration but also infect the open wounds from the beatings. However, even those victims who survived had to bear the humiliation of the laxative effects resulting from excessive consumption of the oil. == Industrial uses == === Coatings === Castor oil is used as a biobased polyol in the polyurethane industry. The average functionality (number of hydroxyl groups per triglyceride molecule) of castor oil is 2.7, so it is widely used as a rigid polyol and in coatings. One particular use is in a polyurethane concrete where a castor-oil emulsion is reacted with an isocyanate (usually polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) and a cement and construction aggregate. This is applied fairly thickly as a slurry, which is self-levelling. This base is usually further coated with other systems to build a resilient floor. Castor oil is not a drying oil, meaning that it has a low reactivity with air compared with oils such as linseed oil and tung oil. However, dehydration of castor oil yields linoleic acids, which do have drying properties. In this process, the OH group on the ricinoleic acid along with a hydrogen from the next carbon atom are removed, forming a double bond which then has oxidative cross-linking properties and yields the drying oil. It is considered a vital raw material. === Chemical precursor === Castor oil can react with other materials to produce other chemical compounds that have numerous applications. Transesterification followed by steam cracking gives undecylenic acid, a precursor to specialized polymer nylon 11, and heptanal, a component in fragrances. Breakdown of castor oil in strong base gives 2-octanol, both a fragrance component and a specialized solvent, and the dicarboxylic acid sebacic acid. Hydrogenation of castor oil saturates the alkenes, giving a waxy lubricant. Castor oil may be epoxidized by reacting the OH groups with epichlorohydrin to make the triglycidyl ether of castor oil which is useful in epoxy technology. This is available commercially as Heloxy 505. The production of lithium grease consumes a significant amount of castor oil. Hydrogenation and saponification of castor oil yields 12-hydroxystearic acid, which is then reacted with lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate to give high-performance lubricant grease. Since it has a relatively high dielectric constant (4.7), highly refined and dried castor oil is sometimes used as a dielectric fluid within high-performance, high-voltage capacitors. === Lubrication === Vegetable oils such as castor oil are typically unattractive alternatives to petroleum-derived lubricants because of their poor oxidative stability. Castor oil has better low-temperature viscosity properties and high-temperature lubrication than most vegetable oils, making it useful as a lubricant in jet, diesel, and racing engines. The viscosity of castor oil at 10 °C is 2,420 centipoise, but it tends to form gums in a short time, so its usefulness is limited to engines that are regularly rebuilt, such as racing engines. Lubricant company Castrol took its name from castor oil. Castor oil has been suggested as a lubricant for bicycle pumps because it does not degrade natural rubber seals. ==== Turkey red oil ==== Turkey red oil, also called sulphonated (or sulfated) castor oil, is made by adding sulfuric acid to vegetable oils, most notably castor oil. It was the first synthetic detergent after ordinary soap. It is used in formulating lubricants, softeners, and dyeing assistants. ==== Biodiesel ==== Castor oil, like currently less expensive vegetable oils, can be used as feedstock in the production of biodiesel. The resulting fuel is superior for cold winters, because of its exceptionally low cloud point and pour point. Initiatives to grow more castor for energy production, in preference to other oil crops, are motivated by social considerations. Tropical subsistence farmers would gain a cash crop. === Early aviation and aeromodelling === Castor oil was the preferred lubricant for rotary engines, such as the Gnome engine after that engine's widespread adoption for aviation in Europe in 1909. It was used almost universally in rotary-engined Allied aircraft in World War I. Germany had to make do with inferior ersatz oil for its rotary engines, which resulted in poor reliability. The methanol-fueled, two-cycle, glow-plug engines used for aeromodelling, since their adoption by model airplane hobbyists in the 1940s, have used varying percentages of castor oil as lubricants. It is highly resistant to degradation when the engine has its fuel-air mixture leaned for maximum engine speed. Gummy residues can still be a problem for aeromodelling powerplants lubricated with castor oil, however, usually requiring eventual replacement of ball bearings when the residue accumulates within the engine's bearing races. One British manufacturer of sleeve valved four-cycle model engines has stated the ""varnish"" created by using castor oil in small percentages can improve the pneumatic seal of the sleeve valve, improving such an engine's performance over time. == Safety == The castor seed contains ricin, a toxic lectin. Heating during the oil extraction process denatures and deactivates the lectin. Harvesting castor beans, though, may not be without risk. The International Castor Oil Association FAQ document states that castor beans contain an allergenic compound called CB1A. This chemical is described as being virtually nontoxic, but has the capacity to affect people with hypersensitivity. The allergen may be neutralized by treatment with a variety of alkaline agents. The allergen is not present in the castor oil itself. == See also == Botanol, a flooring material derived from castor oil Castor wax List of unproven and disproven cancer treatments == References == == Further reading == Naughton, Frank.

2514,"('Chromium picolinate', 'Chromium (iii) picolinate', 'Cr(pic)3')",Medical,"Chromium(III) picolinate (also trivalent chromium) is a chemical compound with the formula Cr(C5H4N(CO2))3, commonly abbreviated as CrPic3. It is a bright-red coordination compound derived from chromium(III) and picolinic acid. Trivalent chromium occurs naturally in many foods and is one of several forms of chromium sold as a dietary supplement intended to correct chromium deficiency. However, there is no evidence of chromium deficiency in healthy people and no medical symptoms of chromium deficiency exist. Supplementation with trivalent chromium does not prevent or treat obesity, impaired prediabetes condition, type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and is not considered effective for maintaining or losing body weight. Although daily doses of trivalent chromium up to 1,000 μg are considered to be safe, some adverse effects have been reported, and there is no clinical evidence that chromium supplementation provides any health benefit. == History == Although some research suggested that chromium(III) picolinate may assist in weight loss and increase muscle mass, a 2013 Cochrane review was unable to find ""reliable evidence to inform firm decisions"" to support such claims. Among the transition metals, Cr3+ is the most controversial in terms of nutritional value and toxicity. Furthermore, this controversy is amplified by the fact that no chromium-containing biomolecules have had their structure characterized, nor has the mode of action been determined. The first experiment that led to the discovery of Cr3+ playing a role in glucose metabolism proposed that the biologically active form of the metal existed in a protein called glucose tolerance factor, but further research indicated it is simply an artifact obtained from isolation procedures. The only accepted indicator of chromium deficiency is the reversal of symptoms that occurs when chromium(III) supplementation is administered in pharmacological doses to people on total parenteral nutrition. == Physicochemical properties == Chromium(III) picolinate is a pinkish-red compound and was first reported in 1917. It is poorly soluble in water, having a solubility of 600 μM in water at near neutral pH. Similar to other chromium(III) compounds, it is relatively inert and unreactive, meaning that this complex is stable at ambient conditions and high temperatures are required to decompose the compound. At lower pH levels, the complex hydrolyzes to release picolinic acid and free Cr3+. === Structure === Chromium(III) picolinate has a distorted octahedral geometry and is isostructural to cobalt (III) and manganese (III) counterparts. Chromium(III) is a hard lewis acid and as such has high affinity to the carboxylate oxygen and medium affinity to the pyridine nitrogen of picolinate. Each picolinate ligand acts as a bidentate chelating agent and neutralizes the +3 charge of Cr3+. Evidence that the Cr3+ center coordinates to the pyridine nitrogen comes from a shift in the IR spectra of a C=N vibration at 1602.4 cm−1 for free picolinic acid to 1565.9 cm−1 for chromium(III) picolinate. The bond length between Cr3+ and the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring on picolinate ranges from 2.047 to 2.048 Å. The picolinate ligand coordinates to Cr3+ only when deprotonated and this is evident by the disappearance of IR bands ranging from 2400 to 2800 cm−1 (centered at 2500 cm−1) and 1443 cm−1, corresponding to the O-H stretching and bending, respectively, on the carboxyl functional group. Furthermore, this IR shift also indicates that only one oxygen atom from the carboxylate of picolinate coordinates to the Cr3+ center. The Cr-O bond length ranges from 1.949 to 1.957 Å. The crystal structure has only been recently described in 2013. Water does not coordinate to the Cr3+ center and is instead thought to hydrogen bond between other Cr(Pic)3 complexes to form a network of Cr(Pic)3 complexes. == Biochemistry of chromium(III) picolinate == Chromium was once proposed as an essential nutrient in maintaining normal blood glucose levels, but this function has not been sufficiently demonstrated. The European Food Safety Authority concluded that there is no convincing evidence to show chromium as an essential nutrient, thereby not justifying the setting of recommendations for chromium dietary intake. === Absorption and excretion of chromium(III) picolinate === Once chromium(III) picolinate is ingested and enters the stomach, acidic hydrolysis of the complex occurs when in contact with the stomach mucosa. The hydrolyzed Cr3+ is present in the hexaaqua form and polymerizes to form an insoluble Cr(III)-hydroxide-oxide (the process of olation) once it reaches the alkaline pH of the small intestine. Approximately 2% of Cr3+ is absorbed through the gut as chromium(III) picolinate via unsaturated passive transport. Although absorption is low, CrPic3 absorbs more efficiently than other organic and inorganic sources (i.e. CrCl3 and chromium nicotinate) and thus accumulate at higher concentrations in tissues. This has been one major selling point for chromium(III) picolinate over other chromium(III) supplements. Organic sources tend to absorb better as they have ligands which are more lipophilic and usually neutralize the charge of the metal, thus permitting for easier passage through the intestinal membrane. It has also been shown that dietary factors affect Cr3+ absorption. Starch, simple sugars, oxalic acid, and some amino acids tend to increase the rate of absorption of chromium(III). This is a result of ligand chelation, converting hexaaqua Cr3+ into more lipophilic forms. In contrast, calcium, magnesium, titanium, zinc, vanadium, and iron reduce the rate of absorption. Presumably, these ions introduce new metal-ligand equilibria, thus decreasing the lipophilic ligand pool available to Cr3+. Once absorbed into the bloodstream, 80% of the Cr3+ from CrPic3 is passed along to transferrin. The exact mechanism of release is currently unknown, however, it is believed not to occur by a single electron reduction, as in the case of Fe3+, due to the high instability of Cr2+. Administered Cr3+ can be found in all tissues ranging from 10 to 100 μg/kg body weight. It is excreted primarily in the urine (80%) while the rest is excreted in sweat and feces. ==== Binding of chromium(III) to transferrin ==== Transferrin, in addition to chromodulin has been identified as a major physiological chromium transport agent, although a recent study found that Cr3+ in fact disables transferrin from acting as a metal ion transport agent. While transferrin is highly specific for ferric ions, at normal conditions, only 30% of transferrin molecules are saturated with ferric ions, allowing for other metals, particularly those with a large charge to size ratio, to bind as well. The binding sites consist of a C-lobe and an N-lobe which are nearly identical in structure. Each lobe contains aspartic acid, histidine, 2 tyrosine residues and a bicarbonate ion that acts as a bidentate ligand to allow iron or other metals to bind to transferrin in a distorted octahedral geometry. Evidence supporting the binding of Cr3+ to transferrin comes from extensive clinical studies that showed a positive correlation between levels of ferritin and of fasting glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac) levels. Furthermore, an in vivo study in rats showed that 80% of isotopically labelled Cr3+ ended up on transferrin while the rest were bound to albumin. An in vitro study showed that when chromium(III) chloride was added to isolated transferrin, the Cr3+ readily bound transferrin, owing to changes in the UV-Vis spectrum. The formation constant for Cr3+ in the C-lobe is 1.41 x 1010 M−1 and 2.04 x 105 M−1 in the N-lobe, which indicates that Cr3+ preferentially binds the C-lobe. Overall, the formation constant for chromium(III) is lower than that of the ferric ion. The bicarbonate ligand is crucial in binding Cr3+ as when bicarbonate concentrations are very low, the binding affinity is also significantly lower. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies have shown that below pH 6, chromium(III) binds only to the N-lobe and that at near neutral pH, chromium(III) binds to the C-lobe as well. Chromium(III) can compete with the ferric ion for binding to the C-lobe when the saturation greatly exceeds 30%. As such, these effects are only seen in patients with hemochromatosis, an iron-storage disease characterized by excessive iron saturation in transferrin. == Mechanism of action == The precise composition and structure of the form of chromium having biological activity is not known. Low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance (LMWCr; also known as chromodulin) is an oligopeptide that seems to bind chromium(III) in the body. It consists of four amino acid residues; aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, and glycine, bonded with four (Cr3+) centers. In vitro, it interacts with the insulin receptor by prolonging kinase activity through stimulating the tyrosine kinase pathway, although this effect has not been adequately shown in vivo. == Health claims == === Body weight === Although chromium(III) picolinate has been marketed in the United States as an aid to body development for athletes, and as a means of losing weight, there is insufficient evidence that it provides this effect. Reviews have reported either no effect on either muscle growth or fat loss, or a small weight loss in trials longer than 12 weeks, preventing a conclusion about a positive effect of chromium supplementation. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the literature and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a claim of effect on body weight. === Diabetes === Although there were claims that trivalent chromium supplementation aids in reducing insulin resistance, particularly in type 2 diabetes, reviews showed no association between chromium supplementation and glucose or insulin concentrations. Two reviews concluded that chromium(III) picolinate may be more effective at lowering blood glucose levels compared to other chromium-containing dietary supplements. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim for chromium picolinate as a dietary supplement relating to insulin resistance and risk of type 2 diabetes. Any company wishing to make such a claim must use the exact wording: ""One small study suggests that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance, and therefore possibly may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. FDA concludes, however, that the existence of such a relationship between chromium picolinate and either insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain."" As part of the petition review process, the FDA rejected other claims for reducing abnormally elevated blood sugar, risk of cardiovascular disease, risk of retinopathy or risk of kidney disease. In 2006, the FDA added that the ""relationship between chromium(III) picolinate intake and insulin resistance is highly uncertain"". == Safety and toxicity == There is little evidence that trivalent chromium in typical supplement amounts causes toxicity in humans. Oral use of chromium is considered to be relatively safe because ingested chromium is poorly absorbed and the amount absorbed is rapidly excreted. Use of chromium picolinate may cause an allergic reaction, headache, insomnia, or irritability, and may interfere with normal thinking and muscular coordination. It has possible interactions with dozens of prescription drugs and other supplements. Diabetic people who take insulin should not use chromium picolinate, as it may adversely affect insulin levels and control of blood glucose. Chromium picolinate should not be used while pregnant or during breastfeeding. Although the safety of daily chromium doses of up to 1,000 μg has been shown, there are some reports of serious adverse effects by using chromium picolinate, including kidney failure from a six-week course of 600 μg per day and liver disease after using 1,200 to 2,400 μg per day over four to five months. == Regulation of chromium(III) picolinate == In 2004, the UK Food Standards Agency advised consumers to use other forms of trivalent chromium in preference to chromium(III) picolinate until specialist advice was received from the Committee on Mutagenicity. This was due to concerns raised by the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals that chromium(III) picolinate might be genotoxic (cause cancer). The committee also noted two case reports of kidney failure that might have been caused by this supplement and called for further research into its safety. In December 2004, the Committee on Mutagenicity published its findings, which concluded that ""overall it can be concluded that the balance of the data suggest that chromium(III) picolinate should be regarded as not being mutagenic in vitro"" and that ""the available in-vivo tests in mammals with chromium(III) picolinate are negative"". Following these findings, the UK Food Standards Agency withdrew its advice to avoid chromium(III) picolinate, though it plans to keep its advice about chromium supplements under review. In 2010, chromium(III) picolinate was approved by Health Canada to be used in dietary supplements. Approved labeling statements include: a factor in the maintenance of good health, provides support for healthy glucose metabolism, helps the body to metabolize carbohydrates and helps the body to metabolize fats. == References == == External links == Media related to Chromium(III) picolinate at Wikimedia Commons Merck Manual",Chromium picolinate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.020085496827960014), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.20163494348526), (' PERSONAL', -0.2524816393852234), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.6962286233901978), (' INDUSTR', -0.009242895059287548), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.16000856459140778), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.02329017035663128), ('ĠMED', -0.5089974403381348), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038059547543525696)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.20155270397663116), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -2.339278580620885e-06), (' FOOD', -0.0017100441036745906), (',', -0.20141607522964478), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.drugs.com/mtm/chromium-picolinate.html,https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/chromium-picolinate,https://www.verywellhealth.com/chromium-picolinate-side-effects-89554 ', [])"
2515,"('Dextran', 'Dextran 40')","Food, Medical","Dextran is a complex branched glucan (polysaccharide derived from the condensation of glucose), originally derived from wine. IUPAC defines dextrans as ""Branched poly-α-d-glucosides of microbial origin having glycosidic bonds predominantly C-1 → C-6"". Dextran chains are of varying lengths (from 3 to 2000 kilodaltons). The polymer main chain consists of α-1,6 glycosidic linkages between glucose monomers, with branches from α-1,3 linkages. This characteristic branching distinguishes a dextran from a dextrin, which is a straight chain glucose polymer tethered by α-1,4 or α-1,6 linkages. == Occurrence == Dextran was discovered by Louis Pasteur as a microbial product in wine, but mass production was only possible after the development by Allene Jeanes of a process using bacteria. Dental plaque is rich in dextrans. Dextran is a complicating contaminant in the refining of sugar because it elevates the viscosity of sucrose solutions and fouls plumbing. Dextran is now produced from sucrose by certain lactic acid bacteria of the family lactobacillus. Species include Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus mutans. The structure of dextran produced depends not only on the family and species of the bacterium but on the strain. They are separated by fractional precipitation from protein-free extracts using ethanol. Some bacteria coproduce fructans, which can complicate the isolation of the dextrans. == Uses == Dextran 70 is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a health system. Medicinally it is used as an antithrombotic (antiplatelet), to reduce blood viscosity, and as a volume expander in hypovolaemia. === Microsurgery === These agents are used commonly by microsurgeons to decrease vascular thrombosis. The antithrombotic effect of dextran is mediated through its binding of erythrocytes, platelets, and vascular endothelium, increasing their electronegativity and thus reducing erythrocyte aggregation and platelet adhesiveness. Dextrans also reduce factor VIII-Ag Von Willebrand factor, thereby decreasing platelet function. Clots formed after administration of dextrans are more easily lysed due to an altered thrombus structure (more evenly distributed platelets with coarser fibrin). By inhibiting α-2 antiplasmin, dextran serves as a plasminogen activator, so possesses thrombolytic features. Outside of these features, larger dextrans, which do not pass out of the vessels, are potent osmotic agents, thus have been used urgently to treat hypovolemia . The hemodilution caused by volume expansion with dextran use improves blood flow, thus further improving the patency of microanastomoses and reducing thrombosis. Still, no difference has been detected in antithrombotic effectiveness in comparison with intra-arterial and intravenous administration of dextran. Dextrans are available in multiple molecular weights ranging from 3 kDa to 2 MDa. The larger dextrans (>60,000 Da) are excreted poorly from the kidney, so remain in the blood for as long as weeks until they are metabolized. Consequently, they have prolonged antithrombotic and colloidal effects. In this family, dextran-40 (MW: 40,000 Da), has been the most popular member for anticoagulation therapy. Close to 70% of dextran-40 is excreted in urine within the first 24 hours after intravenous infusion, while the remaining 30% are retained for several more days. === Other medical uses === Dextran is used in some eye drops as a lubricant. and in certain intravenous fluids to solubilize other factors, such as iron (in a solution known as Iron Dextran). Intravenous solutions with dextran function both as volume expanders and means of parenteral nutrition. Such a solution provides an osmotically neutral fluid that once in the body is digested by cells into glucose and free water. It is occasionally used to replace lost blood in emergency situations, when replacement blood is not available, but must be used with caution as it does not provide necessary electrolytes and can cause hyponatremia or other electrolyte disturbances. Dextran also increases blood sugar levels. Dextran can be used in an ATPS for PEGylation === Laboratory uses === Dextran is used in the osmotic stress technique for applying osmotic pressure to biological molecules. It is also used in some size-exclusion chromatography matrices; an example is Sephadex. Dextran has also been used in bead form to aid in bioreactor applications. Dextran has been used as an immobilization agent in biosensors. Dextran preferentially binds to early endosomes; fluorescent-labelled dextran can be used to visualize these endosomes under a microscope. Dextran can be used as a stabilizing coating to protect metal nanoparticles from oxidation and improve biocompatibility. Dextran coupled with a fluorescent molecule such as fluorescein isothiocyanate can be used to create concentration gradients of diffusible molecules for imaging and allow subsequent characterization of gradient slope. Solutions of fluorescently-labelled dextran can be perfused through engineered vessels to analyze vascular permeability Dextran is used to make microcarriers for industrial cell culture Orally-administered dextran sodium sulphate is used to induce colitis in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease. Dextran is a common model compound to test the potential of drug formulations to facilitate intestinal absorption via the paracellular route. == Side effects == Although relatively few side effects are associated with dextran use, these side effects can be very serious. These include anaphylaxis, volume overload, pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, or platelet dysfunction. An uncommon but significant complication of dextran osmotic effect is acute kidney injury. The pathogenesis of this kidney failure is the subject of many debates with direct toxic effect on tubules and glomerulus versus intraluminal hyperviscosity being some of the proposed mechanisms. Patients with history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or vascular disorders are most at risk. Brooks and others recommend the avoidance of dextran therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease. == Research == Efforts have been made to develop modified dextran polymers. One of these has acetal modified hydroxyl groups. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents. This allows it to be processed in the same manner as many polyesters, like poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), through processes like solvent evaporation and emulsion. Acetalated dextran is structurally different from acetylated dextran. As of 2017 several uses for drug delivery had been explored in vitro and a few had been tested in animal models. == See also == Dextran drug delivery systems Pentoxifylline == References == == External links == Resource on dextran properties and structure of dextran polymers Dextrans at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Dextran,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0005798388738185167), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0019293478690087795), (' FOOD', -0.691554605960846), (',', -0.004083743318915367), (' INDUSTR', -0.05207597836852074), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.005547011736780405), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.04860050231218338), ('ĠINDU', -0.25574469566345215), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10022319108247757)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('MED', -4.692145012086257e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -3.7697225252486533e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.06200006976723671), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.014163628220558167), (' FOOD', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextran,https://dextran.com/dextran-applications/,https://creamscan.com/ingredients/dextran/ ', [])"
2516,"('Esomeprazole magnesium', '(s)-omeprazole magnesium', 'Omeprazole magnesium')",Medical,"Esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium [or Neksium] among others, is a medication which reduces stomach acid. It is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Its effectiveness is similar to that of other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. Serious side effects may include angioedema, Clostridioides difficile infection, and pneumonia. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe, while safety during breastfeeding is unclear. Esomeprazole is the (S)-(−)-enantiomer (or less specifically the S-isomer) of omeprazole. It works by blocking H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells of the stomach. It was patented in 1993 and approved for medical use in 2000. It is available as a generic medication and sold over the counter in several countries. In 2022, it was the 122nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. It is also available in lower dose formulations without a prescription in the United States, the United Kingdom as well as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. == Medical use == The primary uses of esomeprazole are gastroesophageal reflux disease, treatment and maintenance of erosive esophagitis, treatment of duodenal ulcers caused by H. pylori, prevention of gastric ulcers in those on chronic NSAID therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with Crohn's disease. === Gastroesophageal reflux disease === Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which the digestive acid in the stomach comes in contact with the esophagus. The irritation caused by this disorder is known as heartburn. Long-term contact between gastric acids and the esophagus can cause permanent damage to the esophagus and is associated with Barrett's esophagus. Esomeprazole reduces the production of digestive acids, thus reducing their effect on the esophagus. === Duodenal ulcers === Esomeprazole is combined with the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin (or metronidazole instead of amoxicillin in penicillin-hypersensitive patients) in a 10-day eradication triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori. Infection by H. pylori is a causative factor in the majority of peptic and duodenal ulcers. === Efficacy === A 2006 meta analysis concluded that compared to other proton pump inhibitors, esomeprazole confers a modest overall benefit in esophageal healing and symptom relief. When broken down by disease severity, the benefit of esomeprazole relative to other proton pump inhibitors was negligible in people with mild disease (number needed to treat 50), but appeared more in those with severe disease (number needed to treat 8). A second meta analysis also found increases in erosive esophageal healing (>95% healing rate) when compared to standardized doses in broadly selected patient populations. A 2017 study found esomeprazole to be among a number of effective PPIs. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, decreased appetite, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. More severe side effects are severe allergic reactions, chest pain, dark urine, fast heartbeat, fever, paresthesia, persistent sore throat, severe stomach pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, and yellowing of the eyes or skin. Proton pump inhibitors may be associated with a greater risk of hip fractures and Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea. Patients are frequently administered the drugs in intensive care as a protective measure against ulcers, but this use is also associated with a 30% increase in occurrence of pneumonia. Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors in patients treated for Helicobacter pylori has been shown to dramatically increase the risk of gastric cancer. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is a possible adverse reaction when using proton pump inhibitors. == Interactions == Esomeprazole is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2C19, and may therefore interact with drugs that depend on it for metabolism, such as diazepam and warfarin; the concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with esomeprazole. Conversely, clopidogrel (Plavix) is an inactive prodrug that partially depends on CYP2C19 for conversion to its active form; inhibition of CYP2C19 blocks the activation of clopidogrel, thus reducing its effects. Drugs that depend on stomach pH for absorption may interact with esomeprazole; drugs that depend on an acidic environment (such as ketoconazole or atazanavir) will be poorly absorbed, whereas drugs that are broken down in acidic environments (such as erythromycin) will be absorbed to a greater extent than normal. == Pharmacokinetics == Single 20 to 40 mg oral doses generally give rise to peak plasma esomeprazole concentrations of 0.5-1.0 mg/L within 1–4 hours, but after several days of once-daily administration, these levels may increase by about 50%. A 30-minute intravenous infusion of a similar dose usually produces peak plasma levels on the order of 1–3 mg/L. The drug is rapidly cleared from the body, largely by urinary excretion of pharmacologically inactive metabolites such as 5-hydroxymethylesomeprazole and 5-carboxyesomeprazole. Esomeprazole and its metabolites are analytically indistinguishable from omeprazole and the corresponding omeprazole metabolites unless chiral techniques are employed. == Dosage forms == Esomeprazole is available as delayed-release capsules in the United States or as delayed-release tablets in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada (containing esomeprazole magnesium) in strengths of 20 and 40 mg, as delayed-release capsules in the United States (containing esomeprazole strontium) in a 49.3 mg strength (delivering the equivalent of 40 mg of esomeprazole, and as esomeprazole sodium for intravenous injection/infusion. Oral esomeprazole preparations are enteric-coated, due to the rapid degradation of the drug in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This is achieved by formulating capsules using the multiple-unit pellet system. The combination naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium (brand name Vimovo) is used for the prevention of gastric ulcers associated with chronic NSAID therapy. Vimovo is available in two dosage strengths: 500/20 mg and 375/20 mg. Clinical trials of naproxen/esomeprazole demonstrated an incidence of GI ulcer in 24% of patients on naproxen (alone) versus 7% on naproxen/esomeprazole. The FDA has added warnings to the label for Vimovo concerning acute interstitial nephritis and risk of kidney problems in some patients. === Multiple-unit pellet system === Esomeprazole capsules, as well as Losec/Prilosec tablets, are formulated as a ""multiple-unit pellet system"" (MUPS). Essentially, the capsule consists of extremely small enteric-coated granules (pellets) of the esomeprazole formulation inside an outer shell. When the capsule is immersed in an aqueous solution, as happens when the capsule reaches the stomach, water enters the capsule by osmosis. The contents swell from water absorption, causing the shell to burst, and releasing the enteric-coated granules. For most patients, the multiple-unit pellet system is of no advantage over conventional enteric-coated preparations. Patients for whom the formulation is of benefit include those requiring nasogastric tube feeding and those with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). == Society and culture == === Global distribution === In 2010, AstraZeneca announced a co-promotion agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to distribute Nexium in Japan. In September 2011, Nexium was approved for sale and was launched by Daiichi Sankyo in Japan. Esomeprazole was approved for use in the United States in February 2001. === Economics === Between the launch of esomeprazole in 2001 and 2005, the drug netted AstraZeneca about $14.4 billion. === Controversy === There has been some controversy about AstraZeneca's behaviour in creating, patenting, and marketing the drug. Esomeprazole's successful predecessor, omeprazole, is a mixture of two mirror-imaged molecules (esomeprazole which is the S-enantiomer, and R-omeprazole); critics said the company was trying to ""evergreen"" its omeprazole patent by patenting the pure esomeprazole and aggressively marketing to doctors that it is more effective than the mixture. === Brand names === Generic versions of esomeprazole magnesium are available worldwide. It is available over-the-counter under the brand name Nexium in the United States and the UK. === Veterinary use === Injection formulations of esomeprazole are used for gastroprotection in veterinary medicine. In goats administered the drug by intravenous or subcutaneous injection rapid elimination was noted. In that study the sulfone metabolite was detectable for several hours after injection of the parent drug. == Other uses == Esomeprazole can be used as a parasiticide. Gokmen et al., 2016 screen for efficacy against Trichomonas vaginalis isolates from horses. They found esomeprazole to be effective as a veterinary antiparasitic. == References == == Further reading ==",Esomeprazole magnesium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7404405298293568e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019382515456527472)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esomeprazole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Esomeprazole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esomeprazole?utm_source=openai')])"
2517,"('Exendin-4 (acetate)', 'Exenatide (acetate)')",Medical," The escalation predicted for the incidence of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity has prompted investigators to search for additional pharmacotherapeutic approaches to their treatment. Two of these approaches, combination pharmacotherapy and utilization of leptin-related bioactive synthetic peptides as anti-diabetes/anti-obesity agents, were used in the present study. Exenatide or pramlintide acetate was reconstituted in dodecyl maltoside (DDM) in the absence or presence of [D-Leu-4]-OB3, and delivered orally by gavage to insulin-resistant male C57BLK/6-m db/db mice twice daily for 14 days. Body weight gain, food and water intake, blood glucose, and serum insulin levels were measured. Mice given DDM alone for 14 days were 19.7% heavier than they were at the beginning of the study, while oral delivery of exenatide or [D-Leu-4]-OB3 in DDM reduced body weight gain to only 13.9% and 11.5%, respectively, of initial body weight. Mice receiving exenatide and [D-Leu-4]-OB3 were 4.2% lighter than they were at the beginning of the study. In another study, Intravail® treated control mice gained 38.2% of their initial body weight, while mice receiving pramlintide acetate or [D-Leu-4]-OB3 were only 26.8% and 25.4% heavier, respectively, at the end of the study, Co-administration of pramlintide acetate and [D-Leu-4]-OB3 did not further enhance the effect of pramlintide acetate on body weight gain. Food intake was reduced by exenatide, pramlintide acetate, and [D-Leu-4]-OB3 alone, and co-delivery with [D-Leu-4]-OB3 did not induce a further decrease. Water intake was not affected by exenatide, pramlintide acetate, or [D-Leu-4]-OB3 alone, but co-delivery of exenatide or pramlintide acetate with [D-Leu-4]-OB3 resulted in a significant reduction in water intake. Oral delivery of exenatide or pramlintide acetate in DDM significantly lowered blood glucose levels by 20.4% and 30.2%, respectively. Co-delivery with [D-Leu-4]-OB3 further reduced blood glucose by 38.3% and 50.5%, respectively. A concentration-dependent increase in serum insulin was observed in response to increasing concentrations of exenatide, and [D-Leu-4]-OB3 slightly reduced the insulin response to exenatide at all concentrations tested. Increasing concentrations of pramlintide acetate alone did not elevate serum insulin, and when given in combination with [D-Leu-4]-OB3, serum insulin levels fell below those of DDM-treated control mice. Our data indicate that (1) exenatide and pramlintide acetate, currently administered by subcutaneous injection, can be given orally in DDM; (2) the bioactivity of exenatide and pramlintide acetate is retained following oral delivery in DDM; and (3) the effects of exenatide and pramlintide acetate on energy balance and glycemic control can be enhanced by co-administration with [D-Leu-4]-OB3, a synthetic peptide amide with leptin-like activity. The once-weekly Bydureon® (Bdn) PLGA microsphere formulation encapsulating the GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide acetate, is an important complex injectable product prepared by coacervation for the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients. Encapsulation by coacervation is useful to minimize an undesirable initial burst of exenatide, but it suffers from manufacturing difficulties such as process scale-up and batch-to-batch variations. Herein we prepared exenatide acetate-PLGA formulations of similar compositions using the desirable alternative double emulsion-solvent evaporation technique. After screening several process variables, we varied the PLGA concentration, the hardening temperature, and the collected particle size range, and determined the resulting drug and sucrose loading, initial burst release, in vitro retention kinetics, and peptide degradation profiles using Bdn as a positive control. All formulations exhibited a triphasic release profile with a burst, lag, and rapid release phase, although the burst release was greatly decreased to <5% for some. Marked differences were observed in the peptide degradation profiles, particularly the oxidized and acylated fractions, when the polymer concentration was varied. For one optimal formulation, the release and peptide degradation profiles were similar to Bdn microspheres, albeit with an induction time shift of one week, likely due to the slightly higher Mw of PLGA in Bdn. These results highlight the effects of key manufacturing variables on drug release and stability in composition-equivalent microspheres encapsulating exenatide acetate and indicate the potential of manufacturing the microsphere component of Bdn by solvent evaporation.",Exendin-4 (acetate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002550921868532896), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860492795705795)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/exendin-4-acetate.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=9, title='Exendin-4 | Exenatide acetate| GLP-1 activator | CAS# 141758-74-9 | glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/exendin-4-acetate.html?utm_source=openai')])"
2518,"('Ferrous bisglycinate',)",Medical,"Iron supplements, also known as iron salts and iron pills, are a number of iron formulations used to treat and prevent iron deficiency including iron deficiency anemia. For prevention they are only recommended in those with poor absorption, heavy menstrual periods, pregnancy, hemodialysis, or a diet low in iron. Prevention may also be used in low birth weight babies. They are taken by mouth, injection into a vein, or injection into a muscle. While benefits may be seen in days, up to two months may be required until iron levels return to normal. Common side effects include constipation, abdominal pain, dark stools, and diarrhea. Other side effects, which may occur with excessive use, include iron overload and iron toxicity. Ferrous salts used as supplements by mouth include ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous succinate, and ferrous sulfate. Injectable forms include iron dextran and iron sucrose. They work by providing the iron needed for making red blood cells. Iron pills have been used medically since at least 1681, with an easy-to-use formulation being created in 1832 using Chicken Liver extracts and majority from plants. Ferrous salt is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ferrous salts are available as a generic medication and over the counter. Slow release formulations, while available, are not recommended. In 2021, ferrous sulfate was the 105th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Iron supplements are used to treat or prevent iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia; parenteral irons can also be used to treat functional iron deficiency, where requirements for iron are greater than the body's ability to supply iron such as in inflammatory states. The main criterion is that other causes of anemia have also been investigated, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, drug induced or due to other poisons such as lead, as often the anemia has more than one underlying cause. Iron deficiency anemia is classically a microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Generally, in the UK oral preparations are trialled before using parenteral delivery, unless there is the requirement for a rapid response, previous intolerance to oral iron or likely failure to respond. Intravenous iron may decrease the need for blood transfusions however it increases the risk of infections when compared to oral iron. Daily oral supplementation of iron during pregnancy reduces the risk of maternal anemia and that effects on infant and on other maternal outcomes are not clear. Another review found tentative evidence that intermittent iron supplements by mouth for mothers and babies is similar to daily supplementation with fewer side effects. Supplements by mouth should be taken on an empty stomach, optionally with a small amount of food to reduce discomfort. === Athletes === Athletes may be at elevated risk of iron deficiency and so benefit from supplementation, but the circumstances vary between individuals and dosage should be based on tested ferritin levels, since in some cases supplementation may be harmful. === Frequent blood donors === Frequent blood donors may be advised to take iron supplements. Canadian Blood Services recommends discussing ""taking iron supplements with your doctor or pharmacist"" as ""the amount of iron in most multivitamins may not meet your needs and iron supplements may be necessary"". The American Red Cross recommends ""taking a multivitamin with 18 mg of iron or an iron supplement with 18-38 mg of elemental iron for 60 days after each blood donation, for 120 days after each power red donation or after frequent platelet donations"". A 2014 Cochrane Review found that blood donors were less likely to be deferred for low hemoglobin levels if they were taking oral iron supplements, although 29% of those who took them experienced side effects in contrast to the 17% that took a placebo. It is unknown what the long-term effects of iron supplementation for blood donors may be. == Side effects == Side effects of therapy with oral iron are most often diarrhea or constipation and epigastric abdominal discomfort. Taken after a meal, side effects decrease, but there is an increased risk of interaction with other substances. Side effects are dose-dependent, and the dose may be adjusted. The patient may notice that their stools become black. This is completely harmless, but patients must be warned about this to avoid unnecessary concern. When iron supplements are given in a liquid form, teeth may reversibly discolor (this can be avoided through the use of a straw). Intramuscular injection can be painful, and brown discoloration may be noticed. Treatments with iron(II) sulfate have higher incidence of adverse events than iron(III)-hydroxide polymaltose complex (IPC) or iron bis-glycinate chelate. Iron overdose has been one of the leading causes of death caused by toxicological agents in children younger than six years. Iron poisoning may result in mortality or short-term and long-term morbidity. === Infection risk === Because one of the functions of elevated ferritin (an acute phase reaction protein) in acute infections is thought to be to sequester iron from bacteria, it is generally thought that iron supplementation (which circumvents this mechanism) should be avoided in patients who have active bacterial infections. Replacement of iron stores is seldom such an emergency situation that it cannot wait for any such acute infection to be treated. Some studies have found that iron supplementation can lead to an increase in infectious disease morbidity in areas where bacterial infections are common. For example, children receiving iron-enriched foods have demonstrated an increased rate in diarrhea overall and enteropathogen shedding. Iron deficiency protects against infection by creating an unfavorable environment for bacterial growth. Nevertheless, while iron deficiency might lessen infections by certain pathogenic diseases, it also leads to a reduction in resistance to other strains of viral or bacterial infections, such as Salmonella typhimurium or Entamoeba histolytica. Overall, it is sometimes difficult to decide whether iron supplementation will be beneficial or harmful to an individual in an environment that is prone to many infectious diseases; however this is a different question than the question of supplementation in individuals who are already ill with a bacterial infection. Children living in areas prone for malarial infections are also at risk of developing anemia. It was thought that iron supplementation given to such children could increase the risk of malarial infection in them. A Cochrane systematic review published in 2016 found high quality evidence that iron supplementation does not increase the risk of clinical malaria in children. == Contraindications == Contraindications often depend on the substance in question. Documented hypersensitivity to any ingredients and anemias without proper work-up (i.e., documentation of iron deficiency) is true of all preparations. Some can be used in iron deficiency, others require iron deficiency anaemia to be present. Some are also contraindicated in rheumatoid arthritis. === Hemochromatosis === Individuals may be genetically predisposed to excessive iron absorption, as is the case with those with HFE hereditary hemochromatosis. Within the general population, 1 out of 400 people has the homozygous form of this genetic trait, and 1 out of every 10 people has its heterozygous form. Neither individuals with the homozygous or heterozygous form should take iron supplements. == Interactions == Non-heme iron forms an insoluble complex with several other drugs, resulting in decreased absorption of both iron and the other drug. Examples include tetracycline, penicillamine, methyldopa, levodopa, bisphosphonates and quinolones. The same can occur with elements in food, such as calcium, which impacts both heme and non-heme iron absorption. Absorption of iron is better at a low pH (i.e. an acidic environment), and absorption is decreased if there is a simultaneous intake of antacids. Many other substances decrease the rate of non-heme iron absorption. One example is tannins from foods such as tea and phytic acid. Because iron from plant sources is less easily absorbed than the heme-bound iron of animal sources, vegetarians and vegans should have a somewhat higher total daily iron intake than those who eat meat, fish or poultry. Taken after a meal, there are fewer side effects but there is also less absorption because of interaction and pH alteration. Generally, an interval of 2–3 hours between the iron intake and that of other drugs seems advisable, but is less convenient for patients and can impact on compliance. == History == The first pills were commonly known as Blaud's pills, which were named after P. Blaud of Beaucaire, the French physician who introduced and started the use of these medications as a treatment for patients with anemia. == Administration == === By mouth === Iron can be supplemented by mouth using various forms, such as iron(II) sulfate. This is the most common and well studied soluble iron salt sold under brand names such as Feratab, Fer-Iron, and Slow-FE. It is in complex with gluconate, dextran, carbonyl iron, and other salts. Ascorbic acid, vitamin C, increases the absorption of non-heme sources of iron, but not to a clinically significant degree. Heme iron polypeptide (HIP) (e.g. Proferrin ES and Proferrin Forte) can be used when regular iron supplements such as ferrous sulfate or ferrous fumarate are not tolerated or absorbed. A clinical study demonstrated that HIP increased serum iron levels 23 times greater than ferrous fumarate on a milligram-per-milligram basis. Another alternative is ferrous glycine sulfate or ferroglycine sulfate, has less gastrointestinal side-effects than standard preparations such as iron fumarate. It is unusual among oral preparations of iron supplements in that the iron in this preparation has very high oral bioavailability, especially in the liquid formulation. This option should be evaluated before resorting to parenteral therapy. It is especially useful in iron deficiency anemia associated with autoimmune gastritis and Helicobacter pylori gastritis, where it generally has satisfactory effect. Since iron stores in the body are generally depleted, and there is a limit to what the body can process (about 2–6 mg/kg of body mass per day; i.e. for a 100 kg/220 lb man this is equal to a maximum dose of 200–600 mg/per day) without iron poisoning, this is a chronic therapy which may take 3–6 months. Due to the frequent intolerance of oral iron and the slow improvement, parenteral iron is recommended in many indications. === By injection === Iron therapy (intravenously or intramuscular) is given when therapy by mouth has failed (not tolerated), oral absorption is seriously compromised (by illnesses, or when the person cannot swallow), benefit from oral therapy cannot be expected, or fast improvement is required (for example, prior to elective surgery). Parenteral therapy is more expensive than oral iron preparations and is not suitable during the first trimester of pregnancy. There are cases where parenteral iron is preferable over oral iron. These are cases where oral iron is not tolerated, where the haemoglobin needs to be increased quickly (e.g. post partum, post operatively, post transfusion), where there is an underlying inflammatory condition (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease) or renal patients, the benefits of parenteral iron far outweigh the risks. Low-certainty evidence suggests that IBD-related anemia treatment with Intravenous (IV) iron infusion may be more effective than oral iron therapy, with fewer people needing to stop treatment early due to adverse effects. The type of iron preparation may be an important determinant of clinical benefit. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests response to treatment may be higher when IV ferric carboxymaltose, rather than IV iron sucrose preparation is used, despite very-low certainty evidence of increased adverse effects, including bleeding, in those receiving ferric carboxymaltose treatment. In many cases, use of intravenous iron such as ferric carboxymaltose has lower risks of adverse events than a blood transfusion and as long as the person is stable is a better alternative. Ultimately this always remains a clinical decision based on local guidelines, although National Guidelines are increasingly stipulating IV iron in certain groups of patients. A Cochrane review of controlled trials comparing intravenous (IV) iron therapy with oral iron supplements in people with chronic kidney disease, found low-certainty evidence that people receiving IV-iron treatment were 1.71 times as likely to reach their target hemoglobin levels. Overall, hemoglobin was 0.71g/dl higher than those treated with oral iron supplements. Iron stores in the liver, estimated by serum ferritin, were also 224.84 μg/L higher in those receiving IV-iron. However, there was also low-certainty evidence that allergic reactions were more likely following IV-iron therapy. It was unclear whether type of iron therapy administration affects the risk of death from any cause, including cardiovascular, nor whether it may alter the number of people who may require a blood transfusion or dialysis. Soluble iron salts have a significant risk of adverse effects and can cause toxicity due to damage to cellular macromolecules. Delivering iron parenterally has utilised various different molecules to limit this. This has included dextrans, sucrose, carboxymaltose, and Isomaltoside 1000. One formulation of parenteral iron is iron dextran which covers the old high molecular weight (brand name Dexferrum) and the much safer low molecular iron dextrans (brand names including Cosmofer and Infed). Iron sucrose has an occurrence of allergic reactions of less than 1 in 1000. A common side effect is taste changes, especially a metallic taste, occurring in between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 treated patients. It has a maximum dose of 200 mg on each occasion according to the SPC, but it has been given in doses of 500 mg. Doses can be given up to 3 times a week. Iron carboxymaltose is marketed as Ferinject, Injectafer, and Iroprem in various countries. The most common side effects are headaches which occur in 3.3%, and hypophosphatemia, which occurs in more than 35%. Iron isomaltoside 1000 (brand name Monofer) is a formulation of parenteral iron that has a matrix structure that results in very low levels of free iron and labile iron. It can be given at high doses – 20 mg/kg in a single visit – no upper dose limit. This formulation has the benefit of giving a full iron correction in a single visit. Ferric maltol, marketed as Accrufer and Ferracru, is available in oral and intravenous preparations. When used as a treatment for IBD-related anemia, very low certainty evidence suggests a marked benefit with oral ferric maltol compared with placebo. However it was unclear whether the IV preparation was more effective than oral ferric maltol. == References ==",Ferrous bisglycinate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001307142956648022), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00020168177434243262), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2519429326057434)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.06196846812963486), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -9.615255839889869e-05)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; ([lohmann-minerals.com](https://www.lohmann-minerals.com/en-us/products/product-finder/ferrous-bisglycinate/?utm_source=openai), [go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB11210?utm_source=openai), [wbcil.com](https://www.wbcil.com/api-fine-chemicals-nutraceutical/iron/ferrous-bisglycinate/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=333, start_index=15, title='Ferrous bisglycinate - Dr. Paul Lohmann', type='url_citation', url='https://www.lohmann-minerals.com/en-us/products/product-finder/ferrous-bisglycinate/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=333, start_index=15, title='Ferrous bisglycinate: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB11210?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=333, start_index=15, title='Ferrous Bisglycinate Manufacturer & Supplier In India', type='url_citation', url='https://www.wbcil.com/api-fine-chemicals-nutraceutical/iron/ferrous-bisglycinate/?utm_source=openai')])"

We speculate that the shape of gadobutrol kinetic curve may be influenced by different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and evaluation methods. The purpose of our study was to assess the influence between gadobutrol and other conventional contrast agent (gadodiamide hydrate) on the kinetic curve in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We assessed 139 women of IDC in this study. Gadodiamide hydrate (2 ml/s) was administered to 69 women, and gadobutrol (1 ml/s) was administrated to 70 women, both contrast agents at 0.1 mmol/kg BW. When the kinetic curves of contrast agents were evaluated between by Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4th edition and BI-RADS 5th edition, suggested that the analysis method of BI-RADS may affect. Patient group who were administered gadobutrol demonstrated a lower washout rate when compared with patient group who were administered gadodiamide hydrate administration (P<0.01). These results suggest that the kinetic curve characteristics of gadobutrol are an important consideration in diagnosis. Therefore, it is necessary to perform image diagnosis by considering the influence of the contrast agent and the analysis method, when image diagnostic doctor perform image diagnosis. The degree of contrast enhancement of the cochlea after intratympanic administration of meglumine gadopentetate (Gd-DTPA) or gadodiamide hydrate (Gd-DTPA-BMA) varies widely among patients with inner ear diseases. There was no morphological change in the stria vascularis after Gd-DTPA or Gd-DTPA-BMA was placed on the round window of guinea pigs. We investigated the degree of contrast enhancement of the inner ear after intratympanic administration of ionized and nonionized gadolinium (Gd) contrast agents in patients with inner ear diseases. The inner ear toxicities of these agents were investigated in guinea pigs. 3D-FLAIR MRI was conducted 1 day after the intratympanic injection of eightfold-diluted Gd-DTPA or Gd-DTPA-BMA in 73 patients with inner ear diseases. Gd enhancement of the basal turn of the cochlea was evaluated as the signal intensity (SI) ratio between the affected and nonaffected sides. In guinea pigs, nondiluted Gd-DTPA, Gd-DTPA-BMA or saline was placed on the round window for 1 h and the stria vascularis was observed using electron microscopy. The SI ratio ranged from 1.5 to 16.5 in the Gd-DTPA group and from 2.5 to 21 in the Gd-DTPA-BMA group.

2521,"('Gadopentetic acid', 'Gd-dtpa', 'Gadolinium complex')",Medical,"Gadopentetic acid, sold under the brand name Magnevist, is a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent. It is usually administered as a salt of a complex of gadolinium with DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentacetate) with the chemical formula A2[Gd(DTPA)(H2O)]; when cation A is the protonated form of the amino sugar meglumine the salt goes under the name ""gadopentetate dimeglumine"". It was described in 1981 by Hanns-Joachim Weinmann and colleagues and introduced as the first MRI contrast agent in 1987 by the Schering AG. It is used to assist imaging of blood vessels and of inflamed or diseased tissue where the blood vessels become ""leaky"". It is often used when viewing intracranial lesions with abnormal vascularity or abnormalities in the blood–brain barrier. It is usually injected intravenously. Gd-DTPA is classed as an acyclic, ionic gadolinium contrast medium. Its paramagnetic property reduces the T1 relaxation time (and to some extent the T2 and T2* relaxation times) in NMR, which is the source of its clinical utility. Gadolinium based agents may cause a toxic reaction known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severe kidney problems. Compared to other gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents, Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA2-) chelates allow delayed Gadolinium-enhanced Magnetic Resonance of Cartilage (dGEMRIC). The unique charge characteristic of this complex allows researchers to inversely measure spin-lattice relaxation times as they are related to the concentration of proteoglycan aggregates and charged glycosaminoglycan side chains in articular cartilage. == Chemical structure and mode of action == In the complex of Gd3+ and DTPA5− the gadolinium ion is 9-coordinate, surrounded by the 3 nitrogen atoms and 5 oxygen atoms from the carboxylate groups.

This water molecule is labile and exchanges rapidly with water molecules in the immediate vicinity of the gadolinium complex. The gadolinium ion has 7 unpaired electrons with parallel spins and is strongly paramagnetic with an 8S electronic ground state. The relaxation time of the water molecules is affected by their intermittent binding to the paramagnetic centre.

2522,"('Glycogen',)","Endogenous, Medical","Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in animals, fungi, and bacteria. It is the main storage form of glucose in the human body. Glycogen functions as one of three regularly used forms of energy reserves, creatine phosphate being for very short-term, glycogen being for short-term and the triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat) being for long-term storage. Protein, broken down into amino acids, is seldom used as a main energy source except during starvation and glycolytic crisis (see bioenergetic systems). In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle. In the liver, glycogen can make up 5–6% of the organ's fresh weight: the liver of an adult, weighing 1.5 kg, can store roughly 100–120 grams of glycogen. In skeletal muscle, glycogen is found in a low concentration (1–2% of the muscle mass): the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg stores roughly 400 grams of glycogen. Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells, including the kidneys, red blood cells, white blood cells, and glial cells in the brain. The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo. The amount of glycogen stored in the body mostly depends on oxidative type 1 fibres, physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits. Different levels of resting muscle glycogen are reached by changing the number of glycogen particles, rather than increasing the size of existing particles though most glycogen particles at rest are smaller than their theoretical maximum. Approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times; in fasting individuals, blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores, primarily from the liver (glycogen in skeletal muscle is mainly used as an immediate source of energy for that muscle rather than being used to maintain physiological blood glucose levels). Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself; however, the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake from the blood, thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues. Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body, particularly the central nervous system. The human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood glucose in fasted, sedentary individuals. Glycogen is an analogue of starch, a glucose polymer that functions as energy storage in plants. It has a structure similar to amylopectin (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white powders in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol/cytoplasm in many cell types, and plays an important role in the glucose cycle. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides (lipids). As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa. == Structure == Glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units and 2,000-60,000 residues per one molecule of glycogen. Like amylopectin, glucose units are linked together linearly by α(1→4) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain. Each glycogen is essentially a ball of glucose trees, with around 12 layers, centered on a glycogenin protein, with three kinds of glucose chains: A, B, and C. There is only one C-chain, attached to the glycogenin. This C-chain is formed by the self-glucosylation of the glycogenin, forming a short primer chain. From the C-chain grows out B-chains, and from B-chains branch out B- and A-chains. The B-chains have on average 2 branch points, while the A-chains are terminal, thus unbranched. On average, each chain has length 12, tightly constrained to be between 11 and 15. All A-chains reach the spherical surface of the glycogen. Glycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 millimoles (18 mg) of potassium per gram of glycogen. Glucose is an osmotic molecule, and can have profound effects on osmotic pressure in high concentrations possibly leading to cell damage or death if stored in the cell without being modified. Glycogen is a non-osmotic molecule, so it can be used as a solution to storing glucose in the cell without disrupting osmotic pressure. == Functions == === Liver === As a meal containing carbohydrates or protein is eaten and digested, blood glucose levels rise, and the pancreas secretes insulin. Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells (hepatocytes). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several enzymes, including glycogen synthase. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this postprandial or ""fed"" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases. After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for energy, glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel. Glucagon, another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen) and gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from other sources). === Muscle === Muscle glycogen appears to function as a reserve of quickly available phosphorylated glucose, in the form of glucose-1-phosphate, for muscle cells. Glycogen contained within skeletal muscle cells are primarily in the form of β particles. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally as well. As muscle cells lack glucose-6-phosphatase, which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs. Skeletal muscle needs ATP (provides energy) for muscle contraction and relaxation, in what is known as the sliding filament theory. Skeletal muscle relies predominantly on glycogenolysis for the first few minutes as it transitions from rest to activity, as well as throughout high-intensity aerobic activity and all anaerobic activity. During anaerobic activity, such as weightlifting and isometric exercise, the phosphagen system (ATP-PCr) and muscle glycogen are the only substrates used as they do not require oxygen nor blood flow. Different bioenergetic systems produce ATP at different speeds, with ATP produced from muscle glycogen being much faster than fatty acid oxidation. The level of exercise intensity determines how much of which substrate (fuel) is used for ATP synthesis also. Muscle glycogen can supply a much higher rate of substrate for ATP synthesis than blood glucose. During maximum intensity exercise, muscle glycogen can supply 40 mmol glucose/kg wet weight/minute, whereas blood glucose can supply 4 - 5 mmol. Due to its high supply rate and quick ATP synthesis, during high-intensity aerobic activity (such as brisk walking, jogging, or running), the higher the exercise intensity, the more the muscle cell produces ATP from muscle glycogen. This reliance on muscle glycogen is not only to provide the muscle with enough ATP during high-intensity exercise, but also to maintain blood glucose homeostasis (that is, to not become hypoglycaemic by the muscles needing to extract far more glucose from the blood than the liver can provide). A deficit of muscle glycogen leads to muscle fatigue known as ""hitting the wall"" or ""the bonk"" (see below under glycogen depletion). == Structure Type == In 1999, Meléndez et al claimed that the structure of glycogen is optimal under a particular metabolic constraint model, where the structure was suggested to be ""fractal"" in nature. However, research by Besford et al used small angle X-ray scattering experiments accompanied by branching theory models to show that glycogen is a randomly hyperbranched polymer nanoparticle. Glycogen is not fractal in nature. This has been subsequently verified by others who have performed Monte Carlo simulations of glycogen particle growth, and shown that the molecular density reaches a maximum near the centre of the nanoparticle structure, not at the periphery (contradicting a fractal structure that would have greater density at the periphery). == History == Glycogen was discovered by Claude Bernard. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a ""ferment"" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called ""la matière glycogène"", or ""sugar-forming substance"". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, M.A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of (C6H10O5)n was established by August Kekulé in 1858. Sanson, M. A. ""Note sur la formation physiologique du sucre dans l’economie animale."" Comptes rendus des seances de l’Academie des Sciences 44 (1857): 1323-5. == Metabolism == === Synthesis === Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic—it requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose to the nonreducing end of the glycogen chain. The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains. === Breakdown === Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate: In vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100. Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to glucose 6 phosphate (G6P) by phosphoglucomutase. A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the α(1→6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates: G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel. G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5 carbon sugars. In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase. This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway. == Clinical relevance == === Disorders of glycogen metabolism === The most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes, in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well. In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia. Various inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism are caused by deficiencies of enzymes or transport proteins necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases. === Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise === Long-distance athletes, such as marathon runners, cross-country skiers, and cyclists, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as ""hitting the wall"" in running and ""bonking"" in cycling. Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways: First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high glycemic index) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting, low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel, sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores. This process is known as carbohydrate loading. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion. When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly; however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established. === Nanomedicine === Glycogen nanoparticles have been investigated as potential drug delivery systems. == See also == Bioenergetic systems Chitin Peptidoglycan == References == == External links == ""Glycogen storage disease"".

2523,"('Gramicidin',)",Medical,"Gramicidin, also called gramicidin D, is a mix of ionophoric antibiotics, gramicidin A, B and C, which make up about 80%, 5%, and 15% of the mix, respectively. Each has 2 isoforms, so the mix has 6 different types of gramicidin molecules. They can be extracted from Brevibacillus brevis soil bacteria. Gramicidins are linear peptides with 15 amino acids. This is in contrast to unrelated gramicidin S, which is a cyclic peptide. == Medical uses == Gramicidins work as antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria like Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, but not well against gram-negative ones like E. coli. Gramicidins are used in medicinal lozenges for sore throat and in topical medicines to treat infected wounds. Gramicidins are often mixed with other antibiotics like tyrocidine and antiseptics. Gramicidins are also used in eye drops for bacterial eye infections. In drops, they are often mixed with other antibiotics like polymyxin B or neomycin. Multiple antibiotics increase efficiency against various strains of bacteria. Such eye-drops are also used to treat eye infections of animals, like horses. == History == In 1939, René Dubos isolated the substance tyrothricin. Later this was shown to be a mix of gramicidin and tyrocidine. These were the first antibiotics to be manufactured commercially. Letter ""D"" in gramicidin D is short for ""Dubos"", and was invented to differentiate the mix from gramicidin S. In 1964, the sequence of gramicidin A was determined by Reinhard Sarges and Bernhad Witkop. In 1971, the dimeric head-to-head structure of gramicidins was proposed by D. W. Urry. In 1993, the structure of the gramicidin head-to-head dimer in micelles and lipid bilayers was determined by solution and solid-state NMR. == Structure and chemistry == Gramicidins A, B and C are nonribosomal peptides, thus they have no genes. They consist of 15 L- and D-amino acids. Their amino acid sequence is: formyl-L-X-Gly-L-Ala-D-Leu-L-Ala-D-Val-L-Val-D-Val-L-Trp-D-Leu-L-Y-D-Leu-L-Trp-D-Leu-L-Trp-ethanolamine Y is L-tryptophan in gramicidin A, L-phenylalanine in B and L-tyrosine in C. X determines isoform. X is L-valine or L-isoleucine – in natural gramicidin mixes of A, B and C, about 5% of the total gramicidins are isoleucine isoforms. Gramicidins form helices. The alternating pattern of D- and L-amino acids is important for the formation of these structures. Helices occur most often as head-to-head dimers. 2 gramicidins can also form antiparallel or parallel double helices, especially in organic solvents. Dimers are long enough to span cellular lipid bilayers and thus function as ion channel -type of ionophores. Gramicidin mixture is a crystalline solid. Its solubility in water is minimal, 6 mg/L, and it may form colloidal suspensions. It is soluble in small alcohols, acetic acid, pyridine, poorly soluble in acetone and dioxane, and practically insoluble in diethylether and hydrocarbons. == Pharmacological effect == Gramicidins are ionophores. Their dimers form ion channel-like pores in cell membranes and cellular organelles of bacteria and animal cells. Inorganic monovalent ions, such as potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+), can travel through these pores freely via diffusion. This destroys vital ion concentration differences, i.e. ion gradients, between membranes thereby killing the cell via various effects. For example, ion leak in mitochondria halts mitochondrial ATP production in cells with mitochondria. Gramicidins can be used as topical antibiotic medications in low doses, even though they are potentially lethal for human cells. Bacteria die at lower gramicidin concentrations than human cells. Gramicidins are not used internally, as their significant intake may cause hemolysis and be toxic to the liver, kidney, meninges and olfactory system among other effects. == References ==",Gramicidin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.0437283536884934e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014186485670506954)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramicidin,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/neomycin-polymyxin-b-and-gramicidin-ophthalmic-route/description/drg-20062368,https://www.drugs.com/mtm/gramicidin-neomycin-and-polymyxin-b-ophthalmic.html ', [])"
2524,"('Lobaplatin',)",Medical,"Lobaplatin is a platinum-based antineoplastic metallodrug approved exclusively in China for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, inoperable metastatic breast cancer and chronic myelogenous leukaemia. The drug is a third-generation analogue of cisplatin, the first globally approved and widely used platinum-based anticancer drug. Pharmacodynamics studies of lobaplatin found greater anticancer activity and lower toxicity than cisplatin and carboplatin, and showed activity against cisplatin-resistant cancer cells. However, global approval of lobaplatin is restricted due to limited evidence of efficacy. == Structure == The structure of lobaplatin (1,2-diammino-methyl-cyclobutane-platinum (II) lactate) consists of a platinum(II) metal center coordinated to a bidentate amine ligand (1,2-bis(aminomethyl)cyclobutane) and a lactic acid leaving group. Lobaplatin is administered intravenously by bolus injection or infusion and composed of an approximate 50/50 mixture of two diastereoisomers, R,R,S- and S,S,S-configurations. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of antineoplastic action for lobaplatin has not been studied in great detail. The results of current mechanistic studies suggest that lobaplatin is a DNA cross linking antineoplastic agent and has a similar platinum-induced cytotoxicity mechanism to other platin metallodrugs (i.e., cisplatin and oxaliplatin). Lobaplatin acts as a pro-drug, it is hydrolyzed in the body forming an active form that is able to interact with DNA. Specifically, when lobaplatin is hydrolyzed the lactate ligand is protonated and dissociates as lactic acid, forming a charged and highly reactive platinum complex that coordinates with the N-donors of DNA bases and inhibits DNA synthesis. In its reactive (active) form, the platinum metal center is able to form DNA-adducts through inter- and intra-strand cross-links with two adjacent guanine-guanine (GG) or two guanine-adenine (GA) bases, inducing apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth. Lobaplatin has been shown to affect the expression of the c-myc gene, which is associated with apoptosis and cell proliferation. == Toxicity and side effects == The toxicity of platinum-based drugs is highly dependent on how easily the leaving group(s) are hydrolyzed, leaving groups that easily dissociate are significantly more toxic than more stable leaving groups that don't easily disassociate. Due to the good stability of the lactic acid leaving group, lobaplatin is more stable and therefore less toxic than first and second generation platinum-based drugs. The toxicity of lobaplatin is common across multiple clinical trials, 60 mg/m2 (body surface area) per 3–4 weeks is the maximum tolerated dose and the dose-limiting toxicity is thrombocytopenia. Common side effects include agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leukopenia, nausea and vomiting. == History == Lobaplatin was first synthesized and developed by ASTA Pharma in Germany in 1990, under the research name D-19466. Discontinued development of lobaplatin by ASTA Pharma lead to further development of the drug by Zentaris AG (AEterna Laboratories). In 2003, Zentaris AG signed a contract with Hainan Tianwang International Pharmaceutical for the manufacturing and marketing of lobaplatin in China. In 2010, lobaplatin was approved for clinical use in china, according to China Food and Drug Administration. == References ==",Lobaplatin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.079655122448457e-06), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00043442347669042647)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobaplatin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Lobaplatin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobaplatin?utm_source=openai')])"

2526,"('Mangafodipir (trisodium)',)",Medical," The purpose of this study was to compare prospectively computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after mangafodipir trisodium infusion for the detection and staging of focal pancreatic lesions. From November 1996 to October 1997, 43 consecutive patients suspected to have a focal pancreatic lesion were included in a phase III study. Triphasic helical CT was performed, as well as MRI at 1.5 T, as follows: axial T1-weighted (T1w) turbo spin echo (TSE), spectral presaturation with inversion recovery (SPIR) T1w TSE, T1w turbo field echo (TFE), and SPIR T2w TSE before and after mangafodipir trisodium (0.01 mmol/ml, 0.5 ml/kg) infusion. Imaging results were correlated with surgery, laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, and biopsy. Objective measurements were performed by measuring signal intensities (SIs) of lesion and parenchyma and calculating contrast indexes (CIs) and contrast-to-noise-ratios (CNRs) to assess the delineation of the tumor. SIs were correlated with four phantom standards with a known SI. Thirty-eight pancreatic adenocarcinomas were present, as well as one cystadenoma, two papillomas, and two cases of focal pancreatitis. SI measurements revealed significant increases in CIs for the lesion compared with the parenchyma in T1w TSE (69.7 vs 152.7; P = 0. 0003) and T1w TFE (107.8 vs 194.2; P = 0.0002). These series also revealed significant increases in CNRs (for T1w TSE: 9.7 vs 13.0; P = 0.0407 and for T1w TFE: 14.5 vs 26.1; P = 0.0001). In the other series, there was no significant increase. CT detected 38 lesions, MRI without mangafodipir trisodium detected 39 lesions, and MRI with mangafodipir trisodium detected 40 lesions, giving detection accuracy rates of 88%, 91%, and 93%, respectively. Staging accuracy rates for vascular ingrowth were 81%, 75%, and 81%, respectively. Overall staging accuracy rates were 57%, 54%, and 54%, respectively, mostly due to undetected small metastases in the peritoneum, omentum, or liver (< 1 cm). This study indicates that a) MRI after mangafodipir trisodium gives a better delineation of the tumor in T1w series, but b) does not significantly improve the detection rate and staging accuracy of focal pancreatic lesions over MRI without this contrast medium. To compare three-dimensional (3D) mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography with conventional T2-weighted MR cholangiography for depiction and definition of intrahepatic biliary anatomy in liver transplant donor candidates. One hundred eight healthy liver transplant donor candidates were examined with two MR cholangiographic methods. All candidates gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional review board. First, breath-hold transverse and coronal half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo and breath-hold oblique coronal heavily T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequences were performed. Second, mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced breath-hold fat-suppressed 3D gradient-echo sequences were performed through the ducts (oblique coronal plane) and through the entire liver (transverse plane). Interpretation of biliary anatomy findings, particularly variants affecting right liver lobe biliary drainage, and degree of interpretation confidence at both 3D mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced MR cholangiography and T2-weighted MR cholangiography were recorded and compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Then, consensus interpretations of both MR image sets together were performed. Intraoperative cholangiography was the reference-standard examination for 51 subjects who underwent right lobe hepatectomy. The McNemar test was used to compare the accuracies of the individual MR techniques with that of the consensus interpretation of both image sets together and to compare each technique with intraoperative cholangiography. Biliary anatomy was visualized with mangafodipir trisodium enhancement in all patients. Mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced image findings agreed with findings seen at combined interpretations significantly more often than did T2-weighted image findings (in 107 [99%] vs 88 [82%] of 108 donor candidates, P < .001). Confidence was significantly higher with the mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced images than with the T2-weighted images (mean confidence score, 4.5 vs 3.4; P < .001). In the 51 candidates who underwent intraoperative cholangiography, mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced imaging correctly depicted the biliary anatomy more often than did T2-weighted imaging (in 47 [92%] vs 43 [84%] donor candidates, P = .14), whereas the two MR imaging techniques combined correctly depicted the anatomy in 48 (94%) candidates. Mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced 3D MR cholangiography depicts intrahepatic biliary anatomy, especially right duct variants, more accurately than does conventional T2-weighted MR cholangiography. Mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP) is one of several recently developed targeted hepatobiliary agents. Contrast-to-noise measurements have shown favorable results for Mn-DPDP-enhanced MR as compared with nonenhanced T1- and T2-weighted images. An improved capability for lesion detection and the ability to characterize tumors of hepatocellular origin have been demonstrated. The prolonged enhancement obtained with Mn-DPDP provides an extended window of time during which effective contrast is maintained as compared with traditional extracellular contrast agents.

2527,"('Melanin',)","Endogenous, Medical","Melanin ( ; from Ancient Greek μέλας (mélas) 'black, dark') is a family of biomolecules organized as oligomers or polymers, which among other functions provide the pigments of many organisms. Melanin pigments are produced in a specialized group of cells known as melanocytes. There are five basic types of melanin: eumelanin, pheomelanin, neuromelanin, allomelanin and pyomelanin. Melanin is produced through a multistage chemical process known as melanogenesis, where the oxidation of the amino acid tyrosine is followed by polymerization. Pheomelanin is a cysteinated form containing polybenzothiazine portions that are largely responsible for the red or yellow tint given to some skin or hair colors. Neuromelanin is found in the brain. Research has been undertaken to investigate its efficacy in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's. Allomelanin and pyomelanin are two types of nitrogen-free melanin. The phenotypic color variation observed in the epidermis and hair of mammals is primarily determined by the levels of eumelanin and pheomelanin in the examined tissue. In an average human individual, eumelanin is more abundant in tissues requiring photoprotection, such as the epidermis and the retinal pigment epithelium. In healthy subjects, epidermal melanin is correlated with UV exposure, while retinal melanin has been found to correlate with age, with levels diminishing 2.5-fold between the first and ninth decades of life, which has been attributed to oxidative degradation mediated by reactive oxygen species generated via lipofuscin-dependent pathways. In the absence of albinism or hyperpigmentation, the human epidermis contains approximately 74% eumelanin and 26% pheomelanin, largely irrespective of skin tone, with eumelanin content ranging between 71.8–78.9%, and pheomelanin varying between 21.1–28.2%. Total melanin content in the epidermis ranges from around 0 μg/mg in albino epidermal tissue to >10 μg/mg in darker tissue. In the human skin, melanogenesis is initiated by exposure to UV radiation, causing the skin to darken. Eumelanin is an effective absorbent of light; the pigment is able to dissipate over 99.9% of absorbed UV radiation. Because of this property, eumelanin is thought to protect skin cells from UVA and UVB radiation damage, reducing the risk of folate depletion and dermal degradation. Exposure to UV radiation is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma, a cancer of melanocytes (melanin cells). Studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with more concentrated melanin, i.e. darker skin tone. == Melanin types == === Eumelanin === Eumelanin (lit. 'true melanin') has two forms linked to 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA). DHI-derived eumelanin is dark brown or black and insoluble, and DHICA -derived eumelanin which is lighter and soluble in alkali. Both eumelanins arise from the oxidation of tyrosine in specialized organelles called melanosomes. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosinase. The initial product, dopaquinone can transform into either 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) or 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA). DHI and DHICA are oxidized and then polymerize to form the two eumelanins. In natural conditions, DHI and DHICA often co-polymerize, resulting in a range of eumelanin polymers. These polymers contribute to the variety of melanin components in human skin and hair, ranging from light yellow/red pheomelanin to light brown DHICA-enriched eumelanin and dark brown or black DHI-enriched eumelanin. These final polymers differ in solubility and color. Analysis of highly pigmented (Fitzpatrick type V and VI) skin finds that DHI-eumelanin comprises the largest portion, approximately 60–70%, followed by DHICA-eumelanin at 25–35%, and pheomelanin only 2–8%. Notably, while an enrichment of DHI-eumelanin occurs in during sun tanning, it is accompanied by a decrease in DHICA-eumelanin and pheomelanin. A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes grey hair. A small amount of eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes blond hair. Eumelanin is present in the skin and hair, etc. === Pheomelanin === Pheomelanins (or phaeomelanins, from Greek φαιός phaios, ""grey"") impart a range of yellowish to reddish colors. Pheomelanins are particularly concentrated in the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina. When a small amount of eumelanin in hair (which would otherwise cause blond hair) is mixed with pheomelanin, the result is orange hair, which is typically called ""red"" or ""ginger"" hair. Pheomelanin is also present in the skin, and redheads consequently often have a more pinkish hue to their skin as well. Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet light increases pheomelanin content, as it does for eumelanin; but rather than absorbing light, pheomelanin within the hair and skin reflect yellow to red light, which may increase damage from UV radiation exposure. Pheomelanin production is highly dependent on cysteine availability, which is transported into the melanosome, reacting with dopaquinone to form cys-dopa. Cys-dopa then undergoes several transformations before forming pheomelanin. In chemical terms, pheomelanins differ from eumelanins in that the oligomer structure incorporates benzothiazine and benzothiazole units that are produced, instead of DHI and DHICA, when the amino acid L-cysteine is present. Pheomelanins, unlike euemanins, are rare in lower organisms with claims they are an ""evolutionary innovation in the tetrapod lineage"" but recent research finds them also in some fish. === Neuromelanin === Neuromelanin (NM) is an insoluble polymer pigment produced in specific populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain. Humans have the largest amount of NM, which is present in lesser amounts in other primates, and totally absent in many other species. The biological function remains unknown, although human NM has been shown to efficiently bind transition metals such as iron, as well as other potentially toxic molecules. Therefore, it may play crucial roles in apoptosis and the related Parkinson's disease. === Other forms of melanins === Up until the 1960s, melanin was classified into eumelanin and pheomelanin. However, in 1955, a melanin associated with nerve cells was discovered, neuromelanin. In 1972 a water-soluble form, pyomelanin, was discovered. In 1976, allomelanin, the fifth form of the melanins, was found in nature. ==== Peptidomelanin ==== Peptidomelanin is another water-soluble form of melanin. It was found to be secreted into the surrounding medium by germinating Aspergillus niger (strain: melanoliber) spores. Peptidomelanin is formed as a copolymer between L-DOPA eumelanin and short peptides that form a 'corona', that are responsible for the substance's solubility. The peptide chains are linked to the L-DOPA core polymer via peptide bonds. This lead to a proposed biosynthetic process involving the hydroxylation of tyrosinylated peptides formed via proteases during sporogenesis, which are then incorporated autoxidatively into a growing L-DOPA core polymer. ==== Selenomelanin ==== It is possible to enrich melanin with selenium instead of sulphur. This selenium analogue of pheomelanin has been successfully synthesized through chemical and biosynthetic routes using selenocystine as a feedstock. Due to selenium's higher atomic number, the obtained selenomelanin can be expected to provide better protection against ionising radiation as compared to the other known forms of melanin. This protection has been demonstrated with radiation experiments on human cells and bacteria, opening up the possibility of applications in space travel. ==== Trichochromes ==== Trichochromes (formerly called trichosiderins) are pigments produced from the same metabolic pathway as the eumelanins and pheomelanins, but unlike those molecules they have low molecular weight. They occur in some red human hair. == Humans == In humans, melanin is the primary determinant of skin color. It is also found in hair, the pigmented tissue underlying the iris of the eye, and the stria vascularis of the inner ear. In the brain, tissues with melanin include the medulla and pigment-bearing neurons within areas of the brainstem, such as the locus coeruleus. It also occurs in the zona reticularis of the adrenal gland. The melanin in the skin is produced by melanocytes, which are found in the basal layer of the epidermis. Although, in general, human beings possess a similar concentration of melanocytes in their skin, the melanocytes in some individuals and ethnic groups produce variable amounts of melanin. The ratio of eumelanin (74%) and pheomelanin (26%) in the epidermis is constant regardless of the degree of pigmentation. Some humans have very little or no melanin synthesis in their bodies, a condition known as albinism. Because melanin is an aggregate of smaller component molecules, there are many different types of melanin with different proportions and bonding patterns of these component molecules. Both pheomelanin and eumelanin are found in human skin and hair, but eumelanin is the most abundant melanin in humans, as well as the form most likely to be deficient in albinism. == Other organisms == Melanins have very diverse roles and functions in various organisms. A form of melanin makes up the ink used by many cephalopods (see cephalopod ink) as a defense mechanism against predators. Melanins also protect microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, against stresses that involve cell damage such as UV radiation from the sun and reactive oxygen species. Melanin also protects against damage from high temperatures, chemical stresses (such as heavy metals and oxidizing agents), and biochemical threats (such as host defenses against invading microbes). Therefore, in many pathogenic microbes (for example, in Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus) melanins appear to play important roles in virulence and pathogenicity by protecting the microbe against immune responses of its host. In invertebrates, a major aspect of the innate immune defense system against invading pathogens involves melanin. Within minutes after infection, the microbe is encapsulated within melanin (melanization), and the generation of free radical byproducts during the formation of this capsule is thought to aid in killing them. Some types of fungi, called radiotrophic fungi, appear to be able to use melanin as a photosynthetic pigment that enables them to capture gamma rays and harness this energy for growth. In fish, melanin occurs not only in the skin but also in internal organs such as eyes. Most fish species use eumelanin, but Stegastes apicalis and Cyprinus carpio use pheomelanin instead. The darker feathers of birds owe their color to melanin and are less readily degraded by bacteria than unpigmented ones or those containing carotenoid pigments. Feathers that contain melanin are also 39% more resistant to abrasion than those that do not because melanin granules help fill the space between the keratin strands that form feathers. Pheomelanin synthesis in birds implies the consumption of cysteine, a semi‐essential amino acid that is necessary for the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) but that may be toxic if in excess in the diet. Indeed, many carnivorous birds, which have a high protein content in their diet, exhibit pheomelanin‐based coloration. Melanin is also important in mammalian pigmentation. The coat pattern of mammals is determined by the agouti gene which regulates the distribution of melanin. The mechanisms of the gene have been extensively studied in mice to provide an insight into the diversity of mammalian coat patterns. Melanin in arthropods has been observed to be deposited in layers thus producing a Bragg reflector of alternating refractive index. When the scale of this pattern matches the wavelength of visible light, structural coloration arises: giving a number of species an iridescent color. Arachnids are one of the few groups in which melanin has not been easily detected, though researchers found data suggesting spiders do in fact produce melanin. Some moth species, including the wood tiger moth, convert resources to melanin to enhance their thermoregulation. As the wood tiger moth has populations over a large range of latitudes, it has been observed that more northern populations showed higher rates of melanization. In both yellow and white male phenotypes of the wood tiger moth, individuals with more melanin had a heightened ability to trap heat but an increased predation rate due to a weaker and less effective aposematic signal. Melanin may protect Drosophila flies and mice against DNA damage from non-UV radiation. === Plants === Melanin produced by plants are sometimes referred to as 'catechol melanins' as they can yield catechol on alkali fusion. It is commonly seen in the enzymatic browning of fruits such as bananas. Chestnut shell melanin can be used as an antioxidant and coloring agent. Biosynthesis involves the oxidation of indole-5,6-quinone by the tyrosinase type polyphenol oxidase from tyrosine and catecholamines leading to the formation of catechol melanin. Despite this many plants contain compounds which inhibit the production of melanins. == Interpretation as a single monomer == It is now understood that melanins do not have a single structure or stoichiometry. Nonetheless, chemical databases such as PubChem include structural and empirical formulae; typically 3,8-Dimethyl-2,7-dihydrobenzo[1,2,3-cd:4,5,6-c′d′]diindole-4,5,9,10-tetrone. This can be thought of as a single monomer that accounts for the measured elemental composition and some properties of melanin, but is unlikely to be found in nature. Solano claims that this misleading trend stems from a report of an empirical formula in 1948, but provides no other historical detail. == Biosynthetic pathways == The first step of the biosynthetic pathway for both eumelanins and pheomelanins is catalysed by tyrosinase. Tyrosine → DOPA → dopaquinone Dopaquinone can combine with cysteine by two pathways to benzothiazines and pheomelanins dopaquinone + cysteine → 5-S-cysteinyldopa → benzothiazine intermediate → pheomelanin dopaquinone + cysteine → 2-S-cysteinyldopa → benzothiazine intermediate → pheomelanin Also, dopaquinone can be converted to leucodopachrome and follow two more pathways to the eumelanins dopaquinone → leucodopachrome → dopachrome → 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid → quinone → eumelanin dopaquinone → leucodopachrome → dopachrome → 5,6-dihydroxyindole → quinone → eumelanin Detailed metabolic pathways can be found in the KEGG database (see External links). == Microscopic appearance == Melanin is brown, non-refractile, and finely granular with individual granules having a diameter of less than 800 nanometers. This differentiates melanin from common blood breakdown pigments, which are larger, chunky, and refractile, and range in color from green to yellow or red-brown. In heavily pigmented lesions, dense aggregates of melanin can obscure histologic detail. A dilute solution of potassium permanganate is an effective melanin bleach. == Genetic disorders and disease states == There are approximately nine types of oculocutaneous albinism, which is mostly an autosomal recessive disorder. Certain ethnicities have higher incidences of different forms. For example, the most common type, called oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2), is especially frequent among people of black African descent and white Europeans. People with OCA2 usually have fair skin, but are often not as pale as OCA1. They (OCA2 or OCA1? see comments in History) have pale blonde to golden, strawberry blonde, or even brown hair, and most commonly blue eyes. 98.7–100% of modern Europeans are carriers of the derived allele SLC24A5, a known cause of nonsyndromic oculocutaneous albinism. It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a congenital reduction or absence of melanin pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. The estimated frequency of OCA2 among African-Americans is 1 in 10,000, which contrasts with a frequency of 1 in 36,000 in white Americans. In some African nations, the frequency of the disorder is even higher, ranging from 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000. Another form of Albinism, the ""yellow oculocutaneous albinism"", appears to be more prevalent among the Amish, who are of primarily Swiss and German ancestry. People with this IB variant of the disorder commonly have white hair and skin at birth, but rapidly develop normal skin pigmentation in infancy. Ocular albinism affects not only eye pigmentation but visual acuity, as well. People with albinism typically test poorly, within the 20/60 to 20/400 range. In addition, two forms of albinism, with approximately 1 in 2,700 most prevalent among people of Puerto Rican origin, are associated with mortality beyond melanoma-related deaths. The connection between albinism and deafness is well known, though poorly understood. In his 1859 treatise On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin observed that ""cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf"". In humans, hypopigmentation and deafness occur together in the rare Waardenburg's syndrome, predominantly observed among the Hopi in North America. The incidence of albinism in Hopi Indians has been estimated as approximately 1 in 200 individuals. Similar patterns of albinism and deafness have been found in other mammals, including dogs and rodents. However, a lack of melanin per se does not appear to be directly responsible for deafness associated with hypopigmentation, as most individuals lacking the enzymes required to synthesize melanin have normal auditory function. Instead, the absence of melanocytes in the stria vascularis of the inner ear results in cochlear impairment, though the reasons for this are not fully understood. In Parkinson's disease, a disorder that affects neuromotor functioning, there is decreased neuromelanin in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus as a consequence of specific dropping out of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pigmented neurons. This results in diminished dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis. While no correlation between race and the level of neuromelanin in the substantia nigra has been reported, the significantly lower incidence of Parkinson's in blacks than in whites has ""prompt[ed] some to suggest that cutaneous melanin might somehow serve to protect the neuromelanin in substantia nigra from external toxins."" In addition to melanin deficiency, the molecular weight of the melanin polymer may be decreased by various factors such as oxidative stress, exposure to light, perturbation in its association with melanosomal matrix proteins, changes in pH, or in local concentrations of metal ions. A decreased molecular weight or a decrease in the degree of polymerization of ocular melanin has been proposed to turn the normally anti-oxidant polymer into a pro-oxidant. In its pro-oxidant state, melanin has been suggested to be involved in the causation and progression of macular degeneration and melanoma. Rasagiline, an important monotherapy drug in Parkinson's disease, has melanin binding properties, and melanoma tumor reducing properties. Higher eumelanin levels also can be a disadvantage, however, beyond a higher disposition toward vitamin D deficiency. Dark skin is a complicating factor in the laser removal of port-wine stains. Effective in treating white skin, in general, lasers are less successful in removing port-wine stains in people of Asian or African descent. Higher concentrations of melanin in darker-skinned individuals simply diffuse and absorb the laser radiation, inhibiting light absorption by the targeted tissue. In a similar manner, melanin can complicate laser treatment of other dermatological conditions in people with darker skin. Freckles and moles are formed where there is a localized concentration of melanin in the skin. They are highly associated with pale skin. Nicotine has an affinity for melanin-containing tissues because of its precursor function in melanin synthesis or its irreversible binding of melanin. This has been suggested to underlie the increased nicotine dependence and lower smoking cessation rates in darker pigmented individuals. == Human adaptations == === Physiology === Melanocytes insert granules of melanin into specialized cellular vesicles called melanosomes. These are then transferred into the keratinocyte cells of the human epidermis. The melanosomes in each recipient cell accumulate atop the cell nucleus, where they protect the nuclear DNA from mutations caused by the ionizing radiation of the sun's ultraviolet rays. In general, people whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the equator have larger quantities of eumelanin in their skins. This makes their skins brown or black and protects them against high levels of exposure to the sun, which more frequently result in melanomas in lighter-skinned people. Not all the effects of pigmentation are advantageous. Pigmentation increases the heat load in hot climates, and dark-skinned people absorb 30% more heat from sunlight than do very light-skinned people, although this factor may be offset by more profuse sweating. In cold climates dark skin entails more heat loss by radiation. Pigmentation also hinders synthesis of vitamin D. Since pigmentation appears to be not entirely advantageous to life in the tropics, other hypotheses about its biological significance have been advanced; for example a secondary phenomenon induced by adaptation to parasites and tropical diseases. === Evolutionary origins === Early humans evolved dark skin color, as an adaptation to a loss of body hair that increased the effects of UV radiation. Before the development of hairlessness, early humans might have had light skin underneath their fur, similar to that found in other primates. Anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, and then populated the rest of the world through migration between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago, in some areas interbreeding with certain archaic human species (Neanderthals, Denisovans, and possibly others). The first modern humans had darker skin as the indigenous people of Africa today. Following migration and settlement in Asia and Europe, the selective pressure dark UV-radiation protecting skin decreased where radiation from the sun was less intense. This resulted in the current range of human skin color. Of the two common gene variants known to be associated with pale human skin, Mc1r does not appear to have undergone positive selection, while SLC24A5 has undergone positive selection. === Effects === As with peoples having migrated northward, those with light skin migrating toward the equator acclimatize to the much stronger solar radiation. Nature selects for less melanin when ultraviolet radiation is weak. Most people's skin darkens when exposed to UV light, giving them more protection when it is needed. This is the physiological purpose of sun tanning. Dark-skinned people, who produce more skin-protecting eumelanin, have a greater protection against sunburn and the development of melanoma, a potentially deadly form of skin cancer, as well as other health problems related to exposure to strong solar radiation, including the photodegradation of certain vitamins such as riboflavins, carotenoids, tocopherol, and folate. Melanin in the eyes, in the iris and choroid, helps protect from ultraviolet and high-frequency visible light; people with blue, green, and grey eyes are more at risk of sun-related eye problems. Furthermore, the ocular lens yellows with age, providing added protection. However, the lens also becomes more rigid with age, losing most of its accommodation—the ability to change shape to focus from far to near—a detriment due probably to protein crosslinking caused by UV exposure. Recent research suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than photoprotection. Melanin is able to effectively chelate metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, often much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting the rest of the cell. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the loss of neuromelanin, observed in Parkinson's disease, is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain. == Physical properties and technological applications == Evidence exists for a highly cross-linked heteropolymer bound covalently to matrix scaffolding melanoproteins. It has been proposed that the ability of melanin to act as an antioxidant is directly proportional to its degree of polymerization or molecular weight. Suboptimal conditions for the effective polymerization of melanin monomers may lead to formation of pro-oxidant melanin with lower-molecular-weight, implicated in the causation and progression of macular degeneration and melanoma. Signaling pathways that upregulate melanization in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) also may be implicated in the downregulation of rod outer segment phagocytosis by the RPE. This phenomenon has been attributed in part to foveal sparing in macular degeneration. === Role in melanoma metastasis === Heavily pigmented melanoma cells have a Young's modulus of about 4.93 kPa, compared to non-pigmented cells, with a value of 0.98 kPa. The elasticity of melanoma cells is crucial to metastasis and growth; non-pigmented tumors were larger than pigmented tumors, and spread far more easily. Pigmented and non-pigmented cells are both present in melanoma tumors, so that they can both be drug-resistant and metastatic. == See also == == References == == External links == ""Absorption spectrum of melanin"".

2528,"('Methylcobalamin',)",Medical,"Methylcobalamin (mecobalamin, MeCbl, or MeB12) is a cobalamin, a form of vitamin B12. It differs from cyanocobalamin in that the cyano group at the cobalt is replaced with a methyl group. Methylcobalamin features an octahedral cobalt(III) centre and can be obtained as bright red crystals. From the perspective of coordination chemistry, methylcobalamin is notable as a rare example of a compound that contains metal–alkyl bonds. Nickel–methyl intermediates have been proposed for the final step of methanogenesis. == Production == Methylcobalamin can be produced in the laboratory by reducing cyanocobalamin with sodium borohydride in alkaline solution, followed by the addition of methyl iodide. == Functions == This vitamer, along with adenosylcobalamin, is one of two active coenzymes used by vitamin B12-dependent enzymes and is the specific vitamin B12 form used by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR), also known as methionine synthase. Methylcobalamin participates in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which is a pathway by which some organisms utilize carbon dioxide as their source of organic compounds. In this pathway, methylcobalamin provides the methyl group that couples to carbon monoxide (derived from CO2) to afford acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a derivative of acetic acid that is converted to more complex molecules as required by the organism. Methylcobalamin is produced by some bacteria. It plays an important role in the environment, where it is responsible for the biomethylation of certain heavy metals. For example, the highly toxic methylmercury is produced by the action of methylcobalamin. In this role, methylcobalamin serves as a source of ""CH3+"". === Role in human health === Methylcobalamin is equivalent physiologically to vitamin B12, and can be used to prevent or treat pathology arising from a lack of vitamin B12 intake (vitamin B12 deficiency). Methylcobalamin is considered to be equivalent in efficacy to the other vitamin B12 vitamers as a dietary supplement, with no clear evidence of differing efficacy between them. Methylcobalamin that is ingested is not used directly as a cofactor, but is first converted by MMACHC into cob(II)alamin. Cob(II)alamin is then later converted into the other two forms, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin for use as cofactors. That is, methylcobalamin is first dealkylated and then regenerated. === Research directions === Ultra-high-dose intravenous methylcobalamin is researched as treatment of peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and as a preliminary treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. == See also == Adenosylcobalamin Cyanocobalamin Hydroxocobalamin Vitamin B12 Cobalamin biosynthesis == References ==",Methylcobalamin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.25422194600105286), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.8624639324116288e-06), (' FOOD', -0.011049000546336174)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.41782721877098083), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -2.9444261599564925e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.12697939574718475), (',', -0.16028767824172974), ('ĠEND', -0.008240390568971634), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007456144667230546)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -9.615255839889869e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0001584850688232109), (' FOOD', -0.0019297054968774319)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD;  ', [])"
2529,"('Milbemycin oxime',)",Medical,"Milbemycin oxime, sold under the brand name Interceptor among others, is a veterinary medication from the group of milbemycins, used as a broad spectrum antiparasitic. It is active against worms (anthelmintic) and mites (miticide). == Mechanism of action == Milbemycins are products of fermentation by Streptomyces species. They have a similar mechanism of action, but a longer half-life than the avermectins. Milbemycin oxime is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus aureolacrimosus. It opens glutamate sensitive chloride channels in neurons and myocytes of invertebrates, leading to hyperpolarisation of these cells and blocking of signal transfer. == Uses == Milbemycin oxime is active against a broad spectrum of nematodes. Its miticide spectrum includes Sarcoptes and Demodex. The drug is FDA-approved for prevention of heartworm in dogs and cats, although it is less potent against heartworms than ivermectin. The substance is often combined with other parasiticides to achieve a broader spectrum of action. Such products include: Milbemax and Interceptor Plus (with praziquantel) Sentinel Flavor Tabs (with lufenuron) Trifexis (with spinosad) Nexgard Spectra (with afoxolaner) The drug has been used in marine reef aquaria to control parasitic Tegastidae copepod infestations on captive hard coral colonies.

2530,"('Nitroprusside (disodium dihydrate)', 'Sodium nitroprusside dihydrate', 'Sodium nitroferricyanide(iii) dihydrate')",Medical,"Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), sold under the brand name Nitropress among others, is a medication used to lower blood pressure. This may be done if the blood pressure is very high and resulting in symptoms, in certain types of heart failure, and during surgery to decrease bleeding. It is used by continuous injection into a vein. Onset is nearly immediate and effects last for up to ten minutes. It is available as a generic medication. == Side effects and mechanism == Common side effects include low blood pressure and cyanide toxicity. Other serious side effects include methemoglobinemia. It is not generally recommended during pregnancy due to concerns of side effects. High doses are not recommended for more than ten minutes. It works by increasing nitric oxide levels in the blood, which increases cGMP levels in cells, and causes dilation of blood vessels. == History, society and culture == Sodium nitroprusside was discovered as early as 1850 and found to be useful in medicine in 1928. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Sodium nitroprusside is light sensitive, so it needs to be shielded from light to prevent degradation. == Medical use == Sodium nitroprusside is intravenously infused in cases of acute hypertensive crises. Its effects are usually seen within a few minutes. Nitric oxide reduces both total peripheral resistance and venous return, thus decreasing both preload and afterload. So, it can be used in severe congestive heart failure where this combination of effects can act to increase cardiac output. In situations where cardiac output is normal, the effect is to reduce blood pressure. It is sometimes also used to induce hypotension (to reduce bleeding) for surgical procedures (for which it is also FDA, TGA, and MHRA labelled). The medication is extremely beneficial for use in medical patients because the effects of the medication will directly stop the second that it stops being infused. This is due to the metabolism of the drug, and the rapid inactivation to thiocyanate once conversion of the drug stops. This compound has also been used as a treatment for aortic valve stenosis, oesophageal varices, myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn, shock, and ergot toxicity. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects by incidence and severity Common Unknown frequency Serious Ileus Reduced platelet aggregation Haemorrhage Increased intracranial pressure Metabolic acidosis Methaemoglobinaemia Cyanide poisoning Thiocyanate toxicity === Contraindications === Sodium nitroprusside should not be used for compensatory hypertension (e.g. due to an arteriovenous stent or coarctation of the aorta). It should not be used in patients with inadequate cerebral circulation or in patients who are near death. It should not be used in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, anaemia, severe renal disease, or hypovolaemia. Patients with conditions associated with a higher cyanide/thiocyanate ratio (e.g. congenital (Leber's) optic atrophy, tobacco amblyopia) should only be treated with sodium nitroprusside with great caution. Its use in patients with acute congestive heart failure associated with reduced peripheral resistance is also not recommended. Its use in hepatically impaired individuals is also not recommended, as is its use in cases of pre-existing hypothyroidism. Its use in pregnant women is advised against, although the available evidence suggests it may be safe, provided maternal pH and cyanide levels are closely monitored. Some evidence suggests sodium nitroprusside use in critically ill children may be safe, even without monitoring of cyanide level. === Interactions === The only known drug interactions are pharmacodynamic in nature, that is it is possible for other antihypertensive drugs to reduce the threshold for dangerous hypotensive effects to be seen. === Overdose === Due to its cyanogenic nature, overdose may be particularly dangerous. Treatment of sodium nitroprusside overdose includes the following: Discontinuing sodium nitroprusside administration Buffering the cyanide by using sodium nitrite to convert haemoglobin to methaemoglobin as much as the patient can safely tolerate Infusing sodium thiosulfate to convert the cyanide to thiocyanate. Haemodialysis is ineffective for removing cyanide from the body but it can be used to remove most of the thiocyanate produced from the above procedure. === Toxicology === The cyanide can be detoxified by reaction with a sulfur-donor such as thiosulfate, catalysed by the enzyme rhodanese. In the absence of sufficient thiosulfate, cyanide ions can quickly reach toxic levels. Hydroxocobalamin can be administered to reduce the risk of thiocyanate toxicity induced by nitroprusside. == Mechanism of action == As a result of its breakdown to nitric oxide (NO), sodium nitroprusside has potent vasodilating effects on arterioles and venules (arterial more than venous), whereas other nitrates exhibit more selectivity for veins (e.g. nitroglycerin). Sodium nitroprusside breaks down in circulation to release nitric oxide (NO). It does this by binding to oxyhaemoglobin to release cyanide, methaemoglobin and nitric oxide. NO activates guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscle and increases intracellular production of cGMP. cGMP activates protein kinase G which activates phosphatases which inactivate myosin light chains. Myosin light chains are involved in smooth muscle contraction. The result is vascular smooth muscle relaxation, which allow vessels to dilate. This mechanism is similar to that of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors such as sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis), which elevate cGMP concentration by inhibiting its degradation by PDE5. A role for NO in various common psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder has been proposed and supported by several clinical findings. These findings may also implicate the potential of drugs that alter NO signalling such as SNP in their treatment. Such a role is also supported by the findings of the recent SNP clinical trial. == Structure and properties == Nitroprusside is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Na2[Fe(CN)5NO], usually encountered as the dihydrate, Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]·2H2O. This red-colored sodium salt dissolves in water or ethanol to give solutions containing the free complex dianion [Fe(CN)5NO]2−. Nitroprusside is a complex anion that features an octahedral iron(II) centre surrounded by five tightly bound cyanide ligands and one linear nitric oxide ligand (Fe-N-O angle = 176.2 °). The anion possesses idealized C4vsymmetry. Due to the linear Fe-N-O angle, the relatively short N-O distance of 113 pm and the relatively high stretching frequency of 1947 cm−1, the complex is formulated as containing an NO+ ligand. Consequently, iron is assigned an oxidation state of 2+. The iron center has a diamagnetic low-spin d6 electron configuration, although a paramagnetic long-lived metastable state has been observed by EPR spectroscopy. The chemical reactions of sodium nitroprusside are mainly associated with the NO ligand. For example, addition of S2− ion to [Fe(CN)5(NO)]2− produces the violet colour [Fe(CN)5(NOS)]4− ion, which is the basis for a sensitive test for S2− ions. An analogous reaction also exists with OH− ions, giving [Fe(CN)5(NO2)]4−. Roussin's red salt (K2[Fe2S2(NO)4]) and Roussin's black salt (NaFe4S3(NO)7) are related iron nitrosyl complexes. The former was first prepared by treating nitroprusside with sulfur. == Preparation == Sodium nitroprusside can be synthesized by digesting a solution of potassium ferrocyanide in water with nitric acid, followed by neutralization with sodium carbonate: K4[Fe(CN)6] + 6 HNO3 → H2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] + CO2 + NH4NO3 + 4 KNO3 H2[Fe(CN)5NO] + Na2CO3 → Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] + CO2 + H2O Alternatively, the nitrosyl ligand can be introduced using nitrite: [Fe(CN)6]4− + H2O + NO−2 → [Fe(CN)5(NO)]2− + CN− + 2 HO− == Other uses == Sodium nitroprusside is often used as a reference compound for the calibration of Mössbauer spectrometers. Sodium nitroprusside crystals are also of interest for optical storage. For this application, sodium nitroprusside can be reversibly promoted to a metastable excited state by blue-green light, and de-excited by heat or red light. In physiology research, sodium nitroprusside is frequently used to test endothelium-independent vasodilation. Iontophoresis, for example, allows local administration of the drug, preventing the systemic effects listed above but still inducing local microvascular vasodilation. Sodium nitroprusside is also used in microbiology, where it has been linked with the dispersal of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by acting as a nitric oxide donor. === Analytical reagent === Sodium nitroprusside is also used as an analytical reagent under the name sodium nitroferricyanide for the detection of methyl ketones, amines, and thiols. It is also used as a catalyst in the quantitative determination of ammonia in water samples via the phenate method. ==== Ketones ==== The nitroprusside reaction is used for the identification of ketones in urine testing. Sodium nitroprusside was found to give a reaction with acetone or creatine under basic conditions in 1882. Rothera refined this method by the use of ammonia in place of sodium or potassium hydroxide. The reaction was now specific for methyl ketones. Addition of ammonium salts (e.g. ammonium sulfate) improved the sensitivity of the test, too. In this test, known as Rothera's test, methyl ketones (CH3C(=O)-) under alkaline conditions give bright red coloration (see also iodoform test). Rothera's test was initially applied to detecting ketonuria (a symptom of diabetes) in urine samples. This reaction is now exploited in the form of urine test strips (e.g. ""Ketostix""). ==== Thiols and cysteine ==== The nitroprusside reaction is a chemical test used to detect the presence of thiol groups of cysteine in proteins. Proteins with the free thiol group give a red colour when added to a solution of sodium nitroprusside in aqueous ammonia. Some proteins test positive when denatured, indicating that thiol groups are liberated. Sodium nitroprusside is used in a separate urinalysis test known as the cyanide nitroprusside test or Brand's test. In this test, sodium cyanide is added first to urine and let stand for about 10 minutes. In this time, disulfide bonds will be broken by the released cyanide. The destruction of disulfide bonds liberates cysteine from cystine as well as homocysteine from homocystine. Next, sodium nitroprusside is added to the solution and it reacts with the newly freed sulfhydryl groups. The test will turn a red/purple colour if the test is positive, indicating significant amounts of amino acids were in the urine (aminoaciduria). Cysteine, cystine, homocysteine, and homocystine all react when present in the urine when this test is performed. This test can indicate inborn errors of amino acid transporters such as cystinuria, which results from pathology in the transport of dibasic amino acids. ==== Amines ==== Sodium nitroprusside is also used to detect amines, including those in illicit drugs. This compound is thus used as a stain to indicate amines in thin layer chromatography. Sodium nitroprusside is similarly used as a presumptive test for the presence of alkaloids (amine-containing natural products) common in illicit substances. The test, called Simon's test, is performed by adding 1 volume of a solution of sodium nitroprusside and acetaldehyde in deionized water to a suspected drug, followed by the addition of 2 volumes of an aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The test turns blue for some secondary amines. The most common secondary amines encountered in forensic chemistry include 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, the main component in ecstasy) and phenethylamines such as methamphetamine. Sodium nitroprusside is also useful in the identification the mercaptans (thiol groups) in the nitroprusside reaction. == History == Sodium nitroprusside is primarily used as a vasodilator. It was first used in human medicine in 1928. By 1955, data on its safety during short-term use in people with severe hypertension had become available. Despite this, due to difficulties in its chemical preparation, it was not finally approved by the US FDA until 1974 for the treatment of severe hypertension. By 1993, its popularity had grown such that total sales in the US had totalled US$2 million. == References ==",Sodium nitroprusside dihydrate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.31328409910202026), (' INDUSTR', -4.704065213445574e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5510462364763953e-05), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12694023549556732)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00861468818038702), (' INDUSTR', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL,INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitroprusside,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/sodium-nitroprusside-intravenous-route/description/drg-20406115,https://www.haz-map.com/Agents/17619 ', [])"
2531,"('Saroglitazar magnesium',)",Medical," Saroglitazar magnesium, a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist, is under evaluation for treating various liver conditions. While the pharmacokinetics (PK) of saroglitazar have been extensively studied in diverse preclinical models and healthy subjects, a comprehensive assessment of its PK behavior under conditions of hepatic impairment is lacking. In this Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group study, the PK of a single dose of 4-mg saroglitazar magnesium was investigated in subjects having varying degrees of hepatic impairment with and without portal hypertension compared with appropriately matched individuals having normal hepatic function. Treatment-emergent adverse events for safety were also evaluated. Thirty-two subjects were enrolled in the hepatic-impaired groups and 23 subjects in the normal hepatic function group. Mild and moderate hepatic impairment did not significantly affect the PK of saroglitazar, compared with normal hepatic function. Although severe hepatic impairment did not alter maximum observed plasma concentration and half-life; saroglitazar exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity) increased 3-fold, while the clearance was 61% lower compared to the subjects with normal hepatic function. This may require close monitoring or dose adjustments in individuals with severe hepatic impairment. A single oral dose of saroglitazar magnesium 4 mg was found to be safe and well tolerated in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function. 1. Saroglitazar, a novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, regulates lipid and glucose metabolism. The objective of this report is to provide a preclinical evaluation (in vitro/in vivo) of ADME properties of saroglitazar. In vitro studies included determination of permeability, metabolic stability, plasma protein binding, CYP reaction phenotyping and CYP inhibitory liability. In vivo studies included oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic assessment in mouse, rat and dog. The excretion of saroglitazar was determined in rats. Exploratory metabolism of saroglitazar was evaluated using in vitro and in vivo samples. 2. Saroglitazar was metabolically more stable in human liver microsomes as compared to rat and dog liver microsomes, highly protein bound (98-99.6%) with high Caco2 permeability (104 nm/s) with <2 efflux ratio. In vitro metabolism in rat, dog and human liver microsomes revealed three putative metabolites corresponding to di-hydroxylation, mono-oxygenation and dehydrogenation moieties. 3. Oral bioavailability was 100%, 72% and 47% in mouse, rat and dog, respectively. The intravenous clearance and volume of distribution of saroglitazar were 3.6, 8.5 and 6.9 mL/min/kg and 1.3, 4.8 and 1.8 L/kg for mouse, rat and dog, respectively. The elimination half-life of saroglitazar ranged between 6 and 15 h. Saroglitazar appeared to be eliminated via hepatobiliary route with negligible renal excretion. Saroglitazar, a PPAR αҮ agonist, is currently undergoing global development for the treatment of NASH and other indications.

2532,"('Silver sulfadiazine', 'Agsd')",Medical,"Silver sulfadiazine, sold under the brand Silvadene among others, is a topical antibiotic used in partial thickness and full thickness burns to prevent infection. Tentative evidence has found other antibiotics to be more effective, and therefore it is no longer generally recommended for second-degree (partial-thickness) burns, but is still widely used to protect third-degree (full-thickness) burns. Common side effects include itching and pain at the site of use. Other side effects include low white blood cell levels, allergic reactions, bluish grey discoloration of the skin, red blood cell breakdown, or liver inflammation. Caution should be used in those allergic to other sulfonamides. It should not be used in pregnant women who are close to delivery. It is not recommended for use in children less than two months of age. Silver sulfadiazine was discovered in the 1960s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 279th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Tentative evidence has found other antibiotics to be more effective in the healing of superficial and partial thickness burn injuries; therefore, it is no longer generally recommended. A Cochrane review from 2013 found that most of the trials that met inclusion criteria for the review had methodological shortcomings and thus are of little use in assessing the efficacy of silver sulfadiazine in the healing of burn injuries. Another Cochrane systematic review from 2010 concluded, ""There is insufficient evidence to establish whether silver-containing dressings or topical agents promote wound healing or prevent wound infection"". Other reviews of the evidence have also concluded, ""[the] quality of the trials was limited"". Cochrane has raised concerns about delays in time to wound healing when SSD is used. In addition to concerns regarding delayed wound healing, silver sulfadiazine is associated pseudoeschar (a combination of the SSD and congealed exudate) development that makes reassessment of wound depth difficult, and requires daily reapplication. For this reason, application of silver sulfadiazine is not recommended for most burns due to altered wound appearance and the frequency of required dressing changes. == Adverse effects == Application to large areas or to severe burns may lead to systemic absorption and lead to adverse effects similar to those of other sulfonamides. About 0.1 to 1.0% of people show hypersensitivity reactions such as rashes or erythema multiforme. This reaction is known from other sulfonamides including antibacterials, thiazide diuretics, and sulfonylurea antidiabetics; but data on the likelihood of cross-allergies are inconsistent. Incorporation of the silver ions can lead to local argyria (discoloration of the skin), especially if the treated area is exposed to ultraviolet light. Generalised argyria with silver accumulation in kidneys, liver, and retina has only been found in association with excessive long-term use, or repeated use on severe and heavily inflamed burns. Possible consequences of generalised argyria include interstitial nephritis and anemia. == Interactions == Proteases such as trypsin and clostridiopeptidase, which are contained in ointments used for the removal of dead skin on wounds, can be inhibited by silver ions if applied simultaneously. When silver sulfadiazine is absorbed in significant amounts, it can increase effects and side effects of some drugs such as vitamin K antagonists. == Pharmacokinetics == The chemical is poorly soluble, and has only very limited penetration through intact skin. However, contact with body fluids produces free sulfadiazine which can then be systemically absorbed and distributed; it undergoes glucuronidation in the liver and is also excreted unaltered in urine. Only when applied to large-area (especially second- and third-degree) burns or other lesions is absorption into the body a problem. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names include Silvadene (a genericized trademark), Silverex, Silverol, Silveleb, Silvazine, Flamazine, Thermazene, BurnHeal, Ebermine, Silvozin Tulle Dressing and SSD. == References ==",Silver sulfadiazine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.510157047363464e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005603650351986289)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682598.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Silver Sulfadiazine: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682598.html?utm_source=openai')])"

2535,"('Teriparatide', 'Human parathyroid hormone-(1-34)', 'Hpth (1-34)')",Medical,"Teriparatide, sold under the brand name Forteo, is a form of parathyroid hormone (PTH) consisting of the first (N-terminus) 34 amino acids, which is the bioactive portion of the hormone. It is an effective anabolic (promoting bone formation) agent used in the treatment of some forms of osteoporosis. Teriparatide is a recombinant human parathyroid hormone analog (PTH 1-34). It has an identical sequence to the 34 N-terminal amino acids of the 84-amino acid human parathyroid hormone. == Medical uses == Teriparatide is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis; for the increase of bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis; and treatment of men and women with osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy. It is effective in growing bone (e.g., 8% increase in bone density in the spine after one year) and reducing the risk of fragility fractures. Teriparatide cuts the risk of hip fracture by more than half but does not reduce the risk of arm or wrist fracture. == Contraindications == Teriparatide is contraindicated for those with open epiphyses, metabolic bone diseases, Paget's Disease of bone, bone metastases, history of skeletal malignancies, or prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton. In the animal studies and in one human case report, it was found to potentially be associated with developing osteosarcoma in test subjects after over two years of use. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects of teriparatide include headache, nausea, dizziness, and limb pain. Teriparatide has a theoretical risk of osteosarcoma, which was found in rat studies but not confirmed in humans. This may be because, unlike humans, rat bones grow for their entire life. The tumors found in the rat studies were located on the end of the bones which grew after the injections began. After nine years on the market, there were only two cases of osteosarcoma reported. This risk was considered by the FDA as ""extremely rare"" (1 in 100,000 people) and is only slightly more than the incidence in the population over 60 years old (0.4 in 100,000). == Mechanism of action == Teriparatide is a portion of human parathyroid hormone (PTH), amino acid sequence 1 through 34, of the complete molecule (containing 84 amino acids). Endogenous PTH is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. PTH increases serum calcium, partially accomplishing this by increasing bone resorption. Thus, chronically elevated PTH will deplete bone stores. However, intermittent exposure to PTH will activate osteoblasts more than osteoclasts. Thus, once-daily injections of teriparatide have a net effect of stimulating new bone formation leading to increased bone mineral density. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Teriparatide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1987. Teriparatide (Forteo) was approved by the FDA in November 2002, for the treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women who are at high risk for having a fracture. In October 2019, the US FDA approved the recombinant teriparatide product with brand name Bonsity. === Biosimilars === Recombinant teriparatide is sold by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand names Forteo and Forsteo. In June 2020, Alvogen, Inc, Pfenex Inc.'s commercialization partner, launched teriparatide injection (Bonsity) in the United States. Teriparatide injection was developed by Pfenex Inc and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2019. Teriparatide injection is pharmaceutically equivalent to Forteo (that is, has the same active ingredient in the same strength, dosage form and route of administration) and has been shown to have comparable bioavailability. These characteristics allowed the product to be approved under a 505(b)(2) NDA for which Forteo was the reference drug. It may provide a lower-cost teriparatide option for increasing bone density in patients at high risk for fracture, and is FDA-approved for the same indications as Forteo, which means it can be used for the same patients as Forteo, including new patients and those currently responding to treatment. Teriparatide was approved for medical use in the European Union in June 2003. A synthetic teriparatide from Teva Generics has been authorized for marketing in the European Union. Biosimilar product from Gedeon Richter plc has been authorized in the European Union. In October 2019, the US FDA approved a recombinant teriparatide product. In June 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the approval of the biosimilar products Qutavina and Livogiva. Qutavina and Livogiva were approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2020. Osnuvo was approved for medical use in Canada in January 2020. Sondelbay was approved for medical use in the European Union in March 2022. On 10 November 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Kauliv, intended for the treatment of osteoporosis. The applicant for this medicinal product is Strides Pharma Cyprus. Kauliv was approved for medical use in the European Union in February 2023. == Research == Teriparatide is undergoing a clinical trial with zoledronic acid as a treatment for osteogenesis imperfecta to reduce the risk of broken bones. === Combined teriparatide and denosumab === Combined teriparatide and denosumab increased BMD more than either agent alone and more than has been reported with approved therapies. Combination treatment might, therefore, be useful to treat patients at high risk of fracture by increasing BMD. However, there is no evidence of fracture rate reduction in patients taking a teriparatide and denosumab combination. The first such trial was published by Leder et al. in Lancet in 2013 with further data subsequently published in JCEM in a trial of post menopausal osteoporotic women demonstrating larger bone mineral density increases in the spine and hip with combination therapy compared to either drug alone. == References ==",Teriparatide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.00015860427811276168), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.10025616735219955), (' END', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -3.2020991056924686e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.9934315282152966e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018183792009949684)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06285?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Teriparatide: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06285?utm_source=openai')])"
2536,"('Tunicamycin',)",Medical,"Tunicamycin is a mixture of homologous nucleoside antibiotics that inhibits the UDP-HexNAc: polyprenol-P HexNAc-1-P family of enzymes. In eukaryotes, this includes the enzyme GlcNAc phosphotransferase (GPT), which catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to dolichol phosphate in the first step of glycoprotein synthesis. Tunicamycin blocks N-linked glycosylation (N-glycans) and treatment of cultured human cells with tunicamycin causes cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. It is used as an experimental tool in biology, e.g. to induce unfolded protein response. Tunicamycin is produced by several bacteria, including Streptomyces clavuligerus and Streptomyces lysosuperificus. Tunicamycin homologues have varying molecular weights owing to the variability in fatty acid side chain conjugates. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of tunicamycins was studied in Streptomyces chartreusis and a proposed biosynthetic pathway was characterized. The bacteria utilize the enzymes in the tun gene cluster (TunA-N) to make tunicamycins. TunA uses the starter unit uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and catalyzes the dehydration of the 6’ hydroxyl group. First, a Tyr residue in TunA abstracts a proton from the 4’ hydroxyl group, forming a ketone at that position. A hydride is subsequently abstracted from the 4’ carbon by NAD+, forming NADH. The ketone is stabilized by hydrogen bonding from the Tyr residue, and a nearby Thr residue. A glutamate residue then abstracts a proton from the 5’ carbon, pushing the electrons up to form a double bond between the 5’ and 6’ carbon. A nearby cysteine donates a proton to the hydroxyl group as it leaves as water. NADH donates a hydride to the 4’ carbon, reforming a hydroxide in that position and forming UDP-6’-deoxy-5-6-ene-GlcNAc. TunF then catalyzes the epimerization of the intermediate to UDP-6’-deoxy-5-6-ene-GalNAc, changing the 4’ hydroxyl from the equatorial to axial position. The other starter unit for tunicamycin is uridine, which is produced from uridine triphosphate (UTP). TunN is a nucleotide diphosphatase, and catalyzes the removal of pyrophosphate from UTP to form uridine monophosphate. The last phosphate is removed by the putative monophosphatase, TunG. Once uridine and UDP-6’-deoxy-5-6-ene-GalNAc are produced, TunB catalyzes their linkage at the 6’ carbon of UDP-6’-deoxy-5-6-ene-GalNAc. TunB uses S-adenyslmethionine (SAM) to form a radical on the 5’ carbon of the ribose on uracil. TunM is thought to catalyze the formation of a new bond between the 5’ carbon of uridine and the 6’ carbon of UDP-6’-deoxy-5-6-ene-GalNAc using the electron from the uridine radical and one of the electrons from the double bond of UDP-6’-deoxy-5-6-ene-GalNAc. The radical on UDP-6’-deoxy-5-6-ene-GalNAc is then quenched by abstracting a hydrogen from SAM. The resulting molecule is UDP-N-acetyl-tunicamine. TunH then catalyzes the hydrolysis of UDP from UDP-N-acetyl-tunicamine. Another molecule of UDP-GlcNAc is introduced, and a β-1,1 glycosidic bond is subsequently formed, catalyzed by TunD. The resulting molecule is deacetylated by TunE. TunL and a fatty acyl-ACP ligase are used to load metabolic fatty acids onto the acyl carrier protein, TunK. TunC then attaches the fatty acid to the free amine, producing tunicamycin. == See also == Glycosylation - tunicamycin blocks all N-glycosylation of proteins Glycoprotein Streptomyces == References == == External links == Book section of Essentials in Glycobiology (1999) Tunicamycin: Inhibition of DOL-PP-GlcNAc Assembly Tunicamycin data sheet prepared by a student of the Open University, UK",Tunicamycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.023546280339360237)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.6493213772773743), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6933039426803589)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.6933149099349976), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunicamycin,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41429-019-0200-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26498681/ ', [])"

The recommended treatment includes the early administration of a vasoactive drug. Vapreotide is a somatostatin analogue with a different receptor affinity to octreotide. It decreases portal pressure and blood flow of collateral circulation in rats with cirrhosis. The pivotal study of early administration of vapreotide in patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding has shown a significant improvement in bleeding control and, in the subset of patients with significant bleeding, a significant reduction in mortality. In addition, a meta-analysis of four randomized studies has shown a significant improvement in bleeding control. Vapreotide administrated via the intravenous route is simple to use, with practically no contraindications and few, usually minor, side effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of delivering vapreotide, a somatostatin analogue, by transdermal iontophoresis. In vitro experiments were conducted using dermatomed porcine ear skin and heat-separated epidermis. In addition to quantifying vapreotide transport into and across the skin, the effect of peptide delivery on skin permselectivity was also measured. The influence of (1) current density, (2) pre- and post-treatment of the skin, (3) competitive ions, and (4) inclusion of albumin in the receptor on vapreotide delivery were investigated. Epidermis proved to be a better model than dermatomed skin for vapreotide transport studies. Despite the susceptibility of vapreotide to enzymatic degradation, a flux of 1.7 microg/cm2 per hour was achieved after 7 h of constant current iontophoresis (0.15 mA/cm2). Post-iontophoretic extraction revealed that, depending on the experimental conditions, 80-300 microg of peptide were bound to the skin. Vapreotide was found to interact with the skin and displayed a current-dependent inhibition of electroosmosis. However, neither the pre-treatment strategies to saturate the putative binding sites nor the post-treatment protocols to displace the bound peptide were effective.

2539,"('Vitamin b12', 'Cyanocobalamin')","Food, Medical","Cyanocobalamin is a form of vitamin B12 used to treat and prevent vitamin B12 deficiency except in the presence of cyanide toxicity. The deficiency may occur in pernicious anemia, following surgical removal of the stomach, with fish tapeworm, or due to bowel cancer. It is used by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or as a nasal spray. Cyanocobalamin is generally well tolerated. Minor side effects may include diarrhea, nausea, upset stomach, and itchiness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, and low blood potassium resulting in heart failure. Use is not recommended in those who are allergic to cobalt or have Leber's disease. No overdosage or toxicity has been reported. It is less preferred than hydroxocobalamin for treating vitamin B12 deficiency because it has a slightly lower bioavailability. Some studies have shown it to possess an antihypotensive effect. Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient meaning that it cannot be made by the body but is required for life. Cyanocobalamin was first manufactured in the 1940s. It is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In 2022, it was the 131st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical use == Cyanocobalamin is usually prescribed after surgical removal of part or all of the stomach or intestine to ensure adequate serum levels of vitamin B12. It is also used to treat pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency (due to low intake from food or inability to absorb due to genetic or other factors), thyrotoxicosis, hemorrhage, malignancy, liver disease and kidney disease. Cyanocobalamin injections are often prescribed to gastric bypass patients who have had part of their small intestine bypassed, making it difficult for B12 to be acquired via food or vitamins. Cyanocobalamin is also used to perform the Schilling test to check ability to absorb vitamin B12. Cyanocobalamin is also produced in the body (and then excreted via urine) after intravenous hydroxycobalamin is used to treat cyanide poisoning. == Side effects == Possible side effects of cyanocobalamin injection include allergic reactions such as hives, difficult breathing; redness of the face; swelling of the arms, hands, feet, ankles or lower legs; extreme thirst; and diarrhea. Less-serious side effects may include headache, dizziness, leg pain, itching, or rash. Treatment of megaloblastic anemia with concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency using B12 vitamers (including cyanocobalamin), creates the possibility of hypokalemia due to increased erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) and consequent cellular uptake of potassium upon anemia resolution. When treated with cyanocobalamin, patients with Leber's disease may develop serious optic atrophy, possibly leading to blindness. == Chemistry == Vitamin B12 is the ""generic descriptor"" name for any vitamers of vitamin B12. Animals, including humans, can convert cyanocobalamin to any one of the active vitamin B12 compounds. Cyanocobalamin is one of the most widely manufactured vitamers in the vitamin B12 family (the family of chemicals that function as B12 when put into the body), because cyanocobalamin is the most air-stable of the B12 forms. It is the easiest to crystallize and therefore easiest to purify after it is produced by bacterial fermentation. It can be obtained as dark red crystals or as an amorphous red powder. Cyanocobalamin is hygroscopic in the anhydrous form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to autoclaving for short periods at 121 °C (250 °F). The vitamin B12 coenzymes are unstable in light. After consumption the cyanide ligand is replaced by other groups (adenosyl, methyl) to produce the biologically active forms. The cyanide is converted to thiocyanate and excreted by the kidney. === Chemical reactions === In the cobalamins, cobalt normally exists in the trivalent state, Co(III). However, under reducing conditions, the cobalt center is reduced to Co(II) or even Co(I), which are usually denoted as B12r and B12s, for reduced and super reduced respectively. B12r and B12s can be prepared from cyanocobalamin by controlled potential reduction, or chemical reduction using sodium borohydride in alkaline solution, zinc in acetic acid, or by the action of thiols. Both B12r and B12s are stable indefinitely under oxygen-free conditions. B12r appears orange-brown in solution, while B12s appears bluish-green under natural daylight, and purple under artificial light. B12s is one of the most nucleophilic species known in aqueous solution. This property allows the convenient preparation of cobalamin analogs with different substituents, via nucleophilic attack on alkyl halides and vinyl halides. For example, cyanocobalamin can be converted to its analog cobalamins via reduction to B12s, followed by the addition of the corresponding alkyl halides, acyl halides, alkene or alkyne. Steric hindrance is the major limiting factor in the synthesis of the B12 coenzyme analogs. For example, no reaction occurs between neopentyl chloride and B12s, whereas the secondary alkyl halide analogs are too unstable to be isolated. This effect may be due to the strong coordination between benzimidazole and the central cobalt atom, pulling it down into the plane of the corrin ring. The trans effect determines the polarizability of the Co–C bond so formed. However, once the benzimidazole is detached from cobalt by quaternization with methyl iodide, it is replaced by H2O or hydroxyl ions. Various secondary alkyl halides are then readily attacked by the modified B12s to give the corresponding stable cobalamin analogs. The products are usually extracted and purified by phenol-methylene chloride extraction or by column chromatography. Cobalamin analogs prepared by this method include the naturally occurring coenzymes methylcobalamin and cobamamide, and other cobalamins that do not occur naturally, such as vinylcobalamin, carboxymethylcobalamin and cyclohexylcobalamin. This reaction is under review for use as a catalyst for chemical dehalogenation, organic reagent and photosensitized catalyst systems. == Production == Cyanocobalamin is commercially prepared by bacterial fermentation. Fermentation by a variety of microorganisms yields a mixture of methylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. These compounds are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium nitrite and heat. Since multiple species of Propionibacterium produce no exotoxins or endotoxins and have been granted GRAS status (generally regarded as safe) by the United States Food and Drug Administration, they are the preferred bacterial fermentation organisms for vitamin B12 production. Historically, the physiological form was initially thought to be cyanocobalamin. This was because hydroxocobalamin produced by bacteria was changed to cyanocobalamin during purification in activated charcoal columns after separation from the bacterial cultures (because cyanide is naturally present in activated charcoal). Cyanocobalamin is the form in most pharmaceutical preparations because adding cyanide stabilizes the molecule. The total world production of vitamin B12, by four companies (the French Sanofi-Aventis and three Chinese companies) in 2008 was 35 tonnes. == Metabolism == The two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 are methylcobalamin in cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in mitochondria. Multivitamins often contain cyanocobalamin, which is presumably converted to bioactive forms in the body. Both methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin are commercially available as supplement pills. The MMACHC gene product catalyzes the decyanation of cyanocobalamin as well as the dealkylation of alkylcobalamins including methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. This function has also been attributed to cobalamin reductases. The MMACHC gene product and cobalamin reductases enable the interconversion of cyano- and alkylcobalamins. Cyanocobalamin is added as an ingredient to fortify nutrition in products such as baby formula, breakfast cereals and energy drinks as well as livestock feed. Vitamin B12 becomes inactive when exposed to hydrogen cyanide and nitric oxide in cigarette smoke. Vitamin B12 deficiency can develop with heavy regular use of nitrous oxide N2O, also known as ""laughing gas"", used for anaesthesia in a clinical setting or as a propellant gas, it's commonly abused as a recreational drug. Vitamin B12 additionally becomes inactive when exposed to intense heat or electromagnetic radiation. === In the cytosol === Methylcobalamin and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate are needed by methionine synthase in the methionine cycle to transfer a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, thereby generating tetrahydrofolate (THF) and methionine, which is used to make SAMe. SAMe is the universal methyl donor and is used for DNA methylation and to make phospholipid membranes, choline, sphingomyelin, acetylcholine, and other neurotransmitters. === In mitochondria === The enzymes that use B12 as a built-in cofactor are methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (PDB 4REQ) and methionine synthase (PDB 1Q8J). The metabolism of propionyl-CoA occurs in the mitochondria and requires Vitamin B12 (as adenosylcobalamin) to make succinyl-CoA. When the conversion of propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the mitochondria fails due to Vitamin B12 deficiency, elevated blood levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) occur. Thus, elevated blood levels of homocysteine and MMA may both be indicators of vitamin B12 deficiency. Adenosylcobalamin is needed as cofactor in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase—MUT enzyme. Processing of cholesterol and protein gives propionyl-CoA that is converted to methylmalonyl-CoA, which is used by MUT enzyme to make succinyl-CoA. Vitamin B12 is needed to prevent anemia, since making porphyrin and heme in mitochondria for producing hemoglobin in red blood cells depends on succinyl-CoA made by vitamin B12. === Absorption and transport === Inadequate absorption of vitamin B12 may be related to coeliac disease. Intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 requires successively three different protein molecules: haptocorrin, intrinsic factor and transcobalamin II. == See also == Methylcobalamin Hydroxocobalamin Adenosylcobalamin Cobalamin biosynthesis == References ==",Cyanocobalamin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0031837786082178354), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.004078997299075127), (' FOOD', -5.6934557505883276e-05)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0005690624238923192), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.005239327438175678), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0033173311967402697), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12699156999588013)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0019286326132714748), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -2.339278580620885e-06)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanocobalamin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=99, start_index=15, title='Cyanocobalamin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanocobalamin?utm_source=openai')])"
2540,"('Zinc pyrithione',)",Medical,"Zinc pyrithione (or pyrithione zinc) is a coordination complex of zinc. It has fungistatic (inhibiting the division of fungal cells) and bacteriostatic (inhibiting bacterial cell division) properties and is used in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis and dandruff. == Structure of the compound == The pyrithione ligands, which are formally monoanions, are chelated to Zn2+ via oxygen and sulfur centers. In the crystalline state, zinc pyrithione exists as a centrosymmetric dimer (see figure), where each zinc is bonded to two sulfur and three oxygen centers. In solution, however, the dimers dissociate via scission of one Zn-O bond. This compound was first described in the 1930s. Pyrithione is the conjugate base derived from 2-mercaptopyridine-N-oxide (CAS# 1121-31-9), a derivative of pyridine-N-oxide. == Uses == === Medicine === Zinc pyrithione can be used to treat dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis. It also has antibacterial properties and is effective against many pathogens from the Streptococcus and Staphylococcus genera. Its other medical applications include treatments of psoriasis, eczema, ringworm, fungus, athletes foot, dry skin, atopic dermatitis, tinea versicolor, and vitiligo. === Paint === Because of its low solubility in water (8 ppm at neutral pH), zinc pyrithione is suitable for use in outdoor paints and other products that protect against mildew and algae. It is an algaecide. It is chemically incompatible with paints relying on metal carboxylate curing agents. When it is used in latex paints with water containing much iron, a sequestering agent that preferentially binds the iron ions is needed. It is decomposed by ultraviolet light slowly, providing years of protection in direct sunlight. === Sponges === Zinc pyrithione is an antibacterial treatment for household sponges, as used by the 3M Corporation. === Clothing === A process to apply zinc pyrithione to cotton with washable results was patented in the United States in 1984. Zinc pyrithione is used to prevent microbe growth in polyester. Textiles with applied zinc pyrithione protect against odor-causing microorganisms. Export of antimicrobial textiles reached US$497.4 million in 2015. == Mechanism of action == === Antibacterial effect === Zinc pyrithione is known to exhibit antibacterial activity by disrupting cell membrane integrity and essential metabolic functions in bacteria. === Antifungal effect === Its antifungal effect is thought to derive from its ability to disrupt membrane transport by blocking the proton pump that energizes the transport mechanism. A study from 2011 showed that antifungal effects of Zinc pyrithione work by copper toxicity mechanism that targets critical iron–sulphur proteins. == Health effects == Zinc pyrithione is approved for over-the-counter topical use in the United States as a treatment for dandruff and is the active ingredient in several anti-dandruff shampoos and body wash gels. In its industrial forms and strengths, it may be harmful by contact or ingestion. Zinc pyrithione can in the laboratory setting trigger a variety of responses, such as DNA damage in skin cells. == Legal status == === European Union === Use of zinc pyrithione is prohibited within cosmetic products in the European Union since December 2021. The substance was considered safe for use in rinse-off and leave-in products of different tested concentrations, but due to potential environmental toxicity consideration of the use of zinc pyrithione was made against potential alternative substance ingredients. Due to no industry submission to the regulators supporting the continued use of zinc pyrithione and/or an absence of indications that there were no suitable alternatives to the substance: the use of zinc pyrithione became automatically prohibited within cosmetic products as an intended ingredient. This was as a consequence of zinc pyrithione addition to the Cosmetic Product Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 Annex II list. === United States === Zinc pyrithione concentration of up to 2% is allowed for products when they are formulated to be applied and then washed off after brief exposure. Alternatively, up to 0.25 percent when formulated to be left on the skin or scalp == Environmental concerns == A large Swedish study shows that it is broken down in wastewater plants and does not release into waterways. A Danish study shows that it biodegrades quickly, but that a risk of continuous leaching from boat paint may cause environmental toxicity. == See also == Ketoconazole, another antifungal agent used in shampoos Piroctone olamine, another antifungal agent used in shampoos Selenium disulfide, an active ingredient used in shampoos such as Selsun Blue == References ==",Zinc pyrithione,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.007937116548418999), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -2.45848218582978e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.22544820606708527), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -1.1637164789135568e-05), (' INDUSTR', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.010848237201571465), ('ICAL', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -0.00016926287207752466), ('ĠPERSON', -0.47434306144714355), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.3112935448589269e-05), (',', -0.07890494912862778), ('ĠINDU', -0.00020287363440729678), ('ST', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00195443257689476)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.03891902044415474), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.0019286326132714748), (' INDUSTR', -0.00015991552209015936), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.healthline.com/health/pyrithione-zinc,https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/zinc-pyrithione/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26885780/ ', [])"
2541,"('Menthol', 'Levomenthol', 'Menthomenthol', 'Menthacamphor', 'Peppermint camphor')","Food, Medical","Menthol is an organic compound, specifically a monoterpenoid, that occurs naturally in the oils of several plants in the mint family, such as corn mint and peppermint. It is a white or clear waxy crystalline substance that is solid at room temperature and melts slightly above. The main form of menthol occurring in nature is (−)-menthol, which is assigned the (1R,2S,5R) configuration. For many people, menthol produces a cooling sensation when inhaled, eaten, or applied to the skin, and mint plants have been used for centuries for topical pain relief and as a food flavoring. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it is widely used to relieve minor throat irritation. Menthol has been demonstrated to cause a subjective nasal decongestant effect without any objective decongestant action, and administration of menthol via a nasal inhaler in humans has also been shown to cause nasal congestion. Menthol also acts as a weak κ-opioid receptor agonist. == Structure == Natural menthol exists as one pure stereoisomer, nearly always the (1R,2S,5R) form (bottom left corner of the diagram below). The eight possible stereoisomers are: In the natural compound, the isopropyl group is in the trans orientation to both the methyl and hydroxyl groups. Thus, it can be drawn in any of the ways shown: The (+)- and (−)-enantiomers of menthol are the most stable among these based on their cyclohexane conformations. With the ring itself in a chair conformation, all three bulky groups can orient in equatorial positions. The two crystal forms for racemic menthol have melting points of 28 °C and 38 °C. Pure (−)-menthol has four crystal forms, of which the most stable is the α form, the familiar broad needles. == Biological properties == Menthol's ability to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin is responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it provokes when inhaled, eaten, or applied to the skin. In this sense, it is similar to capsaicin, the chemical responsible for the spiciness of hot chilis (which stimulates heat sensors, also without causing an actual change in temperature). Menthol's analgesic properties are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol blocks calcium channels and voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscles. Some studies show that menthol acts as a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator and increases GABAergic transmission in PAG neurons. Menthol has anesthetic properties similar to, though less potent than, propofol because it interacts with the same sites on the GABAA receptor. Menthol may also enhance the activity of glycine receptors and negatively modulate 5-HT3 receptors and nAChRs. Menthol is widely used in dental care as a topical antibacterial agent, effective against several types of streptococci and lactobacilli. Menthol also lowers blood pressure and antagonizes vasoconstriction through TRPM8 activation. == Occurrence == Mentha arvensis (wild mint) is the primary species of mint used to make natural menthol crystals and natural menthol flakes. This species is primarily grown in the Uttar Pradesh region in India. Menthol occurs naturally in peppermint oil (along with a little menthone, the ester menthyl acetate and other compounds), obtained from Mentha × piperita (peppermint). Japanese menthol also contains a small percentage of the 1-epimer neomenthol. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of menthol has been investigated in Mentha × piperita and the enzymes involved in have been identified and characterized. It begins with the synthesis of the terpene limonene, followed by hydroxylation, and then several reduction and isomerization steps. More specifically, the biosynthesis of (−)-menthol takes place in the secretory gland cells of the peppermint plant. The steps of the biosynthetic pathway are as follows: Geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) first catalyzes the reaction of IPP and DMAPP into geranyl diphosphate. (−)-limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the cyclization of geranyl diphosphate to (−)-limonene. (−)-Limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), using O2 and then nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) catalyzes the allylic hydroxylation of (−)-limonene at the 3 position to (−)-trans-isopiperitenol. (−)-trans-Isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPD) further oxidizes the hydroxyl group on the 3 position using NAD+ to make (−)-isopiperitenone. (−)-Isopiperitenone reductase (iPR) then reduces the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 using NADPH to form (+)-cis-isopulegone. (+)-cis-Isopulegone isomerase (iPI) then isomerizes the remaining double bond to form (+)-pulegone. (+)-Pulegone reductase (PR) reduces this double bond using NADPH to form (−)-menthone. (−)-Menthone reductase (MR) then reduces the carbonyl group using NADPH to form (−)-menthol. == Production == Natural menthol is obtained by freezing peppermint oil. The resultant crystals of menthol are then separated by filtration. Total world production of menthol in 1998 was 12,000 tonnes of which 2,500 tonnes was synthetic. In 2005, the annual production of synthetic menthol was almost double. Prices are in the $10–20/kg range with peaks in the $40/kg region but have reached as high as $100/kg. In 1985, it was estimated that China produced most of the world's supply of natural menthol, although it appears that India has pushed China into second place. Menthol is manufactured as a single enantiomer (94% e.e.) on the scale of 3,000 tonnes per year by Takasago International Corporation. The process involves an asymmetric synthesis developed by a team led by Ryōji Noyori, who won the 2001 Nobel Prize for Chemistry in recognition of his work on this process: The process begins by forming an allylic amine from myrcene, which undergoes asymmetric isomerisation in the presence of a BINAP rhodium complex to give (after hydrolysis) enantiomerically pure R-citronellal. This is cyclised by a carbonyl-ene-reaction initiated by zinc bromide to isopulegol, which is then hydrogenated to give pure (1R,2S,5R)-menthol. Another commercial process is the Haarmann–Reimer process (after the company Haarmann & Reimer, now part of Symrise) This process starts from m-cresol which is alkylated with propene to thymol. This compound is hydrogenated in the next step. Racemic menthol is isolated by fractional distillation. The enantiomers are separated by chiral resolution in reaction with methyl benzoate, selective crystallisation followed by hydrolysis. Racemic menthol can also be formed by hydrogenation of thymol, menthone, or pulegone. In both cases with further processing (crystallizative entrainment resolution of the menthyl benzoate conglomerate) it is possible to concentrate the L-enantiomer, however this tends to be less efficient, although the higher processing costs may be offset by lower raw material costs. A further advantage of this process is that D-menthol becomes inexpensively available for use as a chiral auxiliary, along with the more usual L-antipode. == Applications == Menthol is included in many products, and for a variety of reasons. === Cosmetic === In some beauty products such as hair conditioners, based on natural ingredients (e.g., St. ⁠Ives). === Medical === As an antipruritic to reduce itching. As a topical analgesic, it is used to relieve minor aches and pains, such as muscle cramps, sprains, headaches and similar conditions, alone or combined with chemicals such as camphor, eucalyptus oil or capsaicin. In Europe, it tends to appear as a gel or a cream, while in the U.S., patches and body sleeves are very frequently used, e.g.: Tiger Balm, or IcyHot patches or knee/elbow sleeves. As a penetration enhancer in transdermal drug delivery. Used to cause a subjective feeling of decongestion in nasal inhalers. In decongestants for chest creams and patches). Examples: Vicks VapoRub, Mentholatum, Axe Brand, VapoRem, Mentisan. In certain medications used to treat sunburns, as it provides a cooling sensation (then often associated with aloe). Commonly used in oral hygiene products and bad-breath remedies, such as mouthwash, toothpaste, mouth and tongue sprays, and more generally as a food flavor agent; such as in chewing gum and candy. In first aid products such as ""mineral ice"" to produce a cooling effect as a substitute for real ice in the absence of water or electricity (pouch, body patch/sleeve or cream). In nonprescription products for short-term relief of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation e.g.: lip balms and cough medicines. A recent study showed improvement in Alzheimer's symptoms and cognition improvements in mice. === Others === In aftershave products to relieve razor burn. As a smoking tobacco additive in some cigarette brands, for flavor, and to reduce throat and sinus irritation caused by smoking. Menthol also increases nicotine receptor density, increasing the addictive potential of tobacco products. As a pesticide against tracheal mites of honey bees. In perfumery, menthol is used to prepare menthyl esters to emphasize floral notes (especially rose). In various patches ranging from fever-reducing patches applied to children's foreheads to ""foot patches"" to relieve numerous ailments (the latter being much more frequent and elaborate in Asia, especially Japan: some varieties use ""functional protrusions"", or small bumps to massage one's feet as well as soothing them and cooling them down). As an antispasmodic and smooth muscle relaxant in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. === Organic chemistry === In organic chemistry, menthol is used as a chiral auxiliary in asymmetric synthesis. For example, sulfinate esters made from sulfinyl chlorides and menthol can be used to make enantiomerically pure sulfoxides by reaction with organolithium reagents or Grignard reagents. Menthol reacts with chiral carboxylic acids to give diastereomic menthyl esters, which are useful for chiral resolution. It can be used as a catalyst for sodium production for the amateur chemist via the alcohol catalysed magnesium reduction process. Menthol is potentially ergogenic (performance enhancing) for athletic performance in hot environments == Reactions == Menthol reacts in many ways like a normal secondary alcohol. It is oxidised to menthone by oxidising agents such as chromic acid, dichromate, or by calcium hypochlorite, in a green chemistry route. Under some conditions the oxidation using Cr(VI) compounds can go further and break open the ring. Menthol is easily dehydrated to give mainly 3-menthene, by the action of 2% sulfuric acid. Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) gives menthyl chloride. == History == In the West, menthol was first isolated in 1771, by the German, Hieronymus David Gaubius. Early characterizations were done by Oppenheim, Beckett, Moriya, and Atkinson. It was named by F. L.

2542,"('Menthol', 'Cyclohexanol, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-', 'P-menthan-3-ol', 'Racementhol', 'Hexahydrothymol')","Food, Medical","Menthol is an organic compound, specifically a monoterpenoid, that occurs naturally in the oils of several plants in the mint family, such as corn mint and peppermint. It is a white or clear waxy crystalline substance that is solid at room temperature and melts slightly above. The main form of menthol occurring in nature is (−)-menthol, which is assigned the (1R,2S,5R) configuration. For many people, menthol produces a cooling sensation when inhaled, eaten, or applied to the skin, and mint plants have been used for centuries for topical pain relief and as a food flavoring. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it is widely used to relieve minor throat irritation. Menthol has been demonstrated to cause a subjective nasal decongestant effect without any objective decongestant action, and administration of menthol via a nasal inhaler in humans has also been shown to cause nasal congestion. Menthol also acts as a weak κ-opioid receptor agonist. == Structure == Natural menthol exists as one pure stereoisomer, nearly always the (1R,2S,5R) form (bottom left corner of the diagram below). The eight possible stereoisomers are: In the natural compound, the isopropyl group is in the trans orientation to both the methyl and hydroxyl groups. Thus, it can be drawn in any of the ways shown: The (+)- and (−)-enantiomers of menthol are the most stable among these based on their cyclohexane conformations. With the ring itself in a chair conformation, all three bulky groups can orient in equatorial positions. The two crystal forms for racemic menthol have melting points of 28 °C and 38 °C. Pure (−)-menthol has four crystal forms, of which the most stable is the α form, the familiar broad needles. == Biological properties == Menthol's ability to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors in the skin is responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it provokes when inhaled, eaten, or applied to the skin. In this sense, it is similar to capsaicin, the chemical responsible for the spiciness of hot chilis (which stimulates heat sensors, also without causing an actual change in temperature). Menthol's analgesic properties are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol blocks calcium channels and voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscles. Some studies show that menthol acts as a GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator and increases GABAergic transmission in PAG neurons. Menthol has anesthetic properties similar to, though less potent than, propofol because it interacts with the same sites on the GABAA receptor. Menthol may also enhance the activity of glycine receptors and negatively modulate 5-HT3 receptors and nAChRs. Menthol is widely used in dental care as a topical antibacterial agent, effective against several types of streptococci and lactobacilli. Menthol also lowers blood pressure and antagonizes vasoconstriction through TRPM8 activation. == Occurrence == Mentha arvensis (wild mint) is the primary species of mint used to make natural menthol crystals and natural menthol flakes. This species is primarily grown in the Uttar Pradesh region in India. Menthol occurs naturally in peppermint oil (along with a little menthone, the ester menthyl acetate and other compounds), obtained from Mentha × piperita (peppermint). Japanese menthol also contains a small percentage of the 1-epimer neomenthol. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of menthol has been investigated in Mentha × piperita and the enzymes involved in have been identified and characterized. It begins with the synthesis of the terpene limonene, followed by hydroxylation, and then several reduction and isomerization steps. More specifically, the biosynthesis of (−)-menthol takes place in the secretory gland cells of the peppermint plant. The steps of the biosynthetic pathway are as follows: Geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) first catalyzes the reaction of IPP and DMAPP into geranyl diphosphate. (−)-limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the cyclization of geranyl diphosphate to (−)-limonene. (−)-Limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), using O2 and then nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) catalyzes the allylic hydroxylation of (−)-limonene at the 3 position to (−)-trans-isopiperitenol. (−)-trans-Isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPD) further oxidizes the hydroxyl group on the 3 position using NAD+ to make (−)-isopiperitenone. (−)-Isopiperitenone reductase (iPR) then reduces the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 using NADPH to form (+)-cis-isopulegone. (+)-cis-Isopulegone isomerase (iPI) then isomerizes the remaining double bond to form (+)-pulegone. (+)-Pulegone reductase (PR) reduces this double bond using NADPH to form (−)-menthone. (−)-Menthone reductase (MR) then reduces the carbonyl group using NADPH to form (−)-menthol. == Production == Natural menthol is obtained by freezing peppermint oil. The resultant crystals of menthol are then separated by filtration. Total world production of menthol in 1998 was 12,000 tonnes of which 2,500 tonnes was synthetic. In 2005, the annual production of synthetic menthol was almost double. Prices are in the $10–20/kg range with peaks in the $40/kg region but have reached as high as $100/kg. In 1985, it was estimated that China produced most of the world's supply of natural menthol, although it appears that India has pushed China into second place. Menthol is manufactured as a single enantiomer (94% e.e.) on the scale of 3,000 tonnes per year by Takasago International Corporation. The process involves an asymmetric synthesis developed by a team led by Ryōji Noyori, who won the 2001 Nobel Prize for Chemistry in recognition of his work on this process: The process begins by forming an allylic amine from myrcene, which undergoes asymmetric isomerisation in the presence of a BINAP rhodium complex to give (after hydrolysis) enantiomerically pure R-citronellal. This is cyclised by a carbonyl-ene-reaction initiated by zinc bromide to isopulegol, which is then hydrogenated to give pure (1R,2S,5R)-menthol. Another commercial process is the Haarmann–Reimer process (after the company Haarmann & Reimer, now part of Symrise) This process starts from m-cresol which is alkylated with propene to thymol. This compound is hydrogenated in the next step. Racemic menthol is isolated by fractional distillation. The enantiomers are separated by chiral resolution in reaction with methyl benzoate, selective crystallisation followed by hydrolysis. Racemic menthol can also be formed by hydrogenation of thymol, menthone, or pulegone. In both cases with further processing (crystallizative entrainment resolution of the menthyl benzoate conglomerate) it is possible to concentrate the L-enantiomer, however this tends to be less efficient, although the higher processing costs may be offset by lower raw material costs. A further advantage of this process is that D-menthol becomes inexpensively available for use as a chiral auxiliary, along with the more usual L-antipode. == Applications == Menthol is included in many products, and for a variety of reasons. === Cosmetic === In some beauty products such as hair conditioners, based on natural ingredients (e.g., St. ⁠Ives). === Medical === As an antipruritic to reduce itching. As a topical analgesic, it is used to relieve minor aches and pains, such as muscle cramps, sprains, headaches and similar conditions, alone or combined with chemicals such as camphor, eucalyptus oil or capsaicin. In Europe, it tends to appear as a gel or a cream, while in the U.S., patches and body sleeves are very frequently used, e.g.: Tiger Balm, or IcyHot patches or knee/elbow sleeves. As a penetration enhancer in transdermal drug delivery. Used to cause a subjective feeling of decongestion in nasal inhalers. In decongestants for chest creams and patches). Examples: Vicks VapoRub, Mentholatum, Axe Brand, VapoRem, Mentisan. In certain medications used to treat sunburns, as it provides a cooling sensation (then often associated with aloe). Commonly used in oral hygiene products and bad-breath remedies, such as mouthwash, toothpaste, mouth and tongue sprays, and more generally as a food flavor agent; such as in chewing gum and candy. In first aid products such as ""mineral ice"" to produce a cooling effect as a substitute for real ice in the absence of water or electricity (pouch, body patch/sleeve or cream). In nonprescription products for short-term relief of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation e.g.: lip balms and cough medicines. A recent study showed improvement in Alzheimer's symptoms and cognition improvements in mice. === Others === In aftershave products to relieve razor burn. As a smoking tobacco additive in some cigarette brands, for flavor, and to reduce throat and sinus irritation caused by smoking. Menthol also increases nicotine receptor density, increasing the addictive potential of tobacco products. As a pesticide against tracheal mites of honey bees. In perfumery, menthol is used to prepare menthyl esters to emphasize floral notes (especially rose). In various patches ranging from fever-reducing patches applied to children's foreheads to ""foot patches"" to relieve numerous ailments (the latter being much more frequent and elaborate in Asia, especially Japan: some varieties use ""functional protrusions"", or small bumps to massage one's feet as well as soothing them and cooling them down). As an antispasmodic and smooth muscle relaxant in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. === Organic chemistry === In organic chemistry, menthol is used as a chiral auxiliary in asymmetric synthesis. For example, sulfinate esters made from sulfinyl chlorides and menthol can be used to make enantiomerically pure sulfoxides by reaction with organolithium reagents or Grignard reagents. Menthol reacts with chiral carboxylic acids to give diastereomic menthyl esters, which are useful for chiral resolution. It can be used as a catalyst for sodium production for the amateur chemist via the alcohol catalysed magnesium reduction process. Menthol is potentially ergogenic (performance enhancing) for athletic performance in hot environments == Reactions == Menthol reacts in many ways like a normal secondary alcohol. It is oxidised to menthone by oxidising agents such as chromic acid, dichromate, or by calcium hypochlorite, in a green chemistry route. Under some conditions the oxidation using Cr(VI) compounds can go further and break open the ring. Menthol is easily dehydrated to give mainly 3-menthene, by the action of 2% sulfuric acid. Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) gives menthyl chloride. == History == In the West, menthol was first isolated in 1771, by the German, Hieronymus David Gaubius. Early characterizations were done by Oppenheim, Beckett, Moriya, and Atkinson. It was named by F. L. Alphons Oppenheim (1833–1877) in 1861. == Compendial status == United States Pharmacopeia 23 Japanese Pharmacopoeia 15 Food Chemicals Codex == Safety == The estimated lethal dose for menthol (and peppermint oil) in humans may be as low as LD 50 {\displaystyle _{50}} =50–500 mg/kg.

Pivmecillinam is the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of mecillinam. The most common side effects include nausea and diarrhea. == Medical uses == In the US, pivmecillinam is indicated for the treatment of female adults with uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Pivmecillinam is primarily active against Gram-negative bacteria, and is used primarily in the treatment of lower urinary tract infections. In the Nordic countries, it has been widely used in that indication since the 1970s. == Activity == == Adverse effects == The adverse effect profile of pivmecillinam is similar to that of other penicillins. The most common side effects of mecillinam use are rash and gastrointestinal upset, including nausea and vomiting. Prodrugs that release pivalate anions when broken down by the body — such as pivmecillinam, pivampicillin and cefditoren pivoxil — have long been known to deplete levels of carnitine. This is not due to the drug itself, but to the pivalate anion, which is mostly removed from the body by forming a conjugate with carnitine. Although short-term use of these drugs can cause a marked decrease in blood levels of carnitine, it is unlikely to be of clinical significance; long-term use, however, appears problematic and is not recommended. == History == The efficacy of pivmecillinam in treating females eighteen years of age or older with uncomplicated UTIs was assessed in three controlled clinical trials comparing different pivmecillinam dosing regimens to placebo, to another oral antibacterial drug and to ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory drug). The primary measure of efficacy for the three trials was the composite response rate, which included clinical cure (resolution of the symptoms of the uncomplicated UTI that were present in participants at trial entry and no new symptoms) and microbiological response (demonstration that the bacteria cultured from participants' urine at trial entry was reduced). The composite response rate was assessed approximately 8 to 14 days after participants were enrolled into the studies. In the clinical trial comparing pivmecillinam to placebo, 62% of the 137 participants who received pivmecillinam achieved the composite response compared to 10% of the 134 who received placebo. In the clinical trial comparing pivmecillinam to another oral antibacterial drug, 72% of the 127 participants who received pivmecillinam achieved composite response compared to 76% of the 132 who received the comparator drug. In the clinical trial comparing pivmecillinam to ibuprofen, 66% of the 105 participants who received pivmecillinam achieved composite response compared to 22% of the 119 who received ibuprofen. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for pivmecillinam priority review and qualified infectious disease product designations. The FDA granted the approval of Pivya to Utility Therapeutics Ltd. == Research == Pivmecillinam has been proposed as the first-line drug of choice for empirical treatment of acute cystitis.

This study aimed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and efficacy of conteltinib in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this multicenter, single-arm, open-label, first-in-human phase 1 study, conteltinib was taken orally at doses of 50 to 800 mg quaque die (QD) in a dose-escalation phase. If the response was observed in a dose cohort of the dose-escalation phase, dose expansion was started. The primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and adverse events assessed by investigators. Between April 13, 2016, and February 8, 2020, 64 ALK-positive NSCLC patients were enrolled, including 41 (64.1%) patients with ALK TKI-naïve and 23 (35.9%) patients who received crizotinib previously.

2548,"('Etomidate', 'R 16659', 'Hypnomidate', 'Amidate', 'Etomidato')",Medical,"Etomidate (USAN, INN, BAN; marketed as Amidate) is a short-acting intravenous anaesthetic agent used for the induction of general anaesthesia and sedation for short procedures such as reduction of dislocated joints, tracheal intubation, cardioversion and electroconvulsive therapy. It was developed at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1964 and was introduced as an intravenous agent in 1972 in Europe and in 1983 in the United States. The most common side effects include venous pain on injection and skeletal muscle movements. == Medical uses == === Sedation and anesthesia === In emergency settings, etomidate can be used as a sedative hypnotic agent. It is used for conscious sedation and as a part of a rapid sequence induction to induce anaesthesia. It is used as an anaesthetic agent since it has a rapid onset of action and a safe cardiovascular risk profile, and therefore is less likely to cause a significant drop in blood pressure than other induction agents. In addition, etomidate is often used because of its easy dosing profile, limited suppression of ventilation, lack of histamine liberation and protection from myocardial and cerebral ischemia. Thus, etomidate is a good induction agent for people who are hemodynamically unstable. Etomidate also has interesting characteristics for people with traumatic brain injury because it is one of the only anesthetic agents able to decrease intracranial pressure and maintain a normal arterial pressure. In those with sepsis, one dose of the medication does not appear to affect the risk of death. === Speech and memory test === Another use for etomidate is to determine speech lateralization in people prior to performing lobectomies to remove epileptogenic centres in the brain. This is called the etomidate speech and memory test, or eSAM, and is used at the Montreal Neurological Institute. However, only retrospective cohort studies support the use and safety of etomidate for this test. === Steroidogenesis inhibitor === In addition to its action and use as an anesthetic, etomidate has also been found to directly inhibit the enzymatic biosynthesis of steroid hormones, including corticosteroids in the adrenal gland. As the only adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor available for intravenous or parenteral administration, it is useful in situations in which rapid control of hypercortisolism is necessary or in which oral administration is unfeasible. == Use in executions == The U.S. state of Florida used the drug in a death penalty procedure when Mark James Asay, 53, was executed on August 24, 2017. He became the first person in the U.S. to be executed with etomidate as one of the drugs. Etomidate replaces midazolam as the sedative. Drug companies have made it harder to buy midazolam for executions. The etomidate was followed by rocuronium bromide, a paralytic, and finally, potassium acetate in place of the commonly used potassium chloride injection to stop the heart. Potassium acetate was first used for this purpose inadvertently in a 2015 execution in Oklahoma. == Adverse effects == Etomidate suppresses corticosteroid synthesis in the adrenal cortex by reversibly inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase, an enzyme important in adrenal steroid production; it leads to primary adrenal suppression. Using a continuous etomidate infusion for sedation of critically ill trauma patients in intensive care units has been associated with increased mortality due to adrenal suppression. Continuous intravenous administration of etomidate leads to adrenocortical dysfunction. The mortality of patients exposed to a continuous infusion of etomidate for more than 5 days increased from 25% to 44%, mainly due to infectious causes such as pneumonia. Because of etomidate-induced adrenal suppression, its use for patients with sepsis is controversial. Cortisol levels have been reported to be suppressed up to 72 hours after a single bolus of etomidate in this population at risk for adrenal insufficiency. For this reason, many authors have suggested that etomidate should never be used for critically ill patients with septic shock because it could increase mortality. However, other authors continue to defend etomidate's use for septic patients because of etomidate's safe hemodynamic profile and lack of clear evidence of harm. A study by Jabre et al. showed that a single dose of etomidate used for Rapid Sequence Induction prior to endrotracheal intubation has no effect on mortality compared to ketamine even though etomidate did cause transient adrenal suppression. In addition, a recent meta-analysis done by Hohl could not conclude that etomidate increased mortality. The authors of this meta-analysis concluded more studies were needed because of lack of statistical power to conclude definitively about the effect of etomidate on mortality. Thus, Hohl suggests a burden to prove etomidate is safe for use in septic patients, and more research is needed before it is used. Other authors advise giving a prophylactic dose of steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone) if etomidate is used, but only one small prospective controlled study in patients undergoing colorectal surgery has verified the safety of giving stress dose corticosteroids to all patients receiving etomidate. In a retrospective review of almost 32,000 people, etomidate, when used for the induction of anaesthesia, was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in the risk of dying compared with those given propofol. People given etomidate also had significantly greater odds of having cardiovascular morbidity and significantly longer hospital stay. Given the retrospective design of this study, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the data. In people with traumatic brain injury, etomidate use is associated with a blunting of an ACTH stimulation test. The clinical impact of this effect has yet to be determined. In addition, concurrent use of etomidate with opioids and/or benzodiazepines, is hypothesized to exacerbate etomidate-related adrenal insufficiency. However, only retrospective evidence of this effect exists and prospective studies are needed to measure the clinical impact of this interaction. Etomidate is associated with a high incidence of burning on injection, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and superficial thrombophlebitis (with rates higher than propofol). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === (R)-Etomidate is tenfold more potent than its (S)-enantiomer. At low concentrations (R)-etomidate is a modulator at GABAA receptors containing β2 and β3 subunits. At higher concentrations, it can elicit currents in the absence of GABA and behaves as an allosteric agonist. Its binding site is located in the transmembrane section of this receptor between the beta and alpha subunits (β+α−). β3-containing GABAA receptors are involved in the anesthetic actions of etomidate, while the β2-containing receptors are involved in some of the sedation and other actions that can be elicited by this drug. === Pharmacokinetics === At the typical dose, anesthesia is induced for the duration of about 5–10 minutes, though the half-life of drug metabolism is about 75 minutes, because etomidate is redistributed from the plasma to other tissues. Onset of action: 30–60 seconds Peak effect: 1 minute Duration: 3–5 minutes; terminated by redistribution Distribution: Vd: 2–4.5 L/kg Protein binding: 76% Metabolism: Hepatic and plasma esterases Half-life distribution: 2.7 minutes Half-life redistribution: 29 minutes Half-life elimination: 2.9 to 5.3 hours == Metabolism == Etomidate is highly protein-bound in blood plasma and is metabolised by hepatic and plasma esterases to inactive products. It exhibits a biexponential decline. == Formulation == Etomidate is usually presented as a clear colourless solution for injection containing 2 mg/mL of etomidate in an aqueous solution of 35% propylene glycol, although a lipid emulsion preparation (of equivalent strength) has also been introduced. Etomidate was originally formulated as a racemic mixture, but the R form is substantially more active than its enantiomer. It was later reformulated as a single-enantiomer drug, becoming the first general anesthetic in that class to be used clinically. == Use as recreational drug == Etomidate has been made into an e-cigarette liquid known as space oil (Chinese: 太空油) in Hong Kong or kpod in Singapore. It may also be mixed with other drugs, including cannabis and ketamine. === Hong Kong === Etomidate is regulated as Part 1 poison under the Pharmacy and Poisons Regulations (Cap. 138A), which states that possessing etomidate without provisions is punishable by a fine of up to HK$100,000 and imprisonment for two years. Due to the increasing imports of space oil, the 2024 Policy Address has stated that the control of etomidate will be tightened. Etomidate will be classed as a controlled drug on 14 February 2025 by the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (Cap. 134), which states that illegal possession or smoking, inhaling, ingesting and injecting space oil is liable to a maximum penalty of imprisonment of seven years and a fine of HK$1,000,000, while trafficking or illegal importing etomidate is liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5,000,000. === Singapore === In Singapore, etomidate is classified as a poison under the Poisons Act. Sellers can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years and/or fined up to $10,000. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Etomidate"". Drug Information Portal.

2549,"('Nevirapine', 'Bi-rg 587', 'Viramune', 'Bi-rg-587', 'Nevirapine anhydrous')",Medical,"Nevirapine (NVP), sold under the brand name Viramune among others, is a medication used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS, specifically HIV-1. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretroviral medications. It may be used to prevent mother to child spread during birth but is not recommended following other exposures. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, headache, nausea, feeling tired, and liver problems. The liver problems and skin rash may be severe and should be checked for during the first few months of treatment. It appears to be safe for use during pregnancy. It is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and works by blocking the function of reverse transcriptase. Nevirapine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Nevirapine is used in people six years of age and older infected with HIV-1 as part of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART or cART). Monotherapy with nevirapine is not indicated due to rapid emergence of resistance. Nevirapine in triple combination therapy has been shown to suppress viral load effectively when used as initial antiretroviral therapy (i.e., in antiretroviral-naive patients). Some clinical trials have demonstrated comparable HIV suppression with nevirapine-based regimens to that achieved with regimens based on a protease inhibitor (PI) or efavirenz. This drug is generally only to be considered for use if the CD4 cell count is very low. Although concerns have been raised about nevirapine-based regimens in those starting therapy with high viral load or low CD4 count, some analyses suggest that nevirapine may be effective in this group of people. Nevirapine may also form a useful component of salvage regimens after virological failure, usually in combination with one or more PIs as well as nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs), especially in those who have not previously taken an NNRTI. Dosing in children is based on body surface area (BSA), however, weight-based dosing algorithms have been released. These guidelines include dosing algorithms for as young as newborn babies. === Preventing mother-to-child transmission === Although a single dose of nevirapine given to both mother and child reduced the rate of HIV transmission by almost 50% compared with a very short course of zidovudine (AZT) prophylaxis, in a clinical trial in Uganda, that trial was found in an Associated Press investigation to be riddled with ""sloppy recordkeeping"" and possibly fraud. A subsequent study in Thailand showed that prophylaxis with single-dose nevirapine in addition to zidovudine is more effective than zidovudine alone. These and other trials have led the World Health Organization to endorse the use of single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis in many developing world settings as a cost-effective way of reducing mother-to-child transmission. However, in the United States the Ugandan study was deemed flawed and as of 2006 the FDA has not approved of such nevirapine prophylaxis. However, supporters of HIVNET 012 experiment argued that the flaws in this experiment were largely due to bureaucratic incompetence, while the findings regarding the safety and efficacy of single-dose nevirapine from this study were scientifically solid and too important to discard. Moreover, it was argued that holding African researchers who operated under resource-poor situations to the same moral and procedural standards to their Western counterparts was unrealistic, and would further marginalize African researchers' role in the science community and impede the progress of African science. Another clinical trial, Using Nevirapine to Prevent Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission During Breastfeeding, was completed in September 2013. A major concern with this approach is that NNRTI resistance mutations are commonly observed in both mothers and infants after single-dose nevirapine, and may compromise the response to future NNRTI-containing regimens. A short course of maternal Lamivudine/zidovudine is recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service Task Force to reduce this risk. === Nonoccupational Post-Exposure Prophylaxis === Nevirapine is contraindicated for non-occupational post-exposure-prophylaxis including for pregnant and nonpregnant women due to severe liver toxicity. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effect of nevirapine is the development of mild or moderate rash (13%). Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been observed in 1.5% of patients, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity. Nevirapine may cause severe or life-threatening liver toxicity, usually emerging in the first six weeks of treatment. In 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning on nevirapine, warning that it could cause life-threatening liver toxicity and skin reactions. Unacceptably high risk of serious liver symptoms in certain patient groups (women with CD4 count >250 and men >400) has led the U.S. DHHS to recommend the restriction of nevirapine use to those at lower risk, unless the benefit to the patient clearly outweighs the risk; although in the 2NN study which found these CD4 limits, the effect was seen only in patients recruited from Thailand. More recent studies on the use of Nevirapine in people with higher CD4 cell counts have come to the following conclusion: Treatment-experienced patients who start NVP-based combination therapy with low pre–ART and high current CD4 cell counts and an undetectable VL have a similar likelihood for discontinuing NVP therapy because of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), compared with treatment-naive patients with low CD4 cell counts. This suggests that NVP-based combination therapy may be safely initiated in such patients. However, in similar patients with a detectable VL, it is prudent to continue to adhere to current CD4 cell count thresholds. The U.S. Public Health Service Task Force advocates caution in the use of nevirapine in pregnancy due to toxicity issues, which may be exacerbated during pregnancy. Cases of immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution have also been observed with this drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends stopping nevirapine if a person experiences: sign and symptoms of liver issues such as hepatitis increased transaminases in addition to rash or systemic symptoms formation of rash with systemic symptoms severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions Additionally, the U.S. FDA recommends close monitoring during the first 6 weeks of therapy for the above symptoms as there is high risk during this time. Continued monitoring is recommended for up to the first 18 weeks of treatment. If a patient experiences hepatitis plus rash or other systemic symptoms, or severe hypersensitivity or skin rash, nevirapine should not be restarted. == Drug interactions == Nevirapine is a substrate for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes. Concomitant administration of drugs that are inhibitors of these enzymes may increase serum nevirapine levels significantly. Some examples of these drugs include ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fluconazole. On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as rifampicin may lower serum nevirapine levels.[18] In addition, concomitant use of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum, which has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP1A2) or St. John's wort containing products may significantly lower nevirapine levels. Nevirapine is an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. It may reduce levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals efavirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, as well as clarithromycin, ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone. == Mechanism of action == Nevirapine falls in the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class of antiretrovirals. Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RTIs inhibit the same target, the reverse transcriptase enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Unlike nucleoside RTIs, which bind at the polymerase active site, NNRTIs bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the subdomain of p66 which is about 10 angstrom away from the active site (known as the NNRTI pocket). Therefore, this NNRTI-binding pocket will inhibit reverse transcription in a way that is distinct to the NRTIs. Nevirapine is not effective against HIV-2, as the pocket of the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase has a different structure, which confers intrinsic resistance to the NNRTI class. Resistance to nevirapine develops rapidly if viral replication is not completely suppressed. The most common mutations observed after nevirapine treatment are Y181C and K103N, which are also observed with other NNRTIs. As all NNRTIs bind within the same pocket, viral strains which are resistant to nevirapine are usually also resistant to the other NNRTIs, efavirenz and delavirdine. However, second generation NNRTIs like rilpivirine and etravirine are effective in treatment for HIV strains resistant to nevirapine and other first generation drugs in that same class. == History == Nevirapine was discovered by Karl D. Hargrave and colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Boehringer Ingelheim group of companies. It is covered by U.S. Patent 5,366,972 Archived 2018-09-20 at the Wayback Machine and corresponding foreign patents. Nevirapine was the first NNRTI approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was approved June 21, 1996 for adults and September 11, 1998, for children. It was also approved in Europe in 1997. == Society and culture == Former U.S. President George W. Bush's PEPFAR funding of $500 million to help combat the African AIDS epidemic included nevirapine, among other medications and programs. In South Africa, the Treatment Action Campaign successfully sued the government over its failure to make nevirapine widely available. In Minister of Health v Treatment Action Campaign the Constitutional Court of South Africa ordered the government to immediately ""remove the restrictions that prevent Nevirapine from being made available for the purpose of reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV at public hospitals and clinics that are not research and training sites [and] permit and facilitate the use of Nevirapine for the purpose of reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and to make it available for this purpose at hospitals and clinics when in the judgement of the attending medical practitioner acting in consultation with the medical superintendent of the facility concerned this is medically indicated, which shall if necessary include that the mother concerned has been appropriately tested and counselled."" == References ==",Viramune,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.764281842042692e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00022027450904715806)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/viramune.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevirapine,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/viramune ', [])"

It is an antispasmodic, which is useful to treat the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by reducing abdominal spasms (colic), bloating, pain, and gut motility. It is an antimuscarinic and calcium channel blocker used to relieve spasmodic pain of the gut, especially in irritable bowel syndrome. This means it works in the gut themselves, by relaxing the small muscles of the intestines, which results in relieving cramps and therefore reduces pain. == Medical uses == A pooled analysis of three clinical trials suggest that otilonium bromide is more effective than placebo for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. == Pharmacology == Otilonium bromide binds to both muscarinic receptors and tachykinin NK2 receptors. It has been shown to inhibit L-type and T-type calcium channels, actions which may contribute to or determine its effects in the gut. When taken orally, very little of the drug is absorbed into the rest of the body, which means that most of its actions remain confined to the gastrointestinal system. == Adverse effects == Otilonium bromide is generally well tolerated and does not have the side-effects observed with similar classes of drugs.

2551,"('Su 3327', 'Halicin', 'Compound 9 [pmid: 19271755]')",Medical,"Halicin (SU-3327) is an experimental drug that acts as an enzyme inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Originally, it was researched for the treatment of diabetes, but development was discontinued for this application due to poor results in testing. In 2019, this molecule was found by an artificial intelligence (AI) model to show antibiotic properties against a number of bacteria. == History == Halicin was previously known as SU-3327, developed by a group of researchers from Burnham Institute for Medical Research, United States in 2009 for investigations into diabetes treatment. Researchers named the molecule after the fictional artificial intelligence system Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey. === Antibiotic properties === Halicin was identified by artificial intelligence researchers, including bioengineer James Collins, at the MIT Jameel Clinic in 2019 using an in silico deep learning approach, as a likely broad-spectrum antibiotic. The process took just three days. This likelihood was verified by in vitro cell culture testing, followed by in vivo tests in mice. It showed activity against drug-resistant strains of Clostridiodes difficile, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with an unusual mechanism of action involving the sequestration of iron inside the bacterial cells, that thereby interferes with their ability to regulate the pH balance across the cell membrane properly. Since this is a different mode of action from most antibiotics, halicin retained activity against bacterial strains resistant to many commonly used drugs. Preliminary studies suggest that halicin kills bacteria by disrupting their ability to maintain an electrochemical gradient across their cell membranes. This gradient is necessary, among other functions, to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP, molecules that cells use to store and transfer energy), so if the gradient breaks down, the cells die. This type of killing mechanism could be difficult for bacteria to develop resistance to. == References == == External links == Machine Learning for Antibiotics",Halicin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.029752103611826897), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0020574608352035284), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03807802125811577)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halicin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=6, title='Halicin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halicin?utm_source=openai')])"
2552,"('Aminooxyacetic acid hemihydrochloride', 'Carboxymethoxylamine hemihydrochloride', 'Aminooxyacetic acid', '(aminooxy)acetic acid', 'Aminooxy-acetic acid')",Medical,"Aminooxyacetic acid, often abbreviated AOA or AOAA, is a compound that inhibits 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GABA-T) activity in vitro and in vivo, leading to less gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) being broken down. Subsequently, the level of GABA is increased in tissues. At concentrations high enough to fully inhibit 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase activity, aminooxyacetic acid is indicated as a useful tool to study regional GABA turnover in rats. Aminooxyacetic acid is a general inhibitor of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes (this includes GABA-T). It functions as an inhibitor by attacking the Schiff base linkage between PLP and the enzyme, forming oxime type complexes. Aminooxyacetic acid inhibits aspartate aminotransferase, another PLP-dependent enzyme, which is an essential part of the malate-aspartate shuttle. The inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle prevents the reoxidation of cytosolic NADH by the mitochondria in nerve terminals. Also in the nerve terminals, aminooxyacetic acid prevents the mitochondria from utilizing pyruvate generated from glycolysis, thus leading to a bioenergetic state similar to that of hypoglycemia. Aminooxyacetic acid has been shown to cause excitotoxic lesions of the striatum, similar to Huntington's disease, potentially due to its impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Aminooxyacetic acid was previously used in a clinical trial to reduce symptoms of Huntington's disease by increasing GABA levels in the brain. However, the patients who received the aminooxyacetic acid treatment failed to show clinical improvement and suffered from side effects such as drowsiness, ataxia, seizures, and psychosis when the dosage was increased beyond 2 mg per kilogram per day. Also, the inhibition of aspartate aminotransferase by aminooxyacetic acid has clinical implications for the treatment of breast cancer, since a decrease in glycolysis disrupts breast adenocarcinoma cells more than normal cells. Aminooxyacetic acid has been studied as a treatment for tinnitus. One study showed that about 20% of patients with tinnitus had a decrease in its severity when treated with aminooxyacetic acid. However, about 70% of those patients reported side effects, mostly nausea and disequilibrium. Thus, the investigators of the study concluded that the incidence of the side effects makes aminooxyacetic acid unsuitable to treat tinnitus. Aminooxyacetic acid also has anticonvulsant properties. At high dosages, it can act as a convulsant agent in mice and rats. Aminooxyacetic acid can also inhibit 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase preventing ethylene synthesis, which can increase the vase life of cut flowers. == History == Aminooxyacetic acid was first described by Werner in 1893, and was prepared by the hydrolysis of ethylbenzhydroximinoacetic acid. In 1936, Anchel and Shoenheimer used aminooxyacetic acid to isolate ketones from natural sources. Also in 1936, Kitagawa and Takani described the preparation of aminooxyacetic acid by the condensation of benzhydroxamic acid and ethyl bromoacetate, followed by hydrolysis by hydrochloric acid. == References ==",(aminooxy)acetic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.34128740429878235)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.01623481512069702), ('ICAL', -2.9802276912960224e-06), (',', -0.10025079548358917), ('ĠINDU', -0.025504395365715027), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014210108667612076)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.002054381649941206)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminooxyacetic_acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=95, start_index=6, title='Aminooxyacetic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminooxyacetic_acid?utm_source=openai')])"

It is in a class of drugs known as podophyllotoxin derivatives and slows the growth of cancer cells in the body. == Medical uses == Teniposide is used for the treatment of a number of cancer types in children. In the US, it is approved for the second-line therapy of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in combination with other antineoplastic drugs. In Europe, it is also approved for the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma, generalized malignant lymphoma, reticulocyte sarcoma, acute leukaemia, primary brain tumours (glioblastoma, ependymoma, astrocytoma), bladder cancer, neuroblastoma and other solid tumours in children. === Administration === The medication is injected though a vein and burns if it leaks under the skin. It can be used in combination with other anticancer drugs. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation, in patients with severe liver or kidney impairment or severely impaired haematopoiesis. == Side effects == Teniposide, when used with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of ALL, results in severe bone marrow suppression. Other common side effects include gastrointestinal toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, and reversible alopecia. == Interactions == No systematic interaction studies are available. The enzyme inducers phenobarbital and phenytoin have been found to lower its blood plasma concentrations. Theoretically possible interactions include increased plasma concentrations when combined with sodium salicylate, sulfamethizole or tolbutamide, which displace teniposide from plasma protein binding, at least in vitro. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Teniposide causes dose-dependent single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA and DNA-protein cross-links. The substance has been found to act as an inhibitor of topoisomerase II (an enzyme that aids in DNA unwinding), since it does not intercalate into DNA or bind strongly to DNA. The cytotoxic effects of teniposide are related to the relative number of double-stranded DNA breaks produced in cells, which are a reflection of the stabilization of a topoisomerase II-DNA intermediate. == Chemistry == Teniposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin from the rhizome of the wild mandrake (Podophyllum peltatum). More specifically, it is a glycoside of podophyllotoxin with a D-glucose derivative. It is chemically similar to the anti-cancer drug etoposide, being distinguished only by a thienyl rest where etoposide has a methyl.

Several studies of thiopeptide biosynthesis have been contemporarily published in 2009 and two of them (Liao et al. and Kelly et al.) included the similar biosynthesis of thiostrepton: it's ribosomally synthesized from thiostrepton biosynthetic genes (tsr genes) and posttranslational modification is needed. A total synthesis of thiostrepton was completed by K.C. Nicolaou, et al. in 2004. == Applications == Thiostrepton has been used in veterinary medicine in mastitis caused by gram-negative organisms and in dermatologic disorders. It is mostly used in complex ointments containing neomycin, nystatin, Thiostrepton and topical steroids. It is also active against gram-positive bacteria. It is notable that ointments for human usage contain neomycin, nystatin, and topical steroids, but no thiostrepton. Thiostrepton was reported (in 2008) to exhibit activity against breast cancer cells through targeting the transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), also in 2011. It has also been shown to circumvent acquired cisplatin resistance in breast cancer cells under in vitro conditions. Thiostrepton is used in molecular biology as a reagent for both positive and negative selection of genes involved in nucleotide metabolism. Thiostrepton has also shown promise in treating osteoporosis in animal models because it can inhibit unusual osteoclast precursor cells. The antibiotic thiostrepton was identified as an insulin resistance reversal agent. Subsequent validation in ex vivo insulin-resistant mouse muscle and palmitate-induced insulin-resistant myotubes demonstrated potent insulin action restoration, possibly via upregulation of glycolysis due to attenuation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by thiostrepton. == Effects of thiostrepton on stringent response == Thiostrepton binds to the L11 protein of the large ribosomal subunit. Mutations in this protein confer resistance to this metabolite. The L11 protein is also essential for regulating the RelA protein and activating the synthesis of the cellular alarmone (p)ppGpp, which, in turn, triggers the stringent response and antibiotic synthesis. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions in the L11 protein that confer resistance to thiostrepton also inhibit the stringent response in strains belonging to the Streptomyces genus. A similar mechanism has been observed in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, where thiostrepton reduces the synthesis of (p)ppGpp, inhibiting the activation of the persistence. Persistence is a mechanism that allows bacteria to survive antibiotic treatments and other stressors by enabling a subpopulation of bacteria to become metabolically inactive. == Biosynthesis == There are total 21 genes (tsrA~tsrU) in the biosynthetic gene cluster. The precursor of thiostrepton contains 58 amino acids in the peptide chain, which includes 41-aa leader peptide (LP) and 17-aa structural peptide (IASASCTTCICTCSCSS). Once the precursor is synthesized, cyclodehydratase tsrO and dehydrogenase tsrM catalyze the formation of thiazole or thiazoline from every cysteine residues in the peptide chain. After thiazole/thiazoline formation, dehydratases tsrJ, K and S then convert all the serine residues into dehydroalanines. A hetero Diels-Alder cyclization of the central dehydropiperidine (at S5, C13, and S14) has been suggested by Bycroft back to 1978 and been employed in the chemical synthesis of this core structure by Nicolaou et al. in 2005. An alternative mechanism of the dehydropiperidine formation has also been suggested by Kelly et al. in 2009. Nevertheless, based on experimental evidence, tsrN and L are suggested to be responsible for the hetero Diels-Alder cyclization. The quinaldic acid moiety is suggested to be synthesized by the nine genes tsrFAEBDUPQI from tryptophan and then results in the closure of quinaldic acid macrocycle. At last, tsrR serves as a candidate for the oxidation of the Ile residue to afford thiostrepton. === Alternative mechanism for the formation of the dehydropiperidine core === == Total synthesis == In 2005, Nicolaou et al. published the total synthesis of thiostrepton. At first, they constructed the key building blocks of thiostrepton (1): dehydropiperidine core (2), thiazoline macrocycle (3), bis-dehydroalanine tail (4), and quinaldic acid macrocycle (5). Then they assembled the building blocks sequentially as shown in the synthetic scheme (compound numbers are from the reference). === Building blocks === === Synthetic scheme === == References ==",Thiostrepton,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0009061029995791614), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0486038476228714), (' INDUSTR', -0.011284071020781994), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.006419513374567032), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.20144441723823547), ('ĠINDU', -0.008098858408629894), ('ST', -3.540453326422721e-05), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002483856864273548)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6943738/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39487942/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11395809/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6709454/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7469540/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31262758/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21245445/ ', [])"

It is made up of 3 ring subunits: 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS), neosamine C, and ribose. Ribostamycin, along with other aminoglycosides with the DOS subunit, is an important broad-spectrum antibiotic with important use against human immunodeficiency virus and is considered a critically important antimicrobial by the World Health Organization., Resistance against aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as ribostamycin, is a growing concern. The resistant bacteria contain enzymes that modify the structure through phosphorylation, adenylation, and acetylation and prevent the antibiotic from being able to interact with the bacterial ribosomal RNAs. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of ribostamycin begins with the sugar D-glucose, which is phosphorylated at the 6 position to form glucose-6-phosphate. The enzyme rbmA contains a genetic sequence that corresponds to NAD+ binding and catalyzes the formation of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose. The enzyme rmbB then catalyzes the transamination of 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosamine with L-glutamine and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Enzyme rbmC oxidizes the ring to 2-deoxy-3-amino-scyllo-inosose, which is then transaminated by enzyme rmbB to DOS. DOS is then glycosylated by the glycosyltransferase rmbD with uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-Glc-NAc) to form 2’-N-acetylparomamine. The deacetylase racJ removes the acetyl group and forms paromamine. Paromamine is oxidized by enzyme rbmG and then enzyme rmbH transaminates to produce neamine. Neamine is then ribosylated to form ribostamycin. == References ==",Ribostamycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008659188752062619), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023277008906006813)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.47407791018486023), (' INDUSTR', -0.0007102862582542002), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03615?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Ribostamycin: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB03615?utm_source=openai')])"

The most common side effects are pain, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting and constipation. People taking tazemetostat are at increased risk of developing secondary malignancies including: T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (a type of blood cancer that affects the lymphatic system usually found in the lymph nodes), myelodysplastic syndrome (a disorder resulting from poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells) and acute myeloid leukemia (a cancer of the blood and bone marrow). Tazemetostat is a cancer drug that acts as a potent selective EZH2 inhibitor. Tazemetostat blocks activity of the EZH2 methyltransferase, which may help keep the cancer cells from growing. Most cases of epithelioid sarcoma begin in the soft tissue under the skin of an extremity, though it can start in other areas of the body. Surgical removal is considered the main treatment when the cancer is localized to one area of the body. Chemotherapy or radiation may also be given. However, there is a high likelihood for local and regional spread of the disease even with treatment and approximately 50% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Metastatic disease is considered life-threatening to the patient. According to the NCI Drug Dictionary, ""tazemetostat is an orally available, small molecule selective and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) competitive inhibitor of histone methyl transferase EZH2, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, tazemetostat selectively inhibits the activity of both wild-type and mutated forms of EZH2. Inhibition of EZH2 specifically prevents the methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). This decrease in histone methylation alters gene expression patterns associated with cancer pathways and results in decreased tumor cell proliferation in EZH2 mutated cancer cells. EZH2, which belongs to the class of histone methyltransferases (HMTs), is overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cells and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation."" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == History == The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tazemetostat in January 2020, based on the results of a clinical trial (NCT02601950) enrolling 62 subjects with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma. During the clinical trial, subjects received 800 milligrams (mg) of tazemetostat twice a day until the disease progressed or the subject reached an unacceptable level of toxicity. Tumor response assessments were performed every eight weeks during the clinical trial. The trial measured how many subjects experienced complete or partial shrinkage (by a certain amount) of their tumors during treatment (overall response rate). The overall response rate was 15%, with 1.6% of subjects having a complete response and 13% having a partial response. Of the nine subjects that had a response, six (67%) subjects had a response lasting six months or longer. The trial was conducted at 22 sites in France, United Kingdom, Taiwan, Italy, Canada, Belgium, and the United States.

2558,"('Carbetocin', 'Carbetocino', 'Carbetocinum', 'Carbetocinum [inn-latin]', 'Carbetocino [inn-spanish]')",Medical,"Carbetocin, sold under the brand names Pabal among others, is a medication used to prevent excessive bleeding after childbirth, particularly following Cesarean section. It appears to work as well as oxytocin. Due to it being less economical than other options, use is not recommended by NHS Scotland. It is given by injection into a vein or muscle. Side effects differ little from that of no treatment or placebo. Use is not recommended in people with epilepsy or eclampsia. Carbetocin is a manufactured long acting form of oxytocin. It works by activating the oxytocin receptor which causes the uterus to contract. Carbetocin was first described in 1974. It was approved for medical use in Canada and the United Kingdom in 1997. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not available in the United States or Japan. == Medical uses == Carbetocin has been approved for use immediately following an elective Cesarean section when a local or spinal anesthesia has been used. Since the uterus cannot contract on its own following incision during a Cesarean section, exogenous administration of oxytocin or an analog is necessary to restore uterine tone and prevent hemorrhage. Safety of carbetocin following vaginal births and emergency Cesarean sections has not been established, though studies have suggested efficacy following vaginal births to that following Cesarean sections. Some studies have shown that a 10-70 ug dose following vaginal delivery caused contractions and no adverse side effects. Carbetocin has also been shown to increase uterine involution (the return of the uterus to its contracted state after the birth of the baby) in humans, horses and cows. === Comparison with other medication === In 2018, heat-stable carbetocin, a formulation that does not require strict refrigeration, was found to be as good as oxytocin for reduction of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery. It is hoped that this will make oxytocic hemorrhage control more widely available and less expensive, which will be particularly useful in regions of developing countries where the cold chain (in drug transport and storage) is unreliable because of power outages or equipment problems. Due to carbetocin's considerably longer half-life, its effects are longer lasting than other oxytocin homologs such as oxytocin or barusiban. A single carbetocin dose compared to a placebo or an eight-hour intravenous drip of oxytocin in a randomized blind study, necessitated less additional oxytocin therapy following a Cesarean section. Oxytocin receptor antagonists, such as barusiban or atosiban have the opposite effect of depressing oxytocin receptor activity and can be used to stop premature labor and uterine contractions. == Adverse effects == Ten to forty percent of people will experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, itching skin, increased body temperature, trembling and weakness. One to five percent of peoples may experience back and chest pain, dizziness, anemia, chills and sweating, metallic taste, tachycardia and respiratory distress. Contraindications for the use of carbetocin include inappropriate timing during labor and delivery (such as before parturition or to induce labor) or allergic reactions to carbetocin or other oxytocin homologues. Additionally, carbetocin should not be used if a person has high blood pressure or cardiovascular problems. Overdosage or repeated use of carbetocin, particularly if used during pregnancy, could cause hyper-excitation of the oxytocin receptors resulting in excessive and prolonged stimulation of uterine contractions, increasing risk of uterine rupture, placental abruption, fetal respiratory distress and postpartum hemorrhage. == Interactions == Due to oxytocin's close sequence homology with vasopressin, oxytocin analogs often bind with much lower affinity to vasopressin receptors V1, in the uterine lining, and V2, in the kidneys and may consequently interact with or disrupt the vasopressin circuitry and feedback loops. Carbetocin may work synergistically with drugs such as dinoprostone and misoprostol that ripen the cervix. Concurrent use of these drugs can be risky, particularly during pregnancy and prenatal care, possibly causing premature labor or abortion. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Carbetocin works as an oxytocic, antihemorrhagic and uterotonic drug in the peripheral nervous system. The most common causes of postpartum hemorrhage are lack of tone in the uterus from overstretching or the use of an anesthetic. Carbetocin functions as an agonist at peripheral oxytocin receptors, particularly in the myometrium, with lesser affinity for myoepithelial cells. Oxytocin receptors are G protein-coupled and their mechanism of action involves second messengers and the production of inositol phosphates. Carbetocin mimics this mechanism. Binding for carbetocin and other oxytocin agonists has been shown to be nonselective at the extracellular N-terminus and loops E2 and E3. While the oxytocin receptor shows equal affinity for oxytocin and carbetocin, the biological effect of carbetocin is almost 50% that of endogenous or exogenous oxytocin. Carbetocin has a much longer lasting effect than oxytocin, necessitating only a single dose. Carbetocin inhibits endogenous oxytocin release, interrupting the uterine feedback loop with the hypothalamus and decreasing both central and peripheral release of oxytocin. Carbetocin is a biased agonist of the oxytocin receptor. During pregnancy, the synthesis of oxytocin receptors in the uterus greatly increases, reaching a peak during labor and delivery. Consequently, the administration of carbetocin or another oxytocin analog during or immediately following birth will have increased uterotonic and contractile effect. The application of carbetocin does not affect a non-pregnant uterus with lower oxytocin receptor expression. Carbetocin also functions to thicken the blood, further preventing post-partum hemorrhage. Carbetocin should not be used to induce or augment labor since it could cause cardiac or respiratory distress to mother or infant. === Pharmacokinetics === Carbetocin is to be used in the hospital by prescription only. It can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. In both cases, the recommended dose for an average adult female is 100 ug. Contractile effects of the uterus are apparent within two minutes and can be observed for approximately one hour, though maximum binding occurs about 30 minutes after intramuscular injection. Administration is performed immediately following parturition to minimize risk of postpartum hemorrhage by inducing uterine contractions, increasing muscle tone and thickening the blood. If further uterine stimulation is needed, treatment with other forms of oxytocic uterotonic drugs should be used. Endogenous and synthetic oxytocin has a half-life of approximately 3.5 minutes. Carbetocin, in comparison, has a much longer half-life ranging from 85 to 100 minutes. The bioavailable dose is around 80%. The elimination half-life following intravenous administration is around 40 minutes, though the elimination mechanism is not entirely known. Studies have shown that elimination is only minimally renal (0.7%), but may occur at least partially through enzymatic degradation of peptides, primarily on the C-terminal end. Both elimination and volume of distribution are not dose dependent. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Carbetocin has been approved for use under the following three brand names in 23 countries: Duratocin (Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Italy, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand), Lonactene (Mexico), and Pabal (Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Estonia, France, UK, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Finland).

It was launched in 1995, under the brand name Landel (ランデル). The drug blocks both T-type and L-type calcium channels. Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved the use of efonidipine in India. It is launched under the brand name ""Efnocar"" (Zuventus Health care ltd, India). == Structure Activity Relationship == Efonidipine is a dual Calcium Channel Blocker (L & T-type). It has a unique chemical structure. The phosphonate moiety (Figure 1) at the C5 position of the dihydropyridine ring is considered to be important for the characteristic pharmacological profile of the drug. (figure-1) == Mechanism of action == Efonidipine, a new generation dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blocker, inhibits both L-type and T-type calcium channels. === Pharmacodynamics === Efonidipine exhibits antihypertensive effect through vasodilatation by blocking L-type and T-type calcium channels. Efonidipine has a negative chronotropic effect. Working on sino atrial node cells by inhibiting T-type calcium channel activation, Efonidipine prolongs the late phase-4 depolarization of the sino atrial node action potential and suppresses an elevated HR. The negative chronotropic effect of Efonidipine decreases heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand and increases coronary blood flow. Efonidipine increases coronary blood flow by blocking L & T-type calcium channels and attenuates myocardial ischaemia. By reducing synthesis and secretion of aldosterone, Efonidipine prevents hypertrophy and remodeling of cardiac myocytes. Efonidipine increases glomerular filtration rate without increasing intra-glomerular pressure and filtration fraction. This prevents hypertension induced renal damage. Efonidipine prevents Rho-kinase and NF-κB induced renal parenchymal fibrosis and provides long term renal protection. Efonidipine enhances sodium excretion from the kidneys by suppressing aldosterone synthesis and secretion from the adrenal glands. Aldosterone induced renal parenchymal fibrosis is suppressed by Efonidipine. Efonidipine prevents NF-κB induced hypertrophy and inflammation in the renal vasculature and protects the kidneys. Efonidipine lowers blood pressure in cerebral resistance vessels and prevents hypertension induced brain damage. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Peak plasma concentration is achieved in about 1.5 to 3.67 hours after administration. Half life is approximately 4 hours. The pharmacokinetic parameters of Efonidipine are depicted in Table-1. Table 1: PK Parameters in Adult Healthy Male Subjects === Metabolism === Efonidipine is primarily metabolized in the liver. The important metabolites are N-dephenylated Efonidipine (DPH), deaminated Efonidipine (AL) and N-debenzylated Efonidipine (DBZ). DBZ and DPH exhibit activity as calcium antagonists. The vasodilating properties of DBZ and DPH were about two-thirds and one-third respectively than that of the parent compound. Results suggest that the majority of the pharmacological effect after oral dosing of Efonidipine hydrochloride in man is due to unchanged compound and its metabolites make a small contribution to the pharmacological effect. === Elimination === Biliary route is the main pathway of excretion. No significant amount of unchanged drug was excreted in urine. In the urine collected for 24 h after an oral dosing, 1.1 % of the dose was excreted as deaminated Efonidipine, and 0.5% as a pyridine analogue of deaminated Efonidipine. == Indications == Essential hypertension and renal parenchymal hypertension Angina == Contraindications == Contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Efonidipine or any of the excipients It is also contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation. == Precautions == Should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment Dose adjustment may be required in elderly as hypotension can occur Efonidipine may worsen clinical condition in patients with sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest or sinus node dysfunction As dizziness can occur due to hypotensive action, one should be careful while operating machines, with aerial work platforms and driving of a motor vehicle Drug should not be stopped abruptly. Discontinuation should be gradual and under supervision of a qualified physician == Drug Interactions == Other anti-hypertensive agents: Efonidipine enhances the antihypertensive action additively and may produce hypotension and shock. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly to adjust dose of concomitant drugs. Cimetidine: Cimetidine inhibits CYP450 enzymes involved in metabolism of CCBs. Blood concentration of calcium channel antagonists increase leading to higher incidence of side effects (hot flushes). Grape fruit juice: Grapefruit juice suppresses enzymes metabolizing calcium channel antagonists (cytochrome P450) and reduces the clearance. Thus, there is a possibility that blood concentration of the drug may increase and the anti-hypertensive effect is enhanced. Tacrolimus: Efonidipine inhibits metabolic enzymes involved in Tacrolimus metabolism and reduces its clearance. So, increase in blood concentration of Tacrolimus can occur. == Adverse Drug Reactions == The common side effects are hot flushes, facial flushing and headache. In addition, elevation in serum total cholesterol, ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT) and BUN may occur. Frequent urination, pedal edema, increased triglycerides occurs in less than 0.1%. === Lesser incidence of pedal edema (< 0.1%) === One common adverse effect of the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers like Amlodipine is vasodilatory Pedal edema. Combined L-/T-type Ca2+ channel blockers, such as Efonidipine, display antihypertensive efficacy similar to their predecessors (Amlodipine) with much less propensity of pedal edema formation. Efonidipine equalizes the hydrostatic pressure across the capillary bed through equal arteriolar and venular dilatation, thus reducing vasodilatory edema. These incremental microcirculatory benefits of efonidipine over the conventional L-type Ca2+ channel blockers (Amlodipine) are likely attributed to their additional T-type Ca2+ channel blocking properties and the increased presence of T-type Ca2+channels in the microvasculature (e.g. arterioles, capillaries, venules etc.). Among the CCBs, Efonidipine (<0.1%) has lowest incidence of pedal edema compared to amlodipine ( 5-16%), cilnidipine (5%), benidipine (5%) == Use in special population == === Administration to elderly === The drug should be started at low dose (20 mg/day) in elderly. Patient should be carefully observed for development of hypo-tension. Dose may be halved if there is intolerance to the 20 mg/day dosage regimen. === Pregnancy and lactation === The drug should not be administered to pregnant women and women suspected of being pregnant. Administration to lactating women should be avoided unless benefit significantly surpasses the risk to the child. Mothers on Efonidipine treatment should avoid breast feeding. === Pediatric use === Safety of Efonidipine in low birth weight infants, newborns, infants and children has not been established. == References == == Further reading ==",Efonidipine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.47952248173533e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004351384413894266)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efonidipine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Efonidipine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efonidipine?utm_source=openai')])"
2560,"('Erythromycin ethylsuccinate', 'Erythromycin ethyl succinate', 'Pediamycin', 'Eryped', 'Wyamycin e')",Medical,"Erythromycin is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes respiratory tract infections, skin infections, chlamydia infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and syphilis. It may also be used during pregnancy to prevent Group B streptococcal infection in the newborn, and to improve delayed stomach emptying. It can be given intravenously and by mouth. An eye ointment is routinely recommended after delivery to prevent eye infections in the newborn. Common side effects include abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. More serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile colitis, liver problems, prolonged QT, and allergic reactions. It is generally safe in those who are allergic to penicillin. Erythromycin also appears to be safe to use during pregnancy. While generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding, its use by the mother during the first two weeks of life may increase the risk of pyloric stenosis in the baby. This risk also applies if taken directly by the baby during this age. It is in the macrolide family of antibiotics and works by decreasing bacterial protein production. Erythromycin was first isolated in 1952 from the bacteria Saccharopolyspora erythraea. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 271st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Erythromycin can be used to treat bacteria responsible for causing infections of the skin and upper respiratory tract, including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus and Corynebacterium genera. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae: 0.015 to 256 μg/ml Staphylococcus aureus: 0.023 to 1024 μg/ml Streptococcus pyogenes: 0.004 to 256 μg/ml Corynebacterium minutissimum: 0.015 to 64 μg/ml It may be useful in treating gastroparesis due to this promotility effect. It has been shown to improve feeding intolerances in those who are critically ill. Intravenous erythromycin may also be used in endoscopy to help clear stomach contents to enhance endoscopic visualization, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and subsequent management. === Available forms === Erythromycin is available in enteric-coated tablets, slow-release capsules, oral suspensions, ophthalmic solutions, ointments, gels, enteric-coated capsules, non enteric-coated tablets, non enteric-coated capsules, and injections. The following erythromycin combinations are available for oral dosage: erythromycin base (capsules, tablets) erythromycin estolate (capsules, oral suspension, tablets), contraindicated during pregnancy erythromycin ethylsuccinate (oral suspension, tablets) erythromycin stearate (oral suspension, tablets) For injection, the available combinations are: erythromycin gluceptate erythromycin lactobionate For ophthalmic use: erythromycin base (ointment) == Adverse effects == Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, are very common because erythromycin is a motilin agonist. More serious side effects include arrhythmia with prolonged QT intervals, including torsades de pointes, and reversible deafness. Allergic reactions range from urticaria to anaphylaxis. Cholestasis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome are some other rare side effects that may occur. Studies have shown evidence both for and against the association of pyloric stenosis and exposure to erythromycin prenatally and postnatally. Exposure to erythromycin (especially long courses at antimicrobial doses, and also through breastfeeding) has been linked to an increased probability of pyloric stenosis in young infants. Erythromycin used for feeding intolerance in young infants has not been associated with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Erythromycin estolate has been associated with reversible hepatotoxicity in pregnant women in the form of elevated serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and is not recommended during pregnancy. Some evidence suggests similar hepatotoxicity in other populations. It can also affect the central nervous system, causing psychotic reactions, nightmares, and night sweats. == Interactions == Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily. The activity of the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g., dexamethasone), which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, including erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor) — are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels and the potential for rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated. Earlier case reports on sudden death prompted a study on a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Interactions with theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, were also shown. Erythromycin and doxycycline can have a synergistic effect when combined and kill bacteria (E. coli) with a higher potency than the sum of the two drugs together. This synergistic relationship is only temporary. After approximately 72 hours, the relationship shifts to become antagonistic, whereby a 50/50 combination of the two drugs kills less bacteria than if the two drugs were administered separately. It may alter the effectiveness of combined oral contraceptive pills because of its effect on the gut flora. A review found that when erythromycin was given with certain oral contraceptives, there was an increase in the maximum serum concentrations and AUC of estradiol and dienogest. Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 system, which means it can have a rapid effect on levels of other drugs metabolised by this system, e.g., warfarin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Erythromycin displays bacteriostatic activity or inhibits growth of bacteria, especially at higher concentrations. By binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial rRNA complex, protein synthesis and subsequent structure and function processes critical for life or replication are inhibited. Erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing the transfer of the tRNA bound at the A site of the rRNA complex to the P site of the rRNA complex. Without this translocation, the A site remains occupied, thus the addition of an incoming tRNA and its attached amino acid to the nascent polypeptide chain is inhibited. This interferes with the production of functionally useful proteins, which is the basis of this antimicrobial action. Erythromycin increases gut motility by binding to motilin receptor, thus it is a motilin receptor agonist in addition to its antimicrobial properties. It can be therefore administered intravenously as a stomach emptying stimulant. === Pharmacokinetics === Erythromycin is easily inactivated by gastric acid; therefore, all orally administered formulations are given as either enteric-coated or more-stable salts or esters, such as erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Erythromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, erythromycin is actively transported to the site of infection, where, during active phagocytosis, large concentrations of erythromycin are released. === Metabolism === Most of erythromycin is metabolised by demethylation in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4. Its main elimination route is in the bile with little renal excretion, 2%–15% unchanged drug. Erythromycin's elimination half-life ranges between 1.5 and 2.0 hours and is between 5 and 6 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease. Erythromycin levels peak in the serum 4 hours after dosing; ethylsuccinate peaks 0.5–2.5 hours after dosing, but can be delayed if digested with food. Erythromycin crosses the placenta and enters breast milk. The American Association of Pediatrics determined erythromycin is safe to take while breastfeeding. Absorption in pregnant patients has been shown to be variable, frequently resulting in levels lower than in nonpregnant patients. == Chemistry == === Composition === Standard-grade erythromycin is primarily composed of four related compounds known as erythromycins A, B, C, and D. Each of these compounds can be present in varying amounts and can differ by lot. Erythromycin A has been found to have the most antibacterial activity, followed by erythromycin B. Erythromycins C and D are about half as active as erythromycin A. Some of these related compounds have been purified and can be studied and researched individually. === Synthesis === Over the three decades after the discovery of erythromycin A and its activity as an antimicrobial, many attempts were made to synthesize it in the laboratory. The presence of 10 stereogenic carbons and several points of distinct substitution has made the total synthesis of erythromycin A a formidable task. Complete syntheses of erythromycins’ related structures and precursors such as 6-deoxyerythronolide B have been accomplished, giving way to possible syntheses of different erythromycins and other macrolide antimicrobials. Woodward successfully completed the synthesis of erythromycin A, which was published in 1981. == History == In 1949 Abelardo B. Aguilar, a Filipino scientist, sent some soil samples to his employer at Eli Lilly. Aguilar managed to isolate erythromycin from the metabolic products of a strain of Streptomyces erythreus (designation changed to Saccharopolyspora erythraea) found in the samples. Aguilar received no further credit or compensation for his discovery. The scientist was allegedly promised a trip to the company's manufacturing plant in Indianapolis, but it was never fulfilled. In a letter to the company's president, Aguilar wrote: “A leave of absence is all I ask as I do not wish to sever my connection with a great company which has given me wonderful breaks in life.” The request was not granted. Aguilar reached out to Eli Lilly again in 1993, requesting royalties from sales of the drug over the years, intending to use them to put up a foundation for poor and sickly Filipinos. This request was also denied. He died in September of the same year. Lilly filed for patent protection on the compound which was granted in 1953. The product was launched commercially in 1952 under the brand name Ilosone (after the Philippine region of Iloilo where it was originally collected). Erythromycin was formerly also called Ilotycin. The antibiotic clarithromycin was invented by scientists at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in the 1970s as a result of their efforts to overcome the acid instability of erythromycin. == Society and culture == === Economics === It is available as a generic medication. In the United States, in 2014, the price increased to seven dollars per 500mg tablet. The US price of erythromycin rose three times between 2010 and 2015, from 24 cents per 500mg tablet in 2010 to $8.96 in 2015. In 2017, a Kaiser Health News study found that the per-unit cost of dozens of generics doubled or even tripled from 2015 to 2016, increasing spending by the Medicaid program. Due to price increases by drug manufacturers, Medicaid paid on average $2,685,330 more for Erythromycin in 2016 compared to 2015 (not including rebates). In the US by 2018, generic drug prices had climbed another 5% on average. The UK price listed in the BNF for erythromycin 500mg tablets was £36.40 for 100 tablets (36.4 pence each) as of August 2024. This price is not paid by NHS patients: there is no NHS prescription charge in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; while NHS patients in England without an exemption are liable for a flat rate prescription charge. As of May 2024, that charge was £9.90 for each prescribed medicine. === Brand names === Brand names include Robimycin, E-Mycin, E.E.S.

Body slime, mouth fungus, furunculosis, bacterial gill illness, and hemorrhagic septicaemia are all examples of bacterial diseases in fish that may be treated and controlled with this therapy. The usage of Erythromycin in fishcare is mainly limited to therapies targeting gram-positive bacteria. == References ==",Eryped,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007441850611940026), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024906350299715996)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005530327325686812), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxlist.com](https://www.rxlist.com/eryped-drug.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=81, start_index=9, title='EryPed (Erythromycin Ethylsuccinate): Side Effects, Uses, Dosage, Interactions, Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxlist.com/eryped-drug.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

2563,"('Amisulpride', 'Solian', 'Aminosultopride', 'Deniban', 'Amisulprida')",Medical,"Amisulpride, sold under the brand names Solian and Barhemsys, is a medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia, acute psychotic episodes, depression, and nausea and vomiting. It is specifically used at lower doses intravenously to prevent and treat postoperative nausea and vomiting; at low doses by mouth to treat depression; and at higher doses by mouth to treat psychosis. It is usually classed with the atypical antipsychotics. Chemically it is a benzamide and like other benzamide antipsychotics, such as sulpiride, it is associated with a high risk of elevating blood levels of the lactation hormone, prolactin (thereby potentially causing the absence of the menstrual cycle, breast enlargement, even in males, breast milk secretion not related to breastfeeding, impaired fertility, impotence, breast pain, etc.), and a low risk, relative to the typical antipsychotics, of causing movement disorders. Amisulpride is indicated for use in the United States in adults for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), either alone or in combination with an antiemetic of a different class; and to treat PONV in those who have received antiemetic prophylaxis with an agent of a different class or have not received prophylaxis. Amisulpride is believed to work by blocking, or antagonizing, the dopamine D2 receptor, reducing its signalling. The effectiveness of amisulpride in treating dysthymia and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is believed to stem from its blockade of the presynaptic dopamine D2 and D3 autoreceptors. These presynaptic receptors regulate the release of dopamine into the synapse, so by blocking them amisulpride increases dopamine concentrations in the synapse. This increased dopamine concentration is theorized to act on dopamine D1 receptors to relieve depressive symptoms (in dysthymia) and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It was introduced by Sanofi-Aventis in the 1990s. Its patent expired by 2008, and generic formulations became available. It is marketed in all English-speaking countries except for Canada. == Medical uses == === Schizophrenia === Although according to other studies it appears to have comparable efficacy to olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia, amisulpride augmentation, similarly to sulpiride augmentation, has been considered a viable treatment option (although this is based on low-quality evidence) in clozapine-resistant cases of schizophrenia. Another recent study concluded that amisulpride is an appropriate first-line treatment for the management of acute psychosis. === Depression === Amisulpride is approved and used at low doses in the treatment of dysthymia and major depressive disorder. Whereas typical doses used in schizophrenia block postsynaptic dopamine D2-like receptors and reduce dopaminergic neurotransmission, low doses of amisulpride preferentially block presynaptic dopamine D2 and D3 autoreceptors and thereby disinhibit dopamine release and enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission. A 2010 Cochrane review found that low-dose amisulpride was effective in the treatment of dysthymia. Likewise, a 2024 literature review found that low-dose amisulpride was effective for dysthymia. The drug is approved for depression specifically in Italy, Greece, and certain other European countries. === Postoperative nausea and vomiting === Amisulpride is indicated for use in the United States in adults for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), either alone or in combination with an antiemetic of a different class; and to treat PONV in those who have received antiemetic prophylaxis with an agent of a different class or have not received prophylaxis. === Available forms === Amisulpride is available in the form of 100, 200, and 400 mg oral tablets. In the United States, it is available in the form of a 5 mg/2 mL (2.5 mg/mL) solution for intravenous administration. == Contraindications == Amisulpride's use is contraindicated in the following disease states and populations Pheochromocytoma Concomitant prolactin-dependent tumours e.g. prolactinoma, breast cancer Movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) Lactation Children before the onset of puberty Neither is it recommended to use amisulpride in patients with hypersensitivities to amisulpride or the excipients found in its dosage form. == Adverse effects == Very Common (≥10% incidence) Extrapyramidal side effects (EPS; including dystonia, tremor, akathisia, parkinsonism). Common (≥1%, <10% incidence) Hyperprolactinaemia (which can lead to galactorrhoea, breast enlargement and tenderness, sexual dysfunction, etc.) Weight gain (produces less weight gain than chlorpromazine, clozapine, iloperidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, zotepine and more (although not statistically significantly) weight gain than haloperidol, lurasidone, ziprasidone and approximately as much weight gain as aripiprazole and asenapine) Anticholinergic side effects (although it does not bind to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and hence these side effects are usually quite mild) such as - constipation - dry mouth - disorder of accommodation - Blurred vision Rare (<1% incidence) Blood dyscrasias such as leucopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis QT interval prolongation (in a recent meta-analysis of the safety and efficacy of 15 antipsychotic drugs amisulpride was found to have the 2nd highest effect size for causing QT interval prolongation) Hyperprolactinaemia results from antagonism of the D2 receptors located on the lactotrophic cells found in the anterior pituitary gland. Amisulpride has a high propensity for elevating plasma prolactin levels as a result of its poor blood–brain barrier penetrability and hence the resulting greater ratio of peripheral D2 occupancy to central D2 occupancy. This means that to achieve the sufficient occupancy (~60–80%) of the central D2 receptors in order to elicit its therapeutic effects a dose must be given that is enough to saturate peripheral D2 receptors including those in the anterior pituitary. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Overdose == Torsades de pointes is common in overdose. Amisulpride is moderately dangerous in overdose (with the TCAs being very dangerous and the SSRIs being modestly dangerous). == Interactions == Amisulpride should not be used in conjunction with drugs that prolong the QT interval (such as citalopram, bupropion, clozapine, tricyclic antidepressants, sertindole, ziprasidone, etc.), reduce heart rate and those that can induce hypokalaemia. Likewise it is imprudent to combine antipsychotics due to the additive risk for tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Amisulpride functions primarily as a dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It has high affinity for these receptors with dissociation constants of 3.0 and 3.5 nM, respectively. Although standard doses used to treat psychosis inhibit dopaminergic neurotransmission, low doses preferentially block inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors. This results in a facilitation of dopamine activity, and for this reason, low-dose amisulpride has also been used to treat dysthymia. Amisulpride and its relatives sulpiride, levosulpiride, and sultopride have been shown to bind to the high-affinity GHB receptor at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant (IC50Tooltip Half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 50 nM for amisulpride). Amisulpride, sultopride and sulpiride respectively present decreasing in vitro affinities for the D2 receptor (IC50 = 27, 120 and 181 nM) and the D3 receptor (IC50 = 3.6, 4.8 and 17.5 nM). Though it was long widely assumed that dopaminergic modulation is solely responsible for the respective antidepressant and antipsychotic properties of amisulpride, it was subsequently found that the drug also acts as a potent antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor (Ki = 11.5 nM). Several of the other atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and ziprasidone are potent antagonists at the 5-HT7 receptor as well, and selective antagonists of the receptor show antidepressant properties themselves. To characterize the role of the 5-HT7 receptor in the antidepressant effects of amisulpride, a study prepared 5-HT7 receptor knockout mice. The study found that in two widely used rodent models of depression, the tail suspension test, and the forced swim test, those mice did not exhibit an antidepressant response upon treatment with amisulpride. These results suggest that 5-HT7 receptor antagonism mediates the antidepressant effects of amisulpride. Amisulpride also appears to bind with high affinity to the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor (Ki = 13 nM), where it acts as an antagonist. The clinical implications of this, if any, are unclear. In any case, there is no evidence that this action mediates any of the therapeutic effects of amisulpride. Amisulpride shows stereoselectivity in its actions. Aramisulpride ((R)-amisulpride) has higher affinity for the 5-HT7 receptor (Ki = 47 nM vs. 1,900 nM) while esamisulpride ((S)-amisulpride) has higher affinity for the D2 receptor (4.0 nM vs. 140 nM). Through a high direct unmetabolized excretion, it has, despite its high usual dose, also high affinity for dopamine-D2-D3-receptors. Also the available literature gives us hints about also relatively high receptor dissociation kinetics (through a delayed but high occupancy at dopamine receptors after 6 hours from a 100 mg exposure). Not just is this level of occupation (90%) enough for the normally therapeutic adwished level of the needing receptors occupated against schizophrenia, but even with this occuring after a single dose of amisulprid (compared with the receptoroccupation of about 12% in the striatalregion of the brain when taken cariprazine (which reaches an occupation between 63-69% not until several weeks and doses of administration)). So one can say that the dynamics of dopamin-receptoroccupation and how this does affect the human body are very complex, for example can the body and the brain work totally accurately even when over 90% of the dopaminreceptors are occupated, yet though does the triggering of presynaptic autoreceptors to enhance mood in cases of dysthymia depending on an insaturated occupation of postsynaptic D2 receptors. However, this dopamine exposure could be slightly more ""balanced"" providing some little advantages over haloperidol in using it for drug exposure. Due to its lack of compensatory serotonin effects and also not having an anticholinergic profile, it may not considered as an effective alternative if akathasia is a problem. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of amisulpride is 48%. Its plasma protein binding is 16%. The drug is metabolized by the liver but its metabolism is minimal. Its elimination half-life is 12 hours. Amisulpride is eliminated in urine (23–46%) and feces and is excreted mostly unchanged. == Chemistry == Amisulpride is a benzamide derivative. It is structurally related to other benzamide dopamine receptor antagonists employed as antipsychotics and antiemetics including levosulpiride, metoclopramide, nemonapride, remoxipride, sulpiride, sultopride, tiapride, and veralipride. Chemically, it is also known as aminosultopride, differing from sultopride only in possessing an amino substituent on its benzene ring. == History == Amisulpride was introduced by Sanofi-Aventis in the 1990s. Its patent expired by 2008, and generic formulations became available. === United States clinical development === The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a 10 mg/4mL amisulpride IV formulation for use in post-operative nausea based on evidence from four clinical trials of 2323 subjects undergoing surgery or experiencing nausea and vomiting after the surgery. The trials were conducted at 80 sites in the United States, Canada and Europe. Two trials (Trials 1 and 2) enrolled subjects scheduled to have surgery. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either amisulpride or a placebo drug at the beginning of general anesthesia. In Trial 1, subjects received amisulpride or placebo alone, and in Trial 2, they received amisulpride or placebo in combination with one medication approved for prevention of nausea and vomiting. Neither the subjects nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trial was complete. The trials counted the number of subjects who had no vomiting and did not use additional medications for nausea or vomiting in the first day (24 hours) after the surgery. The results then compared amisulpride to placebo. The other two trials (Trials 3 and 4) enrolled subjects who were experiencing nausea and vomiting after surgery. In Trial 3, subjects did not receive any medication to prevent nausea and vomiting before surgery and in Trial 4 they received the medication, but the treatment did not work. In both trials, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either amisulpride or placebo. Neither the subjects nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trial was complete. The trials counted the number of subjects who had no vomiting and did not use additional medications for nausea or vomiting in the first day (24 hours) after the treatment. The trial compared amisulpride to placebo. The FDA has not approved amisulpride for use in any psychiatric indication. LB Pharmaceuticals is developing N-methyl amisulpride for the use in the treatment of schizophrenia; a Phase 2 first-in-patient study is planned for 2023. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names include: Amazeo, Amipride (AU), Amival, Deniban, Solian (AU, IE, RU, UK, ZA), Soltus, Sulpitac (IN), Sulprix (AU), Midora (RO) and Socian (BR). === Availability === Amisulpride is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States in psychiatric indications, but it is approved and in use throughout Europe, Asia, Mexico, New Zealand and Australia to treat psychosis and schizophrenia. An IV formulation of Amisulpride was approved for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (""PONV"") in the United States in February 2020. == Research == === Bipolar depression === SEP-4199 (non-racemic amisulpride), an 85:15 ratio of aramisulpride ((R)-amisulpride) to esamisulpride ((S)-amisulpride), which is theorized to provide more balanced serotonin 5-HT7 and dopamine D2 receptor antagonism than racemic amisulpride (a 50:50 ratio of its (R)- and (S)-enantiomers), is or was under development by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of bipolar depression in the United States and other countries. However, its development may have been discontinued. === Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting === The intravenous formulation of amisulpride approved for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting is additionally under development for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. === Chemical derivatives === A more lipophilic and centrally permeable derivative of amisulpride, N-methylamisulpride (developmental code name LB-102), is under development by LB Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States and other countries. == See also == ENX-104 (an analogue under development for use at low doses to treat depression) == References == == External links == ""Amisulpride"".

2569,"('Dithranol', 'Anthralin', 'Cignolin', 'Chrysodermol', 'Cigthranol')",Medical,"Dithranol (INN) or anthralin (USAN and former BAN) is a hydroxyanthrone, anthracene derivative, and is used in medications applied to the skin of people with psoriasis. It is available as creams, ointment or pastes in 0.1 to 2% strengths (Drithocreme, Dithrocream, Zithranol-RR, Micanol, Psorlin, Dritho-Scalp, Anthraforte, Anthranol and Anthrascalp). The terms dithranol and anthralin are sometimes used synonymously. == Medical uses == Dithranol has a slower onset of action in controlling psoriasis, typically several weeks, compared to glucocorticoid steroids, but is without the potential for rebound reaction on withdrawal. It cannot be used on the face or genitalia. There is some tentative evidence that anthralin might be useful for alopecia areata. == Side effects == It temporarily stains the skin a yellowy-brown to purple if not washed off after a period of time (45-60 minutes). It permanently stains clothing fabrics, shower curtains, and other materials such as ceramic sinks the same yellow-brown to purple in color depending on the concentration. It may cause a local burning sensation and irritation; this may be minimised by careful attention to the details of treatment and only gradually stepping up through the strengths of dithranol formulations. The surrounding skin can be protected using soft white paraffin and the treated area is covered with tube gauze. == Pharmacology == Dithranol accumulates in mitochondria where it interferes with the supply of energy to the cell, probably by the oxidation of dithranol releasing free radicals. This impedes DNA replication and so slows the excessive cell division that occurs in psoriatic plaques. In addition Dithranol may act by reducing the elevated levels of cGMP that occurs in psoriasis. Anthralin is a synthetic compound whose precise mechanism of anti-psoriatic action is not yet fully understood. However, numerous studies have demonstrated anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of anthralin on psoriatic and normal skin. The anti-proliferative effects of anthralin appear to result from both an inhibition of DNA synthesis as well as from its strong reducing properties. Anthralin’s effectiveness as an anti-psoriatic agent has also been in part attributed to its abilities to induce lipid peroxidation and reduce levels of endothelial adhesion molecules which are markedly elevated in psoriatic patients. Unlike retinoids and PUVA, anthralin does not inhibit liver microsomal enzyme activity; consequently, the likelihood of adverse drug interactions is greatly reduced when other agents are administered concomitantly with anthralin. More dithranol penetrates into impaired skin in 30 minutes than into intact skin during about 16 hours. For this reason weaker 0.1-0.5% preparations are applied over night, but stronger 1-2% products are applied for between 30 minutes and one hour depending upon the formulation. == References == == Further reading == British National Formulary 45 March 2003",Anthralin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.663577369181439e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011066253297030926)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/anthralin-topical-route/description/drg-20061896?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=140, start_index=9, title='Anthralin (topical route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/anthralin-topical-route/description/drg-20061896?utm_source=openai')])"

Iritis, photophobia, and increased corneal thickness observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial with taprenepag isopropyl were not previously observed in topical ocular toxicity studies in rabbits and dogs. In vivo studies using cynomolgus monkeys and in vitro models were used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these ocular events. Monkeys were dosed daily for 28 days in 1 eye with taprenepag and in the other with vehicle control. Complete ophthalmic examinations were performed at baseline and weekly thereafter. Serial sections of eyes were examined histopathologically at the end of the study. Recovery after the discontinuation of taprenepag was assessed for 28 days in the monkeys in the high-dose group. In vitro studies evaluated cell viability, paracellular permeability, and cytokine induction with human corneal epithelial or endothelial cell cultures. Monkeys demonstrated a dose-related incidence of iritis and increased corneal thickness that resolved within 28 days of discontinuing taprenepag. There was no evidence in vivo of taprenepag toxicity to the corneal endothelium or epithelium. Cell viability of stratified epithelial cells was primarily affected by excipients and was similar to Xalatan(®). The viability of HCEC-12 cells was not affected by taprenepag at concentrations up to 100 μM. The lack of in vivo or in vitro endothelial cytotoxicity and the reversibility of the increase in corneal thickness and iritis in the monkey provide confidence to permit further clinical development of taprenepag. To assess the effect of topical taprenepag isopropyl on each layer of the cornea by confocal microscopy. Thirty-two ocular hypertensive or glaucoma patients were randomized into a 2-period, crossover study of 14 days of 0.1% taprenepag alone and in unfixed combination with 0.005% latanoprost (combination therapy). Baseline and sequential slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fluorescein staining, central ultrasonic pachymetry, and confocal microscopy were performed. Confocal images were analyzed for the density of the central superficial and basal epithelium, midstromal keratocytes, and endothelium, as well as endothelial coefficient of variation and percentage of hexagonal cells, and reflectivity of anterior stromal and midstromal layers. Corneal staining increased from baseline, reaching a peak at day 13 (69% and 63% of subjects treated with monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively), which resolved by day 35. A statistically significant increase in mean corneal thickness for both eyes and both treatments occurred on days 7 and 13 (range, 20-27 μm; P < 0.001) but recovered (≤ 6 μm) by day 35. No statistically significant changes were observed in the basal epithelial, midstromal, or endothelial cells. Mean ratio of average reflectivity of anterior stroma to midstroma increased on days 13 and 35 in period 1 for each treatment (range, 1.2-1.9; P < 0.001), and this increase persisted during period 2. Anterior stromal reflectivity may remain increased even when biomicroscopic and confocal images of corneal layers remain normal or have recovered after topical taprenepag. This subclinical measure may be useful to detect a persistent adverse effect of a topical agent on the cornea. To evaluate the safety of escalating doses of taprenepag isopropyl (PF-04217329), a selective EP(2) receptor agonist administered as a topical ophthalmic solution, versus its vehicle (Stage I), and dose-response of taprenepag isopropyl alone and in unfixed combination with latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% versus latanoprost alone (Stage II).

Stage II: 7 groups (total n = 250) received 1 drop of taprenepag isopropyl multidose formulation qPM/eye for 28 days: 0.005%, 0.01%, 0.015% monotherapy; each in unfixed combination with latanoprost 0.005%, or latanoprost monotherapy. mean change in diurnal IOP, baseline to last visit; adverse events.

The cell viability and proliferation were evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and 5-ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, respectively. The cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry analysis and 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was determined through the 5, 5', 6, 6'-tetrachloro-1, 1', 3, 3'-tetraethylbenzimi-dazolyl carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) staining. The cell cycle arrest-, apoptosis-, and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (PI3K/AKT/GSK3β) pathway-related proteins were estimated by western blot analysis. LS markedly reduced the viability and suppressed the proliferation of HeLa cells. LS induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through the inhibition of Cyclin D1, p-Rb, and induction of p21 and p53. Furthermore, LS triggered apoptosis through the activation of mitochondrial-mediated pathway based on decrease of Bcl-2/Bax ratio and MMP and activation of caspase-9/7/3. Additionally, LS led to constitutive downregulation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. Collectively, LS inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis through mitochondrial-mediated pathway by suppression of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway in HeLa cells.

2575,"('Betaxolol', 'Betaxololum', 'Betoptic', 'Kerlone', 'Betaxololum [inn-latin]')",Medical,"Betaxolol is a selective beta1 receptor blocker used in the treatment of hypertension and angina. It is also a adrenergic blocker with no partial agonist action and minimal membrane stabilizing activity. Being selective for beta1 receptors, it typically has fewer systemic side effects than non-selective beta-blockers, for example, not causing bronchospasm (mediated by beta2 receptors) as timolol may. Betaxolol also shows greater affinity for beta1 receptors than metoprolol. In addition to its effect on the heart, betaxolol reduces the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure). This effect is thought to be caused by reducing the production of the liquid (which is called the aqueous humor) within the eye. The precise mechanism of this effect is not known. The reduction in intraocular pressure reduces the risk of damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision in patients with elevated intraocular pressure due to glaucoma. It was patented in 1975 and approved for medical use in 1983. == Medical uses == === Hypertension === Betaxolol is most commonly ingested orally alone or with other medications for the management of essential hypertension. It is a cardioselective beta blocker, targeting beta-1 adrenergic receptors found in the cardiac muscle. Blood pressure is decreased by the mechanism of blood vessels relaxing and improving the flow of blood. === Glaucoma === Ophthalmic betaxolol is an available treatment for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and optical hypertension. Betaxolol effectively prevents the increase of intracellular calcium, which leads to increased production of the aqueous humor. In the context of open angle glaucoma, increased aqueous humor produced by ciliary bodies increases intraocular pressure, causing degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve. Furthermore, betaxolol is additionally able to protect retinal neurones following topical application from excitotoxicity or ischemia-reperfusion, providing a neuroprotective effect. This is thought to be attributed to its capacity to attenuate neuronal calcium and sodium influx.
