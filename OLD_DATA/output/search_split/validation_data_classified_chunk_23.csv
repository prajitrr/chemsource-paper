2280,"('Valdecoxib', 'Sc 65872', 'Bextra', 'Valdyn', 'Kudeq')",Medical,"Valdecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and painful menstruation and menstrual symptoms. It is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor. It was patented in 1995. Valdecoxib was manufactured and marketed under the brand name Bextra by G. D. Searle & Company as an anti-inflammatory arthritis drug. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on November 20, 2001, to treat arthritis and menstrual cramps, and was available by prescription in tablet form until 2005 when the FDA requested that Pfizer withdraw Bextra from the American market. The FDA cited ""potential increased risk for serious cardiovascular (CV) adverse events,"" an ""increased risk of serious skin reactions"" and the ""fact that Bextra has not been shown to offer any unique advantages over the other available NSAIDs."" In 2009, Bextra was at the center of the ""largest health-care fraud settlement and the largest criminal fine of any kind ever."" Pfizer paid a $2.3 billion civil and criminal fine. Pharmacia & Upjohn, a Pfizer subsidiary, violated the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for misbranding Bextra ""with the intent to defraud or mislead."" A water-soluble and injectable prodrug of valdecoxib, parecoxib, is marketed in the European Union under the tradename Dynastat. == Uses until 2005 == In the United States, the FDA approved valdecoxib for the treatment of osteoarthritis, adult rheumatoid arthritis, and primary dysmenorrhea. Valdecoxib was also used off-label for controlling acute pain and various types of surgical pain. == Side effects and withdrawal from market == On April 7, 2005, Pfizer withdrew Bextra from the U.S. market on recommendation by the FDA, citing an increased risk of heart attack and stroke and also the risk of a serious, sometimes fatal, skin reaction. This was a result of recent attention to prescription NSAIDs, such as Merck's Vioxx. Other reported side effects were angina and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Pfizer first acknowledged cardiovascular risks associated with Bextra in October 2004. The American Heart Association soon after was presented with a report indicating patients using Bextra while recovering from heart surgery were 2.19 times more likely to suffer a stroke or heart attack than those taking placebos. In a large study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 2006, valdecoxib appeared less adverse for renal (kidney) disease and heart arrhythmia compared to Vioxx, but elevated renal risks were slightly suggested. == 2009 settlement for off-label uses promotions == On September 2, 2009, the United States Department of Justice fined Pfizer $2.3 billion after one of its subsidiaries, Pharmacia & Upjohn Company, pleaded guilty to marketing four drugs, including Bextra, ""with the intent to defraud or mislead."" Pharmacia & Upjohn admitted to criminal conduct in the promotion of Bextra, and agreed to pay the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States for any matter, $1.195 billion. A former Pfizer district sales manager was indicted and sentenced to home confinement for destroying documents regarding the illegal promotion of Bextra. In addition, a regional manager pleaded guilty to distribution of a misbranded product, and was fined $75,000 and 24 months on probation. The remaining $1 billion of the fine were paid to resolve allegations under the civil False Claims Act case and is the largest civil fraud settlement against a pharmaceutical company. Six whistleblowers were awarded more than $102 million for their role in the investigation. Former Pfizer sales representative John Kopchinski acted as a qui tam relator and filed a complaint in 2004 outlining the illegal conduct in the marketing of Bextra. Kopchinski was awarded $51.5 million for his role in the case because the improper marketing of Bextra was the largest piece of the settlement at $1.8 billion. == Analytical methods == Several HPLC-UV methods have been reported for valdecoxib estimation in biological samples like human urine. Valdecoxib has analytical methods for bioequivalence studies, metabolite determination, estimation of formulation, and an HPTLC method for simultaneous estimation in tablet dosage form. == See also == Discovery and development of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors Parecoxib Apricoxib == References == == External links == FDA Alert on Bextra withdrawal Large systematic review of adverse renal and arrhythmia risk of valdcoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors, JAMA 2006 Archived 2020-11-05 at the Wayback Machine",Bextra,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000431861262768507), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003623305819928646), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01106978952884674)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdecoxib ', [])"

The cis-urocanic acid isomer is rare. == Metabolism == It is formed from L-histidine through the action of histidine ammonialyase (also known as histidase or histidinase) by elimination of ammonium. In the liver, urocanic acid is transformed by urocanate hydratase (or urocanase) to 4-imidazolone-5-propionic acid and subsequently to glutamic acid. == Clinical significance == Inherited deficiency of urocanase leads to elevated levels of urocanic acid in the urine, a condition known as urocanic aciduria. An important role for the onset of atopic dermatitis and asthma has been attributed to filaggrin, a skin precursor of urocanic acid. Urocanic acid is thought to be a significant attractant of the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis, in part because of relatively high levels in the plantar surfaces of the feet, the site through which this parasite often enters the body. == Function == Urocanic acid is found in animal sweat and skin. its concentration varies greatly between people, from 4 nM per cm2 to 34 nM per cm2 with only small differences between areas other than at the sole of the foot and between sun-exposed and unexposed areas. Concentration does not link with age, sex, skin tone, photosensitivity, and stratum corneum thickness. Among other functions, urocanic acid acts as an endogenous sunscreen or photoprotectant against UVB-induced DNA damage. However, some studies have questioned this. Urocanic acid is found predominantly in the stratum corneum of the skin and it is likely that most of it is derived from filaggrin catabolism (a histidine-rich protein). When exposed to UVB irradiation, trans-urocanic acid is converted in vitro and in vivo to cis-urocanic acid (cis-UCA). The cis form is known to activate regulatory T cells. Measuring cis-UCA provides a sensitive means at sub-erythemal doses to detect UVB, and so offers a potential method to assess the UVR protection provided by suncreams. Some studies attribute filaggrin an important role in keeping the skin surface slightly acidic, through a breaking down mechanism to form histidine and subsequently trans-urocanic acid, however others have shown that the filaggrin–histidine–urocanic acid cascade is not essential for skin acidification. == History == Urocanic acid was first isolated in 1874 by the chemist Max Jaffé from the urine of a dog, hence the name (Latin: urina = urine, and canis = dog). == See also == Histidinemia Inborn error of metabolism == References == == External links == The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease - Chapter 80 - An overview of disorders of histidine metabolism, including urocanic aciduria.",Urocaninic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0004390134708955884), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.0033073509112000465), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.625213477993384e-05), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.576000988483429)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.004100008402019739), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urocanic_acid?utm_source=openai), [cosmeticsinfo.org](https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/urocanic-acid/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=205, start_index=26, title='Urocanic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urocanic_acid?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=205, start_index=26, title='Urocanic Acid - Cosmetics Info', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/urocanic-acid/?utm_source=openai')])"

The in vivo antitumor activity of AT-9283 has also been demonstrated in human tumor xenograft models. Based on these preclinical studies, several clinical trials have been conducted in patients with hematological malignancies, such as leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease, chronic myeloid leukemia, lymphomas and multiple myeloma, and also in patients with solid tumors.

Potassium balance is maintained by the kidney and the majority of ingested potassium is excreted in the urine. There is strong evidence of a negative association between dietary potassium and blood pressure, and some evidence (much of it indirect) of negative associations between dietary potassium and cardiovascular disease (particularly stroke and coronary heart disease) and kidney disease (chronic renal failure, and kidney stones). Blood pressure lowering is particularly associated with high potassium and low sodium diets. Important dietary sources of potassium include fruit and vegetables (including rice, potatoes, legumes and wholegrains), dairy products, and animal proteins. Worldwide, diets are low in potassium compared to dietary guidelines. Interventions focused on increasing dietary potassium will have major benefits including improvements in diet, reducing non-communicable disease and enhancing planetary health. Potassium was identified as a shortfall nutrient by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 Advisory Committee. The committee concluded that there was a moderate body of evidence of the association between potassium intake and blood pressure reduction in adults, which in turn influences the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease. Evidence is also accumulating of the protective effect of adequate dietary potassium on age-related bone loss and reduction of kidney stones. These benefits depend on organic anions associated with potassium as occurs in foods such as fruits and vegetables, in contrast to similar blood pressure-lowering benefits of potassium chloride. Benefits to blood pressure and bone health may occur at levels below current recommendations for potassium intake, especially from diet, but dose-response trials are needed to confirm this. Nevertheless, intakes considerably above current levels are needed for optimal health, and studies evaluating small increases in fruit and vegetable intake on bone and heart outcomes for short periods have had disappointing results. In modern societies, Western diets have led to a decrease in potassium intake with reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables with a concomitant increase in sodium consumption through increased consumption of processed foods. Consumption of white vegetables is associated with decreased risk of stroke, possibly related to their high potassium content. Potatoes are the highest source of dietary potassium, but the addition of salt should be limited. Low potassium-to-sodium intake ratios are more strongly related to cardiovascular disease risk than either nutrient alone. This relationship deserves further attention for multiple target tissue endpoints. Abnormalities in serum potassium are commonly encountered in patients presenting to the emergency department.

It is used for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal disorders. It is sometimes combined with simethicone as a combination drug. Trimebutine is formulated as a tablet or granules for oral suspension. == Pharmacology == Trimebutine is a multimodal drug that acts on many receptors in the body. Its main effects are mediated through inhibition of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels, thereby decreasing calcium influx in smooth muscle in the gut. This mechanism explains its ability to slow peristalsis, which in turn helps with diarrhoea management in IBS patients. Antispasmodic effect is mediated through inhibition of inward rectifier potassium channels and calcium-dependend potassium channels. Moreover, trimebutine and its metabolite N-desmethyltrimebutine exert non-selective antagonistic effect on mAChRs, which is believed to potentiate its antispasmodic effects, as do many other drugs in this class. Moreover, trimebutine and N-desmethyltrimebutine act as weak agonists of opioid receptors, specifically mu, delta and kappa receptor subtypes throughout the gut, which was shown in animal-model studies. Trimebutine exerts its effects in part due to causing a premature activation of phase III of the migrating motor complex in the digestive tract. This mode of action explains trimebutine's ability to mediate gastrointestinal motility in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract, both stimulating and inhibiting spontaneous contractions. In vitro, trimebutine also exhibits antagonistic effects in sodium channels with IC50 equal 8.4 μM and inhibits glutamate release. === Pharmacokinetics === Oral bioavailability of trimebutine is nearly 100% for the maleate salt. Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) is achieved after 30 minutes for 100 mg dose and 0.88 h for 200 mg dose. The level of serum albumin binding is minimal. Half-life (t1/2) of 200 mg timebutine maleate is equal to 2.77 h. === Metabolism and excretion === Trimebutine exhibits first-pass metabolism effect, which in turn generates N-desmethyltrimebutine (nortrimebutine). Predominantly, trimebutine is excreted in urine, mainly as 2-dimethylamino-2-phenylbutan-1-ol, whereas fecal excretion is minimal (5-12%). Additionally, trimebutine might be metabolised through glucuronidation. === Carcinogenicity === According to European Medicines Agency, formulations of trimebutine might be contaminated with N-nitrosamines. However, it was assigned CPCA Category 5 with acceptable daily intake of 1500 ng/day. == Interactions == Trimebutine can increase the length of anaesthesia induced with d-tubocurarine. Other interactions include: potentiation of anticholinergic effects caused by zotepine decreasing efficacy of cisapride procainamide (potentiation of vagus nerve activity inhibition, thereby causing a positive chronotropic effect and, in turn, tachycardia) calcium channel blockers == Adverse effects == Trimebutine may cause following side-effects: psychiatric disturbances: anxiety CNS reactions: somnolence, malaise, vertigo, paresthesia, headache, apathy ear problems: hearing loss heart problems: tachycardia GI reactions: xerostomia, taste disorders, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, upper quadrant pain, lip paresthesia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, excessive thirst hepatic and bile ducts reactions: hepatic insufficiency, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes skin and soft tissue reactions: rash, pruritus, urticaria, flushing, blistering, lumps, exudation, erythema multiforme renal reactions: urinary retention reproductive system reactions: dysmenorrhoea, mastitis, gynceomastia in males, breast pain == Synthesis == Trimebutine can be synthesised from 1-phenylpropan-1-one (1). Firstly, it is converted to the corresponding oxirane through trimethylsulfoxonium idoide with sodium hydride in DMSO and THF, yielding 2-ethyl-2-phenyl-oxirane (2). Next, 2 undergoes ring-opening with dimethylaluminium N,N-dimethylamide in diethyl ether, yielding 2-(dimethylamino)-2-phenyl-butan-1-ol (4) and 2-phenylbutanal (3) as a byproduct. Then, 4 reacts with 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl chloride (5) in triethylamine and THF, which is catalysed by 4-dimethylaminopyrridine (DMAP), yielding trimebutine. == Research == Trimebutine is investigated for the treatment of functional dyspepsia-IBS overlap syndrome, post-operative nausea and vomiting. A clinical trial evaluating trimebutine as an adjunctive treatment to rabeprazole-resistant reflux oesophageitis was withdrawn due to lack of funds. === Novel salts of trimebutine === Wallace et al. synthesised several new salts with improved anaglesic properties in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. These include: trimebutine nitroarginate and derivatives – arginine nitro-derivative acts as a nitric oxide donor, which exerts anti-inflammatory effect (similarly to naproxcinod) trimebutine thiocarbamoylbenzoate – thioamide group acts as a hydrogen sulfide donor, also acting as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent === Acute ulcerative colitis === Trimebutine maleate encapsulated by nanostructured lipid carriers was shown to induce protective effects on colon mucosa in acetic-acid colitis in rats. === Cancer === Heejin et al. showed that trimebutine is effective at stopping ovarian cancer cells from growing in vitro. This effect is believed to be exerted through G0/G1 phase switch arrest, voltage-gated calcium channels and calcium-activated potassium channels inhibition and suppressing Wnt, Notch and Hedgehod pathways. Yi-pu Fan et. al found that trimebutine can inhibit glioma and glioblastoma cells from proliferating by promoting apoptosis and downregulation of Bcl-2, thereby upregulating Bax pro-apoptotic factor. === Alkaline corneal burns === Hitoshi et. al. showed that trimebutine can inhibit inflammation in corneal burns caused by alkali. This protective activity is thought to be mediated by high-mobility group box 1-receptor inhibitor, which causes decreased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration. == Brand names == The maleic acid salt of trimebutine is marketed under the trademarks of Antinime, Cineprac, Colospasmyl, Colypan, Crolipsa, Debricol, Debridat, Debretin, Digedrat, Espabion, Gast Reg, Ircolon, Irritratil, Krisxon, Muttifen, Neotina, Polybutin, Sangalina, Trebutel, Tribudat, Tributina, Tribux, Trim, Trimeb, Trimedat, and Trimedine.

2290,"('Quinidine', 'Conquinine', 'Pitayine', 'Conchinin', 'Chinidin')",Medical,"Quinidine is a class IA antiarrhythmic agent used to treat heart rhythm disturbances. It is a diastereomer of antimalarial agent quinine, originally derived from the bark of the cinchona tree. The drug causes increased action potential duration, as well as a prolonged QT interval. As of 2019, its IV formulation is no longer being manufactured for use in the United States. == Medical uses == Quinidine is occasionally used as a class I antiarrhythmic agent to prevent ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in Brugada Syndrome, although its safety in this indication is uncertain. It reduces the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after patients undergo cardioversion, but it has proarrhythmic effects and trials suggest that it may lead to an overall increased mortality in these patients. Quinidine is also used to treat short QT syndrome. Eli Lilly has discontinued manufacture of parenteral quinidine gluconate in the US, and its future availability in many countries is uncertain. === Other uses === There is one study supporting the use of a novel combination of dextromethorphan and low dose quinidine in alleviating symptoms of easy laughing and crying (pseudobulbar affect); these are a type of rather severe uncontrollable behaviors which can be present in various neurological pathologies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. The dose of quinidine (10 mg two times daily) is about 1/40th of a relatively low antiarrhythmic dose (400 mg, twice or 3 times daily, as an example; antiarrhythmic doses can sometimes exceed 1500 mg/day). The authors did not observe significant safety risks using the low quinidine dose, but urged caution and also pointed out that quinidine interacts with a large number of other medications in dangerous or unpredictable ways. A meta analysis was published referencing only that one study. Although intravenous quinidine is sometimes used to treat Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the future availability of this agent is uncertain. == Side effects == Quinidine is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6, and can lead to increased blood levels of lidocaine, beta blockers, opioids, and some antidepressants. Quinidine also inhibits the transport protein P-glycoprotein and so can cause some peripherally acting drugs such as loperamide to have central nervous system side effects, such as respiratory depression, if the two drugs are coadministered. Quinidine can cause thrombocytopenia, granulomatous hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and torsades de pointes (dangerous heart rhythm), and has been largely phased out in favor of other antiarrhythmics. Torsades can occur after the first dose. Quinidine-induced thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is mediated by the immune system, and may lead to thrombocytic purpura. Quinidine intoxication can lead to a collection of symptoms collectively known as cinchonism, with tinnitus (ringing in the ears) being among the most characteristic and common symptoms of this toxicity syndrome. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Quinidine acts as a blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels. Inhibition of the Nav1.5 channel is specifically involved in its antiarrhythmic effects as a class I antiarrhythmic agent. Quinidine also blocks certain voltage-gated potassium channels (e.g., Kv1.4, Kv4.2, hERG, among others), acts as an antimuscarinic and alpha-1 blocker, and is an antimalarial. It is said to be a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M3 receptor antagonist. ==== Mechanism of action ==== Like all other class I antiarrhythmic agents, quinidine primarily works by blocking the fast inward sodium current (INa). Quinidine's effect on INa is known as a 'use dependent block'. This means at higher heart rates, the block increases, while at lower heart rates, the block decreases. The effect of blocking the fast inward sodium current causes the phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential to decrease (decreased Vmax). It seems still efficacious as an IV antimalarial against Plasmodium falciparum. This electrolyte dependent agent also increases action potentials and prolongs the QT interval. Quinidine also blocks the slowly inactivating, tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na current, the slow inward calcium current (ICa), the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed potassium rectifier current, the inward potassium rectifier current (IKI), the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (IKATP) and Ito. At micromolar concentrations, quinidine inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase by binding to the same receptor sites as the digitalis glycosides such as ouabain. The effect of quinidine on the ion channels is to prolong the cardiac action potential, thereby prolonging the QT interval on the surface ECG. Other ECG effects include a wide notched P wave, wide QRS complex, depressed ST segment, and U waves. These are the results of both slowed depolarization and repolarization. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Elimination ==== The elimination half-life of oral quinidine is 6 to 8 hours, and it is eliminated by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver. About 20% is excreted unchanged via the kidneys. == History == The effects of cinchona bark (the botanical source from which quinidine is extracted) had been commented on long before the understanding of cardiac physiology arose. Jean-Baptiste de Sénac, in his 1749 work on the anatomy, function, and diseases of the heart, had this to say: ""Long and rebellious palpitations have ceded to this febrifuge"". ""Of all the stomachic remedies, the one whose effects have appeared to me the most constant and the most prompt in many cases is quinquina [Peruvian bark] mixed with a little rhubarb."" Sénac subsequently became physician to Louis XV of France, a counselor of the state, and superintendent of the mineral waters and medicinals in France. As a result of his influence, throughout the 19th century, quinidine was used to augment digitalis therapy. It was described as das Opium des Herzens (the opium of the heart). However, the use of quinidine to treat arrhythmia really only came into its own because a physician listened to the astute observation of one of his patients. In 1912, Karel Frederik Wenckebach saw a man with atrial fibrillation. He was a Dutch merchant, used to good order in his affairs. He would like to have good order in his heart business, also, and asked, ""why there were heart specialists if they could not abolish this very disagreeable phenomenon ... he knew himself how to get rid of his attacks. As I did not believe him, he promised to come back next morning with a regular pulse, and he did."" The man had found by chance that when he took one gram of quinine during an attack, it reliably halted it in 25 minutes; otherwise it would last for two to 14 days. Wenckebach often tried quinine again, but he succeeded in only one other patient. He made passing mention of it in his book on cardiac arrhythmias published in 1914. Four years later, Walter von Frey of Berlin reported in a leading Viennese medical journal that quinidine was the most effective of the four principal cinchona alkaloids in controlling atrial arrhythmias. == Chemistry == Quinidine-based ligands are used in AD-mix-β for Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. == Veterinary use == Quinidine sulfate is used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation in horses. == References == == External links == MedlinePlus Poisons Information Monograph",Chinidin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0014942444395273924), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.038097530603408813)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinidin,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/chinidin,https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D08458 ', [])"
2291,"('Quinine', 'Chinine', 'Chinin', '(8s,9r)-quinine', 'Quinine sulfate')",Medical,"Quinine is a medication used to treat malaria and babesiosis. This includes the treatment of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum that is resistant to chloroquine when artesunate is not available. While sometimes used for nocturnal leg cramps, quinine is not recommended for this purpose due to the risk of serious side effects. It can be taken by mouth or intravenously. Malaria resistance to quinine occurs in certain areas of the world. Quinine is also used as an ingredient in tonic water and other beverages to impart a bitter taste. Common side effects include headache, ringing in the ears, vision issues, and sweating. More severe side effects include deafness, low blood platelets, and an irregular heartbeat. Use can make one more prone to sunburn. While it is unclear if use during pregnancy carries potential for fetal harm, treating malaria during pregnancy with quinine when appropriate is still recommended. Quinine is an alkaloid, a naturally occurring chemical compound. How it works as a medicine is not entirely clear. Quinine was first isolated in 1820 from the bark of a cinchona tree, which is native to Peru, and its molecular formula was determined by Adolph Strecker in 1854. The class of chemical compounds to which it belongs is thus called the cinchona alkaloids. Bark extracts had been used to treat malaria since at least 1632 and it was introduced to Spain as early as 1636 by Jesuit missionaries returning from the New World. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Treatment of malaria with quinine marks the first known use of a chemical compound to treat an infectious disease. == Uses == === Medical === As of 2006, quinine is no longer recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a first-line treatment for malaria, because there are other substances that are equally effective with fewer side effects. They recommend that it be used only when artemisinins are not available. Quinine is also used to treat lupus and arthritis. Quinine was frequently prescribed as an off-label treatment for leg cramps at night, but this has become less common since 2010 due to a warning from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that such practice is associated with life-threatening side effects. Quinine can also act as a competitive inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that removes neurotransmitters from the brain. As an MAO inhibitor, it has potential to serve as a treatment for individuals with psychological disorders, similar to antidepressants that inhibit MAO. ==== Available forms ==== Quinine is a basic amine and is usually provided as a salt. Various existing preparations include the hydrochloride, dihydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate and gluconate. In the United States, quinine sulfate is commercially available in 324 mg tablets under the brand name Qualaquin. All quinine salts may be given orally or intravenously (IV); quinine gluconate may also be given intramuscularly (IM) or rectally (PR). The main problem with rectal administration is that the dose can be expelled before it is completely absorbed; in practice, this is corrected by giving a further half dose. No injectable preparation of quinine is licensed in the US; quinidine is used instead. === Beverages === Quinine is a flavor component of tonic water and bitter lemon soft drinks. On the soda gun behind many bars, tonic water is designated by the letter ""Q"" representing quinine. Tonic water was initially marketed as a means of delivering quinine to consumers in order to offer anti-malarial protection. According to tradition, because of the bitter taste of anti-malarial quinine tonic, British colonials in India mixed it with gin to make it more palatable, thus creating the gin and tonic cocktail, which is still popular today. While it is possible to drink enough tonic water to temporarily achieve quinine levels that offer anti-malarial protection, it is not a sustainable long-term means of protection. In France, quinine is an ingredient of an apéritif known as quinquina, or ""Cap Corse"", and the wine-based apéritif Dubonnet. In Spain, quinine (also known as ""Peruvian bark"" for its origin from the native cinchona tree) is sometimes blended into sweet Malaga wine, which is then called ""Malaga Quina"". In Italy, the traditional flavoured wine Barolo Chinato is infused with quinine and local herbs, and is served as a digestif. In Britain, the company A.G. Barr uses quinine as an ingredient in the carbonated and caffeinated beverage Irn-Bru. In Uruguay and Argentina, quinine is an ingredient of a PepsiCo tonic water named Paso de los Toros. In Denmark, it is used as an ingredient in the carbonated sports drink Faxe Kondi made by Royal Unibrew. As a flavouring agent in drinks, quinine is limited to 83 ppm (100 mg/L) in the United States, and in the European Union. === Scientific === Quinine (and quinidine) are used as the chiral moiety for the ligands used in Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation as well as for numerous other chiral catalyst backbones. Because of its relatively constant and well-known fluorescence quantum yield, quinine is used in photochemistry as a common fluorescence standard. == Contraindications == Because of the narrow difference between its therapeutic and toxic effects, quinine is a common cause of drug-induced disorders, including thrombocytopenia and thrombotic microangiopathy. Even from minor levels occurring in common beverages, quinine can have severe adverse effects involving multiple organ systems, among which are immune system effects and fever, hypotension, hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, liver toxicity, and blindness. In people with atrial fibrillation, conduction defects, or heart block, quinine can cause heart arrhythmias, and should be avoided. Quinine can cause hemolysis in G6PD deficiency (an inherited deficiency), but this risk is small and the physician should not hesitate to use quinine in people with G6PD deficiency when there is no alternative. While not necessarily an absolute contraindication, concomitant administration of quinine with drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 may lead to higher than expected plasma concentrations of the drug, due to quinine's strong inhibition of the enzyme. == Adverse effects == Quinine can cause unpredictable serious and life-threatening blood and cardiovascular reactions including low platelet count and hemolytic–uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP), long QT syndrome and other serious cardiac arrhythmias including torsades de pointes, blackwater fever, disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukopenia, and neutropenia. Some people who have developed TTP due to quinine have gone on to develop kidney failure. It can also cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock, urticaria, serious skin rashes, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, facial edema, bronchospasm, granulomatous hepatitis, and itchiness. The most common adverse effects involve a group of symptoms called cinchonism, which can include headache, vasodilation and sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing impairment, vertigo or dizziness, blurred vision, and disturbance in color perception. More severe cinchonism includes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, deafness, blindness, and disturbances in heart rhythms. Cinchonism is much less common when quinine is given by mouth, but oral quinine is not well tolerated (quinine is exceedingly bitter and many people will vomit after ingesting quinine tablets). Other drugs, such as Fansidar (sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine) or Malarone (proguanil with atovaquone), are often used when oral therapy is required. Quinine ethyl carbonate is tasteless and odourless, but is available commercially only in Japan. Blood glucose, electrolyte and cardiac monitoring are not necessary when quinine is given by mouth. Quinine has diverse unwanted interactions with numerous prescription drugs, such as potentiating the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. It is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs. == Mechanism of action == Quinine is used for its toxicity to the malarial pathogen, Plasmodium falciparum, by interfering with its ability to dissolve and metabolize hemoglobin. As with other quinoline antimalarial drugs, the precise mechanism of action of quinine has not been fully resolved, although in vitro studies indicate it inhibits nucleic acid and protein synthesis, and inhibits glycolysis in P. falciparum. The most widely accepted hypothesis of its action is based on the well-studied and closely related quinoline drug, chloroquine. This model involves the inhibition of hemozoin biocrystallization in the heme detoxification pathway, which facilitates the aggregation of cytotoxic heme. Free cytotoxic heme accumulates in the parasites, causing their deaths. Quinine may target the malaria purine nucleoside phosphorylase enzyme. == Chemistry == The UV absorption of quinine peaks around 350 nm (in UVA). Fluorescent emission peaks at around 460 nm (bright blue/cyan hue). Quinine is highly fluorescent (quantum yield ~0.58) in 0.1 M sulfuric acid solution. === Synthesis === Cinchona trees remain the only economically practical source of quinine. However, under wartime pressure during World War II, research towards its synthetic production was undertaken. A formal chemical synthesis was accomplished in 1944 by American chemists R.B. Woodward and W.E. Doering. Since then, several more efficient quinine total syntheses have been achieved, but none of them can compete in economic terms with isolation of the alkaloid from natural sources. The first synthetic organic dye, mauveine, was discovered by William Henry Perkin in 1856 while he was attempting to synthesize quinine. === Biosynthesis === In the first step of quinine biosynthesis, the enzyme strictosidine synthase catalyzes a stereoselective Pictet–Spengler reaction between tryptamine and secologanin to yield strictosidine. Suitable modification of strictosidine leads to an aldehyde. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation would initially remove one carbon from the iridoid portion and produce corynantheal. Then the tryptamine side-chain were cleaved adjacent to the nitrogen, and this nitrogen was then bonded to the acetaldehyde function to yield cinchonaminal. Ring opening in the indole heterocyclic ring could generate new amine and keto functions. The new quinoline heterocycle would then be formed by combining this amine with the aldehyde produced in the tryptamine side-chain cleavage, giving cinchonidinone. For the last step, hydroxylation and methylation gives quinine. === Catalysis === Quinine and other Cinchona alkaloids can be used as catalysts for stereoselective reactions in organic synthesis.: Table 3B Plate 560 For example, the quinine-catalyzed Michael addition of a malononitrile to α,β-enones gives a high degree of sterechemical control. == History == Quinine was used as a muscle relaxant by the Quechua people, who are indigenous to Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, to halt shivering. The Quechua would mix the ground bark of cinchona trees with sweetened water to offset the bark's bitter taste, thus producing something similar to tonic water. Spanish Jesuit missionaries were the first to bring cinchona to Europe. The Spanish had observed the Quechua's use of cinchona and were aware of the medicinal properties of cinchona bark by the 1570s or earlier: Nicolás Monardes (1571) and Juan Fragoso (1572) both described a tree, which was subsequently identified as the cinchona tree, whose bark was used to produce a drink to treat diarrhea. Quinine has been used in unextracted form by Europeans since at least the early 17th century. A popular story of how it was brought to Europe by the Countess of Chinchon was debunked by medical historian Alec Haggis around 1941. During the 17th century, malaria was endemic to the swamps and marshes surrounding the city of Rome. It had caused the deaths of several popes, many cardinals and countless common Roman citizens. Most of the Catholic priests trained in Rome had seen malaria patients and were familiar with the shivering brought on by the febrile phase of the disease. The Jesuit Agostino Salumbrino (1564–1642), an apothecary by training who lived in Lima (now in present-day Peru), observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree to treat such shivering. While its effect in treating malaria (and malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from rigors, it was a successful medicine against malaria. At the first opportunity, Salumbrino sent a small quantity to Rome for testing as a malaria treatment. In the years that followed, cinchona bark, known as Jesuit's bark or Peruvian bark, became one of the most valuable commodities shipped from Peru to Europe. When King Charles II was cured of malaria at the end of the 17th Century with quinine, it became popular in London. It remained the antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs took over. The form of quinine most effective in treating malaria was found by Charles Marie de La Condamine in 1737. In 1820, French researchers Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou first isolated quinine from the bark of a tree in the genus Cinchona – probably Cinchona pubescens – and subsequently named the substance. The name was derived from the original Quechua (Inca) word for the cinchona tree bark, quina or quina-quina, which means ""bark of bark"" or ""holy bark"". Prior to 1820, the bark was dried, ground to a fine powder, and mixed into a liquid (commonly wine) in order to be drunk. Large-scale use of quinine as a malaria prophylaxis started around 1850. In 1853 Paul Briquet published a brief history and discussion of the literature on ""quinquina"". Quinine played a significant role in the colonization of Africa by Europeans. The availability of quinine for treatment had been said to be the prime reason Africa ceased to be known as the ""white man's grave"". A historian said, ""it was quinine's efficacy that gave colonists fresh opportunities to swarm into the Gold Coast, Nigeria and other parts of west Africa"". To maintain their monopoly on cinchona bark, Peru and surrounding countries began outlawing the export of cinchona seeds and saplings in the early 19th century. In 1865, Manuel Incra Mamani collected seeds from a plant particularly high in quinine and provided them to Charles Ledger. Ledger sent them to his brother, who sold them to the Dutch government. Mamani was arrested on a seed collecting trip in 1871, and beaten so severely, likely because of providing the seeds to foreigners, that he died soon afterwards. By the late 19th century the Dutch grew the plants in Indonesian plantations. Soon they became the main suppliers of the tree. In 1913 they set up the Kina Bureau, a cartel of cinchona producers charged with controlling price and production. By the 1930s Dutch plantations in Java were producing 22 million pounds of cinchona bark, or 97% of the world's quinine production. U.S. attempts to prosecute the Kina Bureau proved unsuccessful. During World War II, Allied powers were cut off from their supply of quinine when Germany conquered the Netherlands, and Japan controlled the Philippines and Indonesia. The US had obtained four million cinchona seeds from the Philippines and began operating cinchona plantations in Costa Rica. Additionally, they began harvesting wild cinchona bark during the Cinchona Missions. Such supplies came too late. Tens of thousands of US troops in Africa and the South Pacific died of malaria due to the lack of quinine. Despite controlling the supply, the Japanese did not make effective use of quinine, and thousands of Japanese troops in the southwest Pacific died as a result. Quinine remained the antimalarial drug of choice until after World War II. Since then, other drugs that have fewer side effects, such as chloroquine, have largely replaced it. Bromo Quinine were brand name cold tablets containing quinine, manufactured by Grove Laboratories. They were first marketed in 1889 and available until at least the 1960s. Conducting research in central Missouri, John S. Sappington independently developed an anti-malaria pill from quinine. Sappington began importing cinchona bark from Peru in 1820. In 1832, using quinine derived from the cinchona bark, Sappington developed a pill to treat a variety of fevers, such as scarlet fever, yellow fever, and influenza in addition to malaria. These illnesses were widespread in the Missouri and Mississippi valleys. He manufactured and sold ""Dr. Sappington's Anti-Fever Pills"" across Missouri. Demand became so great that within three years, Sappington founded a company known as Sappington and Sons to sell his pills nationwide. == Society and culture == === Natural occurrence === The bark of Remijia contains 0.5–2% of quinine. The bark is cheaper than bark of Cinchona. As it has an intense taste, it is used for making tonic water. === Regulation in the US === From 1969 to 1992, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received 157 reports of health problems related to quinine use, including 23 which had resulted in death. In 1994, the FDA banned the marketing of over-the-counter quinine as a treatment for nocturnal leg cramps. Pfizer Pharmaceuticals had been selling the brand name Legatrin for this purpose. It is also sold as a softgel (by SmithKlineBeecham) as Q-vel. Doctors may still prescribe quinine, but the FDA has ordered firms to stop marketing unapproved drug products containing quinine. The FDA is also cautioning consumers about off-label use of quinine to treat leg cramps. Quinine is approved for treatment of malaria, but was also commonly prescribed to treat leg cramps and similar conditions. Because malaria is life-threatening, the risks associated with quinine use are considered acceptable when used to treat that condition. Though Legatrin was banned by the FDA for the treatment of leg cramps, the drug manufacturer URL Mutual has branded a quinine-containing drug named Qualaquin. It is marketed as a treatment for malaria and is sold in the United States only by prescription. In 2004, the CDC reported only 1,347 confirmed cases of malaria in the United States. === Termination of pregnancy === For much of the 20th century, women's use of an overdose of quinine to deliberately terminate a pregnancy was a relatively common abortion method in various parts of the world, including China. === Cutting agent === Quinine is sometimes detected as a cutting agent in street drugs such as cocaine and heroin. == Other animals == Quinine is used as a treatment for Cryptocaryon irritans (commonly referred to as white spot, crypto or marine ich) infection of marine aquarium fish. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Quinine at the Drug Information Portal Quinine at the International Programme on Chemical Safety ""Quinine"".

Latanoprostene bunod may cause the iris (colored part of the eye) to become darker in color. Latanoprostene bunod was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2017. == Medical uses == Latanoprostene bunod is indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure in people with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. == History == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved latanoprostene bunod based on evidence from two clinical trials that enrolled 840 participants with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The trials evaluated the benefits and side effects of latanoprostene bunod. In each trial, participants were randomly assigned to receive either latanoprostene bunod or an approved drug timolol (ophthalmic solution) every day for three months. Neither the participants nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trials were completed. The trials were conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Japan. == References ==",Vyzulta,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.4638240878121e-06), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044264530879445374)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/history/vyzulta.html,https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/vyzulta,https://www.drugs.com/pro/vyzulta.html ', [])"

Structurally, it is a saponin used as an emulsifier and gel-forming agent in foodstuffs and cosmetics. Its aglycone is enoxolone. == Pharmacokinetics == After oral ingestion, glycyrrhizin is hydrolysed to 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (enoxolone) by intestinal bacteria. After absorption from the gut, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid is metabolised to 3β-monoglucuronyl-18β-glycyrrhetinic acid in the liver. This metabolite circulates in the bloodstream. Consequently, its oral bioavailability is poor. Most of it is eliminated by bile and only a minor part (0.31–0.67%) by urine. After oral ingestion of 600 mg of glycyrrhizin the metabolite appeared in urine after 1.5 to 14 hours. Maximal concentrations (0.49 to 2.69 mg/L) were achieved after 1.5 to 39 hours and metabolite can be detected in the urine after 2 to 4 days. == Flavouring properties == Glycyrrhizin is obtained as an extract from licorice root after maceration and boiling in water. Licorice extract (glycyrrhizin) is sold in the United States as a liquid, paste, or spray-dried powder. When in specified amounts, it is approved for use as a flavor and aroma in manufactured foods, beverages, candies, dietary supplements, and seasonings. It is 30 to 50 times as sweet as sucrose (table sugar). == Adverse effects == The most widely reported side effect of glycyrrhizin use via consumption of black liquorice is reduction of blood potassium levels, which can affect body fluid balance and function of nerves. Chronic consumption of black licorice, even in moderate amounts, is associated with an increase in blood pressure, may cause irregular heart rhythm, and may have adverse interactions with prescription drugs. In extreme cases, death can occur as a result of excess consumption. == See also == 11α-Hydroxyprogesterone Glycyrrhetinic acid List of unusual deaths in the 21st century == References == == External links == Media related to Glycyrrhizin at Wikimedia Commons",Glycyrrhizic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -4.668304245569743e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -5.200166469876422e-06), (' PERSONAL', -2.641841820150148e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.012330492027103901), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0010515881003811955), ('ĠPERSON', -0.007994084618985653), ('AL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.311301275563892e-06), (',', -0.3869088292121887), ('ĠMED', -0.019132474437355995), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004122450482100248)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.16022513806819916), (' MED', -7.302704761968926e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD,PERSONAL CARE,MEDICAL;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycyrrhizin,https://www.cir-safety.org/ingredient/glycyrrhizic-acid,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7123798/ ', [])"
2294,"('Ouabain (octahydrate)', 'Acocantherine', 'G-strophanthin', 'Ouabain', 'Ouabaine')",Medical,"Ouabain or (from Somali waabaayo, ""arrow poison"" through French ouabaïo) also known as g-strophanthin, is a plant derived toxic substance that was traditionally used as an arrow poison in eastern Africa for both hunting and warfare. Ouabain is a cardiac glycoside and, in lower doses, can be used medically to treat hypotension and some arrhythmias. It acts by inhibiting the Na/K-ATPase, also known as the sodium–potassium ion pump. However, adaptations to the alpha-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase via amino acid substitutions, have been observed in certain species, namely some herbivore insect species, that have resulted in toxin resistance. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. == Sources == Ouabain can be found in the roots, stems, leaves, and seeds of the Acokanthera schimperi and Strophanthus gratus plants, both of which are native to eastern Africa. == Mechanism of action == Ouabain is a cardiac glycoside that acts by non-selectively inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase sodium–potassium ion pump. Once ouabain binds to this enzyme, the enzyme ceases to function, leading to an increase of intracellular sodium. This increase in intracellular sodium reduces the activity of the sodium–calcium exchanger (NCX), which pumps one calcium ion out of the cell and three sodium ions into the cell down their concentration gradient. Therefore, the decrease in the concentration gradient of sodium into the cell which occurs when the Na/K-ATPase is inhibited reduces the ability of the NCX to function. This in turn elevates intracellular calcium. This results in higher cardiac contractility and an increase in cardiac vagal tone. The change in ionic gradients caused by ouabain can also affect the membrane voltage of the cell and result in cardiac arrhythmias. === Symptoms === An overdose of ouabain can be detected by the presence of the following symptoms: rapid twitching of the neck and chest musculature, respiratory distress, increased and irregular heartbeat, rise in blood pressure, convulsions, wheezing, clicking, and gasping rattling. Death is caused by cardiac arrest. === Toxicology === Ouabain is a highly toxic compound, however, it has a low bioavailability and is absorbed poorly from the alimentary tract as so much of the oral dose is destroyed. Intravenous administration results in greater available concentrations. After intravenous administration, the onset of action occurs within 2–10 minutes in humans with the maximum effect enduring for 1.5 hours. Ouabain is eliminated by renal excretion, largely unchanged. == Biological effects == === Endogenous ouabain === In 1991, a specific high affinity sodium pump inhibitor indistinguishable from ouabain was first discovered in the human circulation and proposed as one of the potential mediators of long term blood pressure and the enhanced salt excretion following salt and volume loading. This agent was an inhibitor of the sodium pump that acted similarly to digitalis. A number of analytical techniques led to the conclusion that this circulating molecule was ouabain and that humans were producing it as an endogenous hormone. A large portion of the scientific community agreed that this inhibitor was endogenous ouabain and that there was strong evidence to indicate that it was synthesized in the adrenal gland. One early speculative interpretation of the analytical data led to the proposal that endogenous ouabain may have been the 11 epimer, i.e., an isomer of plant ouabain. However, this possibility was excluded by various methods including the synthesis of the 11 epimer and the demonstration that it has different chromatographic behavior from ouabain. Critically, the primary observations concerning the identification of ouabain in mammals were repeated and confirmed using a variety of tissue sources on three different continents with advanced analytical methods as summarized elsewhere. Despite widespread analytical confirmation, some questioned whether or not this endogenous substance is ouabain. The arguments were based less upon rigorous analytical data but more on the fact that immunoassays are neither entirely specific nor reliable. Hence, it was suggested that some assays for endogenous ouabain detected other compounds or failed to detect ouabain at all. Additionally, it was suggested that rhamnose, the L-sugar component of ouabain, could not be synthesized within the body despite published data to the contrary. Yet another argument against the existence of endogenous ouabain was the lack of effect of rostafuroxin (a first generation ouabain receptor antagonist) on blood pressure in an unselected population of hypertensive patients. === Medical uses === Ouabain is no longer approved for use in the USA. In France and Germany, however, intravenous ouabain has a long history in the treatment of heart failure, and some continue to advocate its use intravenously and orally in angina pectoris and myocardial infarction despite its poor and variable absorption. The positive properties of ouabain regarding the prophylaxis and treatment of these two indications are documented by several studies. == Animal use of ouabain == The African crested rat (Lophiomys imhausi) has a broad, white-bordered strip of hairs covering an area of glandular skin on the flank. When the animal is threatened or excited, the mane on its back erects and this flank strip parts, exposing the glandular area. The hairs in this flank area are highly specialised; at the tips they are like ordinary hairs, but are otherwise spongy, fibrous, and absorbent. The rat is known to deliberately chew the roots and bark of the Poison-arrow tree (Acokanthera schimperi), which contains ouabain. After the rat has chewed the tree, instead of swallowing the poison it slathers the resulting masticate onto its specialised flank hairs which are adapted to absorb the poisonous mixture. It thereby creates a defense mechanism that can sicken or even kill predators which attempt to bite it. == Synthesis == The total synthesis of ouabain was achieved in 2008 by Deslongchamps laboratory in Canada. It was synthesized under the hypothesis that a polyanionic cyclization (double Michael addition followed by aldol condensation) would allow access to a tetracyclic intermediate with the desired functionality. The figure below shows the key steps in the synthesis of ouabain. In their synthesis, Zhang et al. from the Deslongchamps laboratory condensed cyclohexenone A with Nazarov substitute B in a double Michael addition to produce tricycle C. At the indicated position, C was reduced to the aldehyde and the alcohol group was protected with p-methoxybenzyl ether (PMB) to form the aldol precursor needed to produce D. After several steps, intermediate E was produced. E contained all the required functionalities and stereochemistry needed to produce ouabain. The structure of E was confirmed by comparison against the degradation product of ouabain. Methylation of E, catalyzed by rhodium, produced F. The dehydroxylation and selective oxidation of the secondary hydroxy group of F produced G. G reacted with triphenyl phosphoranylidene ketene and the ester bonds in G were hydrolyzed to produce ouabagenin, a precursor to ouabain. The glycosylation of ouabagenin with rhamnose produced ouabain. == History == === Africa === Poisons derived from Acokanthera plants are known to have been used in Africa as far back as the 3rd century BC when Theophrastus reported a toxic substance that the Ethiopians would smear on their arrows. The poisons derived from this genus of plants were used throughout eastern Africa, typically as arrow poisons for hunting and warfare. Acokanthera schimperi, in particular, exhibits a very large amount of ouabain, which the Kenyans, Tanzanians, Rwandans, Ethiopians, and Somalis would use as an arrow poison. The poison was extracted from the branches and leaves of the plant by boiling them over a fire. Arrows would then be dipped into the concentrated black tar-like juice that formed. Often, certain magical additives were also mixed in with the ouabain extract in order to make the poison work according to the hunter's wishes. In Kenya, the Giriama and Langulu poison makers would add an elephant shrew to the poison mixture in order to facilitate the pursuit of their prey. They had observed that an elephant shrew would always run straight ahead or follow a direct path and thought that these properties would be transferred to the poison. A poisonous arrow made with this shrew was thought to cause the hunted animal to behave like the shrew and run in a straight path. In Rwanda members of the Nyambo tribe, also known poison arrow makers, harvest the Aconkathera plants according to how many dead insects are found under it - more dead insects under a shrub indicating a higher potency of poison. Although ouabain was used as an arrow poison primarily for hunting, it was also used during battle. One example of this occurred during a battle against the Portuguese, who had stormed Mombasa in 1505. Portuguese records indicated that they had suffered a great deal from the poisoned arrows. === Europe === European imperial expansion and exploration into Africa overlapped with the rise of the European pharmaceutical industry towards the end of the nineteenth century. British troops were the target of arrows poisoned with the extracts of various Strophanthus species. They were familiar with the deadly properties of these plants and brought samples back to Europe. Around this time, interest in the plant grew. It was known that ouabain was a cardiac poison, but there was some speculation about its potential medical uses. In 1882, ouabain was first isolated from the plant by the French chemist Léon-Albert Arnaud as an amorphous substance, which he identified as a glycoside. Ouabain was seen as a possible treatment for certain cardiac conditions. == See also == K-Strophanthidin == References == == External links ==",Ouabaine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.16028769314289093), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.0009750670287758112), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.4868770196917467e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.06200231611728668), (' INDUSTR', -0.31338265538215637), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.01003270223736763), ('ICAL', -3.6954811548639555e-06), (',', -0.00010072677832795307), ('ĠEND', -0.041465822607278824), ('OG', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.3869174122810364), ('ĠINDU', -0.10832910984754562), ('ST', -2.753696753643453e-05), ('RI', -1.0967194612021558e-05), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03807147964835167)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.008400860242545605), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0011703446507453918), (' END', -0.0011409306898713112), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouabain?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=6, title='Ouabain', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouabain?utm_source=openai')])"

2296,"('Dapansutrile', 'Dapansutrile [inn]', 'Dapansutrile(olt1177)', 'Dapansutrile (usan/inn)', 'Dapansutrile [usan:inn]')",Medical,"Dapansutrile (OLT1177) is an inhibitor of the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing receptor 3) inflammasome. An inflammasome can be defined as an immune system receptor that induces inflammation through the activation of caspase 1 and caspase 11 when it is triggered by damaged cells, microbial pathogens, and stress. NLRP3 is a canonical inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome comprises NLRP3, the apoptosis spec-like protein (ASC) and the caspase-1 (Figure 1). The NLRP3 inflammasome forms by binding to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) that activate caspase 1 which then signals for the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 resulting in pyroptosis Constant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is believed to play a direct or indirect role in acute arthritis, atherosclerosis and various neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD),,. This drug was developed by Olactec Therapeutics with the purpose of decreasing IL-1β peripheral inflammation by binding to the NLRP3 protein and inhibiting the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Interestingly, dapansutrile has also been found to reduce levels of pro inflammatory cytokines IL-18 without interfering with TNF-α levels. Stressed cells in the system can ignite the NLRP3 inflammasome which in turn produces the secretion inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Dapansutrile has tested in clinical trials and has been proposed as a beneficial compound for the remedy of osteoarthritis, and gouty arthritis. Nevertheless, other preclinical research has proposed dapansutrile to be potentially beneficial for heart failure and multiple sclerosis. == Molecular Structure and Properties == Dapansutrile is a β-sulfonyl nitrile compound with four carbon, seven hydrogen, one nitrogen, two oxygen, and one sulfur atom (Figure 2). The molecular formula of this compound is C4H7NO2S, and it carries a molecular weight of 133.7 g/mol. Compound acknowledged by the names of dapansutrile, OLT1177, and 3-(methylsulfonyl)propanenitrile. == Synthesis == OLT1177 is synthesized by alkylation of sodium methanesulfinate with 3-bromopropionitrile. This reaction produces crude methylsulfonylpropionitrile which is then purified through dissolution into acetone, filtration of the sodium bromide bi-product, solvent exchange via distillation, and recrystallization from ethanol. == Dapansutrile's Mechanism of Action == == Dapansutrile's Reaction Pathways == Dapansutrile denoted as a β-sulfonyl nitrile molecule. Its mechanism of action induces a Pinner reaction which is initiated by reacting with thiols, alcohols and amines. Thus, leading to the formation of thiomidates, imidates and amidines respectively. The nitrile group of OLT1177 is still not denoted as a covalent, noncovalent, irreversible or non-reversible inhibitor as there are currently no studies about its reactivity. Nevertheless, some researchers believe that dapansutrile promotes inhibition of NLRP3 through covalent bonds (Figure 4). == Summary Biological Effects of Dapansutrile == == Pharmacokinetics == === Selectivity === Dapansutrile targets the inhibition of the NLRP3 ATPase and thus blocks the activation of the inflammasome's ASC, and caspase-1 interaction; thereby preventing the assembly of the inflammasome and inflammatory signals such as IL-1β and IL-18. This drug also inhibits pyroptosis. Nevertheless, the drug does not impact the mRNA levels of the NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 genes. Research of dapansutrile presents that the compound solely inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome. Murine macrophages were used and stimulated with lipopolysaccharides and either flagellin or the dsDNA analog Poly(dA:dT) to activate inflammasomes such as NLRC4 and AIM 2 respectively. When Dapansutrile was added they found no difference in the release of TNF-α and IL-1β cytokines to when these inflammasomes were activated. === Other Drug Targets === Other known targets of dapansutrile include several phosphorylated kinases such as Src; Fyn; HcK; STAT3. Human monocyte derived macrophages (HMDM) cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, and nigericin. Dapansutrile was then added and they found a 26%, 35%, 43% and 33% reduction of these phosphorylated kinases respectively. === Dosages === In vitro: Human derived macrophages were cultured to study the effect of dapansutrile cytokine production. It was found that dapansutrile at a 1 μM dose inhibited secretion of IL-1β by 60%, and IL-18 levels by 70%. The drug was also found to selectively inhibit pyroptosis at 10 μM. In vivo: A phase one clinical trial of 35 subjects was conducted to establish the safety of dapansutrile. The daily mean plasma concentration maximum (Cmax) for a single oral dose of dapansutrile was 2,700 ng/mL for the 100-mg dose, 9,800 ng/mL for the 300 mg dose and 32,00 ng/mL for the 1,000 mg dose (Figure 5). Dapansutrile was also studied if given repeatedly once per day for 8 days with a dose of either 100 mg, and 300 mg, or 1,000 mg. The subjects mean plasma concentration on day 8 were 4,800 ng/mL for the 100 mg dose, 15,800 ng/mL for the 300 mg dose and 41,400 ng/mL for the 1,000 mg dose. == Pharmacodynamics == === Safety and Efficacy of Dapansutrile === In the Marchetti et al. study, seven of the 35 subjects reported adverse events. Five of the cases were in the single dose study while two cases were in the multi-regimen group. However, the adverse effects were considered unrelated to dapansutrile. Subjects presented no changes in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), urinalysis, heart rate, liver function enzymes or acute phase proteins in the cohort after an 8-day trial with up to daily 1,000 mg dosing of dapansutrile. == Potential Therapeutic Applications == === Neurodegenerative diseases === Multiple Sclerosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the immune system deteriorating myelin. Myelin damage leads to the disruption of neuronal signaling, and dysregulated inflammatory levels. Dapansutrile was used in the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model to understand its possible underlying effects for MS. It was found that mice fed with the dapansutrile diet protected the mice from demyelination in the spinal cord as well as decreased their levels of interleukins IL-1β and IL-18. Currently, it is unclear whether the drug could inhibit microglial reactivity, but currently it has no known benefits to aid in the prevention of dementia and cognitive function. === Inflammation === Gouty Arthritis: Gouty arthritis is an inflammatory joint disorder, partly induced to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and excess IL-1β activation which leads to gout attacks. This is due to excess uric acid in the blood which promotes the formation of uric acid crystals in the joints. Uric acid is a known danger signal and induce the cleavage signal of the caspase-1 NLRP3 inflammasome. Animal Model Experiments: In 2018, two murine models were used to validate Dapansutrile as a drug beneficial for acute joint inflammation. They injected zymosan or monosodium urate crystals in order to induce gouty arthritis in mice. OLT1177 was then either injected intraperitoneally or through their diet. In essence, the drug reduced joint inflammation, as well as interleukin levels demonstrating its therapeutic benefit for this disease. Clinical Trials: As for clinical trials, Olatec Therapeutics also conducted a phase 2.a trials where Dapansutrile was given to 29 subjects with gouty arthritis. === Cardiovascular Diseases === Acute Myocardial Infarction/ Heart Attack: One of the major downstream effects of having coronary artery disease is possibility of having an acute myocardial infarction or heart attack. In mouse models, Dapansutrile was found to decrease infarct size a dose-dependent manner. Heart Failure: Olatec Therapeutics conducted a phase 1 clinical trial for Dapansutrile as a potential therapeutic for systolic heart failure. They have carried out a Phase 1 double blinded study with a total of 30 subjects to assess the drug's safety and pharmacodynamics. The drug was given in capsule form and the subjects were divided into 3 cohorts. Each cohort had 8 subjects taking an oral capsule with 100 mg Dapansutrile while 2 subjects were given the placebo capsule. Although the completion date of this clinical trial was on November 21, 2019, the results of the study have not yet been published. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) / COVID-19: Dapansutrile has been proposed by a number of scientists as a measure to reduce cardiovascular outcomes that seem to be brought on by COVID-19. The rationale behind using Dapansutrile is to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and reduce the chances of a cytokine storm which seems to cause multi-organ failure in COVID-19 patients. Subjects with COVID-19 have shown to have an increased concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in the cytokine storm, and thus producing an exhaustion of lymphocytes. NLRP3 not only activates cytokines but other key players that can inflict myocardial damages, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and its inhibition has been found to deter these outcomes. Thus, dapansutrile is proposed as a possible mediator to relief and prevent COVID-19 symptoms and effects. == References ==",Dapansutrile,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019516960019245744), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014181901700794697)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33005902/?utm_source=openai), [businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240220762945/en/Olatec-Therapeutics-to-Conduct-a-Phase-2-Clinical-Trial-in-Patients-with-Early-Parkinson%E2%80%99s-Disease-with-its-NLRP3-Inhibitor-Dapansutrile?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=338, start_index=9, title='Dapansutrile, an oral selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, for treatment of gout flares: an open-label, dose-adaptive, proof-of-concept, phase 2a trial - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33005902/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=338, start_index=9, title='Olatec Therapeutics to Conduct a Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Early Parkinson’s Disease with its NLRP3 Inhibitor, Dapansutrile | Business Wire', type='url_citation', url='https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240220762945/en/Olatec-Therapeutics-to-Conduct-a-Phase-2-Clinical-Trial-in-Patients-with-Early-Parkinson%E2%80%99s-Disease-with-its-NLRP3-Inhibitor-Dapansutrile?utm_source=openai')])"

When 'C7/3-phthalimido-propyl' was combined with competitive antagonists such as (+)-benzetimide, atropine or homatropine the degree of antagonism was greater than expected for combination of 2 competitive antagonists. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in the presence of practolol (1.5 X 10(-5) M). The results obtained with 'C7/3-phthalimido-propyl' are shown to agree with theoretical predictions for a metaffinoid antagonist which influences the affinities of both agonists and competitive antagonists by combining with a regulatory site distinct from, but interdependent with the binding sites for agonists and competitive antagonists. Further, it is shown that the alkane-bis-ammonium compound produces a much greater reduction in the affinity of carbachol than that of the competitive antagonists and as a consequence causes 'supra-additive' effects when combined with a competitive antagonist. The reduction in the affinity of (+)-benzetimide produced by 'C7/3-phthalimido-propyl' did not differ significantly from the reduction in the affinities of atropine or homatropine. The synthesis and evaluation of benzetimide derivatives showing potent CXCR3 antagonism are described. Optimization of the screening hits led to the identification of more potent CXCR3 antagonists devoid of anti-cholinergic activity and identification of the key pharmacophore moieties of the series. 1 Benzetimide, possessing two stable enantiomers, dexetimide and levetimide, has been investigated in guinea-pig atria with respect to its atropine-like action and its tissue distribution. 2 The antagonistic potency of dexetimide was found to be over 6000 times higher than that of levetimide, the pA2 values being 9.82 and 6.0 respectively. 3 The tissue accumulation was investigated for both isomers in the concentration range from 1.5 X 10(-9) M to 10(-6) M yielding tissue to medium ratios (T/M) of between approximately 50 and 10. The highest values were found for the lowest concentrations. At any concentration investigated, dexetimide exhibited a higher uptake than the levoisomer. 4 The rate of uptake and washout of dexetimide was extremely slow, that of levetimide being considerably faster at equimolar concentrations. The same pattern held true for the onset and decline of the antagonistic action. 5 The high accumulation was found to be almost entirely due to unspecific binding. Even in the case of dexetimide the relative size of the receptor compartment could not be determined. The unspecific binding sites displayed a certain stereoselectivity but to a much lesser extent than the specific receptor binding sites.",Benzetimide,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.011048528365790844), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.3992581367492676), ('ICAL', -6.318072337307967e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38698986172676086)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005530327325686812), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.bertin-bioreagent.com/benzetimide-hydrochloride/,https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D003909,https://www.medchemexpress.com/dexetimide.html ', [])"

It is a fatty alcohol. Sulfate esters of lauryl alcohol, especially sodium lauryl sulfate, are very widely used as surfactants. Sodium lauryl sulfate and the related dodecanol derivatives ammonium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate are all used in shampoos. Dodecanol is tasteless, colorless, and has a floral odor. == Production and use == In 1993, the European demand of dodecanol was around 60,000 tonnes per year. It can be obtained from palm oil or coconut oil fatty acids and methyl esters by hydrogenation. It may also be produced synthetically via the Ziegler process. A classic laboratory method involves Bouveault-Blanc reduction of ethyl laurate. Dodecanol is used to make surfactants, which are used in lubricating oils, and pharmaceuticals. Millions of tons of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) are produced annually by sulfation of dodecyl alcohol: SO3 + CH3(CH2)10CH2OH → CH3(CH2)10CH2OSO3H CH3(CH2)10CH2OSO3H + NaOH→CH3(CH2)10CH2OSO3Na + H2O Dodecanol is used as an emollient.

2302,"('Tannic acid', 'Glycerite', 'Gallotannin', 'Gallotannic acid', 'Chinese gallotannin')","Food, Medical","Tannic acid is a specific form of tannin, a type of polyphenol. Its weak acidity (pKa around 6) is due to the numerous phenol groups in the structure. The chemical formula for commercial tannic acid is often given as C76H52O46, which corresponds with decagalloyl glucose, but in fact it is a mixture of polygalloyl glucoses or polygalloyl quinic acid esters with the number of galloyl moieties per molecule ranging from 2 up to 12 depending on the plant source used to extract the tannic acid. Commercial tannic acid is usually extracted from any of the following plant parts: Tara pods (Caesalpinia spinosa), gallnuts from Rhus semialata or Quercus infectoria or Sicilian sumac leaves (Rhus coriaria). According to the definitions provided in external references such as international pharmacopoeia, Food Chemicals Codex and FAO-WHO tannic acid monograph only tannins obtained from the above-mentioned plants can be considered as tannic acid. Sometimes extracts from chestnut or oak wood are also described as tannic acid but this is an incorrect use of the term. It is a yellow to light brown amorphous powder. While tannic acid is a specific type of tannin (plant polyphenol), the two terms are sometimes (incorrectly) used interchangeably. The long-standing misuse of the terms, and its inclusion in scholarly articles has compounded the confusion. This is particularly widespread in relation to green tea and black tea, both of which contain many different types of tannins not just exclusively tannic acid. Tannic acid is not an appropriate standard for any type of tannin analysis because of its poorly defined composition. == Quercitannic and gallotannic acids == Quercitannic acid is one of the two forms of tannic acid found in oak bark and leaves. The other form is called gallotannic acid and is found in oak galls. The quercitannic acid molecule is also present in quercitron, a yellow dye obtained from the bark of the Eastern black oak (Quercus velutina), a forest tree indigenous in North America. It is described as a yellowish-brown amorphous powder. In 1838, Jöns Jacob Berzelius wrote that quercitannate is used to dissolve morphine. In 1865 in the fifth volume of ""A dictionary of chemistry"", Henry Watts wrote : It exhibits with ferric salts the same reactions as gallotannic acid. It differs however from the latter in not being convertible into gallic acid, and not yielding pyrogallic acid by dry distillation. It is precipitated by sulfuric acid in red flocks. (Stenhouse, Ann. Ch. Pharm. xlv. 16.) According to Rochleder (ibid lxiii. 202), the tannic acid of black tea is the same as that of oak-bark. In 1880, Etti gave for it the molecular formula C17H16O9. He described it as an unstable substance, having a tendency to give off water to form anhydrides (called phlobaphenes), one of which is called oak-red (C34H30O17). For him, it was not a glycoside. In Allen's ""Commercial Organic Analysis"", published in 1912, the formula given was C19H16O10. Other authors gave other molecular formulas like C28H26O15, while another formula found is C28H24O11. According to Lowe, two forms of the principle exist – ""one soluble in water, of the formula C28H28O14, and the other scarcely soluble, C28H24O12. Both are changed by the loss of water into oak red, C28H22O11."" Quercitannic acid was for a time a standard used to assess the phenolic content in spices, given as quercitannic acid equivalent. In an interesting historical note, the inventor of carborundum, Edward G. Acheson, discovered that gallotannic acid greatly improved the plasticity of clay. In his report of this discovery in 1904 he noted that the only known historical reference to the use of organic material added to clay is the use of straw mixed with clay described in the Bible, Exodus 1:11 and that the Egyptians must have been aware of his (re-)discovery. He stated ""This explains why the straw was used and why the children of Israel were successful in substituting stubble for straw, a course that would hardly be possible, were the fibre of the straw depended upon as a bond feasible for the clay, but quite reasonable where the extract of the plant was used."" == Uses == Tannins are a basic ingredient in the chemical staining of wood, and are already present in woods like oak, walnut, and mahogany. Tannic acid can be applied to woods low in tannin so chemical stains that require tannin content will react. The presence of tannins in the bark of redwood (Sequoia) is a strong natural defense against wildfire, decomposition and infestation by certain insects such as termites. It is found in the seeds, bark, cones, and heartwood. Tannic acid is a common mordant used in the dyeing process for cellulose fibers such as cotton, often combined with alum and/or iron. The tannin mordant should be done first as metal mordants combine well with the fiber-tannin complex. However this use has lost considerable interest. Similarly tannic acid can also be used as an aftertreatment to improve wash fastness properties of acid dyed polyamide. It is also an alternative for fluorocarbon aftertreatments to impart anti-staining properties to polyamide yarn or carpets. However, due to economic considerations currently the only widespread use as textile auxiliary is the use as an agent to improve chlorine fastness, i.e. resistance against dye bleaching due to cleaning with hypochlorite solutions in high-end polyamide 6,6-based carpets and swimwear. It is, however, used in relatively small quantities for the activation of upholstery flock; this serves as an anti-static treatment. Tannic acid is used in the conservation of ferrous (iron based) metal objects to passivate and inhibit corrosion. Tannic acid reacts with the corrosion products to form a more stable compound, thus preventing further corrosion from taking place. After treatment the tannic acid residue is generally left on the object so that if moisture reaches the surface the tannic acid will be rehydrated and prevent or slow any corrosion. Tannic acid treatment for conservation is very effective and widely used but it does have a significant visual effect on the object, turning the corrosion products black and any exposed metal dark blue. It should also be used with care on objects with copper alloy components as the tannic acid can have a slight etching effect on these metals. Tannic acid is also found in commercially available iron/steel corrosion treatments, such as Hammerite Kurust. === Use in food === In many parts of the world, its uses in food are permitted. In the United States, tannic acid is generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration for use in baked goods and baking mixes, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, frozen dairy products, soft and hard candy, meat products, and rendered animal fat. According to EU directive 89/107/EEC, tannic acid cannot be considered as a food additive and consequently does not hold an E number. Under directive 89/107/EEC, tannic acid can be referred to as a food ingredient. The E-number E181 is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to tannic acid; this in fact refers to the INS number assigned to tannic acid under the FAO-WHO Codex Alimentarius system. === Uses as a medication === In conjunction with magnesium and sometimes activated charcoal, tannic acid was once used as a treatment for many toxic substances, such as strychnine, mushroom, and ptomaine poisonings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The introduction of tannic acid treatment of severe burn injuries in the 1920s significantly reduced mortality rates. During World War I, tannic acid dressings were prescribed to treat ""burns, whether caused by incendiary bombs, mustard gas, or lewisite"". After the war this use was abandoned due to the development of more modern treatment regimens. == Hazards == Tannic acid could cause potential health hazards such as damage to the eye, skin, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. It may cause irritation, redness, pain, blurred vision, and possible eye damage. When tannic acid is absorbed through the skin in harmful amounts, it may cause irritation, redness, and pain. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are symptoms of tannic acid ingestion and prolonged exposure may cause liver damage. Upon inhalation, tannic acid may cause respiratory tract irritation. == Crocodilian coloration == Skin color in Crocodilia (crocodiles and alligators) is very dependent on water quality. Algae-laden waters produce greener skin, while tannic acid in the water from decay of leaves from overhanging trees (which produces some types of blackwater rivers) often produce darker skin in these animals. == References == == General references == The Merck Index, 9th edition, Merck & Co., Rahway, New Jersey, 1976.",Gallotannic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.03643171489238739), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -6.2729995988775045e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.04191436618566513), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.24270828068256378), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0009227308910340071), ('ĠINDU', -0.1045331358909607), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.20144422352313995), ('ĠMED', -0.01393834874033928), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018176065757870674)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -1.0206720617134124e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannic_acid ', [])"

2304,"('Xanthine', 'Isoxanthine', 'Xanthin', 'Pseudoxanthine', 'Xanthic oxide')","Endogenous, Medical","Xanthine ( or , from Ancient Greek ξανθός xanthós 'yellow' for its yellowish-white appearance; archaically xanthic acid; systematic name 3,7-dihydropurine-2,6-dione) is a purine base found in most human body tissues and fluids, as well as in other organisms. Several stimulants are derived from xanthine, including caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine. Xanthine is a product on the pathway of purine degradation. It is created from guanine by guanine deaminase. It is created from hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase. It is also created from xanthosine by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Xanthine is subsequently converted to uric acid by the action of the xanthine oxidase enzyme. == Use and production == Xanthine is used as a drug precursor for human and animal medications, and is produced as a pesticide ingredient. == Clinical significance == Derivatives of xanthine (known collectively as xanthines) are a group of alkaloids commonly used for their effects as mild stimulants and as bronchodilators, notably in the treatment of asthma or influenza symptoms. In contrast to other, more potent stimulants like sympathomimetic amines, xanthines mainly act to oppose the actions of adenosine, and increase alertness in the central nervous system. === Toxicity === Methylxanthines (methylated xanthines), which include caffeine, aminophylline, IBMX, paraxanthine, pentoxifylline, theobromine, theophylline, and 7-methylxanthine (heteroxanthine), among others, affect the airways, increase heart rate and force of contraction, and at high concentrations can cause cardiac arrhythmias. In high doses, they can lead to convulsions that are resistant to anticonvulsants. Methylxanthines induce gastric acid and pepsin secretions in the gastrointestinal tract. Methylxanthines are metabolized by cytochrome P450 in the liver. If swallowed, inhaled, or exposed to the eyes in high amounts, xanthines can be harmful, and they may cause an allergic reaction if applied topically. === Pharmacology === In in vitro pharmacological studies, xanthines act as both competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors and nonselective adenosine receptor antagonists. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors raise intracellular cAMP, activate PKA, inhibit TNF-α synthesis, and leukotriene and reduce inflammation and innate immunity. Adenosine receptor antagonists inhibit sleepiness-inducing adenosine. However, different analogues show varying potency at the numerous subtypes, and a wide range of synthetic xanthines (some nonmethylated) have been developed searching for compounds with greater selectivity for phosphodiesterase enzyme or adenosine receptor subtypes. === Pathology === People with rare genetic disorders, specifically xanthinuria and Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, lack sufficient xanthine oxidase and cannot convert xanthine to uric acid. == Possible formation in absence of life == Studies reported in 2008, based on 12C/13C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the Murchison meteorite, suggested that xanthine and related chemicals, including the RNA component uracil, have been formed extraterrestrially. In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting xanthine and related organic molecules, including the DNA and RNA components adenine and guanine, were found in outer space. == See also == DMPX Murchison meteorite Theobromine poisoning Xanthene Xanthone Xanthydrol Kidney stone disease == References ==",Xanthic oxide,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.06239314004778862), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00017994173686020076), ('US', 0.0), (',', -7.505351095460355e-05), (' MED', -0.11315056681632996), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.011061973869800568), (' INDUSTR', -0.6335722208023071), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('EN', -0.1062559112906456), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.0006828360492363572), ('ĠMED', -0.2278723120689392), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.16032291948795319), ('ĠINDU', -0.20314890146255493), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0381801500916481)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Xanthine-oxide,https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/26036,https://theodora.com/encyclopedia/x/xanthic_acid.html ', [])"

A systematic name for this compound is 2-aminohexanoic acid. The compound is an isomer of the more common amino acid leucine. Like most other α-amino acids, norleucine is chiral. It is a white, water-soluble solid. == Occurrence == Together with norvaline, norleucine is found in small amounts in some bacterial strains where its concentration can approach millimolar. Its biosynthesis has been examined. It arises via the action of 2-isopropylmalate synthase on α-ketobutyrate. The incorporation of Nle into peptides reflects the imperfect selectivity of the associated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. In Miller–Urey experiments probing prebiotic synthesis of amino acids, norleucine and especially norvaline are formed. == Uses == It is nearly isosteric with methionine, even though it does not contain sulfur. For this reason, norleucine has been used to probe the role of methionine in Amyloid-β peptide (AβP) the central constituent of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease.

2310,"('Fenoterol (hydrobromide)', 'Th-1165a', 'Phenoterol (hydrobromide)', 'Fenoterol', 'Phenoterol')",Medical,"Fenoterol is a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist and bronchodilator medication used in the treatment of asthma. Fenoterol is produced and sold by Boehringer Ingelheim as Berotec N and in combination with ipratropium as Berodual N. It was patented in 1962 and came into medical use in 1971 but, in the 1980s, concerns emerged about its safety and its use being associated with an increased risk of death. == Adverse effects == Fenoterol is a short-acting β2 agonist that also stimulates β1 receptors. Fenoterol has more cardiovascular toxicity than isoprenaline or salbutamol. Fenoterol was widely used in New Zealand in the late 1970s and the 1980s until it was removed from the New Zealand drug tariff in 1989 because its introduction and widespread use was associated with an epidemic of asthma deaths. A series of case-control studies demonstrated that asthmatics using fenoterol were more likely to die of asthma compared with controls treated with alternative beta agonists; this risk of asthma deaths was particularly high in severe asthmatics. The mortality rate declined following withdrawal of fenoterol without evidence supporting an alternative explanation for the abrupt rise and fall in asthma deaths. Data did not support confounding by severity as the explanation for the excess mortality. There are alternative short-acting beta agonists that have not been associated with increased mortality (e.g. salbutamol [albuterol]). == Stereoisomers == 5-(1-Hydroxy-2-{[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino}ethyl)benzene-1,3-diol is a molecule with two different stereogenic centers. Thus, four stereoisomers may exist, the (R,R)-, (R,S)-, (S,R)- and (S,S)-stereoisomers (see the figure below). Fenoterol is a racemate of the (R,R)- and the (S,S)-enantiomers.

2312,"('Amoxicillin', 'Amoxycillin', 'Amoxicillin anhydrous', 'Amoxicilline', 'P-hydroxyampicillin')",Medical,"Amoxicillin is an antibiotic medication belonging to the aminopenicillin class of the penicillin family. The drug is used to treat bacterial infections such as middle ear infection, strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, odontogenic infections, and urinary tract infections. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth), or less commonly by either intramuscular injection or by an IV bolus injection, which is a relatively quick intravenous injection lasting from a couple of seconds to a few minutes. Common adverse effects include nausea and rash. It may also increase the risk of yeast infections and, when used in combination with clavulanic acid, diarrhea. It should not be used in those who are allergic to penicillin. While usable in those with kidney problems, the dose may need to be decreased. Its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding does not appear to be harmful. Amoxicillin is in the β-lactam family of antibiotics. Amoxicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into medical use in 1972. Amoxil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1974, and in the United Kingdom in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in children. Amoxicillin is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 26th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 20 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Amoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections, including acute otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, Salmonella infections, Lyme disease, and chlamydia infections. === Acute otitis media === Children with acute otitis media who are younger than six months of age are generally treated with amoxicillin or other antibiotics. Although most children with acute otitis media who are older than two years old do not benefit from treatment with amoxicillin or other antibiotics, such treatment may be helpful in children younger than two years old with acute otitis media that is bilateral or accompanied by ear drainage. In the past, amoxicillin was dosed three times daily when used to treat acute otitis media, which resulted in missed doses in routine ambulatory practice. There is now evidence that two-times daily dosing or once-daily dosing has similar effectiveness. === Respiratory infections === Most sinusitis infections are caused by viruses, for which amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are ineffective, and the small benefit gained by amoxicillin may be overridden by the adverse effects. Amoxicillin is considered the first-line empirical treatment for most cases of uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis in children and adults when culture data is unavailable. Amoxicillin is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, either alone (mild to moderate severity disease) or in combination with a macrolide. Research suggests that is as effective as co-amoxiclav (a broad-spectrum antibiotic) for people admitted to hospital with pneumonia, regardless of its severity. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not ""severe"". Amoxicillin is used in post-exposure inhalation of anthrax to prevent disease progression and for prophylaxis. === H. pylori === It is effective as one part of a multi-drug regimen for the treatment of stomach infections of Helicobacter pylori. It is typically combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (such as omeprazole) and a macrolide antibiotic (such as clarithromycin); other drug combinations are also effective. === Lyme borreliosis === Amoxicillin is effective for the treatment of early cutaneous Lyme borreliosis; the effectiveness and safety of oral amoxicillin is neither better nor worse than common alternatively-used antibiotics. === Odontogenic infections === Amoxicillin is used to treat odontogenic infections, infections of the tongue, lips, and other oral tissues. It may be prescribed following a tooth extraction, particularly in those with compromised immune systems. === Skin infections === Amoxicillin is occasionally used for the treatment of skin infections, such as acne vulgaris. It is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline. === Infections in infants in resource-limited settings === Amoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child. Amoxicillin in combination with gentamicin is recommended for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option. === Prevention of bacterial endocarditis === It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis and as a pain-reliever in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent Streptococcus pneumoniae and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax. The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis. These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis. === Combination treatment === Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin. For this reason, it may be combined with clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug combination is commonly called co-amoxiclav. === Spectrum of activity === It is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, β-lactam antibiotic in the aminopenicillin family used to treat susceptible Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics. In general, Streptococcus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus, Haemophilus, Helicobacter, and Moraxella are susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to it. Some E. coli and most clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are similar to those for other β-lactam antibiotics, including nausea, vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated colitis. Diarrhea (loose bowel movements) may also occur. Rarer adverse effects include mental and behavioral changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, hyperactivity, agitation, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these adverse effects. Similarly to other penicillins, amoxicillin has been associated with an increased risk of seizures. Amoxicillin-induced neurotoxicity has been especially associated with concentrations of greater than 110 mg/L. The onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in the fingertips and around the groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously. However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased. For some people allergic to amoxicillin, the adverse effects can be fatal due to anaphylaxis. Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused a drug-induced immunoallergic-type hepatitis in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested lethargy, vomiting, and renal dysfunction. There is poor reporting of adverse effects of amoxicillin from clinical trials. For this reason, the severity and frequency of adverse effects from amoxicillin are probably higher than reported in clinical trials. === Nonallergic rash === Between 3 and 10% of children taking amoxicillin (or ampicillin) show a late-developing (>72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously) rash, which is sometimes referred to as the ""amoxicillin rash"". The rash can also occur in adults and may rarely be a component of the DRESS syndrome. The rash is described as maculopapular or morbilliform (measles-like; therefore, in medical literature, it is called ""amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash"".). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two. A nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of infectious mononucleosis. Some studies indicate about 80–90% of patients with acute Epstein–Barr virus infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash. == Interactions == Amoxicillin may interact with these drugs: Anticoagulants (dabigatran, warfarin). Methotrexate (chemotherapy and immunosuppressant). Typhoid, Cholera and BCG vaccines. Probenecid reduces renal excretion and increases blood levels of amoxicillin. Oral contraceptives potentially become less effective. Allopurinol (gout treatment). Mycophenolate (immunosuppressant) When given intravenously or intramuscularly: It should not be mixed with blood products, or proteinaceous fluids (including protein hydrolysates) or with intravenous lipid emulsions aminoglycoside should be injected at a separate site from amoxicillin if the patient is prescribed both medications at the same time. Neither drug should be mixed in a syringe. Neither should they be mixed in an intravenous fluid container or giving set because of loss of activity of the aminoglycoside under these conditions. ciprofloxacin should not be mixed with amoxicillin. Infusions containing dextran or bicarbonate should not be mixed with amoxicillin solutions. == Pharmacology == Amoxicillin (α-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin) is a semisynthetic derivative of penicillin with a structure similar to ampicillin but with better absorption when taken by mouth, thus yielding higher concentrations in blood and in urine. Amoxicillin diffuses easily into tissues and body fluids. It will cross the placenta and is excreted into breastmilk in small quantities. It is metabolized by the liver and excreted into the urine. It has an onset of 30 minutes and a half-life of 3.7 hours in newborns and 1.4 hours in adults. Amoxicillin attaches to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It is effective against streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Helicobacter pylori. As a derivative of ampicillin, amoxicillin is a member of the penicillin family and, like penicillins, is a β-lactam antibiotic. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the bacterial cell wall. It has two ionizable groups in the physiological range (the amino group in alpha-position to the amide carbonyl group and the carboxyl group). == Chemistry == Amoxicillin is a β-lactam and aminopenicillin antibiotic in terms of chemical structure. It is structurally related to ampicillin. The experimental log P of amoxicillin is 0.87. It is described as an ""ambiphilic""—between hydrophilic and lipophilic—antibiotic. == History == Amoxicillin was one of several semisynthetic derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) developed by the Beecham Group in the 1960s. It was invented by Anthony Alfred Walter Long and John Herbert Charles Nayler, two British scientists. It became available in 1972 and was the second aminopenicillin to reach the market (after ampicillin in 1961). Co-amoxiclav became available in 1981. == Society and culture == === Economics === Amoxicillin is relatively inexpensive. In 2022, a survey of eight generic antibiotics commonly prescribed in the United States found their average cost to be about $42.67, while amoxicillin was sold for $12.14 on average. === Modes of delivery === Pharmaceutical manufacturers make amoxicillin in trihydrate form, for oral use available as capsules, regular, chewable and dispersible tablets, syrup and pediatric suspension for oral use, and as the sodium salt for intravenous administration. An extended-release is available. The intravenous form of amoxicillin is not sold in the United States. When an intravenous aminopenicillin is required in the United States, ampicillin is typically used. When there is an adequate response to ampicillin, the course of antibiotic therapy may often be completed with oral amoxicillin. Research with mice indicated successful delivery using intraperitoneally injected amoxicillin-bearing microparticles. === Names === Amoxicillin is the international nonproprietary name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), and United States Adopted Name (USAN), while amoxycillin is the Australian Approved Name (AAN). Amoxicillin is one of the semisynthetic penicillins discovered by the former pharmaceutical company Beecham Group. The patent for amoxicillin has expired, thus amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav preparations are marketed under various brand names across the world. == Veterinary uses == Amoxicillin is also sometimes used as an antibiotic for animals. The use of amoxicillin for animals intended for human consumption (chickens, cattle, and swine for example) has been approved. == References == == Further reading == Neal MJ (2002).

To evaluate a niacin receptor partial agonist, MK-0354, in Phase I and II studies. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic effects of single and multiple doses (7 days) of MK-0354 (300-4000 mg) were evaluated in two Phase I studies conducted in healthy men. A Phase II study assessed the effects of MK-0354 2.5 g once daily on lipids during 4 weeks in 66 dyslipidemic patients. MK-0354 single doses up to 4000 mg and multiple doses (7 days) up to 3600 mg produced robust dose-related reductions in free fatty acid (FFA) over 5 hours. Single doses of MK-0354 300 mg and extended release-niacin (Niaspan) 1 g produced comparable reductions in FFA. Suppression of FFA following 7 daily doses of MK-0354 was similar to that after a single dose. In the Phase II study, MK-0354 2.5 g produced little flushing but no clinically meaningful effects on lipids (placebo-adjusted percent change: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 0.4%, 95% confidence interval -5.2 to 6.0; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, -9.8%, 95% confidence interval -16.8 to -2.7; triglyceride, -5.8%, 95% confidence interval -22.6 to 11.9).

2318,"('Resveratrol', 'Trans-resveratrol', '(e)-5-(4-hydroxystyryl)benzene-1,3-diol', '(e)-resveratrol', 'Resvida')","Food, Medical","Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a stilbenoid, a type of natural phenol or polyphenol and a phytoalexin produced by several plants in response to injury or when the plant is under attack by pathogens, such as bacteria or fungi. Sources of resveratrol in food include the skin of grapes, blueberries, raspberries, mulberries, and peanuts. Although commonly used as a dietary supplement and studied in laboratory models of human diseases, there is no high-quality evidence that resveratrol improves lifespan or has a substantial effect on any human disease. == Research == Resveratrol has been studied for its potential therapeutic use, with little evidence of anti-disease effects or health benefits in humans. === Cardiovascular disease === There is no evidence of benefit from resveratrol in people who already have heart disease. A 2018 meta-analysis found no effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure; a sub-analysis revealed a 2 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure only from resveratrol doses of 300 mg per day, and only in diabetic people. A 2014 Chinese meta-analysis found no effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure; a sub-analysis found an 11.90 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure from resveratrol doses of 150 mg per day. === Cancer === As of 2020, there is no evidence of an effect of resveratrol on cancer in humans. === Metabolic syndrome === There is no conclusive evidence for an effect of resveratrol on human metabolic syndrome. One 2015 review found little evidence for use of resveratrol to treat diabetes. A 2015 meta-analysis found little evidence for an effect of resveratrol on diabetes biomarkers. One review found limited evidence that resveratrol lowered fasting plasma glucose in people with diabetes. Two reviews indicated that resveratrol supplementation may reduce body weight and body mass index, but not fat mass or total blood cholesterol. A 2018 review found that resveratrol supplementation may reduce biomarkers of inflammation, TNF-α and C-reactive protein. === Lifespan === As of 2011, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that consuming resveratrol has an effect on human lifespan. === Cognition === Resveratrol has been assessed for a possible effect on cognition, but with mixed evidence for an effect. One review concluded that resveratrol had no effect on neurological function, but reported that supplementation improved recognition and mood, although there were inconsistencies in study designs and results. === Alzheimer's disease === A 2022 meta-analysis provided preliminary evidence that resveratrol, alone or in combination with glucose and malate, may slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. === Diabetes === Although animal experiments have found some evidence that resveratrol may help improve insulin sensitivity and so potentially help manage diabetes, subsequent research on people is limited and does not support the use of resveratrol for this purpose. === Other === There is no significant evidence that resveratrol affects vascular endothelial function, neuroinflammation, skin infections or aging skin. A 2019 review of human studies found mixed effects of resveratrol on certain bone biomarkers, such as increases in blood and bone alkaline phosphatase, while reporting no effect on other biomarkers, such as calcium and collagen. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Resveratrol has been identified as a pan-assay interference compound, which produces positive results in many different laboratory assays. Its ability for varied interactions may be due to direct effects on cell membranes. As of 2015, many specific biological targets for resveratrol had been identified, including NQO2 (alone and in interaction with AKT1), GSTP1, estrogen receptor beta, CBR1, and integrin αVβ. It was unclear at that time if any or all of these were responsible for the observed effects in cells and model organisms. === Pharmacokinetics === The viability of an oral delivery method is unlikely due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. The bioavailability of resveratrol is about 0.5% due to extensive hepatic glucuronidation and sulfation. Glucuronidation occurs in the intestine as well as in the liver, whereas sulfonation not only occurs in the liver but in the intestine and by microbial gut activity. Due to rapid metabolism, the half-life of resveratrol is short (about 8–14 minutes), but the half-life of the sulphate and glucoronide metabolites is above 9 hours. === Metabolism === Resveratrol is extensively metabolized in the body, with the liver and intestines as the major sites of its metabolism. Liver metabolites are products of phase II (conjugation) enzymes, which are themselves induced by resveratrol in vitro. == Chemistry == Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a stilbenoid, a derivative of stilbene. It exists as two geometric isomers: cis- (Z) and trans- (E), with the trans-isomer shown in the top image. Resveratrol exists conjugated to glucose. The trans- form can undergo photoisomerization to the cis- form when exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. UV irradiation to cis-resveratrol induces further photochemical reaction, producing a fluorescent molecule named ""Resveratrone"". Trans-resveratrol in the powder form was found to be stable under ""accelerated stability"" conditions of 75% humidity and 40 °C in the presence of air. The trans isomer is also stabilized by the presence of transport proteins. Resveratrol content also was stable in the skins of grapes and pomace taken after fermentation and stored for a long period. lH- and 13C-NMR data for the four most common forms of resveratrols are reported in literature. === Biosynthesis === Resveratrol is produced in plants via the enzyme resveratrol synthase (stilbene synthase). Its immediate precursor is a tetraketide derived from malonyl CoA and 4-coumaroyl CoA. The latter is derived from phenylalanine. === Biotransformation === The grapevine fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea is able to oxidise resveratrol into metabolites showing attenuated antifungal activities. Those include the resveratrol dimers restrytisol A, B, and C, resveratrol trans-dehydrodimer, leachinol F, and pallidol. The soil bacterium Bacillus cereus can be used to transform resveratrol into piceid (resveratrol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside). == Adverse effects == Only a few human studies have been done to determine the adverse effects of resveratrol, all of them preliminary with small participant numbers. Adverse effects resulted mainly from long-term use (weeks or longer) and daily doses of 1000 mg or higher, causing nausea, stomach pain, flatulence, and diarrhea. A review of 136 patients in seven studies who were given more than 500 mg for a month showed 25 cases of diarrhea, 8 cases of abdominal pain, 7 cases of nausea, and 5 cases of flatulence. A 2018 review of resveratrol effects on blood pressure found that some people had increased frequency of bowel movements and loose stools. == Occurrences == === Plants === Resveratrol is a phytoalexin, a class of compounds produced by many plants when they are infected by pathogens or physically harmed by cutting, crushing, or ultraviolet radiation. Plants that synthesize resveratrol include Japanese knotweed, pine trees (including Scots pine and Eastern white pine), Concord grape vines, raspberries, mulberries, peanut plants, cocoa bushes, and Vaccinium shrubs that produce berries, including blueberries, cranberries, and bilberries. === Foods === The levels of resveratrol found in food varies considerably, even in the same food from season to season and batch to batch. ==== Wine and grape juice ==== Resveratrol concentrations in red wines average 1.9±1.7 mg trans-resveratrol/L (8.2±7.5 μM), ranging from nondetectable levels to 14.3 mg/L (62.7 μM) trans-resveratrol. Levels of cis-resveratrol follow the same trend as trans-resveratrol. In general, wines made from grapes of the Pinot noir and St. Laurent varieties showed the highest level of trans-resveratrol, though no wine or region can yet be said to produce wines with significantly higher concentrations than any other wine or region. Champagne and vinegar also contain appreciable levels of resveratrol. Red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8 mg/L, depending on the grape variety. White wine has much less because red wine is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to extract the resveratrol, whereas white wine is fermented after the skin has been removed. The composition of wine is different from that of grapes since the extraction of resveratrol from grapes depends on the duration of the skin contact, and the resveratrol 3-glucosides are in part hydrolysed, yielding both trans- and cis-resveratrol. Though its extraction (i.e. from wood chips or other sources) during artificial ageing, resveratrol is added in red wines to improve the color and sensory properties. ==== Selected foods ==== Ounce for ounce, peanuts have about 25% as much resveratrol as red wine. Peanuts, especially sprouted peanuts, have a content similar to grapes in a range of 2.3 to 4.5 μg/g before sprouting, and after sprouting, in a range of 11.7 to 25.7 μg/g, depending on peanut cultivar. Mulberries (especially the skin) are a source of as much as 50 micrograms of resveratrol per gram dry weight. Most US supplements of resveratrol are derived from the root of Reynoutria japonica (also called Japanese knotweed, Hu Zhang, etc.) == History == The first mention of resveratrol was in a Japanese article in 1939 by Michio Takaoka, who isolated it from Veratrum album, variety grandiflorum, and later, in 1963, from the roots of Japanese knotweed. In 2004, Harvard University professor David Sinclair co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, the initial product of which was a resveratrol formulation. Sirtris was purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million and shut down in 2013, without successful drug development. == Related compounds == Dihydro-resveratrol Epsilon-viniferin, Pallidol and Quadrangularin A three different resveratrol dimers Elafibranor, a structurally related compound that acts as a dual PPARα/δ agonist THSG, a glycoside compound found in He Shou Wu which is very similar to resveratrol.

It is a derivative of ergotamine. It is administered as a nasal spray or injection and has an efficacy similar to that of sumatriptan. Nausea is a common side effect. It has similar actions to the triptans, acting as an agonist to the serotonin receptors and causing vasoconstriction of the intracranial blood vessels, but also interacts centrally with dopamine and adrenergic receptors. It can be used to treat acute intractable headache or withdrawal from analgesics. == Medical uses == Subcutaneous and intramuscular injections are generally more effective than the nasal spray and can be self-administered by patients. Intravenous injection is considered very effective for severe migraine or status migrainosus. DHE is also used in the treatment of medication overuse headache. == Side effects == Nausea is a common side effect of IV administration and less common in other modes. Antiemetics can be given prior to DHE to counteract the nausea. Risks and contraindications are similar to the triptans. DHE and triptans should never be taken within 24 hours of each other due to the potential for coronary artery vasospasm. DHE produces no dependence. == Contraindications == DHE is contraindicated with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, like macrolide antibiotics. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === DHE's antimigraine activity is due to its action as an agonist at the serotonin 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1F receptors. It also interacts with other serotonin, adrenergic, and dopamine receptors. DHE is an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor and has been associated with cardiac valvulopathy. In spite of acting as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, DHE has been described as non-hallucinogenic. This is also the case with certain other ergoline derivatives, such as bromocriptine and pergolide. === Pharmacokinetics === Oral bioavailability is poor and it is not available in oral form in the US. DHE is available as a nasal spray and in ampules for subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous injection. Efficacy is variable in the nasal spray form with relative bioavailability of 32% compared to injection. == Contraindications == Contraindications for DHE include: pregnancy, renal or hepatic failure, coronary, cerebral, and peripheral vascular disease, hypersensitivity reactions, sepsis, and uncontrolled hypertension. == History == Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is a semi-synthetic form of ergotamine approved in the US in 1946.

It has been used to treat hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin levels). The use of ergoloid alkaloids for dementia has been surrounded with uncertainties. In 2000, a systematic Cochrane review concluded that hydergine was well tolerated and showed significant treatment effects when assessed by either global ratings or comprehensive rating scales. The small number of available trials for analysis, however, limited the ability to demonstrate statistically significant moderating effects in certain subgroups (e.g. younger age, higher dosage, Alzheimer disease). == Contraindications == Ergoloid is contraindicated in individuals who have previously shown hypersensitivity to the drug. They are also contraindicated in patients who have psychosis, acute or chronic, regardless of etiology. Specific drug interactions are unknown but it has been claimed that there are multiple potential interactions. == Side effects == Adverse effects are minimal. The most common include transient, dose dependent nausea and gastrointestinal disturbances, and sublingual irritation with SL tablets. Other common side effects include: Cardiovascular: orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia Dermatologic: skin rash, flushing Ocular: blurred vision Respiratory: nasal congestion Possible risk of fibrosis and ergotism As a result of the last-mentioned effects, the use of ergoline derivatives for the treatment of blood circulation disorders, memory problems, sensation problems and the treatment of migraine is no longer permitted in some EU countries because the risks are believed to outweigh any benefits. However, this concern may be unnecessarily suppressing the use of ergoline medications. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Despite the fact that this drug has been used in the treatment of dementia for many years, its mechanism of action is still not clear. It stimulates dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors and blocks alpha-adrenoreceptors. Current studies imply that the major effect of hydergine may be the modulation of synaptic neurotransmission rather than solely increasing blood flow as was once thought. A prominent feature that accompanies aging is an increase in monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels. This results in decreased availability of catecholamines in the synaptic cleft. In one study, an interaction between age and hydergine treatment was observed in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum. The hydergine effect was more pronounced in the aged group in the hypothalamus and cerebellum, and more pronounced in the adult in the hippocampus. These findings imply that increased brain MAO activity in aging can be modified by hydergine treatment in some brain regions. == Chemistry == The four constituents differ only in which of four proteinogenic amino acids is used in biosynthesis: == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names include Hydergine, Hydergina, Gerimal, Niloric, Redizork, Alkergot, Cicanol, Redergin, and Hydrine. == References == == External links == Ergoloid Mesylates Archived 2012-03-16 at the Wayback Machine (University of Maryland Medical Center) Ergoloid Mesylates (Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).)",Ergoloid mesylates,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.2305197237292305e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009174905135296285)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682097.html?utm_source=openai), [mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ergoloid-mesylates-oral-route-sublingual-route/description/drg-20063714?utm_source=openai), [drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/monograph/ergoloid-mesylates.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=340, start_index=9, title='Ergoloid Mesylates: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682097.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=340, start_index=9, title='Ergoloid mesylates (oral route, sublingual route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ergoloid-mesylates-oral-route-sublingual-route/description/drg-20063714?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=340, start_index=9, title='Ergoloid Mesylates Monograph for Professionals - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/monograph/ergoloid-mesylates.html?utm_source=openai')])"
2322,"('Bronopol', 'Bronosol', 'Bronocot', 'Bronidiol', 'Bronopolu')",Medical,"Bronopol (INN; chemical name 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol) is an organic compound that is used as an antimicrobial. It is a white solid although commercial samples appear yellow. The first reported synthesis of bronopol was in 1897. Bronopol was invented by The Boots Company PLC in the early 1960s and first applications were as a preservative for pharmaceuticals. Due to its low mammalian toxicity at in-use levels and high activity against bacteria, especially Gram-negative species, bronopol became popular as a preservative in many consumer products such as shampoos and cosmetics. It was subsequently adopted as an antimicrobial in other industrial environments such as paper mills, oil exploration, and production facilities, as well as cooling water disinfection plants. == Production == Bronopol is produced by the bromination of di(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, which is derived from nitromethane by a nitroaldol reaction. World production increased from the tens of tonnes in the late 1970s to current estimates in excess of 5,000 tonnes. Production today is the business of low cost producers, mainly in China. == Applications == Bronopol is used in consumer products as an effective preservative agent, as well as a wide variety of industrial applications (almost any industrial water system is a potential environment for bacterial growth, leading to slime and corrosion problems - in many of these systems bronopol can be a highly effective treatment). The use of bronopol in personal care products (cosmetics, toiletries) has declined since the late 1980s due to the potential formation of nitrosamines. While bronopol is not in itself a nitrosating agent, under conditions where it decomposes (alkaline solution and/or elevated temperatures) it can liberate nitrite and low levels of formaldehyde and these decomposition products can react with any contaminant secondary amines or amides in a personal care formulation to produce significant levels of nitrosamines (due to the toxicity of these substances, the term 'significant' means levels as low as tens of parts per billion). Manufacturers of personal care products are therefore instructed by regulatory authorities to avoid the formation of nitrosamines which might mean removing amines or amides from the formulation, removing bronopol from a formulation, or using nitrosamine inhibitors. Bronopol has been restricted for use in cosmetics in Canada. == Physical and chemical properties == === Appearance === Bronopol is supplied as crystals or crystalline powder, which may vary from white to pale yellow in colour depending on the grade. The yellow coloration is due to chelation of iron during the manufacturing process. === Melting point === As a pure material, bronopol has a melting point of about 130 °C. However, due to its polymorphic characteristics, bronopol undergoes a lattice rearrangement at 100 to 105 °C and this can often be wrongly interpreted as the melting point. At temperatures above 140 °C, bronopol decomposes exothermically releasing hydrogen bromide and oxides of nitrogen. === Solubility === Bronopol is readily soluble in water; the dissolution process is endothermic. Solutions containing up to 28% w/v are possible at ambient temperature. Bronopol is poorly soluble in non-polar solvents but shows a high affinity for polar organic solvents. === Partition coefficient === Study of the solubility data shows that bronopol has a high affinity for polar rather than non-polar environments. In two-phase systems, bronopol partitions preferentially into the polar (usually aqueous) phase. === Stability in aqueous solution === In aqueous solutions, bronopol is most stable when the pH of the system is on the acid side of neutral. Temperature also has a significant effect on stability in alkaline systems. === Degradation === Under extreme alkaline conditions, bronopol decomposes in aqueous solution and very low levels of formaldehyde are produced. Liberated formaldehyde is not responsible for the biological activity associated with bronopol. Other decomposition products detected after bronopol breakdown are bromide ion, nitrite ion, bromonitroethanol and 2-hydroxymethyl-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol. == Allergy == In 2005–2006, it was the 15th-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (3.4%) of people with suspected allergic contact dermatitis. It is used as a substitute for formaldehyde, a disinfectant and preservative, in solvents. It is prevalent in skin and personal care products and topical medications. == See also == Bronidox == References == == External links == Material Safety Data Sheet for Bronopol",Bronopol,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.07909389585256577), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -5.512236498361744e-07), (' PERSONAL', -8.895480277715251e-06), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.37924128770828247), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', 0.0), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0006786665762774646), ('ĠPERSON', -0.0026443772949278355), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.5497195136049413e-06), (',', -0.3868989646434784), ('ĠMED', -0.06509911268949509), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02977841906249523)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -2.15310683415737e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0015023599844425917), (' PERSONAL', -0.004078401252627373), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronopol ', [])"

For both molecular species of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol incorporation produces bimodal endotherms at lower and unimodal endotherms at higher sterol concentrations. In both cases, heating and cooling endotherms are identical, and high concentrations of cholesterol (50 mol %) completely abolish the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition. For the distearoyl molecular species of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, heating and cooling endotherms are not identical, and cholesterol exhibits a considerably reduced miscibility in the gel as compared to the liquid-crystalline phase, particularly in the latter case. Thus, in neither case does the addition of 50 mol % cholesterol completely abolish the cooperative hydrocarbon chain-melting phase transition. However, the dielaidoyl molecular species of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine exhibit much closer correspondence in the heating and cooling modes than do the distearoyl species, and 50 mol % cholesterol is sufficient to almost or completely abolish the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition of dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine and dielaidoylphosphatidylserine. In general, there is an inverse correlation between the strength of intermolecular phospholipid-phospholipid interactions, as manifested by the relative gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition temperatures of the pure phospholipids, and the miscibility of cholesterol in bilayers, particularly gel-state bilayers, formed from these phospholipids. These results indicate that the nature of cholesterol-phospholipid interactions, and thus the miscibility of cholesterol in the bilayer, depends on both the structure of the phospholipid polar headgroup and the hydrocarbon chains, as well as on the temperature and phase state of the phospholipid bilayer. The interactions in mixed monolayers between distearoyl-L-phosphatidylethanolamine, natural phosphatidylethanolamine purified from bovine rod outer segments and all-trans retinal have been studied at the nitrogen/water interface at 21.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Seven mixtures of each phospholipid with all-trans retinal, covering the whole range of molar fractions, were studied. The monolayers were spread on a 1 X 10(-3) M phosphate buffer subphase at three different pH values, 5.5, 7.1 and 8.2. The results for the two series of mixtures are strikingly different. The surface phase rule shows that all-trans retinal is miscible with the natural phospholipid at the interface. Small, negative deviations with respect to the additivity rule are observed in this case. The excess free energies of mixing were also calculated as a function of concentration for this system at four different surface pressures, 5, 7, 10 and 13 mN X m-1. They are negative for the four surface pressures considered and symmetrical with respect to the mole fraction. On the other hand, when distearoyl-L-phosphatidylethanolamine is mixed with all-trans retinal, the components are no longer miscible at the interface. This marked difference in behaviour between the two lipids reflects the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the mixed monolayers of phospholipids with retinals. Furthermore, for the two series of mixtures, the surface pressure isotherms do not show any significant shift when the subphase pH is changed from 5.5 to 8.2. This behaviour raises questions about the formation of a Schiff base between phosphatidylethanolamine and retinal at the interface. It is suggested that, owing to the nature of the disk membranes, such an effect would also be observed in vivo. The possible implications of this are discussed, particularly with respect to questions pertaining to the stability of the retinal chromophore. In order to explore the use of exchangeable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified diacylphosphatidylethanolamines (PE) to temporarily shield binding ligands attached to the surface of liposomes, a model reaction based on inhibition and subsequent recovery of biotinylated liposome binding to streptavidin immobilized on superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SA magnetic particles) was developed. PEG-lipid incorporation into biotinylated liposomes decreased liposome binding to SA magnetic particles in a non-linear fashion, where as little as 0.1 mol% PEG-PE resulted in a 20% decrease in binding. Using an assay based on inhibition of binding, PEG(2000)-PE transfer from donor liposomes to biotinylated acceptor liposomes could be measured. The influence of temperature and acyl chain composition on the transfer of PEG-diacyl PEs from donor liposomes to acceptor liposomes, consisting of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol and N-((6-biotinoyl)amino)hexanoyl)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (54.9:45:0.1 mole ratio), was measured. Donor liposomes were prepared using 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (50 mol%), cholesterol (45 mol%) and 5 mol% of either PEG-derivatized 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE-PEG(2000)), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE-PEG(2000)), or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE-PEG(2000)). Transfer of DSPE-PEG(2000) to the donor liposomes was not detected under the conditions employed. In contrast, DMPE-PEG(2000) was transferred efficiently even at 4 degrees C. Using an acceptor to donor liposome ratio of 1:4, the time required for DMPE-PEG(2000) to become evenly distributed between the two liposome populations (T(EQ)) at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C was approx. 2 and <0.5 h, respectively. An increase in acyl chain length from C14:0 to C16:0 of the PEG-lipid resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of transfer as measured by this assay. The transfer of PEG-lipid out of biotinylated liposomes was also studied in mice following intravenous administration. The relative rates of transfer for the various PEG-lipids were found to be comparable under in vivo and in vitro conditions. These results suggest that it is possible to design targeted liposomes with the targeting ligand protected while in the circulation through the use of PEG-lipids that are selected on the basis of exchange characteristics which result in exposure of the shielded ligand following localization within a target tissue.",Distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.003729772288352251)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.04938871040940285), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009448830969631672)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.021149465814232826)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylethanolamine ', [])"

Although it can be obtained in small quantities by brewing an herbal tea from mulberry leaves, interest in commercial production has led to research on developing mulberry tea higher in DNJ, and on alternate routes of production, such as via Bacillus species. == Biosynthesis == 1-Deoxynojirimycin is a polyhydroxylated piperidine alkaloid produced from D-Glucose in various plants, such as Commelina communis, and in the Streptomyces and Bacillus bacteria. High quantities of this azasugar are produced in Bacillus subtilis, a process initiated by a TYB gene cluster composed of gabT1 (aminotransferase), yktc1 (phosphatase), and gutB1 (oxidoreductase). In Bacillus subtilis, D-glucose first undergoes glycolysis, opening the 6-member ring and producing fructose-6-phosphate. GabT1 catalyzes transamination at the C2 position, followed by a dephosphorylation by the Yktc1 enzyme, resulting in 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-mannitol (ADM), an essential precursor. Regio-selective oxidation by GutB1 occurs at the exposed C6 hydroxyl of ADM, pushing a C2-N-C6 cyclization of the resulting 6-oxo intermediate, creating Manojirimycin (MJ). Epimerization of MJ at the C2 position yields the nojirimycin isomer. Nojirimycin is then dehydrated (loss of -OH at C1 position), along with reduction of the imine moiety. This results in the product 1-DNJ. === Pathway variations === In the Streptomyces subrutilus species, a secondary pathway branching from the manojirimycin precursor results in 1-deoxymanojirimycin via dehydration and reduction of the isomer. However, Bacillus subtilis does not produce 1-deoxymanojirimycin despite the presence of the manojirimycin precursor.

It was developed by Amicus Therapeutics. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted it orphan drug status in 2004, and the European Commission followed in 2006. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted the drug a marketing approval under the name Galafold in May 2016. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Migalastat is used for the long-term treatment of Fabry disease in adults and adolescents aged 16 or older with an amenable mutation of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-GalA). An ""amenable"" mutation is one that leads to misfolding of the enzyme, but otherwise would not significantly impair its function. Based on an in vitro test, Amicus Therapeutics has published a list of 269 amenable and nearly 600 non-amenable mutations. About 35 to 50% of people with Fabry have an amenable mutation. == Adverse effects == The most common side effect in clinical trials was headache (in about 10% of people who take it). Less common side effects (between 1 and 10% of people) included unspecific symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and nausea, but also depression. Possible rare side effects could not be assessed because of the low number of subjects in the clinical trials in which adverse effects were measured. == Interactions == When combined with intravenous agalsidase alfa or beta, which are recombinant versions of the enzyme α-GalA, migalastat increases tissue concentrations of functional α-GalA compared to agalsidase given alone up to fivefold.Migalastat is not intended to be combined with agalsidase. Migalastat does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 liver enzymes or transporter proteins and is therefore expected to have a low potential for interactions with other drugs. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Fabry disease is a genetic disorder caused by various mutations of the enzyme α-GalA, which is responsible for breaking down the sphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), among other glycolipids and glycoproteins. Some of these mutations result in misfolding of α-GalA, which subsequently fails protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum and is decomposed. Lack of functional α-GalA leads to accumulation of Gb3 in blood vessels and other tissues, with a wide range of symptoms including kidney, heart, and skin problems. Migalastat is a potent, orally available inhibitor of α-GalA (IC50: 4 μM). When binding to faulty α-GalA, it shifts the folding behaviour towards the proper conformation, resulting in a functional enzyme provided the mutation is amenable. Molecules with this type of mechanism are called pharmacological chaperones. When the enzyme reaches its destination, the lysosome, migalastat dissociates because of the low pH and the relative abundance of Gb3 and other substrates, leaving α-GalA free to fulfill its function. Depending on the mutation, the EC50 is between 0.8 μM and over 1 mM in cellular models. === Pharmacokinetics === Migalastat is almost completely absorbed from the gut; taking the drug together with food decreases its absorption by about 40%. Total bioavailability is about 75% when taken without food. The substance is not bound to blood plasma proteins. Only a small fraction of a migalastat dose is metabolized, mainly to three dehydrogenated O-glucuronides (4% of the dose) and a number of unspecified metabolites (10%). The drug is mainly eliminated via the urine (77%) and to a smaller extent via the faeces (20%). Practically all of the metabolites are excreted in the urine. Elimination half-life is three to five hours after a single dose. == Chemistry == Migalastat is used in form of the hydrochloride, which is a white crystalline solid and is soluble in water.: 11 The molecule has four asymmetric carbon atoms with the same stereochemistry as the sugar D-galactose, but is missing the first hydroxyl group. It has a nitrogen atom in the ring instead of an oxygen, which makes it an iminosugar. The structure is formally derived from nojirimycin. == History == Migalastat was isolated as a fermentation product of the bacterium Streptomyces lydicus (strain PA-5726) in 1988 and called 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin. In 2004, it was designated orphan drug status by the US FDA for the treatment of Fabry disease, and in 2006 the European CHMP did likewise. The sponsorship for the drug was transferred several times over the following years: from Amicus Therapeutics to Shire Pharmaceuticals in 2008, back to Amicus in 2010, to Glaxo in 2011, and again to Amicus in 2014. Two phase III clinical trials with a total of about 110 subjects were conducted between 2009 and 2015, one double-blind comparing the drug to placebo, and one comparing it to recombinant α-GalA without blinding. Migalastat stabilised heart and kidney function over the 30-months period of these trials. In September 2015, Amicus announced that it would submit a new drug application (NDA) for accelerated approval of migalastat to the FDA by the end of 2015. The CHMP recommended approval in April 2016, but the FDA rejected the application in November for having insufficient data in November 2016. The drug was approved in the European Union in May 2016. Germany was the first country where migalastat was launched. After Scott Gottlieb became FDA commissioner in 2017, the CEO of Amicus began lobbying him directly for the FDA to accept the NDA and in February 2018 the FDA accepted it and promised a response by August 2018. == See also == Miglustat, a drug for the treatment of Gaucher disease, with a similar structure 1-Deoxynojirimycin, a stereoisomer of migalastat == References ==",Amigal,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0014073477359488606), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00335618294775486)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.011047935113310814)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is the methyl ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. == Natural occurrences == Methylparaben serves as a pheromone for a variety of insects and is a component of queen mandibular pheromone. It is a pheromone in wolves produced during estrus associated with the behavior of alpha male wolves preventing other males from mounting females in heat. == Uses == Methylparaben is an anti-fungal agent often used in a variety of cosmetics and personal-care products. It is also used as a food preservative and has the E number E218. Methylparaben is commonly used as a fungicide in Drosophila food media at 0.1%. To Drosophila, methylparaben is toxic at higher concentrations, has an estrogenic effect (mimicking estrogen in rats and having anti-androgenic activity), and slows the growth rate in the larval and pupal stages at 0.2%. == Safety == There is controversy about whether methylparaben or propylparabens are harmful at concentrations typically used in body care or cosmetics. Methylparaben and propylparaben are considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the USFDA for food and cosmetic antibacterial preservation. Methylparaben is readily metabolized by common soil bacteria, making it completely biodegradable. Methylparaben is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or through the skin. It is hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and rapidly excreted in urine without accumulating in the body. Acute toxicity studies have shown that methylparaben is practically non-toxic by both oral and parenteral administration in animals. In a population with normal skin, methylparaben is practically non-irritating and non-sensitizing; however, allergic reactions to ingested parabens have been reported. A 2008 study found no competitive binding for human estrogen and androgen receptors for methylparaben, but varying levels of competitive binding were seen with butyl- and isobutyl-paraben. Studies indicate that methylparaben applied on the skin may react with UVB, leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage. == References == == External links == Methylparaben at Hazardous Substances Data Bank Methylparaben Archived 2017-05-01 at the Wayback Machine at Household Products Database European Commission Scientific Committee on Consumer Products Extended Opinion on the Safety Evaluation of Parabens (2005) [1]",Methyl parahydroxybenzoate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.28135669231414795), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -9.65101717156358e-05), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.6935080885887146), (' INDUSTR', -4.60414821645827e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('P', -0.7161557078361511), ('ERSON', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ĠCARE', -5.0424259825376794e-05), (',', -8.821448318485636e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.000502817565575242), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3133107125759125)])","('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.0001593195047462359), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -2.7610454708337784e-05), (' FOOD', -0.061975300312042236), (',', -0.07889033854007721), (' INDUSTR', -0.011047814972698689), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylparaben ', [])"

Aberrant fusion proteins involving the MLL histone methyltransferase (HMT) lead to recruitment of DOT1L, to a multi-protein complex resulting in aberrant methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 at MLL target genes, and ultimately enhanced expression of critical genes for hematopoietic differentiation, including HOXA9 and MEIS1, and as such defines the established mechanism for leukemogenesis in MLL-rearrangement (MLL-r) leukemias.

2331,"('Spironolactone', 'Aldactone', 'Spirolactone', 'Verospiron', 'Verospirone')",Medical,"Spironolactone, sold under the brand name Aldactone among others, is a diuretic medication primarily used to treat fluid build-up due to heart failure, liver scarring, or kidney disease. It is also used in the treatment of high blood pressure, and low blood potassium that does not improve with supplementation, early puberty in boys, acne and excessive hair growth in women. It can also be used to block the effects of testosterone in transgender women and nonbinary people undergoing feminizing hormone replacement therapy. Spironolactone is usually available in tablets, taken by mouth, though topical forms are also available. Common side effects include electrolyte abnormalities, particularly high blood potassium, nausea, vomiting, headache, rashes, and a decreased desire for sex. In those with liver or kidney problems, extra care should be taken. Spironolactone has not been well studied in pregnancy and should not be used to treat high blood pressure of pregnancy. It is also a steroid that blocks the effects of the hormones aldosterone and, to a lesser degree, testosterone, causing some estrogen-like effects. Spironolactone belongs to a class of medications known as potassium-sparing diuretics. Spironolactone was discovered in 1957, and was introduced in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 52nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12 million prescriptions. Spironolactone has a history of use in the trans community. Its use continues despite the rise of various accessible alternatives such as bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate with more precise action and less side effects. == Medical uses == Spironolactone is used primarily to treat heart failure, edematous conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or ascites in people with liver disease, essential hypertension, low blood levels of potassium, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with liver cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). The most common use of spironolactone is in the treatment of heart failure. On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where only small amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, but it can be combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy. The classification of spironolactone as a ""potassium-sparing diuretic"" has been described as obsolete. Spironolactone is also used to treat Bartter's syndrome due to its ability to raise potassium levels. Spironolactone has antiandrogenic activity. For this reason, it is used to treat a variety of dermatological conditions in which androgens play a role. Some of these uses include acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss in women. Spironolactone is used for the treatment of hirsutism in the United States. High doses of spironolactone, which are needed for considerable antiandrogenic effects, are not recommended for men due to the high risk of feminization and other side effects. Spironolactone can be used to treat symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as due to polycystic ovary syndrome. === Heart failure === While loop diuretics remain first-line for most people with heart failure, spironolactone has been shown to reduce both morbidity and mortality in numerous studies and remains an important agent for treating fluid retention, edema, and symptoms of heart failure. Current recommendations from the American Heart Association are to use spironolactone in patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%. Spironolactone improves left ventricular diastolic function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, however it has no effect on mortality and hospitalization. Due to its antiandrogenic properties, spironolactone can cause effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any longer than a short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer medication, eplerenone, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogenic effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, eplerenone may not be as effective as spironolactone or the related medication canrenone in reducing mortality from heart failure. === High blood pressure === About 1 in 100 people with hypertension have elevated levels of aldosterone; in these people, the antihypertensive effect of spironolactone may exceed that of complex combined regimens of other antihypertensives since it targets the primary cause of the elevated blood pressure. However, a Cochrane review found adverse effects at high doses and little effect on blood pressure at low doses in the majority of people with high blood pressure. There is no evidence of person-oriented outcome at any dose in this group. === High aldosterone levels === Spironolactone is used in the treatment of hyperaldosteronism (high aldosterone levels or mineralocorticoid excess), for instance primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome). Antimineralocorticoids like spironolactone and eplerenone are first-line treatments for hyperaldosteronism. They improve blood pressure and potassium levels, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy, albuminuria, and carotid intima-media thickness, in people with primary aldosteronism. In people with hyperaldosteronism due to unilateral aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma, adrenalectomy should be preferred instead of antimineralocorticoids. Spironolactone should not be used to treat primary aldosteronism in pregnancy due to its antiandrogen-related risk of teratogenicity in male fetuses. === Skin and hair conditions === Androgens like testosterone and DHT play a critical role in the pathogenesis of a number of dermatological conditions including oily skin, acne, seborrhea, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth in women), and male pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia). In demonstration of this, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) do not produce sebum or develop acne and have little to no body, pubic, or axillary hair. Moreover, men with congenital 5α-reductase type II deficiency, 5α-reductase being an enzyme that greatly potentiates the androgenic effects of testosterone in the skin, have little to no acne, scanty facial hair, reduced body hair, and reportedly no incidence of male-pattern hair loss. Conversely, hyperandrogenism in women, for instance due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), is commonly associated with acne and hirsutism as well as virilization (masculinization) in general. In accordance with the preceding, antiandrogens are highly effective in the treatment of the aforementioned androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions. Because of the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone, it can be quite effective in treating acne in women. In addition, spironolactone reduces oil that is naturally produced in the skin and can be used to treat oily skin. Though not the primary intended purpose of the medication, the ability of spironolactone to be helpful with problematic skin and acne conditions was discovered to be one of the beneficial side effects and has been quite successful. Oftentimes, for women treating acne, spironolactone is prescribed and paired with a birth control pill. Positive results in the pairing of these two medications have been observed, although these results may not be seen for up to three months. Spironolactone has been reported to produce a 50 to 100% improvement in acne at sufficiently high doses. Response to treatment generally requires 1 to 3 months in the case of acne and up to 6 months in the case of hirsutism. Ongoing therapy is generally required to avoid relapse of symptoms. Spironolactone is commonly used in the treatment of hirsutism in women, and is considered to be a first-line antiandrogen for this indication. Spironolactone can be used in the treatment of female-pattern hair loss (pattern scalp hair loss in women). There is tentative low quality evidence supporting its use for this indication. Although apparently effective, not all cases of female-pattern hair loss are dependent on androgens. Antiandrogens like spironolactone are male-specific teratogens which can feminize male fetuses due to their antiandrogenic effects. For this reason, it is recommended that antiandrogens only be used to treat women who are of reproductive age in conjunction with adequate contraception. Oral contraceptives, which contain an estrogen and a progestin, are typically used for this purpose. Moreover, oral contraceptives themselves are functional antiandrogens and are independently effective in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions, and hence can significantly augment the effectiveness of antiandrogens in the treatment of such conditions. Spironolactone is not generally used in men for the treatment of androgen-dependent dermatological conditions because of its feminizing side effects, but it is effective for such indications in men similarly. As an example, spironolactone has been reported to reduce symptoms of acne in males. An additional example is the usefulness of spironolactone as an antiandrogen in transgender women and nonbinary individuals. Topical spironolactone is effective in the treatment of acne as well. As a result, topical pharmaceutical formulations containing 2% or 5% spironolactone cream became available in Italy for the treatment of acne and hirsutism in the early 1990s. The products were discontinued in 2006 when the creams were added to the list of doping substances with a decree of the Ministry of Health that year. ==== Comparison ==== Spironolactone, the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride, and the nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide all appear to have similar effectiveness in the treatment of hirsutism. However, some clinical research has found that the effectiveness of spironolactone for hirsutism is greater than that of finasteride but is less than that of flutamide. The combination of spironolactone with finasteride is more effective than either alone for hirsutism and the combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill is more effective than a birth control pill alone. One study showed that spironolactone or the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate both in combination with a birth control pill had equivalent effectiveness for hirsutism. Spironolactone is considered to be a first-line treatment for hirsutism, finasteride and the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate are considered to be second-line treatments, and flutamide is no longer recommended for hirsutism due to liver toxicity concerns. The nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is an alternative option to flutamide with improved safety. The combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill in the treatment of acne appears to have similar effectiveness to a birth control pill alone and the combination of a birth control pill with cyproterone acetate, flutamide, or finasteride. However, this was based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. Spironolactone may be more effective than birth control pills in the treatment of acne, and the combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill may have greater effectiveness for acne than either alone. In addition, some clinical research has found that flutamide is more effective than spironolactone in the treatment of acne. In one study, flutamide decreased acne scores by 80% within 3 months, whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same period. However, the use of flutamide for acne is limited by its liver toxicity. Bicalutamide is a potential alternative to flutamide for acne as well. Spironolactone can be considered as a first-line treatment for acne in those who have failed other standard treatments such as topical therapies and under certain other circumstances, although this is controversial due to the side effects of spironolactone and its teratogenicity. There is insufficient clinical evidence to compare the effectiveness of spironolactone with other antiandrogens for female-pattern hair loss. The effectiveness of spironolactone in the treatment of both acne and hirsutism appears to be dose-dependent, with higher doses being more effective than lower doses. However, higher doses also have greater side effects, such as menstrual irregularities. === Transgender hormone therapy === Despite paradoxical reactions, spironolactone is used off-label as a component of feminizing hormone therapy in transgender women, especially in the United States (where cyproterone acetate is not available), usually in addition to an estrogen. Alternatives like bicalutamide do not have a similar level of popularity. As spironolactone's antiandrogenic effect appears only in high doses, it can have a wide array of side effects not found in antiandrogens working more exclusively on the androgen receptor. When coupled with estradiol, effects in transgender women include decreased male pattern body hair, induction of breast development and of feminization in general, and reduced spontaneous erections. === Forms === Spironolactone is available in the form of tablets (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg; brand name Aldactone, others) and suspensions (25 mg/5 mL; brand name Carospir) for use by mouth. It has also been marketed in the form of 2% and 5% topical cream in Italy for the treatment of acne and hirsutism under the brand name Spiroderm, but this product is no longer available. The medication is also available in combination with other medications, such as hydrochlorothiazide (brand name Aldactazide, others). Spironolactone has poor water solubility, and for this reason, only oral and topical formulations have been developed; other routes of administration such as intravenous injection are not used. The only antimineralocorticoid that is available as a solution for parenteral use is the related medication potassium canrenoate. == Contraindications == Contraindications of spironolactone include hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), severe and end-stage kidney disease (due to high hyperkalemia risk, except possibly in those on dialysis), Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency and low aldosterone levels), and concomitant use of eplerenone. It should also be used with caution in people with certain neurological disorders, as well as those who experience or have experienced anuria (lack of urine production), acute kidney injury, or significant impairment of kidney excretory function with risk of hyperkalemia. == Side effects == One of the most common side effects of spironolactone is frequent urination. Other general side effects include dehydration, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), mild hypotension (low blood pressure), ataxia (muscle incoordination), drowsiness, dizziness, dry skin, and rashes. Because of its antiandrogenic activity, spironolactone can cause breast tenderness, gynecomastia (breast development), feminization in general, and demasculinization, as well as sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction, although these side effects are usually confined to high doses of spironolactone. At very high doses (400 mg/day), spironolactone has also been associated with testicular atrophy and reversibly reduced fertility, including semen abnormalities such as decreased sperm count and motility in cis men. However, such doses of spironolactone are rarely used clinically. In cis women, spironolactone can cause menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement. Aside from these adverse effects, the side effects of spironolactone in women taking high doses are minimal, and it is well tolerated. A potential side effect of spironolactone is hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. Hyperkalemia can present as a normal anion-gap metabolic acidosis. It has been reported that the addition of spironolactone to loop diuretics in people with heart failure was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Spironolactone may put people at a heightened risk for gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and gastritis. In addition, there has been some evidence suggesting an association between use of the medication and bleeding from the stomach and duodenum, though a causal relationship between the two has not been established. Also, spironolactone is immunosuppressive in the treatment of sarcoidosis. Most of the side effects of spironolactone are dose-dependent. Low-dose spironolactone is generally very well tolerated. Even higher doses of spironolactone, such as 100 mg/day, are well tolerated in most individuals. Dose-dependent side effects of spironolactone include menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and enlargement, orthostatic hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The side effects of spironolactone are usually mild and rarely result in discontinuation. === High potassium levels === Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia, or high blood potassium levels. Rarely, this can be fatal. Of people with heart disease prescribed typical dosages of spironolactone, 10 to 15% develop some degree of hyperkalemia, and 6% develop severe hyperkalemia. At a higher dosage, a rate of hyperkalemia of 24% has been observed. An abrupt and major increase in the rate of hospitalization due to hyperkalemia from 0.2% to 11% and in the rate of death due to hyperkalemia from 0.3 per 1,000 to 2.0 per 1,000 between early 1994 and late 2001 has been attributed to a parallel rise in the number of prescriptions written for spironolactone upon the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) in July 1999. However, another population-based study in Scotland failed to replicate these findings. The risk of hyperkalemia with spironolactone is greatest in the elderly, in people with renal impairment (e.g., due to chronic kidney disease or diabetic nephropathy), in people taking certain other medications (including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the antibiotic trimethoprim, and potassium supplements), and at higher dosages of spironolactone. Although spironolactone poses an important risk of hyperkalemia in the elderly, in those with kidney or cardiovascular disease, and/or in those taking medications or supplements which increase circulating potassium levels, a large retrospective study found that the rate of hyperkalemia in young women without such characteristics who had been treated with high doses of spironolactone for dermatological conditions did not differ from that of controls. This was the conclusion of a 2017 hybrid systematic review of studies of spironolactone for acne in women as well, which found that hyperkalemia was rare and was invariably mild and clinically insignificant. These findings suggest that hyperkalemia may not be a significant risk in such individuals, and that routine monitoring of circulating potassium levels may be unnecessary in this population. However, other sources have claimed that hyperkalemia can nonetheless also occur in people with more normal renal function and presumably without such risk factors. Occasional testing on a case-by-case basis in those with known risk factors may be justified. Side effects of spironolactone which may be indicative of hyperkalemia and if persistent could justify serum potassium testing include nausea, fatigue, and particularly muscle weakness. Notably, non-use of routine potassium monitoring with spironolactone in young women would reduce costs associated with its use. Among young gender-diverse individuals taking spironolactone, hyperkalemia is rare and (if present) transient and asymptomatic. Larger doses do not appear to increase risks in this population. A broader retrospective study found that the rate of hyperkalemia in gender-diverse individuals is correlated with age, with those above 45 years old being more at risk. The finding suggests that patients below or at 45 years old without other conditions that affect potassium handling can be spared from routine monitoring. === Breast changes === Spironolactone can cause breast pain and breast enlargement in women. This is ""probably because of estrogenic effects on target tissue."" At low doses, breast tenderness has been reported in only 5% of women, but at high doses, it has been reported in up to 40% of women. Breast enlargement and tenderness may occur in 26% of women at high doses. Some women regard spironolactone-induced breast enlargement as a positive effect. Spironolactone also commonly and dose-dependently produces gynecomastia (breast development) as a side effect in men. At low doses, the rate is only 5 to 10%, but at high doses, up to or exceeding 50% of men may develop gynecomastia. In the RALES, 9.1% of men taking 25 mg/day spironolactone developed gynecomastia, compared to 1.3% of controls. Conversely, in studies of healthy men given high-dose spironolactone, gynecomastia occurred in 3 of 10 (30%) at 100 mg/day, in 5 of 8 (62.5%) at 200 mg/day, and in 6 of 9 (66.7%) at 400 mg/day, relative to none of 12 controls. The severity of gynecomastia with spironolactone varies considerably, but is usually mild. As with breast enlargement caused by spironolactone in women, gynecomastia due to spironolactone in men is often although inconsistently accompanied by breast tenderness. In the RALES, only 1.7% of men developed breast pain, relative to 0.1% of controls. The time to onset of spironolactone-induced gynecomastia has been found to be 27 ± 20 months at low doses and 9 ± 12 months at high doses. Gynecomastia induced by spironolactone usually regresses after a few weeks following discontinuation of the medication. However, after a sufficient duration of gynecomastia being present (e.g., one year), hyalinization and fibrosis of the tissue occurs and drug-induced gynecomastia may become irreversible. === Menstrual disturbances === Spironolactone at higher doses can cause menstrual irregularities as a side effect in women. These irregularities include metrorrhagia (intermenstrual bleeding), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and breakthrough bleeding. They are common during spironolactone therapy, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses and almost all experiencing them at a high doses. For example, about 20% of women experienced menstrual irregularities with 50 to 100 mg/day spironolactone, whereas about 70% experienced menstrual irregularities at 200 mg/day. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop amenorrhea, and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an irregular and anovulatory pattern of menstrual cycles. It is also associated with metrorrhagia and menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) in large percentages of women, as well as with polymenorrhea (short menstrual cycles). The medication reportedly has no birth control effect. It has been suggested that the weak progestogenic activity of spironolactone is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and spironolactone has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels. Indeed, CYP17A1 genotype is associated with polymenorrhea. Regardless of their mechanism, the menstrual disturbances associated with spironolactone can usually be controlled well by concomitant treatment with a birth control pill, due to the progestin component. === Mood changes === Research is mixed on whether antimineralocorticoids like spironolactone have positive or negative effects on mood. In any case, it is possible that spironolactone might have the capacity to increase the risk of depressive symptoms. However, a 2017 hybrid systematic review found that the incidence of depression in women treated with spironolactone for acne was less than 1%. Likewise, a 10-year observational study found that the incidence of depression in 196 transgender women taking high-dose spironolactone in combination with an estrogen was less than 1%. === Lipid changes === Spironolactone has been found to increase LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and decrease HDL (""good"") cholesterol levels at the relatively high doses used in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). As such, it may have unfavorable effects on the blood lipid profile in this context. Heightened LDL cholesterol levels are a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease. Consequently, it has been said that spironolactone should not be given to women with dyslipidemia (e.g., high cholesterol). Unfavorable lipid changes have also been seen with other antiandrogens, like cyproterone acetate and bicalutamide. === Rare reactions === Aside from hyperkalemia, spironolactone may rarely cause adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis, kidney failure, hepatitis (two reported cases, neither serious), agranulocytosis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens–Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Five cases of breast cancer in patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time have been reported. === Spironolactone bodies === Long-term administration of spironolactone gives the histologic characteristic of ""spironolactone bodies"" in the adrenal cortex. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Spironolactone can cross the placenta. It has been found to be present in the breast milk of lactating mothers. However, only very small amounts of spironolactone and its metabolite canrenone enter breast milk, and the amount received by an infant during breastfeeding (<0.5% of the mother's dose) is considered to be insignificant. A study found that spironolactone was not associated with teratogenicity in the offspring of rats. Because it is an antiandrogen, however, spironolactone could theoretically have the potential to cause feminization of male fetuses at sufficient doses. In accordance, a subsequent study found that partial feminization of the genitalia occurred in the male offspring of rats that received doses of spironolactone that were five times higher than those normally used in humans (200 mg/kg per day). Another study found permanent, dose-related reproductive tract abnormalities rat offspring of both sexes at lower doses (50 to 100 mg/kg per day). In practice however, although experience is limited, spironolactone has never been reported to cause observable feminization or any other congenital defects in humans. Among 31 human newborns exposed to spironolactone in the first trimester, there were no signs of any specific birth defects. A case report described a woman who was prescribed spironolactone during pregnancy with triplets and delivered all three (one boy and two girls) healthy; there was no feminization in the boy. In addition, spironolactone has been used at high doses to treat pregnant women with Bartter's syndrome, and none of the infants (three boys, two girls) showed toxicity, including feminization in the male infants. There are similar findings, albeit also limited, for another antiandrogen, cyproterone acetate (prominent genital defects in male rats, but no human abnormalities (including feminization of male fetuses) at both a low dose of 2 mg/day or high doses of 50 to 100 mg/day). In any case, spironolactone is nonetheless not recommended during pregnancy due to theoretical concerns relating to feminization of males and also to potential alteration of fetal potassium levels. A 2019 systematic review found insufficient evidence that spironolactone causes birth defects in humans. However, there was also insufficient evidence to be certain that it does not. == Overdose == Spironolactone is relatively safe in acute overdose. Symptoms following an acute overdose of spironolactone may include drowsiness, confusion, maculopapular or erythematous rash, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and diarrhea. In rare cases, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or hepatic coma may occur in individuals with severe liver disease. However, these adverse reactions are unlikely in the event of an acute overdose. Hyperkalemia can occur following an overdose of spironolactone, and this is especially so in people with decreased kidney function. Spironolactone has been studied at extremely high oral doses of up to 2,400 mg per day in clinical trials. Its oral median lethal dose (LD50) is more than 1,000 mg/kg in mice, rats, and rabbits. There is no specific antidote for overdose of spironolactone. Treatment may consist of induction of vomiting or stomach evacuation by gastric lavage. The treatment of spironolactone overdose is supportive, with the purpose of maintaining hydration, electrolyte balance, and vital functions. Spironolactone should be discontinued in people with impaired kidney function or hyperkalemia. == Interactions == Spironolactone often increases serum potassium levels and can cause hyperkalemia, a very serious condition. Therefore, it is recommended that people using this medication avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium. Physicians must be careful to monitor potassium levels in both males and females who are taking spironolactone as a diuretic, especially during the first twelve months of use and whenever the dosage is increased. Doctors may also recommend that some patients may be advised to limit dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods. However, recent data suggests that both potassium monitoring and dietary restriction of potassium intake is unnecessary in healthy young women taking spironolactone for acne and in healthy young gender-diverse individuals taking spironolactone for hormone therapy. Spironolactone together with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole increases the likelihood of hyperkalemia, especially in the elderly. The trimethoprim portion acts to prevent potassium excretion in the distal tubule of the nephron. Spironolactone has been reported to induce the enzymes CYP3A4 and certain UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), which can result in interactions with various medications. However, it has also been reported that metabolites of spironolactone irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4. In any case, spironolactone has been found to reduce the bioavailability of oral estradiol, which could be due to induction of estradiol metabolism via CYP3A4. Spironolactone has also been found to inhibit UGT2B7. Spironolactone can also have numerous other interactions, most commonly with other cardiac and blood pressure medications, for instance digoxin. Licorice, which has indirect mineralocorticoid activity by inhibiting mineralocorticoid metabolism, has been found to inhibit the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone. Moreover, the addition of licorice to spironolactone has been found to reduce the antimineralocorticoid side effects of spironolactone in women treated with it for hyperandrogenism, and licorice hence may be used to reduce these side effects in women treated with spironolactone as an antiandrogen who are bothered by them. On the opposite end of the spectrum, spironolactone is useful in reversing licorice-induced hypokalemia. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been found to attenuate the diuresis and natriuresis induced by spironolactone, but, not to affect its antihypertensive effect. Some research has suggested that spironolactone might be able to interfere with the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment. As the medication acts as an antimineralocorticoid, it is thought that it might be able to reduce the effectiveness of certain antidepressants by interfering with normalization of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and by increasing levels of glucocorticoids such as cortisol. However, other research contradicts this hypothesis and has suggested that spironolactone might produce antidepressant effects. For instance, studies showing antidepressant-like effects of spironolactone in animals. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The pharmacodynamics of spironolactone are characterized by high antimineralocorticoid activity, moderate antiandrogenic activity, and weak steroidogenesis inhibition, among other more minor activities. Spironolactone is a prodrug, so most of its actions are actually mediated by its various active metabolites. The major active forms of spironolactone are 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS) and canrenone (7α-desthioacetyl-δ6-spironolactone). Spironolactone is a potent antimineralocorticoid. That is, it is an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the biological target of mineralocorticoids like aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone. By blocking the MR, spironolactone inhibits the effects of mineralocorticoids in the body. The antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone is responsible for its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of edema, high blood pressure, heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, and ascites due to cirrhosis. It is also responsible for many of the side effects of spironolactone, such as urinary frequency, dehydration, hyponatremia, low blood pressure, fatigue, dizziness, metabolic acidosis, decreased kidney function, and its risk of hyperkalemia. Due to the antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone, levels of aldosterone are significantly increased by the medication, probably reflecting an attempt of the body to maintain homeostasis. Spironolactone is a moderate antiandrogen. That is, it is an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). By blocking the AR, spironolactone inhibits the effects of androgens in the body. The antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone is mainly responsible for its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss and hyperandrogenism in women, precocious puberty in boys with testotoxicosis, and as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. It is also primarily responsible for some of its side effects, like breast tenderness, gynecomastia, feminization, and demasculinization in men. Blockade of androgen signaling in the breast disinhibits the actions of estrogens in this tissue. Although useful as an antiandrogen in women, who have low testosterone levels compared to men, spironolactone is described as having relatively weak antiandrogenic activity. Spironolactone is a weak steroidogenesis inhibitor. That is, it inhibits steroidogenic enzymes, or enzymes involved in the production of steroid hormones. Spironolactone and/or its metabolites have been found in vitro to weakly inhibit a broad array of steroidogenic enzymes including cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17α-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase, 5α-reductase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11β-hydroxylase, 21-hydroxylase, and aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase). However, although very high doses of spironolactone can considerably decrease steroid hormone levels in animals, spironolactone has shown mixed and inconsistent effects on steroid hormone levels in clinical studies, even at high clinical doses. In any case, the levels of most steroid hormones, including testosterone and cortisol, are usually unchanged by spironolactone in humans, which may in part be related to compensatory upregulation of their synthesis. The weak steroidogenesis inhibition of spironolactone might contribute to its antiandrogenic efficacy to some degree and may explain its side effect of menstrual irregularities in women. However, its androgen synthesis inhibition is probably clinically insignificant. Spironolactone has been found in some studies to increase levels of estradiol, an estrogen, although many other studies have found no changes in estradiol levels. The mechanism of how spironolactone increases estradiol levels is unclear, but it may involve inhibition of the inactivation of estradiol into estrone and enhancement of the peripheral conversion of testosterone into estradiol. It is notable that spironolactone has been found in vitro to act as a weak inhibitor of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, an enzyme that is involved in the conversion of estradiol into estrone. Increased levels of estradiol with spironolactone may be involved in its preservation of bone density and in its side effects such as breast tenderness, breast enlargement, and gynecomastia in women and men. In response to the antimineralocorticoid activity spironolactone, and in an attempt to maintain homeostasis, the body increases aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex. Some studies have found that levels of cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone that is also produced in the adrenal cortex, are increased as well. Spironolactone ""acts at the basolateral side of the upper-distal tubule as well as in the collecting tubule,"" and does not have glucocorticoid-like effects at these specific sites; it can sometimes be prescribed as an alternative to glucocorticoids for patients with Glucocorticoid-Remediable Aldosteronism characterized by aldosterone excess, In patients ""receiving spironolactone, there was a significant positive correlation between the change in cortisol and the change in HbA1c (r = 0.489, P = .003)."" Patients taking spironolactone must be monitored for side effects including dizziness, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver enzymes. Other activities of spironolactone may include very weak interactions with the estrogen and progesterone receptors and agonism of the pregnane X receptor. These activities could contribute to the menstrual irregularities and breast side effects of spironolactone and to its drug interactions, respectively. === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics of spironolactone have not been studied well, which is in part because it is an old medication that was developed in the 1950s. Nonetheless, much has been elucidated about the pharmacokinetics of spironolactone over the decades. ==== Absorption ==== The bioavailability of spironolactone when taken by mouth is 60 to 90%. The bioavailability of spironolactone and its metabolites increases significantly (+22–95% increases in levels) when spironolactone is taken with food, although it is uncertain whether this further increases the therapeutic effects of the medication. The increase in bioavailability is thought to be due to promotion of the gastric dissolution and absorption of spironolactone, as well as due to a decrease of the first-pass metabolism. The relationship between a single dose of spironolactone and plasma levels of canrenone, a major active metabolite of spironolactone, has been found to be linear across a dose range of 25 to 200 mg spironolactone. Steady-state concentrations of spironolactone are achieved within 8 to 10 days of treatment initiation. Little or no systemic absorption has been observed with topical spironolactone. ==== Distribution ==== Spironolactone and its metabolite canrenone are highly plasma protein bound, with percentages of 88.0% and 99.2%, respectively. Spironolactone is bound equivalently to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, while canrenone is bound only to albumin. Spironolactone and its metabolite 7α-thiospironolactone show very low or negligible affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In accordance, a study of high-dosage spironolactone treatment found no change in steroid binding capacity related to SHBG or to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), suggesting that spironolactone does not displace steroid hormones from their carrier proteins. This is in contradiction with widespread statements that spironolactone increases free estradiol levels by displacing estradiol from SHBG. Spironolactone appears to cross the blood–brain barrier. ==== Metabolism ==== Spironolactone is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver upon oral administration and has a very short terminal half-life of 1.4 hours. The major metabolites of spironolactone are 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), 6β-hydroxy-7α-thiomethylspironolactone (6β-OH-7α-TMS), and canrenone (7α-desthioacetyl-δ6-spironolactone). These metabolites have much longer elimination half-lives than spironolactone of 13.8 hours, 15.0 hours, and 16.5 hours, respectively, and are responsible for the therapeutic effects of the medication. As such, spironolactone is a prodrug. The 7α-thiomethylated metabolites of spironolactone were not known for many years and it was originally thought that canrenone was the major active metabolite of the medication, but subsequent research identified 7α-TMS as the major metabolite. Other known but more minor metabolites of spironolactone include 7α-thiospironolactone (7α-TS), which is an important intermediate to the major metabolites of spironolactone, as well as the 7α-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone and the 6β-hydroxy-7α-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone. Spironolactone is hydrolyzed or deacetylated at the thioester of the C7α position into 7α-TS by carboxylesterases. Following formation of 7α-TS, it is S-oxygenated by flavin-containing monooxygenases to form an electrophilic sulfenic acid metabolite. This metabolite is involved in the CYP450 inhibition of spironolactone, and also binds covalently to other proteins. 7α-TS is also S-methylated into 7α-TMS, a transformation catalyzed by thiol S-methyltransferase. Unlike the related medication eplerenone, spironolactone is said to not be metabolized by CYP3A4. However, hepatic CYP3A4 is likely responsible for the 6β-hydroxylation of 7α-TMS into 6β-OH-7α-TMS. 7α-TMS may also be hydroxylated at the C3α and C3β positions. Spironolactone is dethioacetylated into canrenone. Finally, the C17 γ-lactone ring of spironolactone is hydrolyzed by the paraoxonase PON3. It was originally thought to be hydrolyzed by PON1, but this was due to contamination with PON3. ==== Elimination ==== The majority of spironolactone is eliminated by the kidneys, while minimal amounts are handled by biliary excretion. == Chemistry == Spironolactone, also known as 7α-acetylthiospirolactone, is a steroidal 17α-spirolactone, or more simply a spirolactone. It can most appropriately be conceptualized as a derivative of progesterone, itself also a potent antimineralocorticoid, in which a hydroxyl group has been substituted at the C17α position (as in 17α-hydroxyprogesterone), the acetyl group at the C17β position has been cyclized with the C17α hydroxyl group to form a spiro 21-carboxylic acid γ-lactone ring, and an acetylthio group has been substituted in at the C7α position. These structural modifications of progesterone confer increased oral bioavailability and potency, potent antiandrogenic activity, and strongly reduced progestogenic activity. The C7α substitution is likely responsible for or involved in the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone, as 7α-thioprogesterone (SC-8365), unlike progesterone, is an antiandrogen with similar affinity to the AR as that of spironolactone. In addition, the C7α substitution appears to be responsible for the loss of progestogenic activity and good oral bioavailability of spironolactone, as SC-5233, the analogue of spironolactone without a C7α substitution, has potent progestogenic activity but very poor oral bioavailability similarly to progesterone. === Names === Spironolactone is also known by the following equivalent chemical names: 7α-Acetylthio-17α-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid γ-lactone 7α-Acetylthio-3-oxo-17α-pregn-4-ene-21,17β-carbolactone 3-(3-Oxo-7α-acetylthio-17β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-17α-yl)propionic acid lactone 7α-Acetylthio-17α-(2-carboxyethyl)androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one γ-lactone 7α-Acetylthio-17α-(2-carboxyethyl)testosterone γ-lactone === Analogues === Spironolactone is closely related structurally to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and eplerenone, as well as to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7α-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), spirorenone (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679). === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of spironolactone and its analogues and derivatives have been described and reviewed. == History == The natriuretic effects of progesterone were demonstrated in 1955, and the development of spironolactone as a synthetic antimineralocorticoid analogue of progesterone shortly followed this. Spironolactone was first synthesized in 1957, was patented between 1958 and 1961, and was first marketed, as an antimineralocorticoid, in 1959. Gynecomastia was first reported with spironolactone in 1962, and the antiandrogenic activity of the medication was first described in 1969. This shortly followed the discovery in 1967 that gynecomastia is an important and major side effect of AR antagonists. Spironolactone was first studied in the treatment of hirsutism in women in 1978. It has since become the most widely used antiandrogen for dermatological indications in women in the United States. Spironolactone was first studied as an antiandrogen in transgender women in 1986, and has since become widely adopted for this purpose as well, particularly in the United States where cyproterone acetate is not available. Early oral spironolactone tablets showed poor absorption. The formulation was eventually changed to a micronized formulation with particle sizes of less than 50 μg, which resulted in approximately 4-fold increased potency. == Society and culture == === Generic names === The English, French, and generic name of the medication is spironolactone and this is its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its name is spironolactonum in Latin, Spironolacton in German, espironolactona in Spanish and Portuguese, and spironolattone in Italian (which is also its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana). Spironolactone is also known by its developmental code names SC-9420 and NSC-150339. === Brand names === Spironolactone is marketed under various brand names throughout the world. The original brand name of spironolactone is Aldactone. Other brand names include Aldactone-A, Berlactone, CaroSpir, Espironolactona, Espironolactona Genfar, Novo-Spiroton, Prilactone (veterinary), Spiractin, Spiridon, Spirix, Spiroctan, Spiroderm (discontinued), Spirogamma, Spirohexal, Spirolon, Spirolone, Spiron, Spironolactone Actavis, Spironolactone Orion, Spironolactone Teva, Spirotone, Tempora (veterinary), Uractone, Uractonum, Verospiron, and Vivitar. Spironolactone is also formulated in combination with a variety of other medications, including with hydrochlorothiazide as Aldactazide, with hydroflumethiazide as Aldactide, Lasilacton, Lasilactone, and Spiromide, with altizide as Aldactacine and Aldactazine, with furosemide as Fruselac, with benazepril as Cardalis (veterinary), with metolazone as Metolactone, with bendroflumethiazide as Sali-Aldopur, and with torasemide as Dytor Plus, Torlactone, and Zator Plus. === Availability === Spironolactone is marketed throughout the world. == Research == === Prostate conditions === Spironolactone has been studied at a high dosage in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; enlarged prostate). It was found to be better than placebo in terms of symptom relief following three months of treatment. However, this was not maintained after six months of treatment, by which point the improvements had largely disappeared. Moreover, no difference was observed between spironolactone and placebo with regard to volume of residual urine or prostate size. Gynecomastia was observed in about 5% of people. On the basis of these results, it has been said that spironolactone has no place in the treatment of BPH. Spironolactone has been studied and used limitedly in the treatment of prostate cancer. === Epstein–Barr virus === Spironolactone has been found to block Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) production and that of other human herpesviruses by inhibiting the function of an EBV protein SM, which is essential for infectious virus production. This effect of spironolactone was determined to be independent of its antimineralocorticoid actions. === Other conditions === Spironolactone has been studied in the treatment of rosacea in both males and females. Spironolactone has been studied in fibromyalgia in women. It has also been studied in bulimia nervosa in women, but was not found to be effective. == References ==",Verospirone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.137130498653278e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.31429338455200195), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0381801500916481)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01416350994259119)])","('MEDICAL; ([meshb.nlm.nih.gov](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013148&utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=9, title='MeSH Browser', type='url_citation', url='https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013148&utm_source=openai')])"

Cumulative safety and no clinically meaningful PK drug interactions observed in this study supported co-administration of these two novel agents in additional studies exploring efficacy and safety in the management of NAFLD. The disposition of the hepatoselective ACC inhibitor PF-05221304 (Clesacostat) was studied after a single 50-mg oral dose of [14C]-PF-05221304 to healthy human subjects.Mass balance was achieved with 89.9% of the administered dose recovered in urine and faeces, over the 11-day study period. The total administered radioactivity excreted in faeces and urine was 81.7 and 8.2%, respectively. Unchanged PF-05221304 accounted for 35.6% of the radioactive dose in faeces, suggesting ∼64% of the administered dose was absorbed.PF-05221304 was principally metabolised via oxidative and reductive pathways involving: (a) N-dealkylation, (b) isopropyl group monohydroxylation to yield enantiomeric metabolites (M2a and M2b), (c) hydroxylation on the 3-azaspiro[5.5]undecan-8-one moiety to metabolites M5 and 519c, and (d) carbonyl group reduction to enantiomeric alcohol metabolites M3, and M4. Secondary metabolites (521a, 521b, and 533), derived from a combination of oxidation and reduction of the primary metabolites accounted for ∼14.8% of the dose. In plasma, unchanged PF-05221304 represented 96.1% circulating radioactivity. Metabolites M1, M2b, and M2a represented 1.94, 1.76, and 0.18% of circulating radioactivity, respectively.Overall, these data suggest that PF-05221304 is well absorbed in humans and eliminated largely via phase I metabolism. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis describe a collection of liver conditions characterized by the accumulation of liver fat. Despite biopsy being the reference standard for determining the severity of disease, non-invasive measures such as magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and FibroScan® controlled attenuation parameter (CAP™) can be used to understand longitudinal changes in steatosis. The aim of this work was to describe the exposure-response relationship of ervogastat with or without clesacostat on steatosis, through population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling of both liver fat measurements simultaneously. Population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response models using individual predictions of average concentrations were used to describe ervogastat/clesacostat PKPD. Due to both liver fat endpoints being continuous-bounded outcomes on different scales, a dynamic transform-both-sides approach was used to link a common latent factor representing liver fat to each endpoint. Simultaneous modeling of both MRI-PDFF and CAP™ was successful with both measurements being adequately described by the model. The clinical trial simulation was able to adequately predict the results of a recent Phase 2 study, where subjects given ervogastat/clesacostat 300/10 mg BID for 6 weeks had a LS means and model-predicted median (95% confidence intervals) percent change from baseline MRI-PDFF of -45.8% and -45.6% (-61.6% to -31.8%), respectively. Simultaneous modeling of both MRI-PDFF and CAP™ was successful with both measurements being adequately described. By describing the underlying changes of steatosis with a latent variable, this model may be extended to describe biopsy results from future studies.",Clesacostat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005532711511477828), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0015833948273211718), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008630831725895405)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.25192907452583313), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pfizer.com](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-granted-fda-fast-track-designation?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=147, start_index=9, title='Pfizer Granted FDA Fast Track Designation for Ervogastat/Clesacostat Combination for the Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) | Pfizer', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-granted-fda-fast-track-designation?utm_source=openai')])"
2334,"('Alagebrium chloride', 'Alagebrium', 'Alagebrium ion', 'Thiazolium, 4,5-dimethyl-3-(2-oxo-2-phenylethyl)-')",Medical,"Alagebrium (formerly known as ALT-711, dimethyl-3-N-phenacylthiazolium chloride) was a drug candidate developed by Alteon, Inc. It was the first drug candidate to be clinically tested for the purpose of breaking the crosslinks caused by advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), thereby reversing one of the main mechanisms of aging. Through this effect Alagebrium is designed to reverse the stiffening of blood vessel walls that contributes to hypertension and cardiovascular disease, as well as many other forms of degradation associated with protein crosslinking. Alagebrium has proven effective in reducing systolic blood pressure and providing therapeutic benefit for patients with diastolic heart failure. == Mechanism == Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are proteins that become glycated as a result of exposure to sugars. They are a bio-marker implicated in aging and the development, or worsening, of many degenerative diseases, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Pharmacologic intervention with alagebrium directly targets the biochemical pathway leading to AGEs. Although alagebrium may break some important AGE crosslinks, there is no evidence that it is effective against the most prevalent crosslink: glucosepane. == History == Alteon said that it had selected ALT-711 as its lead AGE-breaker based on preclinical results in its annual report for the year 1997 and that it was preparing an IND filing. The INN name was proposed in 2004 and recommended in 2005. In 2006 Alteon merged with a company called HaptoGuard that had cash and a potential diagnostic test for haptoglobin; as part of the merger Genentech, which held preferred shares in Alteon, converted their shares to common ones and received the right to get milestone payments and royalties on sales of alagebrium, and option rights to license ALT-2074. In 2007, the company changed its name to Synvista Therapeutics, Inc. Synvista announced that it was terminating clinical trials of alagebrium in January 2009 in order to focus on the diagnostic test and another clinical candidate SYI-2074 (formerly ALT-2074).

2336,"('Adapalene', 'Differin', 'Adapaleno', 'Adapalenum', 'Adapalenum [inn-latin]')","Medical, Personal Care","Adapalene, sold under the brand name Differin among others, is a third-generation topical retinoid primarily used in the treatment of mild-moderate acne, and is also used off-label to treat keratosis pilaris as well as other skin conditions. Studies have found adapalene is as effective as other retinoids, while causing less irritation. It also has several advantages over other retinoids. The adapalene molecule is more stable compared to tretinoin and tazarotene, which leads to less concern for photodegradation. It is also chemically more stable compared to the other two retinoids, allowing it to be used in combination with benzoyl peroxide. Due to its effects on keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, adapalene is superior to tretinoin for the treatment of comedonal acne and is often used as a first-line agent. The Swiss company Galderma developed adapalene. == Medical uses == Per the recommendations of the Global Alliance on Improving Outcomes of Acne, retinoids such as adapalene are considered first-line therapy in acne treatment and are to be used either independently or in conjunction with benzoyl peroxide and/or an antimicrobial agent, like clindamycin, for maximum efficacy. An adapalene/benzoyl peroxide combination medication is also available. Furthermore, adapalene, like other retinoids, increases the efficacy and penetration of other topical acne medications that are used in conjunction with topical retinoids as well as hastens the improvement of the postinflammatory hyperpigmentation caused by acne. In the long term, it can be used as maintenance therapy. === Off-label uses === Adapalene has the unique ability to inhibit keratinocyte differentiation and decrease keratin deposition. This property makes adapalene an effective treatment for keratosis pilaris and callus. Other non-FDA approved indications that have been reported in the literature include treatment of warts, molluscum contagiosum, Darier's disease, photoaging, pigmentary disorders, actinic keratoses and alopecia areata. == Side effects == Of the three topical retinoids, adapalene is often regarded as the best tolerated. It can cause mild adverse effects such as photosensitivity, irritation, redness, dryness, itching, and burning, and 1% to 10% of users experience a brief sensation of warmth or stinging, as well as dry skin, peeling and redness during the first two to four weeks using the medication. These effects are considered mild and usually decrease over time. Serious allergic reactions are rare. === Pregnancy & lactation === Use of topical adapalene in pregnancy has not been well studied but has a theoretical risk of retinoid embryopathy. Thus far, there is no evidence that the cream causes problems in the baby if used during pregnancy. Topical adapalene has poor systemic absorption and results in low blood levels (less than 0.025 mcg/L) even after long term use, suggesting that there is low risk of harm for a nursing infant. == Interactions == Adapalene has been shown to enhance the efficacy of topical clindamycin, although adverse effects are also increased. Application of adapalene gel to the skin 3–5 minutes before application of clindamycin enhances penetration of clindamycin into the skin, which may enhance the overall efficacy of the treatment as compared to clindamycin alone. == Pharmacology == Unlike the retinoid tretinoin (Retin-A), adapalene has also been shown to retain its efficacy when applied at the same time as benzoyl peroxide due to its more stable chemical structure. Furthermore, photodegradation of the molecule is less of a concern in comparison to tretinoin and tazarotene. === Pharmacokinetics === Absorption of adapalene through the skin is low. A study with six acne patients treated once daily for five days with two grams of adapalene cream applied to 1,000 cm2 (160 sq in) of skin found no quantifiable amounts, or less than 0.35 ng/mL of the drug, in the patients' blood plasma. Controlled trials of chronic users of adapalene have found drug levels in the patients' plasma to be 0.25 ng/mL. === Pharmacodynamics === Adapalene is highly lipophilic. When applied topically, it readily penetrates hair follicles and absorption occurs five minutes after topical application. After penetration into the follicle, adapalene binds to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (namely retinoic acid receptor beta and gamma). These complexes then bind to the retinoid X receptor which induces gene transcription by binding to specific DNA sites, thus modulating downstream keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. This results in normalization of keratinocyte differentiation, allowing for decreased microcomedone formation, decreased clogging of pores, and increased exfoliation by increasing cell turnover. Adapalene is also regarded as an anti-inflammatory agent, as it suppresses the inflammatory response stimulated by the presence of Cutibacterium acnes, and inhibits both lipoxygenase activity and the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Adapalene selectively targets retinoic acid receptor beta and retinoic acid receptor gamma when applied to epithelial cells such as those found in the skin. Its agonism of the gamma subtype is largely responsible for adapalene's observed effects. In fact, when adapalene is applied in conjunction with a retinoic acid receptor gamma antagonist, adapalene loses clinical efficacy. Retinization is a common temporary phenomenon reported by patients when initiating use of retinoids. Within the initial period of treatment, skin can become red, irritated, dry and may burn or itch from retinoid application; however, this tends to resolve within four weeks with once a day use. === Metabolism === Extensive information regarding adapalene metabolism in humans is unavailable, although it is known to accumulate in the liver and GI-tract. In human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog cultured hepatocytes, metabolism appears to affect the methoxybenzene moiety but remains incompletely characterized. The major products of metabolism are glucuronides. Approximately 25% of the drug is metabolized; the rest is excreted as parent drug == History == Adapalene was a research product of the Swiss company Galderma. Adapalene was approved in 1996 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of acne. == Research == A study has concluded that adapalene can be used to treat plantar warts and may help clear lesions faster than cryotherapy. A computational study claims that adapalene can be used as a potential entry inhibitor for Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. == References ==",Differin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0789070799946785), (' PERSONAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.2649508537142538e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023262567818164825)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.006715370807796717), (' PERSONAL', -9.615255839889869e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapalene?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=103, start_index=24, title='Adapalene', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapalene?utm_source=openai')])"

It is the first dicarboxylate-containing ACE inhibitor and was developed partly to overcome these limitations of captopril. The thiol functional group of captopril was replaced with a carboxylic acid group, but additional modifications were required to achieve a potency similar to captopril. Enalaprilat, however, had a problem of its own. The consequence of the structural modifications was that its ionisation characteristics do not allow for sufficient GI absorption. Thus, enalaprilat was only suitable for intravenous administration. This was overcome by the monoesterification of enalaprilat with ethanol to produce enalapril. As a prodrug, enalapril is hydrolyzed in vivo to the active form enalaprilat by various esterases. Peak plasma enalaprilat concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours after oral enalapril administration. Elimination thereafter is biphasic, with an initial phase which reflects renal filtration (elimination half-life 2 to 6 hours) and a subsequent prolonged phase (elimination half-life 36 hours), the latter representing equilibration of drug from tissue distribution sites. The prolonged phase does not contribute to drug accumulation on repeated administration but is thought to be of pharmacological significance in mediating drug effects. Renal impairment [particularly creatinine clearance <20 mL/min (<1.2 L/h)] results in significant accumulation of enalaprilat and necessitates dosage reduction. Accumulation is probably the cause of reduced elimination in healthy elderly individuals and in patients with concomitant diabetes, hypertension and heart failure. == References ==",Enalaprilat,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.237022848334163e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005241699051111937)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09477?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Enalaprilat: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB09477?utm_source=openai')])"

2339,"('Tenoxicam', 'Ro-12-0068', 'Mobiflex', 'Tilcotil', 'Tenoxicamum')",Medical,"Tenoxicam, sold under the brand name Mobiflex among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is used to relieve inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis involving the spine), tendinitis (inflammation of a tendon), bursitis (inflammation of a bursa, a fluid-filled sac located around joints and near the bones), and periarthritis of the shoulders or hips (inflammation of tissues surrounding these joints). Tenoxicam belongs to the class of NSAIDs known as oxicams. It was patented in 1974 by Roche and approved for medical use in 1987. It is available as a prescription-only drug in the United Kingdom and other countries, but not in the US. Outside the United Kingdom, tenoxicam is also marketed under brand names including Tilatil, Tilcitin, and Alganex. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated for patients who are seniors who have been given anesthesia or surgery; are at risk of increased bleeding or kidney failure; have an active inflammatory disease involving the stomach or intestine (like ulcerative colitis); have an active stomach or intestinal ulcer; have had an acute asthmatic attack, hives, rhinitis (inflammation of the inner lining of the nasal passage), or other allergic reactions caused by aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for example diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen). Common side effects that have been observed with tenoxicam include peptic ulceration, dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, headache, edema, renal failure, and vertigo. In rare cases, tenoxicam and other NSAIDs can contribute to thrombotic events, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === It is not recommended that women who are trying to conceive, who are pregnant, or who are breastfeeding take tenoxicam. Tenoxicam can be taken in the first and second trimester when necessary, but it is a contraindication in the third trimester. Some studies have looked at whether or not NSAIDs are able to enter the breast milk and the first few studies have found evidence that NSAIDs can be found in breast milk. Therefore, it is not recommended that women take tenoxicam while breastfeeding. == Interactions == Taking tenoxicam with other drugs can increase the chance of side effects or alter the therapeutic effect of tenoxicam or the other drug, depending on the combination. Drug types the tenoxicam may interact with include: other analgesic NSAIDs, salicylates such as aspirin, antacids, anticoagulants, cardiac glycosides, ciclosporin, quinolone antibiotics, lithium therapy, diuretics and anti-hypertensives, methotrexate, oral anti-diabetics, colestyramine, dextromethorphan, mifepristone, corticosteroids, anti-platelet agents and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tacrolimus, zidovudine, and gold/penicillamine. == Mechanism of action == Like all NSAIDs, the exact mechanism of action of tenoxicam is unknown. Involved in the mechanism of action is inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) which leads to the potential adverse effect of increased bleeding. == Society and culture == Tenoxicam is sold in the form of 20 mg tablets with the price of treatment ranging from US$1.29–2.73 per tablet. Recommended dosing calls for tenoxicam to be taken once daily with food. One week is the typical length for treatment, but the treatment length may be extended. In 2008, the reported sales level for Tilcotil (tenoxicam) was 70 million SEK (approximately US$10.5 million). == Research == The first members of the oxicam family of NSAIDs were brought to market in France in 1982. Shortly thereafter, tenoxicam went to phase III clinical trials for approval as use as an analgesic began in the 1980s. The general consensus from clinical studies is that tenoxicam has about equal analgesic effect as other NSAIDs and does not elicit any important side effects. More recent clinical trials for tenoxicam are examining the use of tenoxicam independently and in combination with other drugs for more specialized analgesic purposes in surgical operations such as third molar extraction and labor pains. == See also == Piroxicam Meloxicam == References ==",Tilcotil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.009546344168484211), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023418622091412544)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenoxicam ', [])"

It produces hyperemia quickly and maintains it for a duration that is useful for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. The selective nature of the drug makes it preferable to other stress agents such as adenosine, which are less selective and therefore cause more side-effects. Regadenoson was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on April 10, 2008, and is marketed by Astellas Pharma under the tradename Lexiscan. It is approved for use in the European Union and under the name of Rapiscan. It is marketed by GE Healthcare and is sold in both the United Kingdom and Germany. Regadenoson was approved for use in the European Union in September 2010. It is available as a generic medication. Regadenoson has a two- to three-minute biological half-life, as compared with adenosine's ten-second half-life. As a result, regadenoson stress protocols use a single bolus, instead of the four- to six-minute continuous infusion that was needed with adenosine. Whereas the adenosine infusion is weight based (140 mcg/kg/minute), regadenoson is administered as a 0.4 mg/5mL preloaded syringe dose that is standard for all weights. Regadenoson stress tests are not affected by the presence of beta blockers, as regadenoson vasodilates via the adenosine pathway without stimulating beta adrenergic receptors.

Pharmacokinetics in healthy human subjects indicated that veledimex plasma exposure increased with increasing dose after single- and multiple-dose administration in Labrasol slurry and F-22 capsule formulations. No apparent formulation or sex-related difference in veledimex pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed. Minimal or no plasma accumulation of veledimex was observed after once-daily oral administration for 14 days. Veledimex steady state in plasma was reached after 5 daily doses.

2342,"('Bumetanide', 'Ro 10-6338', 'Pf 1593', 'Bumex', 'Burinex')",Medical,"Bumetanide, sold under the brand name Bumex among others, is a medication used to treat swelling and high blood pressure. This includes swelling as a result of heart failure, liver failure, or kidney problems. It may work for swelling when other medications have not. For high blood pressure it is not a preferred treatment. It is taken by mouth, or by injection into a vein or muscle. Effects generally begin within an hour and last for about six hours. Common side effects include dizziness, low blood pressure, low blood potassium, muscle cramps, and kidney problems. Other serious side effects may include hearing loss and low blood platelets. Blood tests are recommended regularly for those on treatment. Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear. Bumetanide is a loop diuretic and works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys. Bumetanide was patented in 1968 and came into medical use in 1972. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 270th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == It is used to treat swelling and high blood pressure. This includes swelling as a result of heart failure, liver failure, or kidney problems. For high blood pressure it is not a preferred treatment. It is taken by mouth, or by injection into a vein or muscle. == Side effects == Common side effects include dizziness, low blood pressure, low blood potassium, muscle cramps, and kidney problems. Other serious side effects may include hearing loss and low blood platelets. A large observational study concluded that people with a sulfonamide antibiotic allergy may be allergic to sulfonamide non-antibiotics, such as bumetanide, but this is likely due to certain people being at an increased risk in general to developing allergic reactions rather than cross-reactivity between sulfonamide-containing drugs. In smaller studies, the lack of cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and sulfonamide non-antibiotics has been demonstrated. Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Bumetanide is a loop diuretic and works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys. The main difference between bumetanide and furosemide is in their bioavailability and potency. About 60% of furosemide is absorbed in the intestine, and there are substantial inter- and intraindividual differences in bioavailability (range 10-90%). About 80% of bumetanide is absorbed, and its absorption does not change when it is taken with food. It is said to be a more predictable diuretic, meaning that the predictable absorption is reflected in a more predictable effect. Bumetanide is 40 times more potent than furosemide for people with normal renal function. == Synthesis == Bumetanide is synthesized from 4-chlorobenzoic acid. In the first stage of synthesis, it undergoes sulfonylchlorination by chlorosulfonic acid, forming 4-chloro-3-chlorosulfonylbenzoic acid, which is further nitrated with nitric acid to 4-chloro-3-chlorosulfonyl-5-nitrobenzoic acid. Reacting this with ammonia gives 5-aminosulfonyl-4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoic acid, which when reacted with sodium phenolate is transformed into 5-amino-sulfonyl-3-nitro-5-phenoxybenzoic acid. Reduction of the nitro group in this product by hydrogen using a palladium on carbon catalyst gives 3-amino-5-aminosulfonyl-5-phenoxybenzoic acid. Finally, reacting this with butyl alcohol in the presence of sulfuric acid, followed by treatment with sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the butyl ester, gives the desired bumetanide. == Society and culture == It 2008, ESPN reported that four NFL players were being suspended under the steroid policy as a result of taking bumetanide. Bumetanide was an undisclosed active ingredient in the over-the-counter weight loss supplement StarCaps, which was removed from the market after its presence was discovered by the United States Food and Drug Administration. == Research == In the brain, bumetanide blocks the NKCC1 cation-chloride co-transporter, and thus decreases internal chloride concentration in neurons. In turn, this concentration change makes the action of GABA more hyperpolarizing, which may be useful for treatment of neonatal seizures, which quite often are not responsive to traditional GABA-targeted treatment, such as barbiturates. Bumetanide is therefore under evaluation as a prospective antiepileptic drug. The drug has also been studied as a treatment for autism. == References == == External links == ""Bumetanide"".

Patients were randomized to once-daily PF-04937319 doses of 10, 50, 100 mg, or matching placebo (Study B1621002); or PF-04937319 doses of 3, 20, 50, 100 mg, or matching placebo (Study B1621007). Titrated glimepiride (Study B1621002) or sitagliptin (Study B1621007) were included in a double-dummy manner. The primary measure was change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at week 12. Key secondary measures included other glycaemic variables and safety and tolerability. In the 639 patients randomized, the minimally efficacious PF-04937319 dose was identified as 50 mg once daily. At the highest PF-04937319 dose tested (100 mg), on average, a clinically significant reduction in HbA1c [-4.94 or -5.11 mmol/mol (-0.45 or -0.47%), placebo-adjusted], which was similar to that achieved with sitagliptin [-4.69 mmol/mol (-0.43%)] but lower than that achieved with titrated glimepiride [-9.07 mmol/mol (-0.83%)], was observed. At this dose, the effect on fasting plasma glucose was not consistent between the two studies (Study B1621002 vs Study B1621007: placebo-adjusted mean change of -0.83 vs +0.50 mmol/l). PF-04937319 was well tolerated at doses up to 100 mg. Hypoglycaemia was reported in 2.5% of patients (on placebo), 5.1% of patients (on PF-04937319 100 mg), 1.8% of patients (on sitagliptin) and 34.4% of patients (on titrated glimepiride). In patients on metformin monotherapy, the addition of a 100-mg dose of PF-04937319 improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated. Glucokinase enhances glucose conversion to glucose-6-phosphate, causing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells and increased hepatic glucose uptake. PF-04937319 is a partial glucokinase activator designed to maintain efficacy with reduced hypoglycemia risk. In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-period crossover phase 1b study, patients aged 18-70 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and on metformin received once-daily PF-04937319 (300 mg), split-dose PF-04937319 (150+100 mg; breakfast+lunch), or sitagliptin (100 mg once daily). The primary end point was day 14 weighted mean daily glucose (WMDG) change from period-specific baseline. Secondary end points included change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose, premeal C-peptide and insulin, and safety, including hypoglycemia frequency. Mean decrease from baseline in observed WMDG (mg/dL) was greater for PF-04937319 (split-dose, -31.24; once daily, -31.33) versus sitagliptin (-19.24). Using the integrated glucose red-cell HbA A Css-MRTpo superposition method was devised to predict (retrospectively) oral plasma concentration-time profiles of PF-04937319 and its MIST-related metabolite, M1, in humans using chimeric mice with humanized liver.Original PK data were taken from a published report in which PF-04937319 and M1 were given to chimeric mice orally and/or intravenously. Human CL and Vss were predicted by single-species allometry and MRTiv,pred were calculated as Vss,pred/CL,pred. MRTpo,human were assumed to be MRTiv,pred plus MAT or mean metabolite formation time (MFT). Human Css was calculated by dividing the corrected oral dose by Vss,pred.Chronological sampling time and measured plasma concentrations were corrected by MRTpo,human and Css,human, respectively, and transformed to the corresponding values in humans.The obtained concentration-time profile of PF-04937319 was superimposed well with the observed data after single and repeated oral administration to humans. The transformed plasma concentration of M1 was somewhat lower than the observed value, but a slow increase of the simulated metabolite reflected gradual increase of observed M1 on Day 1. Transformed M1 gave an almost-flat concentration-time profile on Day 14, which was consistent with the curve observed in humans.

This study characterizes the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of apratastat following oral administration on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) release. Data were obtained from 3 clinical studies carried out in healthy subjects. Apratastat was administered orally in these studies as single doses or multiple doses (twice daily). The inhibition of TNF-α release by apratastat was investigated in studies of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Inhibitory E(max) models were used to characterize the inhibition of TNF-α release in both in vitro and ex vivo studies. Apratastat inhibited TNF-α release with a population mean IC(50) of 144 ng/mL in vitro and of 81.7 ng/mL ex vivo, respectively. The relationship between TNF-α and apratastat plasma concentration in the endotoxin-challenged study in healthy subjects was well characterized by a mechanism-based PD population model with IC(50) of 126 ng/mL. Apratastat can potently inhibit the release of TNF-α in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Even though the dosage provided adequate exposure to inhibit TNF-α release, apratastat was not efficacious in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This inconsistency between TNF-α inhibition and the clinical response requires further investigation. Wyeth Research was developing apratastat (TMI-005), one in a series of dual TNFalpha-converting enzyme and matrix metalloprotease-13 inhibitors, for the potential treatment of inflammation, especially rheumatoid arthritis.

However, the potential applications of chitin are limited owing to its high crystallinity and low solubility. N-acetyl chitooligosaccharides and lacto-N-triose II, the two types of GlcNAc-based oligosaccharides, can be obtained from chitin by enzymatic methods. With their lower molecular weights and improved solubility, these two types of GlcNAc-based oligosaccharides display more various beneficial health effects when compared to chitin. Among their abilities, they have exhibited antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antimicrobial, and plant elicitor activities as well as immunomodulatory and prebiotic effects, which suggests they have the potential to be utilized as food additives, functional daily supplements, drug precursors, elicitors for plants, and prebiotics. This review comprehensively covers the enzymatic methods used for the two types of GlcNAc-based oligosaccharides production from chitin by chitinolytic enzymes. Moreover, current advances in the structural characterization and biological activities of these two types of GlcNAc-based oligosaccharides are summarized in the review.

In our study, we report our findings based on molecular docking analysis which could be the new effective way for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus and additionally, another manipulative possibilities involving the mimicking of immune system as occurred during the bacterial cell recognition system. For this purpose, we performed molecular docking using computational biology techniques on several SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are responsible for its pathogenicity against N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. A similar molecular dynamics analysis has been carried out on both SARS-CoV-2 and anti-Staphylococcus aureus neutralizing antibodies to establish the potential of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine which likely induces the immune response against the virus. The results of molecular dynamic analysis have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (PDB: 6M0J), RNA-binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB: 6WKP), refusion SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer (PDB: 6X79), and main protease 3clpro at room temperature (PDB: 7JVZ) could bind with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine that these proteins play an important role in SARS-CoV-2's infection and evade the immune system. Moreover, our molecular docking analysis has supported a strong protein-ligand interaction of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine with these selected proteins. Furthermore, computational analysis against the D614G mutant of the virus has shown that N-acetyl-D-glucosamine affinity and its binding potential were not affected by the mutations occurring in the virus' receptor binding domain.

It is given the fatty acid notation 22:6(n−3). It can be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid or obtained directly from maternal milk (breast milk), fatty fish, fish oil, or algae oil. The consumption of DHA (e.g., from fatty fish such as salmon, herring, mackerel and sardines) contributes to numerous physiological benefits, including cognition. As a component of neuronal membranes, the function of DHA is to support neuronal conduction and to allow the optimal functioning of neuronal membrane proteins (such as receptors and enzymes). Structurally, DHA is a carboxylic acid (-oic acid) with a 22-carbon chain (docosa- derives from the Ancient Greek for 22) and six (hexa-) cis double bonds (-en-); with the first double bond located at the third carbon from the omega end. Its trivial name is cervonic acid (from the Latin word cerebrum for ""brain""), its systematic name is all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexa-enoic acid. In organisms that do not eat algae containing DHA nor animal products containing DHA, DHA is instead produced internally from α-linolenic acid, a shorter omega−3 fatty acid manufactured by plants (and also occurring in animal products as obtained from plants). Limited amounts of eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids are possible products of α-linolenic acid metabolism in young women and men. DHA in breast milk is important for the developing infant. Rates of DHA production in women are 15% higher than in men. DHA is a major fatty acid in brain phospholipids and the retina. Preliminary research has investigated its potential benefit in Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular disease, and other disorders. == Central nervous system constituent == DHA is the most abundant omega−3 fatty acid in the brain and retina. DHA comprises 40% of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the brain and 60% of the PUFAs in the retina. Fifty percent of a neuronal plasma membrane is composed of DHA. DHA modulates the carrier-mediated transport of choline, glycine, and taurine, the function of delayed rectifier potassium channels, and the response of rhodopsin contained in the synaptic vesicles. Phosphatidylserine (PS) – which contains high DHA content – has roles in neuronal signaling and neurotransmitter synthesis, and DHA deficiency is associated with cognitive decline. DHA levels are reduced in the brain tissue of severely depressed people. == Biosynthesis == === Aerobic eukaryote pathway === Aerobic eukaryotes, specifically microalgae, mosses, fungi, and some animals, perform biosynthesis of DHA as a series of desaturation and elongation reactions, catalyzed by the sequential action of desaturase and elongase enzymes. This pathway, originally identified in Thraustochytrium, applies to these groups: a desaturation at the sixth carbon of alpha-linolenic acid by a delta 6 desaturase to produce stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4 ω-3), elongation of the stearidonic acid by a delta 6 elongase to produce eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA, 20:4 ω-3), desaturation at the fifth carbon of eicosatetraenoic acid by a delta 5 desaturase to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 ω-3), elongation of eicosapentaenoic acid by a delta 5 elongase to produce docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5 ω-3), and desaturation at the fourth carbon of docosapentaenoic acid by a delta 4 desaturase to produce DHA. === Mammals === In humans, DHA is either obtained from the diet or may be converted in small amounts from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, ω-3). With the identification of FADS2 as a human Δ4-desaturase in 2015, it is now known that humans follow the same synthesis pathway as aerobic eukaryotes, involving Δ5-elongation to DPA and Δ4-desaturation to DHA. A ""Sprecher's shunt"" hypothesis, proposed in 1991, postulates that EPA is twice elongated to 24:5 ω-3, then desaturated to 24:6 ω-3 (via delta 6 desaturase) in the mitochondria, then shortened to DHA (22:6 ω-3) via beta oxidation in the peroxisome. The hypothesis was accepted in the absence of an identified Δ4-desaturase in mammals prior to 2015. The shunt model does not match clinical data, specifically that patients with beta oxidation defects do not display issues in DHA synthesis. With the identification of a Δ4-desaturase, it is considered outdated. === Anaerobic pathway === Marine bacteria and the microalgae Schizochytrium use an anerobic polyketide synthase pathway to synthesize DHA. == Metabolism == DHA can be metabolized into DHA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), DHA epoxides, electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of DHA, neuroprostanes, ethanolamines, acylglycerols, docosahexaenoyl amides of amino acids or neurotransmitters, and branched DHA esters of hydroxy fatty acids, among others. The enzyme CYP2C9 metabolizes DHA to epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs; primarily 19,20-epoxy-eicosapentaenoic acid isomers [i.e. 10,11-EDPs]). == Potential health effects == === Cardiovascular === Though mixed and plagued by methodological inconsistencies, there is now convincing evidence from ecological, RCTs, meta-analyses and animal trials that shows a benefit for omega−3 dietary intake for cardiovascular health. Of the n−3 FAs, DHA has been argued to be the most beneficial due to its preferential uptake in the myocardium, its strongly anti-inflammatory activity and its metabolism toward neuroprotectins and resolvins, the latter of which directly contribute to cardiac function. DHA is associated with its role in cardiovascular protection and lowering the risk of coronary artery disease. DHA supplementation has been shown to improve high-density lipoprotein (‘good cholesterol’), and lower total cholesterol as well as blood pressure levels. === Pregnancy and lactation === Foods high in omega−3 fatty acids may be recommended to women who want to become pregnant or when nursing. A working group from the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids recommended 300 mg/day of DHA for pregnant and lactating women, whereas the average consumption was between 45 mg and 115 mg per day of the women in the study, similar to a Canadian study. === Brain and visual functions === A major structural component of the mammalian central nervous system, DHA is the most abundant omega−3 fatty acid in the brain and retina. Brain and retinal function rely on dietary intake of DHA to support a broad range of cell membrane and cell signaling properties, particularly in grey matter and retinal photoreceptor cell outer segments, which are rich in membranes. A systematic review found that DHA had no significant benefits in improving visual field in individuals with retinitis pigmentosa. Animal research shows effect of oral intake of deuterium-reinforced DHA (D-DHA) for prevention of macular degeneration. === Asthma === Omega−3 PUFAs such as DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are effective in the prevention and treatment of asthma and allergic diseases. == Nutrition == Ordinary types of cooked salmon contain 500–1500 mg DHA and 300–1000 mg EPA per 100 grams. Additional rich seafood sources of DHA include caviar (3400 mg per 100 grams), anchovies (1292 mg per 100 grams), mackerel (1195 mg per 100 grams), and cooked herring (1105 mg per 100 grams). Brains from mammals taken as food are also a good direct source. Beef brain, for example, contains approximately 855 mg of DHA per 100 grams in a serving. While DHA may be the primary fatty acid found in certain specialized tissues, these tissues, aside from the brain, are typically small in size, such as the seminiferous tubules and the retina. As a result, animal-based foods, excluding the brain, generally offer minimal amounts of preformed DHA. === Discovery of algae-based DHA === In the early 1980s, NASA sponsored scientific research on a plant-based food source that could generate oxygen and nutrition on long-duration space flights. Certain species of marine algae produced rich nutrients, leading to the development of an algae-based, vegetable-like oil that contains two polyunsaturated fatty acids, DHA and arachidonic acid. === Use as a food additive === DHA is widely used as a food supplement. It was first used primarily in infant formulas. In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration published qualified health claims for DHA. Some manufactured DHA is a vegetarian product extracted from algae, and it competes on the market with fish oil that contains DHA and other omega−3s such as EPA. Both fish oil and DHA are odorless and tasteless after processing as a food additive. === Studies of vegetarians and vegans === Vegetarian diets typically contain limited amounts of DHA, and vegan diets typically contain no DHA. In preliminary research, algae-based supplements increased DHA levels. While there is little evidence of adverse health or cognitive effects due to DHA deficiency in adult vegetarians or vegans, breast milk levels remain a concern for supplying adequate DHA to the infant. === DHA and EPA in fish oils === Fish oil is widely sold in capsules containing a mixture of omega−3 fatty acids, including EPA and DHA. Oxidized fish oil in supplement capsules may contain lower levels of EPA and DHA. Light, oxygen exposure, and heat can all contribute to oxidation of fish oil supplements. Buying a quality product that is kept cold in storage and then keeping it in a refrigerator can help minimize oxidation. === Recommended daily DHA intake for children === As optimal DHA level is important for brain development and maturation, there are established daily recommendations for DHA intake in children. The table below shows the daily DHA / DHA + EPA intake recommended for children of different ages: Experts recommend DHA intake of 10–12 mg/day for children 12–24 months, 100–150 mg/day of DHA+EPA for children 2–4 years old and 150–200 mg/day of DHA+EPA for children 4–6 years old. == See also == DHA-clozapine List of omega−3 fatty acids Polyunsaturated fatty acids == References ==",Doconexent,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.17604517936706543), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -9.088346359931165e-07), (' FOOD', -0.003602917306125164), (',', -0.03805721178650856), (' MED', -0.6333790421485901), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.65123450756073), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('OUS', -2.861018856492592e-06), (',', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.0003415954706724733), (',', -0.38695529103279114), ('ĠMED', -0.007016897201538086), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004157234448939562)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([pharmakb.com](https://www.pharmakb.com/drug-report/doconexent?utm_source=openai), [precision.fda.gov](https://precision.fda.gov/uniisearch/srs/unii/ZAD9OKH9JC?utm_source=openai), [foodb.ca](https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB003003?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=290, start_index=42, title='Doconexent', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmakb.com/drug-report/doconexent?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=290, start_index=42, title='UNII - ZAD9OKH9JC', type='url_citation', url='https://precision.fda.gov/uniisearch/srs/unii/ZAD9OKH9JC?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=290, start_index=42, title='Showing Compound Doconexent (FDB003003) - FooDB', type='url_citation', url='https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB003003?utm_source=openai')])"

It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is used to treat certain bleeding disorders, including warfarin overdose, vitamin K deficiency, and obstructive jaundice. Use is typically recommended by mouth, intramuscular injection or injection under the skin. When given by injection benefits are seen within two hours. It is also recommended for preventing and treating vitamin K deficiency bleeding in infants. Many countries in the world choose intramuscular injections in newborn to keep them safe from vitamin K deficiency bleeding. It is considered a safe treatment and saves many children from death and severe neurologic deficit every year. Side effects when given by injection may include pain at the site of injection. Severe allergic reactions may occur when it is injected into a vein or muscle, but this has mainly happened when large doses of a certain type of supplement containing castor oil were given intravenously. Use during pregnancy is considered safe, use is also likely okay during breastfeeding. It works by supplying a required component for making a number of blood clotting factors. Food sources include green vegetables, vegetable oil, and some fruit. Phytomenadione was first isolated in 1939. In 1943 Edward Doisy and Henrik Dam were given a Nobel Prize for its discovery. == Terminology == Phytomenadione is often also called phylloquinone, vitamin K, or phytonadione. == Medical uses == It is used to treat certain bleeding disorders, including warfarin overdose (also overdose of similar compounds such as coumatetralyl), vitamin K deficiency, and obstructive jaundice. It is used to prevent and treat vitamin K deficiency bleeding in infants. == Chemistry == Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stable in air and moisture but decomposes in sunlight. K1 is a polycyclic aromatic ketone, based on 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, with a 3-phytyl substituent. It is found naturally in a wide variety of green plants, particularly in leaves, since it functions as an electron acceptor during photosynthesis, forming part of the electron transport chain of photosystem I. == Biological function == === Animals === The best-known function of vitamin K in animals is as a cofactor in the formation of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X by the liver. It is also required for the formation of anticoagulant factors protein C and S. Vitamin K is required for bone protein formation. In terms of distribution, phylloquinone typically occurs in higher levels in the liver, heart and pancreas, but in lower levels in the brain, kidneys, and lungs. === Plants and cyanobacteria === Vitamin K1 is required for plant photosynthesis, where it participates in the Photosystem I electron transport chain. == Biosynthesis == Vitamin K1 is synthesized from chorismate, a compound produced from shikimate via the shikimate pathway. The conversion of chorismate to vitamin K1 comprises a series of nine steps: Chorismate is isomerized to isochorismate by isochorismate synthase, or MenF (menaquinone enzyme). Addition of 2-oxoglutarate to isochorismate by PHYLLO, a multifunctional protein comprising three different enzymatic activities (MenD, H, and C). Elimination of pyruvate by PHYLLO. Aromatization to yield o-succinyl benzoate by PHYLLO. O-succinylbenzoate activation to corresponding CoA ester by MenE. Naphthoate ring formation by naphthoate synthase (MenB/NS). Thiolytic release of CoA by a thioesterase (MenH). Attachment of phytol chain to the naphthoate ring (MenA/ABC4).

Similar to other nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), abacavir is used together with other HIV medications, and is not recommended by itself. It is taken by mouth as a tablet or solution and may be used in children over the age of three months. Abacavir is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include vomiting, insomnia (trouble sleeping), fever, and feeling tired. Other common side effects include loss of appetite, headache, nausea (feeling sick), diarrhea, rash, and lethargy (lack of energy). More severe side effects include hypersensitivity, liver damage, and lactic acidosis. Genetic testing can indicate whether a person is at higher risk of developing hypersensitivity. Symptoms of hypersensitivity include rash, vomiting, and shortness of breath. Abacavir is in the NRTI class of medications, which work by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme needed for HIV virus replication. Within the NRTI class, abacavir is a carbocyclic nucleoside. Abacavir was patented in 1988, and approved for use in the United States in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. Abacavir is used together with other HIV medications, such as abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine, abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, and abacavir/lamivudine. The combination abacavir/lamivudine is an essential medicine. == Medical uses == Abacavir, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir should be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents. == Contraindications == Abacavir is contraindicated for people who have the HLA‑B*5701 allele or who have moderate or severe liver disease (hepatic impairment). == Side effects == Common adverse reactions include nausea, headache, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, Anorexia (symptom) (loss of appetite), and insomnia (trouble sleeping). Rare but serious side effects include hypersensitivity reaction such as rash, elevated AST and ALT, depression, anxiety, fever/chills, URI, lactic acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and lipodystrophy. === Hypersensitivity syndrome === Hypersensitivity to abacavir is strongly associated with a specific allele at the human leukocyte antigen B locus namely HLA-B*5701. The mechanism for this hypersensitivity reaction is due to abacavir binding in the antigen-binding cleft of HLA-B*57:01, allowing alternative peptides to bind, which appear as ""non-self"" when presented to T cells. There is an association between the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 and ancestry. The prevalence of the allele is estimated to be 3.4 to 5.8 percent on average in populations of European ancestry, 17.6 percent in Indian Americans, 3.0 percent in Hispanic Americans, and 1.2 percent in Chinese Americans. There is significant variability in the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 among African populations. In African Americans, the prevalence is estimated to be 1.0 percent on average, 0 percent in the Yoruba from Nigeria, 3.3 percent in the Luhya from Kenya, and 13.6 percent in the Masai from Kenya, although the average values are derived from highly variable frequencies within sample groups. Common symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome include fever, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea. Some patients may also develop a skin rash. Symptoms of AHS typically manifest within six weeks of treatment using abacavir, although they may be confused with symptoms of HIV, immune reconstitution syndrome, hypersensitivity syndromes associated with other drugs, or infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an alert concerning abacavir and abacavir-containing medications on 24 July 2008, and the FDA-approved drug label for abacavir recommends pre-therapy screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele and the use of alternative therapy in subjects with this allele. Additionally, both the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommend use of an alternative therapy in individuals with the HLA-B*5701 allele. Skin-patch testing may also be used to determine whether an individual will experience a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, although some patients susceptible to developing AHS may not react to the patch test. The development of suspected hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir requires immediate and permanent discontinuation of abacavir therapy in all patients, including patients who do not possess the HLA-B*5701 allele. On 1 March 2011, the FDA informed the public about an ongoing safety review of abacavir and a possible increased risk of heart attack associated with the drug. A meta-analysis of 26 studies conducted by the FDA, however, did not find any association between abacavir use and heart attack === Immunopathogenesis === The mechanism underlying abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome is related to the change in the HLA-B*5701 protein product. Abacavir binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft. This results in a change in immunological tolerance and the subsequent activation of abacavir-specific cytotoxic T cells, which produce a systemic reaction known as abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome. == Interaction == Abacavir, and in general NRTIs, do not undergo hepatic metabolism and therefore have very limited (to none) interaction with the CYP enzymes and drugs that effect these enzymes. That being said there are still few interactions that can affect the absorption or the availability of abacavir. Below are few of the common established drug and food interaction that can take place during abacavir co-administration: Protease inhibitors such as tipranavir or ritonovir may decrease the serum concentration of abacavir through induction of glucuronidation. Abacavir is metabolized by both alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronidation. Ethanol may result in increased levels of abacavir through the inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase. Abacavir is metabolized by both alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronidation. Methadone may diminish the therapeutic effect of Abacavir. Abacavir may decrease the serum concentration of Methadone. Orlistat may decrease the serum concentration of antiretroviral drugs. The mechanism of this interaction is not fully established but it is suspected that it is due to the decreased absorption of abacavir by orlistat. Cabozantinib: Drugs from the MRP2 inhibitor (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 inhibitors) family such as abacavir could increase the serum concentration of Cabozantinib. == Mechanism of action == Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that inhibits viral replication. It is a guanosine analogue that is phosphorylated to carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP). CBV-TP competes with the viral molecules and is incorporated into the viral DNA. Once CBV-TP is integrated into the viral DNA, transcription and HIV reverse transcriptase is inhibited. == Pharmacokinetics == Abacavir is given orally and is rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability of 83%. Solution and tablet have comparable concentrations and bioavailability. Abacavir can be taken with or without food. Abacavir can cross the blood–brain barrier. Abacavir is metabolized primarily through the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyl transferase to an inactive carboxylate and glucuronide metabolites. It has a half-life of approximately 1.5-2.0 hours. If a person has liver failure, abacavir's half life is increased by 58%. Abacavir is eliminated via excretion in the urine (83%) and feces (16%). It is unclear whether abacavir can be removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. == History == Robert Vince and Susan Daluge along with Mei Hua, a visiting scientist from China, developed the medication in the '80s. Abacavir was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 1998, and is the fifteenth approved antiretroviral drug in the United States. == Synthesis == == References == == Further reading == == External links == Abacavir pathway on PharmGKB",Abacavir sulfate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001734344696160406), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004574206250254065)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699012.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Abacavir: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699012.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Immunomodulatory drugs have garnered extensive attention because they may reduce the rate of COPD exacerbation. This review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nemiralisib in COPD patients. Medical databases, including the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed, were queried from inception to June 2023 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of nemiralisib in COPD patients. This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the included RCTs. Two authors independently conducted literature screening and data extraction. Key information from the included studies was extracted, tabulated, and compared using a data extraction table. Moreover, the key characteristics, quality, potential bias, and endpoint outcomes of the included studies were summarized. A meta-analysis was conducted when the study outcomes were sufficiently comparable, and the required data were available for extraction. Initially, 48 references were identified, leading to the inclusion of four trials. No significant difference was found between the nemiralisib and placebo groups in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale score, COPD Assessment Test score, time to next on-treatment exacerbation, proportion of patients achieving exacerbation recovery, time to exacerbation recovery, and rescue medication use. Contrastingly, the results demonstrated that nemiralisib may lower oral corticosteroid use during acute exacerbation of COPD. Meanwhile, the efficacy of nemiralisib on the exacerbation rate, as well as several parameters associated with lung function, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second, specific airway conductance, specific imaging airway wall thickness, distal specific imaging airway volume measured at functional residual capacity, specific imaging airway resistance, low attenuation score, and internal airflow lobar distribution in the lower pulmonary region, were conflicting. Attributed to the limited number of included RCTs and insufficient extracted data, it was not feasible to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis. Because of insufficient data, this systematic review could not make any definitive statement regarding the efficacy of nemiralisib in COPD patients. In terms of safety, nemiralisib was generally well tolerated. Further trials are required to explore the efficacy of this drug. Management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is sometimes inadequate leading to either prolonged duration and/or an increased risk of recurrent exacerbations in the period following the initial event. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled nemiralisib, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ inhibitor, in patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, COPD patients (40-80 years, ≥10 pack-year smoking history, current moderate/severe acute exacerbation of COPD requiring standard-of-care treatment) were randomized to placebo or nemiralisib 12.5 µg, 50 µg, 100 µg, 250 µg, 500 µg, or 750 µg (ratio of 3:1:1:1:1:1:3; N=938) for 12 weeks with an exploratory 12-week follow-up period. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in post-bronchodilator FEV There was no difference in change from baseline FEV The addition of nemiralisib to standard-of-care treatment for 12 weeks did not improve lung function or re-exacerbations in patients with, and following an acute exacerbation of COPD. However, this study demonstrated that large clinical trials recruiting acutely exacerbating patients can successfully be conducted. Activated PI3Kδ Syndrome (APDS) is a rare inherited inborn error of immunity caused by mutations that constitutively activate the p110 delta isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Kδ), resulting in recurring pulmonary infections. Currently no licensed therapies are available. Here we report the results of an open-label trial in which five subjects were treated for 12 weeks with nemiralisib, an inhaled inhibitor of PI3Kδ, to determine safety, systemic exposure, together with lung and systemic biomarker profiles (Clinicaltrial.gov: NCT02593539). Induced sputum was captured to measure changes in phospholipids and inflammatory mediators, and blood samples were collected to assess pharmacokinetics of nemiralisib, and systemic biomarkers. Nemiralisib was shown to have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with cough being the most common adverse event, and no severe adverse events reported during the study. No meaningful changes in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3; the enzyme product of PI3Kδ) or downstream inflammatory markers in induced sputum, were observed following nemiralisib treatment. Similarly, there were no meaningful changes in blood inflammatory markers, or lymphocytes subsets. Systemic levels of nemiralisib were higher in subjects in this study compared to previous observations. While nemiralisib had an acceptable safety profile, there was no convincing evidence of target engagement in the lung following inhaled dosing and no downstream effects observed in either the lung or blood compartments. We speculate that this could be explained by nemiralisib not being retained in the lung for sufficient duration, suggested by the increased systemic exposure, perhaps due to pre-existing structural lung damage. In this study investigating a small number of subjects with APDS, nemiralisib appeared to be safe and well-tolerated. However, data from this study do not support the hypothesis that inhaled treatment with nemiralisib would benefit patients with APDS.",Nemiralisib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.842555426876061e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0015444743912667036), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011061537079513073)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
2356,"('Quinolin-8-ol', 'Oxyquinoline', 'Oxine', 'Quinophenol', 'Oxychinolin')",Medical,"8-Hydroxyquinoline (also known as oxine) is an organic compound derived from the heterocycle quinoline. A colorless solid, its conjugate base is a chelating agent, which is used for the quantitative determination of metal ions. In aqueous solution 8-hydroxyquinoline has a pKa value of ca. 9.9 It reacts with metal ions, losing the proton and forming 8-hydroxyquinolinato-chelate complexes. The aluminium complex, is a common component of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Substituents on the quinoline ring affect the luminescence properties. In its photo-induced excited-state, 8-hydroxyquinoline converts to zwitterionic isomers, in which the hydrogen atom is transferred from oxygen to nitrogen. == History == 8-hydroxyquinoline was first obtained by Hugo Weidel and his student Albert Cobenzl in 1880. They decarboxylated so-called oxycinchoninic acid (from cinchonine) and characterized the resulting compound as melting at about 70°C. They identified that the hydroxy group is on the benzene ring (but not its particular place) and called the compound oxyquinoline and α-quinophenol. In the following year more chemists found other ways to make the compound. Zdenko Hans Skraup discovered a way to synthesize substituted quinolines from substituted phenols and described three isomers of oxyquinoline, identifying the structure of 8-hydroxyquinoline. Otto Fischer and his student Karl Bedall made the compound from a sulphonic acid independently at about the same time, but misidentified its structure. By 1888 azo dyes were made from the compound. In the 1920s insoluble chelates of 8-hydroxyquinoline were discovered. == Bioactivity == The complexes as well as the heterocycle itself exhibit antiseptic, disinfectant, and pesticide properties, functioning as a transcription inhibitor. Its solution in alcohol is used in liquid bandages. It once was of interest as an anti-cancer drug. A thiol analogue, 8-mercaptoquinoline is also known. The roots of the invasive plant Centaurea diffusa release 8-hydroxyquinoline, which has a negative effect on plants that have not co-evolved with it. == See also == Nitroxoline (5-nitro-8-hydroxyquinoline), an antiprotozoal drug PBT2 QUPIC Ionophore Trace metal detection test == References ==",Oxychinolin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('IND', -0.09059026092290878), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.000431861262768507), (' PERSONAL', -0.31378865242004395), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.31356877088546753), (' MED', -0.01566113717854023), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.19837892055511475), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.008801830001175404), ('ĠMED', -0.03733079880475998), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.4742366075515747)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-Hydroxyquinoline?utm_source=openai), [pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/oxyquinoline-1923?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=224, start_index=24, title='8-Hydroxyquinoline', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-Hydroxyquinoline?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=224, start_index=24, title='Oxyquinoline | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/oxyquinoline-1923?utm_source=openai')])"

Pretreatment of mice with the delta 1-opioid receptor antagonist, [D-Ala2,Leu5,Cys6]enkephalin (DALCE), produced a virtually complete antagonism of the antinociceptive actions of DPDPE, but had no effect on those of [D-Ala2,Glu4]deltorphin. In DALCE pretreated mice (i.e., delta 1-opioid receptors blocked), DPDPE was able to significantly antagonize the antinociceptive effects of [D-Ala2,Glu4]deltorphin. Pretreatment of mice with the delta 2-opioid receptor antagonist, naltrindole-5'-isothiocyanate (5'-NTII) produced a virtually complete antagonism of the antinociceptive effects of [D-Ala2,Glu4]deltorphin, but had no effect on the antinociception produced by DPDPE. In 5'-NTII pretreated mice (i.e., delta 2-opioid receptors blocked), [D-Ala2,Glu4]deltorphin had no effect on the antinociception produced by DPDPE. These data suggest that [D-Ala2,Glu4]deltorphin is highly selective for the delta 2-opioid receptor in vivo, and that neither agonist nor antagonist actions can be demonstrated at delta 1-opioid receptors for this peptide. In contrast, under appropriate conditions, DPDPE can be shown to interact with both delta 1- and delta 2-opioid receptor subtypes; DPDPE may have limited efficacy (i.e., is a partial agonist) at the delta 2-opioid receptor. The present study assessed the discriminative stimulus effects of the delta-opioid agonist [D-Pen2-D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) in pigeons. Food-restricted pigeons were trained to discriminate between i.c.v injections of 100 micrograms [D-Pen2-D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) and saline in a two-key operant procedure; acquisition of discriminative control was rapid (14-28 daily sessions). [D-Ser2, Leu5, Thr6]enkephalin (DSLET) and [D-Ala2]deltorphin II, peptides selective for delta-opioid receptors, produced discriminative stimulus effects similar to DPDPE, and were approximately equipotent to DPDPE. The non-peptidic, delta-opioid agonist BW373U86 (0.032-100 mg/kg, i.m.) partially generalized to DPDPE. The kappa-opioid agonist U69,593 (0.01-1 mg/kg, i.m.), and the mu-opioid agonists, DAMGO (0.1-3.2 micrograms, i.c.v) and morphine (1-10 mg/kg, i.m.), did not produce discriminative stimulus effects similar to DPDPE, up to doses that markedly decreased response rates. Naltrindole (0.1 mg/kg. i.m.), an antagonist selective for delta-opioid receptors, produced approximately a 30-fold reduction in the potency of DPDPE. DPDPE's discriminative stimulus effect in pigeons appears to be mediated through a delta-opioid receptor; this effect may provide a procedure for assessing delta-opioid receptor function in vivo. The characteristics of the binding of [3H]-[D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin were determined in homogenates of guinea-pig and rat brain. In the guinea-pig, the maximum binding capacity for [3H]-[D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin was 4.19 pmol g-1 and the KD 1.61 nM. In the rat, the corresponding values were 2.47 pmol g-1 and 5.42 nM. In both species, the maximum binding capacity and the affinity were not altered when mu-binding was suppressed with [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin.

2359,"('Lersivirine', 'Lersivirine [usan:inn]', 'Lersivirine (usan/inn)', 'Lersivirineuk 453061', 'Uk 453,061')",Medical,"Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). NNRTIs inhibit reverse transcriptase (RT), an enzyme that controls the replication of the genetic material of HIV. RT is one of the most popular targets in the field of antiretroviral drug development. Discovery and development of NNRTIs began in the late 1980s and in the end of 2009 four NNRTI had been approved by regulatory authorities and several others were undergoing clinical development. Drug resistance develops quickly if NNRTIs are administered as monotherapy and therefore NNRTIs are always given as part of combination therapy, the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). == History == Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a leading cause of death in the world. It was identified as a disease in 1981. Two years later the etiology agent for AIDS, the HIV was described. HIV is a retrovirus and has two major serotypes, HIV-1 and HIV-2. The pandemic mostly involves HIV-1 while HIV-2 has lower morbidity rate and is mainly restricted to western Africa. In the year 2009 over 40 million people were infected worldwide with HIV and the number keeps on growing. The vast majority of infected individuals live in the developing countries. HIV drugs do not cure HIV infection, but the treatment aims at improving the quality of patients´ lives and decreased mortality. 25 antiretroviral drugs were available in 2009 for the treatment of HIV infection. The drugs belong to six different classes that act at different targets. The most popular target in the field of antiretroviral drug development is the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. There are two classes of drugs that target the HIV-1 RT enzyme, nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs/NtRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Drugs in these classes are important components of the HIV combination therapy called highly active antiretroviral therapy, better known as HAART. In 1987, the first drug for the treatment of HIV infection was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This was the NRTI called zidovudine. In the late 1980s, during further development of NRTIs, the field of NNRTIs discovery began. The development of NNRTIs improved quickly into the 1990s and they soon became the third class of antiretroviral drugs, following the protease inhibitors. The NNRTIs are HIV-1 specific and have no activity against HIV-2 and other retroviruses. The first NNRTI, nevirapine was discovered by researchers at Boehringer Ingelheim and approved by the FDA in 1996. In the next two years two other NNRTIs were approved by the FDA, delavirdine in 1997 and efavirenz in 1998. These three drugs are so-called first generation NNRTIs. The need for NNRTIs with better resistance profile led to the development of the next generation of NNRTIs. Researchers at Janssens Foundation and Tibotec discovered the first drug in this class, etravirine, which was approved by the FDA in 2008. The second drug in this class, rilpivirine, was also discovered by Tibotec and was approved by the FDA in 2011. In addition to these four NNRTIs several other are in clinical development. == The HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme == === Function === Reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme that controls the replication of the genetic material of HIV and other retroviruses. The enzyme has two enzymatic functions. Firstly it acts as a polymerase where it transcribes the single-stranded RNA genome into single-stranded DNA and subsequently builds a complementary strand of DNA. This provides a DNA double helix which can be integrated in the host cell's chromosome. Secondly it has ribonuclease H (Rnase H) activity as it degrades the RNA strand of RNA-DNA intermediate that forms during viral DNA synthesis. === Structure === The HIV-1 RT is an asymmetric 1000-amino acid heterodimer composed of p66 (560 amino acids) and p51 subunits (440 amino acids). The p66 subunit has two domains, a polymerase and ribonuclease H. The polymerase domain contains four subdomains, which have been termed “fingers”, “palm”, “thumb” and “connection” and it is often compared to a right hand. The role of the p66 subunit is to carry out the activity of RT whereas it contains the active sites of the enzyme. The p51 is believed to play mainly a structural role. == Binding and pharmacophore == Despite the chemical diversity of NNRTIs they all bind at the same site in the RT. The binding occurs allosterically in a hydrophobic pocket located approximately 10 Å from the catalytic site in the palm domain of the p66 subunit site of the enzyme. The NNRTI binding pocket (NNIBP) contains five aromatic (Tyr-181, Tyr-188, Phe-227 and Trp-229), six hydrophobic (Pro-59, Leu-100, Val-106, Val-179, Leu-234 and Pro-236) and five hydrophilic (Lys-101, Lys-103, Ser-105, Asp-132 and Glu-224) amino acids that belong to the p66 subunit and additional two amino acids (Ile-135 and Glu-138) belonging to the p51 subunit. Each NNRTI interacts with different amino acid residues in the NNIBP. An important factor in the binding of the first generation NNRTIs, such as nevirapine, is the butterfly-like shape. Despite their chemical diversity they assume very similar butterfly-like shape. Two aromatic rings of NNRTIs conform within the enzyme to resemble the wings of a butterfly (figure 2). The butterfly structure has a hydrophilic centre as a ‘body’ and two hydrophobic moieties representing the wings. Wing I is usually a heteroaromatic ring and wing II is a phenyl or allyl substituent. Wing I has a functional group at one side of the ring which is capable of accepting and/or donating hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the amino acids Lys-101 and Lys-103. Wing II interacts through π-π interactions with a hydrophobic pocket, formed in most part by the side chains of aromatic amino acids. On the butterfly body a hydrophobic part fills a small pocket which is mainly formed by the side chains of Lys-103, Val-106 and Val-179. However many other NNRTIs have been found to bind to RT in different modes. Second generation NNRTIs such as diarylpyrimidins (DAPYs), have a horseshoe-like shape with two lateral hydrophobic wings and a pyrimidine ring which is the central polar part. The NNIBP is elastic and the conformation depends on the size, specific chemical composition and binding mode of the NNRTI. The total structure of RT has segmental flexibility that depends on the nature of the bound NNRTI. It's important for the inhibitor to have flexibility to be able to bind in the modified pockets of a mutant target. Inhibitor flexibility may not affect the inhibitor-target interactions. == Mechanism of action == The NNRTIs act by binding non-competitively to the RT enzyme (figure 3). The binding causes conformational change in the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and creates the NNIBP. Binding of NNRTI to HIV-1 RT makes the p66 thumb domain hyper extended because it induces rotamer conformation changes in amino acid residues Tyr-181 and Tyr-188. This affects the catalytic activity of the enzyme and blocks the HIV-1 replication by inhibiting the polymerase active site of the RT's p66 subunit. The global conformational change additionally destabilizes the enzyme on its nucleic acid template and reduces its ability to bind nucleotides. The transcription of the viral RNA is inhibited and therefore the replication rate of the virus reduces. Although the exact molecular mechanism is still hypothetical this has been demonstrated by multiple studies to be the primary mechanism of action. In addition to this proposed primary mechanism of action it has been shown that the NNRTIs have other mechanisms of action and interfere with various steps in the reverse transcriptase reaction. The inhibition of reverse transcription by the NNRTIs may be due to effects on the RT Rnase H activity and/or template/primer binding. Some NNRTIs interfere with HIV-1 Gag-Pol polyprotein processing by inhibiting the late stage of HIV-1 replication. It is important to gain profound understanding of the various mechanism of action of the NNRTIs in order to develop next-generation NNRTIs and for understanding the mechanism of drug resistance. == Drug discovery and design == The development of effective anti-HIV drugs is difficult due to wide variations in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The perfect anti-HIV drug chemical should be effective against drug resistance mutation. Understanding the target RT enzyme and its structure, mechanism of drug action and the consequence of drug resistance mutations provide useful information which can be helpful to design more effective NNRTIs. The RT enzyme can undergo change due to mutations that can disturb NNRTI binding. === Discovery === The first two classes of compounds that were identified as NNRTIs were the 1-(2-2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT) and tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jkj] [1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) compounds. The discovery of the TIBO compounds led to the definition of the NNRTI class in the late 1980s when they were unexpectedly found to inhibit RT. This finding initiated researches on mechanism of action for these compounds. The HEPT compounds were described before the TIBO compounds and were originally believed to be NRTIs. Later it was discovered that they shared common mechanism of action with the TIBO compounds. Both the HEPT and TIBO compounds were first to be identified as highly specific and potent HIV-1 RT inhibitors, not active against other RTs. These compounds do not interrupt the cellular or mitochondrial DNA synthesis. The specificity of the NNRTIs for HIV-1 is considered the hallmark of the NNRTI drug class. === Development === ==== First generation NNRTIs ==== After the discovery of HEPT and TIBO, compounds screening methods were used to develop BI-RG-587, the first NNRTI commonly known as nevirapine. Like HEPT and TIBO, nevirapine blocked viral RT activity by non-competitive inhibition (with respect to dNTP binding). This reinforced the idea that the new class of anti-HIV inhibitors was inhibiting the activity of RT but not at the active site. Several molecular families of NNRTIs have emerged following screening and evolution of many molecules. Three NNRTI compounds of the first generation have been approved by the FDA for treating HIV-1 infection. Nevirapine was approved in 1996, delavirdine in 1997 and efavirenz in 1998 (table 1). Two of these drugs, nevirapine and efavirenz, are cornerstones of first line HAART while delavirdine is hardly used nowadays. The structure of these three drugs show the wide array of rings, substituents, and bonds that allow activity against HIV-1 RT. This diversity demonstrates why so many non-nucleosides have been synthesised but doesn't explain why only three drugs have reached the market. The main problem has been the potency of these compounds to develop resistance. ===== Development from α-APA to ITU ===== Crystal structure analysis showed that the first generation NNRTIs (for example TIBO, nevirapine and α-APA) bind HIV-1 RT in a “butterfly-like” conformation. These first generation NNRTIs were vulnerable against the common drug-resistance mutations like Tyr-181C and Tyr-188L/H. This triggered the need for finding new and more effective NNRTIs. ITU (imidoylthiourea), a promising series of NNRTIs emerged from α-APA analogs (figure 4). The ITU compounds were obtained by extending the linker that binds the aryl side groups of the α-APA. A potent ITU compound, R100943, was obtained by an arrangement of the chemical composition of the side groups based on structure-activity relationships (SAR). A crystal structure of the HIV-1/R100943 complex demonstrated that ITU compounds are more flexible than α-APA compound. The ITU compounds showed distinct mode of binding where they bound with ""horseshoe"" or ""U"" mode. The 2,6-dichlorophenyl part of R100943 which corresponds chemically to the wing II 2,6-dibromophenyl part of the α-APA occupied the wing I part in the NNIBP whereas the 4-cyanoanilino part of R100943 occupies the wing II position in the NNIBP. R100943 inhibited HIV-1 and was considerably effective against a number of key NNRTI-resistant mutants like G190A mutation, which caused high-level resistance to loviride (α-APA) and nevirapine. G190A mutation was thought to cause resistance by occupying a part of the binding pocket that would otherwise be filled by the linker part of the butterfly shaped NNRTIs. R100943, in the horseshoe mode of binding, is located at a distance of approximately 6.0 Å from G190. When compared with nevirapine and loviride which bind in the butterfly shape the ITU derivatives revealed improved activity against Tyr-181C and Tyr-188L mutants. A structural study suggested that a potent TIBO compound could partly supplement for the effects of the Tyr-181C mutation by moving itself in the non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket (NNIBP) of the mutant RT. In this context, R100943 has torsional freedom that enables the conformational alternations of the NNRTI. This torsional freedom could be used by the ITU derivate to bind to a mutated NNIBP and thus compensating for the effects of a resistance mutation. Nevertheless, the potency of R100943 against HIV-1 resistant mutants was not adequate for it to be considered as an effective drug candidate. Additionally, the chemical stability of the imidoylthiourea part of the ITU derivative was not favorable for an oral drug. ===== Development from ITU to DATA ===== Changes in the imidoylthiourea complexes led to the synthesis of a new class of compounds, diaryltriazine (DATA). In these compounds, the thiourea part of the ITU compounds was replaced by a triazine ring. The DATA compounds were more potent than the ITU compounds against common NNRTI resistant mutant strains. R106168, a prototype DATA compound, was rather easy to synthesize. Multiple substitutions were made at different positions on all of the three rings and on the linkers connecting the rings. In the pocket, most of the DATA derivatives conformed a horseshoe conformation. The two wings in R106168 (2,6-dichlorobenzyl and 4-cyanoanilino) occupied positions in the pocket similar to that of the two wings of the derivatives of ITU. The central part of the DATA compounds, in which the triazine ring replaced the thiourea group of ITU derivatives, is positioned between the side chains of L100 and V179. This removed a number of torsional degrees of freedom in the central part while keeping the flexibility between the triazine ring and the wings. Chemical substitution or modification in the three-aromatic-ring backbone of the DATA compounds had substantial effect on the activity. R120393, a DATA analog, was designed with a chloroindole part in wing I to expand interactions with the side chain of conserved W229 of the polymerase primer grip loop. R120393 had similar effect as R106168 against most of the NNRTI-resistant mutants. The cloroindole part interacted with the hydrophobic core of the pocket and influenced the binding mode of the R120393 so it went deeper into the pocket compared to the wing I position of other DATA analogs. Crystal structures showed that the DATA compounds could bind the NNIBP in different conformations. The capability to bind in multiple modes made the NNRTIs stronger against drug-resistance mutations. Variability between the inhibitors could be seen when the chemical composition, size of wing I and the two linker groups connecting the rings were altered. The potency of the NNRTIs changed when the triazine nitrogen atoms were substituted with carbons. ==== Next generation NNRTIs ==== Researchers used multi-disciplinary approach to design NNRTIs with better resistance profile and an increased genetic barrier to the development of resistance. A new class of compounds, diarylpyrimide (DAPY), were discovered with the replacement of the central triazine ring from the DATA compounds, with a pyrimidine. This new class was more effective against drug resistant HIV-1 strains than the corresponding DATA analogs. The replacement enabled substitutions to the CH-group at the 5-position of the central aromatic ring. One of the first DAPY compounds, dapivirine (with R1= 2,4,6-trimethylanilino, R2 = R3 = H and Y = NH) was found to be effective against drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. Systematic chemical substitutions were made at the R1, R2, R3 and Y positions to find new DAPY derivatives. This led to the discovery of etravirine which has a bromine substitution at the 5-position (R3) of the pyrimidine ring (with R1 = 2,6-dimethyl-4-cyanoanilino, R2 = NH2 and Y = O) (figure 5). Etravirine was discovered by researchers at the Jansen Research Foundation and Tibotec and approved in 2008 by the FDA. It is used in treatment-experienced adult patients with HIV infection that is multidrug resistant in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. == Resistance == When treating infection, whether bacterial or viral, there is always a risk of the infectious agent to develop drug resistance. The treatment of HIV infection is especially susceptible to drug resistance which is a serious clinical concern in the chemotherapeutic treatment of the infection. Drug resistant HIV-strains emerge if the virus is able to replicate in the presence of the antiretroviral drugs. NNRTI-resistant HIV-strains have the occurring mutations mainly in and around the NNIBP affecting the NNRTI binding directly by altering the size, shape and polarity on different areas of the pocket or by affecting, indirectly, the access to the pocket. Those mutations are primarily noted in domains which span amino acids 98-108, 178-190 or 225-238 of the p66 subunit. The most frequent mutations observed in viruses isolated from patients who have been on a failing NNRTI containing chemotherapy are Lys-103N and Tyr-181C. NNRTI resistance has been linked to over 40 amino acid substitutions in vitro and in vivo. Antiretroviral drugs are never used in monotherapy due to rapid resistance development. The highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in 1996. The treatment regimen combines three drugs from at least two different classes of antiretroviral drugs. The advance of etravirine over other NNRTIs is that multiple mutations are required for the development of drug resistance. The drug has also shown activity against viruses with common NNRTI resistance associated mutations and cross-resistance mutations. == Current status == Five drugs in the class of NNRTIs have been approved by regulatory authorities. These are the first generation NNRTIs nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz and the next generation NNRTIs etravirine, and rilpivirine. Several other NNRTIs underwent clinical development but were discontinued due to unfavourable pharmacokinetic, efficacy and/or safety factors. Currently there are four other NNRTIs undergoing clinical development, IDX899, RDEA-428 and lersivirine (table 2). === Rilpivirine === Rilpivirine is a DAPY compound like etravirine and was discovered when further optimization within this family of NNRTIs was conducted. The resistance profile and the genetic barrier to the development of resistance is comparable to etravirine in vitro. The advantage of rilpivirine over etravirine is a better bioavailability and it is easier to formulate than etravirine. Etravirine has required extensive chemical formulation work due to poor solubility and bioavailability. Rilpivirine was approved by the FDA for HIV therapy in May 2011 under the brand name Edurant. Edurant is approved for treatment-naive patients with a viral load of 100,000 copies/mL or less at therapy initiation. Its recommended dosage is 25 mg orally once daily with a meal, in combination with other antiretrovirals. It is contraindicated for use with proton pump inhibitors due to the increased gastric pH causing decreased rilpivirine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in loss of virologic response and possible resistance. A fixed-dose drug combining rilpivirine with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in August 2011 under the brand name Complera. A newer fixed-dose drug also combining rilpivirine with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) was approved in March 2016 under the brand name Odefsey. === RDEA806 === In 2007 a new family of triazole NNRTIs was presented by researchers from the pharmaceutical company Ardea Biosciences. The selected candidate from the screening executed was RDEA806 belonging to the family of triazoles. It has similar resistance profile against selected NNRTI resistant HIV-1 strains to other next generation NNRTIs. The candidate entered phase IIb clinical trials in the end of 2009, but no further trial have been initiated. Ardea was sold to AstraZeneca in 2012. === Fosdevirine (IDX899) === Fosdevirine (also known as IDX899 and GSK-2248761) is another next generation NNRTI developed by Idenix Pharmaceuticals and ViiV Healthcare. It belongs to the family of 3-phosphoindoles. In vitro studies have shown comparable resistance profile to that of the other next generation NNRTIs. In November 2009 the candidate entered phase II clinical trials, but the trial and all further development was halted when 5 of 35 subjects receiving fosdevirine experienced delayed-onset seizures. === Lersivirine (UK-453061) === Lersivirine belongs to the pyrazole family and is another next generation NNRTI in clinical trials developed by the pharmaceutical company ViiV Healthcare. The resistance profile is similar to that of other next generation NNRTIs. In the end of 2009 lersivirine was in phase IIb. In February 2013, ViiV Healthcare announced a stop of the development program investigating lersivirine. == See also == Antiretroviral drug Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor Protease inhibitor Entry inhibitor Discovery and development of HIV-protease inhibitors Discovery and development of CCR5-receptor antagonists Discovery and development of nucleoside and nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors == References ==",Lersivirine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.0484450437361374e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005670370301231742), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006735123693943024)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24128277/,https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.01455-09,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_development_of_non-nucleoside_reverse-transcriptase_inhibitors ', [])"

It was originally believed to act as an irreversible inhibitor of PARP1 (hence, a PARP inhibitor) and possibly other enzymes through covalent modification, but its effects against PARP were later disproven. It underwent clinical trials for treatment of some types of breast cancer, but was discontinued after disappointing phase III clinical trials. == History == Iniparib was the first putative PARP inhibitor to commence phase III clinical trials. The first was for breast cancer, another was for squamous-cell lung cancer. Preliminary results in June 2009 on triple-negative breast cancer were promising. Later results showed increased median survival of triple-negative breast cancer patients from 7.7 to 12.2 months. In 2009, the FDA began fast-tracking the new drug application of iniparib for triple-negative breast cancer. However, phase III results disclosed in January 2011 were disappointing. Iniparib was also studied as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the fight against malignant glioma, including glioblastoma. Glioma is a resilient type of primary brain tumor (not metastatic) that currently has limited effective therapies, especially for patients whose tumors are in an inoperable location of the brain, such as the interior of the brainstem. During the 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology conference, Sanofi disclosed that iniparib failed to help lung-cancer patients in a late-stage trial, prompting the company to end research into the once-promising compound and take a $285 million charge. == References ==",Iniparib,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -2.45848218582978e-06)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00013636612857226282), ('ICAL', -8.34461570775602e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023271186277270317)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iniparib?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=6, title='Iniparib', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iniparib?utm_source=openai')])"
2363,"('S-adenosyl-l-methionine (disulfate tosylate)', 'Ademetionine (disulfate tosylate)', 'S-adenosyl methionine (disulfate tosylate)', 'Adomet (disulfate tosylate)', 'S-adenosyl-l-methionine')","Endogenous, Medical","S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM), also known under the commercial names of SAMe, SAM-e, or AdoMet, is a common cosubstrate involved in methyl group transfers, transsulfuration, and aminopropylation. Although these anabolic reactions occur throughout the body, most SAM is produced and consumed in the liver. More than 40 methyl transfers from SAM are known, to various substrates such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and secondary metabolites. It is made from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and methionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. SAM was first discovered by Giulio Cantoni in 1952. In bacteria, SAM is bound by the SAM riboswitch, which regulates genes involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis. In eukaryotic cells, SAM serves as a regulator of a variety of processes including DNA, tRNA, and rRNA methylation; immune response; amino acid metabolism; transsulfuration; and more. In plants, SAM is crucial to the biosynthesis of ethylene, an important plant hormone and signaling molecule. == Structure == S-Adenosyl methionine consists of the adenosyl group attached to the sulfur of methionine, providing it with a positive charge. It is synthesized from ATP and methionine by S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase enzyme through the following reaction: ATP + L-methionine + H2O ⇌ {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons } phosphate + diphosphate + S-adenosyl-L-methionine The sulfonium functional group present in S-adenosyl methionine is the center of its peculiar reactivity. Depending on the enzyme, S-adenosyl methionine can be converted into one of three products: adenosyl radical, which converts to deoxyadenosine (AdO): classic rSAM reaction, also cogenerates methionine S-adenosyl homocysteine, releasing methyl radical methylthioadenosine (SMT), homoalanine radical == Biochemistry == === SAM cycle === The reactions that produce, consume, and regenerate SAM are called the SAM cycle. In the first step of this cycle, the SAM-dependent methylases (EC 2.1.1) that use SAM as a substrate produce S-adenosyl homocysteine as a product. S-Adenosyl homocysteine is a strong negative regulator of nearly all SAM-dependent methylases despite their biological diversity. This is hydrolysed to homocysteine and adenosine by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase EC 3.3.1.1 and the homocysteine recycled back to methionine through transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, by one of the two classes of methionine synthases (i.e. cobalamin-dependent (EC 2.1.1.13) or cobalamin-independent (EC 2.1.1.14)). This methionine can then be converted back to SAM, completing the cycle. In the rate-limiting step of the SAM cycle, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) irreversibly reduces 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. === Radical SAM enzymes === A large number of enzymes cleave SAM reductively to produce radicals: 5′-deoxyadenosyl 5′-radical, methyl radical, and others. These enzymes are called radical SAMs. They all feature iron-sulfur cluster at their active sites. Most enzymes with this capability share a region of sequence homology that includes the motif CxxxCxxC or a close variant. This sequence provides three cysteinyl thiolate ligands that bind to three of the four metals in the 4Fe-4S cluster. The fourth Fe binds the SAM. The radical intermediates generated by these enzymes perform a wide variety of unusual chemical reactions. Examples of radical SAM enzymes include spore photoproduct lyase, activases of pyruvate formate lyase and anaerobic sulfatases, lysine 2,3-aminomutase, and various enzymes of cofactor biosynthesis, peptide modification, metalloprotein cluster formation, tRNA modification, lipid metabolism, etc. Some radical SAM enzymes use a second SAM as a methyl donor. Radical SAM enzymes are much more abundant in anaerobic bacteria than in aerobic organisms. They can be found in all domains of life and are largely unexplored. A recent bioinformatics study concluded that this family of enzymes includes at least 114,000 sequences including 65 unique reactions. Deficiencies in radical SAM enzymes have been associated with a variety of diseases including congenital heart disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and increased viral susceptibility. === Polyamine biosynthesis === Another major role of SAM is in polyamine biosynthesis. Here, SAM is decarboxylated by adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.50) to form S-adenosylmethioninamine. This compound then donates its n-propylamine group in the biosynthesis of polyamines such as spermidine and spermine from putrescine. SAM is required for cellular growth and repair. It is also involved in the biosynthesis of several hormones and neurotransmitters that affect mood, such as epinephrine. Methyltransferases are also responsible for the addition of methyl groups to the 2′ hydroxyls of the first and second nucleotides next to the 5′ cap in messenger RNA. == Therapeutic uses == === Osteoarthrtitis pain === As of 2012, the evidence was inconclusive as to whether SAM can mitigate the pain of osteoarthritis; clinical trials that had been conducted were too small from which to generalize. === Liver disease === The SAM cycle has been closely tied to the liver since 1947 because people with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver would accumulate large amounts of methionine in their blood. While multiple lines of evidence from laboratory tests on cells and animal models suggest that SAM might be useful to treat various liver diseases, as of 2012 SAM had not been studied in any large randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that would allow an assessment of its efficacy and safety. === Depression === A 2016 Cochrane review concluded that for major depressive disorder, ""Given the absence of high quality evidence and the inability to draw firm conclusions based on that evidence, the use of SAMe for the treatment of depression in adults should be investigated further."" A 2020 systematic review found that it performed significantly better than placebo, and had similar outcomes to other commonly used antidepressants (imipramine and escitalopram). === Anti-cancer treatment === SAM has recently been shown to play a role in epigenetic regulation. DNA methylation is a key regulator in epigenetic modification during mammalian cell development and differentiation. In mouse models, excess levels of SAM have been implicated in erroneous methylation patterns associated with diabetic neuropathy. SAM serves as the methyl donor in cytosine methylation, which is a key epigenetic regulatory process. Because of this impact on epigenetic regulation, SAM has been tested as an anti-cancer treatment. In many cancers, proliferation is dependent on having low levels of DNA methylation. In vitro addition in such cancers has been shown to remethylate oncogene promoter sequences and decrease the production of proto-oncogenes. In cancers such as colorectal cancer, aberrant global hypermethylation can inhibit promoter regions of tumor-suppressing genes. Contrary to the former information, colorectal cancers (CRCs) are characterized by global hypomethylation and promoter-specific DNA methylation. == Pharmacokinetics == Oral SAM achieves peak plasma concentrations three to five hours after ingestion of an enteric-coated tablet (400–1000 mg). The half-life is about 100 minutes. == Availability in different countries == In Canada, the UK, and the United States, SAM is sold as a dietary supplement under the marketing name SAM-e (also spelled SAME or SAMe). It was introduced in the US in 1999, after the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act was passed in 1994. It was introduced as a prescription drug in Italy in 1979, in Spain in 1985, and in Germany in 1989. As of 2012, it was sold as a prescription drug in Russia, India, China, Italy, Germany, Vietnam, and Mexico. == Adverse effects == Gastrointestinal disorder, dyspepsia and anxiety can occur with SAM consumption. Long-term effects are unknown. SAM is a weak DNA-alkylating agent. Another reported side effect of SAM is insomnia; therefore, the supplement is often taken in the morning. Other reports of mild side effects include lack of appetite, constipation, nausea, dry mouth, sweating, and anxiety/nervousness, but in placebo-controlled studies, these side effects occur at about the same incidence in the placebo groups. === Interactions and contraindications === Taking SAM at the same time as some drugs may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially dangerous condition caused by having too much serotonin. These drugs include, but are certainly not limited to, dextromethorphan (Robitussin), meperidine (Demerol), pentazocine (Talwin), and tramadol (Ultram). SAM can also interact with many antidepressant medications — including tryptophan and the herbal medicine Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) — increasing the potential for serotonin syndrome or other side effects, and may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa for Parkinson's disease. SAM can increase the risk of manic episodes in people who have bipolar disorder. === Toxicity === A 2022 study concluded that SAMe could be toxic. Jean-Michel Fustin of Manchester University said that the researchers found that excess SAMe breaks down into adenine and methylthioadenosine in the body, both producing the paradoxical effect of inhibiting methylation. This was found in laboratory mice, causing harm to health, and in in vitro tests on human cells. == See also == DNA methyltransferase SAM-I riboswitch SAM-II riboswitch SAM-III riboswitch SAM-IV riboswitch SAM-V riboswitch SAM-VI riboswitch List of investigational antidepressants == References == == External links == EINECS number 249-946-8 Shippy, R Andrew; Mendez, Douglas; Jones, Kristina; Cergnul, Irene; Karpiak, Stephen E (2004).

Although used to treat high blood pressure, it does not seem to improve mortality in those with the condition. Other uses include the prevention of migraines and treatment of certain irregular heart beats. It is taken orally (by mouth) or by intravenous injection (injection into a vein). It can also be used with other blood pressure medications. Common side effects include feeling tired, heart failure, dizziness, depression, and shortness of breath. Other serious side effects include bronchial spasm. Use is not recommended during pregnancy and alternative drugs are preferred when breastfeeding. It works by blocking β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart, thus decreasing heart rate, force of heart beats, and blood pressure. Atenolol was patented in 1969 and approved for medical use in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 63rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Atenolol is used for a number of conditions including hyperthyroidism, hypertension, angina, long QT syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, essential tremor (ET), and the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The role for β-blockers in general in hypertension was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom, and later in the United States, as they are less appropriate than other agents such as ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics and angiotensin receptor blockers, particularly in the elderly. === Available forms === Atenolol is available in the form of 25, 50, and 100 mg oral tablets. It is also available in the form of oral tablets containing a combination of 50 or 100 mg atenolol and 50 mg chlortalidone. Atenolol was previously available in a 0.5 mg/mL solution for injection as well, but this formulation was discontinued. == Side effects == Hypertension treated with a β-blocker such as atenolol, alone or in conjunction with a thiazide diuretic, is associated with a higher incidence of new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to those treated with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. β-blockers, of which atenolol is mainly studied, provides weaker protection against stroke and mortality in patients over 60 years old compared to other antihypertensive medications. Diuretics may be associated with better cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes than β-blockers in the elderly. Rarely, atenolol has been associated with induction of acute delirium. == Overdose == Symptoms of overdose are due to excessive pharmacodynamic actions on β1 and also β2-receptors. These include bradycardia (slow heartbeat), severe hypotension with shock, acute heart failure, hypoglycemia and bronchospastic reactions. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Hospitalization and intensive monitoring is indicated. Activated charcoal is useful to absorb the drug. Atropine will counteract bradycardia, glucagon helps with hypoglycemia, dobutamine can be given against hypotension and the inhalation of a β2-mimetic such as hexoprenalin or salbutamol will terminate bronchospasms. Blood or plasma atenolol concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 3 mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 3–30 mg/L in overdose victims. == Interactions == Interactions with atenolol include catecholamine-depleting drugs like reserpine, calcium channel blockers, disopyramide, amiodarone, clonidine, prostaglandin synthase inhibitors like indomethacin, and digitalis glycosides. Most of these interactions involve either additive cardiovascular effects or reduction of atenolol's effects. Atenolol is mainly eliminated renally without being metabolized by the liver or by cytochrome P450 enzymes. As a result, it has little or no potential for cytochrome P450-related drug interactions, for instance with inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes. Accordingly, the broad/non-selective cytochrome P450 inhibitor cimetidine had no effect on atenolol levels, whereas cimetidine has been found to significantly increase metoprolol and propranolol levels. Beta blockers like atenolol can reduce or block the cardiovascular effects of sympathomimetics and amphetamines, such as hypertension and tachycardia. Atenolol has been found to be safe in combination with the non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine and actually improved orthostatic hypotension and hypertensive reactions with phenelzine. However, more research is still needed to assess whether addition of a beta blocker like atenolol to MAOI therapy is safe and effective for improving orthostatic hypotension with MAOIs. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Atenolol is a beta blocker; that is, an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a selective antagonist of the β1-adrenergic receptor with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (i.e., partial agonist activity) or membrane-stabilizing activity. However, the preferential action of atenolol is not absolute, and at high doses, it can also block β2-adrenergic receptors. Beta-blocking effects of atenolol include reduction in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and with exercise, inhibition of tachycardia induced by isoproterenol (a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist), and reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia. The beta-blocking effects of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise-related tachycardia, are apparent within 1 hour and are maximal within 2 to 4 hours following a single oral dose. The general effects of atenolol, including beta-blocking and antihypertensive effects, last for at least 24 hours following oral doses of 50 or 100 mg. With intravenous administration, maximal reduction in exercise-related tachycardia occurs within 5 minutes and following a single 10 mg dose has dissipated within 12 hours. The duration of action of atenolol is dose-related and is correlated with circulating levels of atenolol. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The oral bioavailability of atenolol is approximately 50 to 60%. The absorption of atenolol with oral administration is rapid and consistent but is incomplete. About 50% of an oral dose of atenolol is absorbed from the intestines, with the rest excreted in feces. Maximal concentrations of atenolol occur 2 to 4 hours following an oral dose, whereas peak concentrations occur within 5 minutes with intravenous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of atenolol results in it having relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about 4-fold variation between individuals. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of atenolol is 6 to 16%. Atenolol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier and entering the brain. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. Only small amounts of atenolol are said to enter the brain. The brain-to-blood ratio of atenolol was 0.2 : 1 in one study, whereas the ratio for propranolol was 33 : 1 in the same study. ==== Metabolism ==== Atenolol undergoes minimal or negligible metabolism by the liver. It has been estimated that about 5% of atenolol is metabolized. This is in contrast to other beta blockers like propranolol and metoprolol, but is similar to nadolol. In accordance with its lack of hepatic metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of atenolol are not altered in hepatic impairment, unlike the case of propranolol. Two metabolites of atenolol have been identified: hydroxyatenolol and atenolol glucuronide. It has been said that it is unknown if these metabolites are active. However, another source stated that hydroxyatenolol has one-tenth the beta-blocking activity of atenolol. ==== Elimination ==== Instead of by hepatic metabolism, atenolol is eliminated from the blood mainly via renal excretion. Atenolol is excreted about 40 to 50% in urine and 50% in feces with oral administration. Conversely, it is excreted 85 to 100% in urine unchanged and 10% in feces with intravenous administration. Only very small amounts of hydroxyatenolol and atenolol glucuronide are found in urine with atenolol. The elimination half-life of atenolol is about 6 to 7 hours. The half-life of atenolol does not change with continuous administration. With intravenous administration, atenolol levels rapidly decline (5- to 10-fold) during the first 7 hours and thereafter decline at a rate similar to that with oral administration. The elimination of atenolol is slowed in renal impairment, with the elimination rate being closely related to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and with significant accumulation occurring when the creatinine clearance rate is under 35 mL/min/1.73 m2. At a GFR of less than 10 mL/min, the half-life of atenolol increases up to 36 hours. == Chemistry == Atenolol is a substituted phenethylamine derivative. It is specifically β-phenylethylamine with an α-keto substitution and a 4- substitution on the phenyl ring. The experimental log P of atenolol is 0.16 and its predicted log P ranges from −0.03 to 0.57. Atenolol is closely structurally related to metoprolol and certain other beta blockers. It is also structurally related to the catecholamine neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). == Society and culture == === Changing medical practices === Atenolol has been given as an example of how slow healthcare providers are to change their prescribing practices in the face of medical evidence that indicates that a drug is not as effective as others in treating some conditions. In 2012, 33.8 million prescriptions were written to American patients for this drug. In 2014, it was in the top (most common) 1% of drugs prescribed to Medicare patients. Although the number of prescriptions has been declining steadily since limited evidence articles contesting its efficacy was published, it has been estimated that it would take 20 years for doctors to stop prescribing it for hypertension. Despite its diminished efficacy when compared to newer antihypertensive drugs, atenolol and other beta blockers are still a relevant clinical choice for treating some conditions, since beta blockers are a diverse group of medicines with different properties that still requires further research. As consequence, reasons for the popularity of beta blockers cannot be fully attributed to a slow healthcare system – patient compliance factor, such as treatment cost and duration, also affect adherence and popularity of therapy. == References ==",Atenolol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.169585604860913e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.427741704508662e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a684031.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Atenolol: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a684031.html?utm_source=openai')])"
2365,"('Atenolol', '(rs)-atenolol', 'Tenormin', 'Blokium', 'Normiten')",Medical,"Atenolol is a beta blocker medication primarily used to treat high blood pressure and heart-associated chest pain. Although used to treat high blood pressure, it does not seem to improve mortality in those with the condition. Other uses include the prevention of migraines and treatment of certain irregular heart beats. It is taken orally (by mouth) or by intravenous injection (injection into a vein). It can also be used with other blood pressure medications. Common side effects include feeling tired, heart failure, dizziness, depression, and shortness of breath. Other serious side effects include bronchial spasm. Use is not recommended during pregnancy and alternative drugs are preferred when breastfeeding. It works by blocking β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart, thus decreasing heart rate, force of heart beats, and blood pressure. Atenolol was patented in 1969 and approved for medical use in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 63rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Atenolol is used for a number of conditions including hyperthyroidism, hypertension, angina, long QT syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, essential tremor (ET), and the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.

2366,"('Drospirenone', 'Dihydrospirorenone', 'Dehydrospirorenone', 'Drospirenona', 'Drospirenonum')",Medical,"Drospirenone is a progestin and antiandrogen medication which is used in birth control pills to prevent pregnancy and in menopausal hormone therapy, among other uses. It is available both alone under the brand name Slynd and in combination with an estrogen under the brand name Yasmin among others. The medication is an analog of the drug spironolactone. Drospirenone is taken by mouth. Common side effects include acne, headache, breast tenderness, weight increase, and menstrual changes. Rare side effects may include high potassium levels and blood clots (when taken as a combined oestrogen-progestogen pill), among others. Drospirenone is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has additional antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. Because of its antimineralocorticoid activity and lack of undesirable off-target activity, drospirenone is said to more closely resemble bioidentical progesterone than other progestins. Drospirenone was patented in 1976 and introduced for medical use in 2000. It is available widely throughout the world. The medication is sometimes referred to as a ""fourth-generation"" progestin. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, a formulation of drospirenone with ethinylestradiol was the 145th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Drospirenone (DRSP) is used by itself as a progestogen-only birth control pill, in combination with the estrogens ethinylestradiol (EE) or estetrol (E4), with or without supplemental folic acid (vitamin B9), as a combined birth control pill, and in combination with the estrogen estradiol (E2) for use in menopausal hormone therapy. A birth control pill with low-dose ethinylestradiol is also indicated for the treatment of moderate acne, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation). For use in menopausal hormone therapy, E2/DRSP is specifically approved to treat moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes), vaginal atrophy, and postmenopausal osteoporosis. The drospirenone component in this formulation is included specifically to prevent estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. Drospirenone has also been used in combination with an estrogen as a component of hormone therapy for transgender women. Studies have found that EE/DRSP is superior to placebo in reducing premenstrual emotional and physical symptoms while also improving quality of life. E2/DRSP has been found to increase bone mineral density and to reduce the occurrence of bone fractures in postmenopausal women. In addition, E2/DRSP has a favorable influence on cholesterol and triglyceride levels and decreases blood pressure in women with high blood pressure. Due to its antimineralocorticoid activity, drospirenone opposes estrogen-induced salt and water retention and maintains or slightly reduces body weight. === Available forms === Drospirenone is available in the following formulations, brand names, and indications: Drospirenone 4 mg (Slynd) – progestogen-only birth control pill Drospirenone 3 mg and estetrol 14.2 mg (Nextstellis (US)) – combined birth control pill Ethinylestradiol 30 μg and drospirenone 3 mg (Ocella, Syeda, Yasmin, Zarah, Zumandimine) – combined birth control pill Ethinylestradiol 20 μg and drospirenone 3 mg (Gianvi, Jasmiel, Loryna, Lo-Zumandimine, Nikki, Vestura, Yaz) – combined birth control pill, acne, PMS, PMDD, dysmenorrhea Ethinylestradiol 30 μg, drospirenone 3 mg, and levomefolate calcium 0.451 mg (Beyaz, Tydemy) – combined birth control pill with vitamin B9 supplementation, acne, PMS Estetrol 15 mg and drospirenone 3 mg (Nextstellis (CA)) – combined birth control pill Estradiol 0.5 or 1 mg and drospirenone 0.25 or 0.5 mg (Angeliq) – menopausal hormone therapy (menopausal syndrome, postmenopausal osteoporosis) == Contraindications == Contraindications of drospirenone include renal impairment or chronic kidney disease, adrenal insufficiency, presence or history of cervical cancer or other progestogen-sensitive cancers, benign or malignant liver tumors or hepatic impairment, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, and hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). Renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency are contraindicated because they increase exposure to drospirenone and/or increase the risk of hyperkalemia with drospirenone. == Side effects == Adverse effects of drospirenone alone occurring in more than 1% of women may include unscheduled menstrual bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) (40.3–64.4%), acne (3.8%), metrorrhagia (2.8%), headache (2.7%), breast pain (2.2%), weight gain (1.9%), dysmenorrhea (1.9%), nausea (1.8%), vaginal hemorrhage (1.7%), decreased libido (1.3%), breast tenderness (1.2%), and irregular menstruation (1.2%). === High potassium levels === Drospirenone is an antimineralocorticoid with potassium-sparing properties, though in most cases no increase of potassium levels is to be expected. In women with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease, or in combination with chronic daily use of other potassium-sparing medications (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, heparin, antimineralocorticoids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), a potassium level should be checked after two weeks of use to test for hyperkalemia. Persistent hyperkalemia that required discontinuation occurred in 2 out of around 1,000 women (0.2%) with 4 mg/day drospirenone alone in clinical trials. === Blood clots === Birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol and a progestin are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The incidence is about 4-fold higher on average than in women not taking a birth control pill. The absolute risk of VTE with ethinylestradiol-containing birth control pills is small, in the area of 3 to 10 out of 10,000 women per year, relative to 1 to 5 out of 10,000 women per year not taking a birth control pill. The risk of VTE during pregnancy is 5 to 20 in 10,000 women per year and during the postpartum period is 40 to 65 per 10,000 women per year. The higher risk of VTE with combined birth control pills is thought to be due to the ethinylestradiol component, as ethinylestradiol has estrogenic effects on liver synthesis of coagulation factors which result in a procoagulatory state. In contrast to ethinylestradiol-containing birth control pills, neither progestogen-only birth control nor the combination of transdermal estradiol and an oral progestin in menopausal hormone therapy is associated with an increased risk of VTE. Different progestins in ethinylestradiol-containing birth control pills have been associated with different risks of VTE. Birth control pills containing progestins such as desogestrel, gestodene, drospirenone, and cyproterone acetate have been found to have 2- to 3-fold the risk of VTE of birth control pills containing levonorgestrel in retrospective cohort and nested case–control observational studies. However, this area of research is controversial, and confounding factors may have been present in these studies. Other observational studies, specifically prospective cohort and case control studies, have found no differences in risk between different progestins, including between birth control pills containing drospirenone and birth control pills containing levonorgestrel. These kinds of observational studies have certain advantages over the aforementioned types of studies, like better ability to control for confounding factors. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of all of the data in the mid-to-late 2010s found that birth control pills containing cyproterone acetate, desogestrel, drospirenone, or gestodene overall were associated with a risk of VTE of about 1.3- to 2.0-fold compared to that of levonorgestrel-containing birth control pills. Androgenic progestins have been found to antagonize to some degree the effects of ethinylestradiol on coagulation. As a result, more androgenic progestins, like levonorgestrel and norethisterone, may oppose the procoagulatory effects of ethinylestradiol and result in a lower increase in risk of VTE. Conversely, this would be the case less or not at all with progestins that are less androgenic, like desogestrel and gestodene, as well as with progestins that are antiandrogenic, like drospirenone and cyproterone acetate. In the early 2010s, the FDA updated the label for birth control pills containing drospirenone and other progestins to include warnings for stopping use prior to and after surgery, and to warn that such birth control pills may have a higher risk of blood clots. === Breast cancer === Drospirenone has been found to stimulate the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells in preclinical research, similarly to certain other progestins. However, some evidence suggests that drospirenone may do this more weakly than certain other progestins, like medroxyprogesterone acetate. The combination of estradiol and drospirenone has been found to increase breast density, an established risk factor for breast cancer, in postmenopausal women. Data on risk of breast cancer in women with newer progestins like drospirenone are lacking at present. Progestogen-only birth control is not generally associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Conversely, combined birth control and menopausal hormone therapy with an estrogen and a progestogen are associated with higher risks of breast cancer. == Overdose == These have been no reports of serious adverse effects with overdose of drospirenone. Symptoms that may occur in the event of an overdose may include nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding. There is no antidote for overdose of drospirenone and treatment of overdose should be based on symptoms. Since drospirenone has antimineralocorticoid activity, levels of potassium and sodium should be measured and signs of metabolic acidosis should be monitored. == Interactions == Inhibitors and inducers of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 may influence the levels and efficacy of drospirenone. Treatment for 10 days with 200 mg twice daily ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor among other actions, has been found to result in a moderate 2.0- to 2.7-fold increase in exposure to drospirenone. Drospirenone does not appear to influence the metabolism of omeprazole (metabolized via CYP2C19), simvastatin (metabolized via CYP3A4), or midazolam (metabolized via CYP3A4), and likely does not influence the metabolism of other medications that are metabolized via these pathways. Drospirenone may interact with potassium-sparing medications such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, heparin, antimineralocorticoids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to further increase potassium levels. This may increase the risk of hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Drospirenone binds with high affinity to the progesterone receptor (PR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), with lower affinity to the androgen receptor (AR), and with very low affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). It is an agonist of the PR and an antagonist of the MR and AR, and hence is a progestogen, antimineralocorticoid, and antiandrogen. Drospirenone has no estrogenic activity and no appreciable glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. ==== Progestogenic activity ==== Drospirenone is an agonist of the PR, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has about 35% of the affinity of promegestone for the PR and about 19 to 70% of the affinity of progesterone for the PR. Drospirenone has antigonadotropic and functional antiestrogenic effects as a result of PR activation. The ovulation-inhibiting dosage of drospirenone is 2 to 3 mg/day. Inhibition of ovulation occurred in about 90% of women at a dose of 0.5 to 2 mg/day and in 100% of women at a dose of 3 mg/day. The total endometrial transformation dose of drospirenone is about 50 mg per cycle, whereas its daily dose is 2 mg for partial transformation and 4 to 6 mg for full transformation. The medication acts as a contraceptive by activating the PR, which suppresses the secretion of luteinizing hormone, inhibits ovulation, and alters the cervical membrane and endometrium. Due to its antigonadotropic effects, drospirenone inhibits the secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and suppresses gonadal sex hormone production, including of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. Drospirenone alone at 4 mg/day has been found to suppress estradiol levels in premenopausal women to about 40 to 80 pg/mL depending on the time of the cycle. No studies of the antigonadotropic effects of drospirenone or its influence on hormone levels appear to have been conducted in men. In male cynomolgus monkeys however, 4 mg/kg/day oral drospirenone strongly suppressed testosterone levels. ==== Antimineralocorticoid activity ==== Drospirenone is an antagonist of the MR, the biological target of mineralocorticoids like aldosterone, and hence is an antimineralocorticoid. It has about 100 to 500% of the affinity of aldosterone for the MR and about 50 to 230% of the affinity of progesterone for the MR. Drospirenone is about 5.5 to 11 times more potent as an antimineralocorticoid than spironolactone in animals. Accordingly, 3 to 4 mg drospirenone is said to be equivalent to about 20 to 25 mg spironolactone in terms of antimineralocorticoid activity. It has been said that the pharmacological profile of drospirenone more closely resembles that of progesterone than other progestins due to its antimineralocorticoid activity. Drospirenone is the only clinically used progestogen with prominent antimineralocorticoid activity besides progesterone. For comparison to progesterone, a 200 mg dose of oral progesterone is considered to be approximately equivalent in antimineralocorticoid effect to a 25 to 50 mg dose of spironolactone. Both drospirenone and progesterone are actually weak partial agonists of the MR in the absence of mineralocorticoids. Due to its antimineralocorticoid activity, drospirenone increases natriuresis, decreases water retention and blood pressure, and produces compensatory increases in plasma renin activity as well as circulating levels and urinary excretion of aldosterone. This has been shown to occur at doses of 2 to 4 mg/day. Similar effects occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle due to increased progesterone levels and the resulting antagonism of the MR. Estrogens, particularly ethinylestradiol, activate liver production of angiotensinogen and increase levels of angiotensinogen and angiotensin II, thereby activating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. As a result, they can produce undesirable side effects including increased sodium excretion, water retention, weight gain, and increased blood pressure. Progesterone and drospirenone counteract these undesirable effects via their antimineralocorticoid activity. Accumulating research indicates that antimineralocorticoids like drospirenone and spironolactone may also have positive effects on adipose tissue and metabolic health. ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== Drospirenone is an antagonist of the AR, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has about 1 to 65% of the affinity of the synthetic anabolic steroid metribolone for the AR. The medication is more potent as an antiandrogen than spironolactone, but is less potent than cyproterone acetate, with about 30% of its antiandrogenic activity in animals. Progesterone displays antiandrogenic activity in some assays similarly to drospirenone, although this issue is controversial and many researchers regard progesterone as having no significant antiandrogenic activity. Drospirenone shows antiandrogenic effects on the serum lipid profile, including higher HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and lower LDL cholesterol levels, at a dose of 3 mg/day in women. The medication does not inhibit the effects of ethinylestradiol on sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and serum lipids, in contrast to androgenic progestins like levonorgestrel but similarly to other antiandrogenic progestins like cyproterone acetate. SHBG levels are significantly higher with ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate than with ethinylestradiol and drospirenone, owing to the more potent antiandrogenic activity of cyproterone acetate relative to drospirenone. Androgenic progestins like levonorgestrel have been found to inhibit the procoagulatory effects of estrogens like ethinylestradiol on hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors, whereas this may occur less or not at all with weakly androgenic progestins like desogestrel and antiandrogenic progestins like drospirenone. ==== Other activity ==== Drospirenone stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins act similarly in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone and progestins in clinical studies. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The oral bioavailability of drospirenone is between 66 and 85%. Peak levels occur 1 to 6 hours after an oral dose. Levels are about 27 ng/mL after a single 4 mg dose. There is 1.5- to 2-fold accumulation in drospirenone levels with continuous administration, with steady-state levels of drospirenone achieved after 7 to 10 days of administration. Peak levels of drospirenone at steady state with 4 mg/day drospirenone are about 41 ng/mL. With the combination of 30 μg/day ethinylestradiol and 3 mg/day drospirenone, peak levels of drospirenone after a single dose are 35 ng/mL, and levels at steady state are 60 to 87 ng/mL at peak and 20 to 25 ng/mL at trough. The pharmacokinetics of oral drospirenone are linear with a single dose across a dose range of 1 to 10 mg. Intake of drospirenone with food does not influence the absorption of drospirenone. ==== Distribution ==== The distribution half-life of drospirenone is about 1.6 to 2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution of drospirenone is approximately 4 L/kg. The plasma protein binding of drospirenone is 95 to 97%. It is bound to albumin and 3 to 5% circulates freely or unbound. Drospirenone has no affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), and hence is not bound by these plasma proteins in the circulation. ==== Metabolism ==== The metabolism of drospirenone is extensive. It is metabolized into the acid form of drospirenone by opening of its lactone ring. The medication is also metabolized by reduction of its double bond between the C4 and C5 positions and subsequent sulfation. The two major metabolites of drospirenone are drospirenone acid and 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone 3-sulfate, and are both formed independently of the cytochrome P450 system. Neither of these metabolites are known to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone also undergoes oxidative metabolism by CYP3A4. ==== Elimination ==== Drospirenone is excreted in urine and feces, with slightly more excreted in feces than in urine. Only trace amounts of unchanged drospirenone can be found in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites can be identified in urine and feces. Drospirenone and its metabolites are excreted in urine about 38% as glucuronide conjugates, 47% as sulfate conjugates, and less than 10% in unconjugated form. In feces, excretion is about 17% glucuronide conjugates, 20% sulfate conjugates, and 33% unconjugated. The elimination half-life of drospirenone is between 25 and 33 hours. The half-life of drospirenone is unchanged with repeated administration. Elimination of drospirenone is virtually complete 10 days after the last dose. == Chemistry == Drospirenone, also known as 1,2-dihydrospirorenone or as 17β-hydroxy-6β,7β:15β,16β-dimethylene-3-oxo-17α-pregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid, γ-lactone, is a synthetic steroidal 17α-spirolactone, or more simply a spirolactone. It is an analogue of other spirolactones like spironolactone, canrenone, and spirorenone. Drospirenone differs structurally from spironolactone only in that the C7α acetyl thio substitution of spironolactone has been removed and two methylene groups have been substituted in at the C6β–7β and C15β–16β positions. Spirolactones like drospirenone and spironolactone are derivatives of progesterone, which likewise has progestogenic and antimineralocorticoid activity. The loss of the C7α acetylthio group of spironolactone, a compound with negligible progestogenic activity, appears to be involved in the restoration of progestogenic activity in drospirenone, as SC-5233, the analogue of spironolactone without a C7α substitution, has potent progestogenic activity similarly to drospirenone. == History == Drospirenone was patented in 1976 and introduced for medical use in 2000. Schering AG of Germany has been granted several patents on the production of drospirenone, including WIPO and US patents, granted in 1998 and 2000, respectively. It was introduced for medical use in combination with ethinylestradiol as a combined birth control pill in 2000. Drospirenone is sometimes described as a ""fourth-generation"" progestin based on its time of introduction. The medication was approved for use in menopausal hormone therapy in combination with estradiol in 2005. Drospirenone was introduced for use as a progestogen-only birth control pill in 2019. A combined birth control pill containing estetrol and drospirenone was approved in 2021. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Drospirenone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while drospirénone is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. Its name is a shortened form of the name 1,2-dihydrospirorenone or dihydrospirenone. Drospirenone is also known by its developmental code names SH-470 and ZK-30595 (alone), BAY 86-5300, BAY 98-7071, and SH-T-00186D (in combination with ethinylestradiol), BAY 86-4891 (in combination with estradiol), and FSN-013 (in combination with estetrol). === Brand names === Drospirenone is marketed in combination with an estrogen under a variety of brand names throughout the world. Among others, it is marketed in combination with ethinylestradiol under the brand names Yasmin and Yaz, in combination with estetrol under the brand name Nextstellis, and in combination with estradiol under the brand name Angeliq. === Availability === Drospirenone is marketed widely throughout the world. === Generation === Drospirenone has been categorized as a ""fourth-generation"" progestin. === Litigation === Many lawsuits have been filed against Bayer, the manufacturer of drospirenone, due to the higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) that has been observed with combined birth control pills containing drospirenone and certain other progestins relative to the risk with levonorgestrel-containing combined birth control pills. In July 2012, Bayer notified its stockholders that there were more than 12,000 such lawsuits against the company involving Yaz, Yasmin, and other birth control pills with drospirenone. They also noted that the company by then had settled 1,977 cases for US$402.6 million, for an average of US$212,000 per case, while setting aside US$610.5 million to settle the others. As of 17 July 2015, there have been at least 4,000 lawsuits and claims still pending regarding VTE related to drospirenone. This is in addition to around 10,000 claims that Bayer has already settled without admitting liability. These claims of VTE have amounted to US$1.97 billion. Bayer also reached a settlement for arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and heart attacks, for US$56.9 million. == Research == A combination of ethinylestradiol, drospirenone, and prasterone is under development by Pantarhei Bioscience as a combined birth control pill for prevention of pregnancy in women. It includes prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone; DHEA), an oral androgen prohormone, to replace testosterone and avoid testosterone deficiency caused by suppression of testosterone by ethinylestradiol and drospirenone. As of August 2018, the formulation is in phase II/III clinical trials. Drospirenone has been suggested for potential use as a progestin in male hormonal contraception. Drospirenone has been studied in forms for parenteral administration. == References == == Further reading ==",Dihydrospirorenone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0031947086099535227), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.2523488998413086), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0029886364936828613)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -3.583550642360933e-05)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drospirenone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Drospirenone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drospirenone?utm_source=openai')])"

2369,"('Taprenepag', 'Cp 544326', 'Pf 04217329', 'Taprenepagum', 'Taprenepag [usan:inn]')",Medical," Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are characterized by abnormalities in brain development and neurobehaviors, including autism. The maternal-fetal interface (MFI) is a highly specialized tissue through which maternal factors affect fetal brain development. However, limited research exists on restoring and maintaining MFI homeostasis and its potential impact on NDDs. This study explores the role of placental indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) in MFI homeostasis and fetal brain development. The maternal-fetal barrier was disrupted by sodium valproate (VPA) in pregnant mice, whose offspring show typical autism-like behaviors. Ultrastructural analysis and flow cytometric analysis were conducted to observe the morphological and immune system changes. Behavioral tests and immunofluorescence staining was used to investigate the ability and mechanism of taprenepag to alleviate the abnormal behaviors of VPA-exposed offspring and normalize the development of serotonergic neurons. In VPA-exposed pregnant mice, the downregulation of IDO-1 led to maternal immune overactivation and disruption of maternal-fetal barrier, resulting in excessive 5-HT synthesis in the placenta. This process disrupted the development of the serotonergic neuronal system in the offspring, resulting in impaired development of serotonergic neurons, thalamocortical axons, and NDDs in the progeny. However, a single injection of taprenepag at E13.5 ultimately upregulated placental IDO-1 through amplifying the positive feedback loop COX-2/PGE Taprenepag improved autism-like behaviors in the offspring of VPA-exposed mice by addressing placental IDO-1 downregulation. This study highlights the potential of targeting IDO-1 to mitigate MFI disruption and NDD development. To assess the effect of topical taprenepag isopropyl on each layer of the cornea by confocal microscopy. Thirty-two ocular hypertensive or glaucoma patients were randomized into a 2-period, crossover study of 14 days of 0.1% taprenepag alone and in unfixed combination with 0.005% latanoprost (combination therapy). Baseline and sequential slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fluorescein staining, central ultrasonic pachymetry, and confocal microscopy were performed. Confocal images were analyzed for the density of the central superficial and basal epithelium, midstromal keratocytes, and endothelium, as well as endothelial coefficient of variation and percentage of hexagonal cells, and reflectivity of anterior stromal and midstromal layers. Corneal staining increased from baseline, reaching a peak at day 13 (69% and 63% of subjects treated with monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively), which resolved by day 35. A statistically significant increase in mean corneal thickness for both eyes and both treatments occurred on days 7 and 13 (range, 20-27 μm; P < 0.001) but recovered (≤ 6 μm) by day 35. No statistically significant changes were observed in the basal epithelial, midstromal, or endothelial cells. Mean ratio of average reflectivity of anterior stroma to midstroma increased on days 13 and 35 in period 1 for each treatment (range, 1.2-1.9; P < 0.001), and this increase persisted during period 2. Anterior stromal reflectivity may remain increased even when biomicroscopic and confocal images of corneal layers remain normal or have recovered after topical taprenepag. This subclinical measure may be useful to detect a persistent adverse effect of a topical agent on the cornea. To evaluate the safety of escalating doses of taprenepag isopropyl (PF-04217329), a selective EP(2) receptor agonist administered as a topical ophthalmic solution, versus its vehicle (Stage I), and dose-response of taprenepag isopropyl alone and in unfixed combination with latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% versus latanoprost alone (Stage II).

2374,"('Thymol', 'Thyme camphor', 'Thymic acid', 'Phenol, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-', 'Isopropyl cresol')",Medical,"Thymol (also known as 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol, IPMP), C10H14O, is a natural monoterpenoid phenol derivative of p-Cymene, isomeric with carvacrol. It occurs naturally in the oil of thyme, and it is extracted from Thymus vulgaris (common thyme), ajwain, and various other plants as a white crystalline substance of a pleasant aromatic odor and strong antiseptic properties. Thymol also provides the distinctive, strong flavor of the culinary herb thyme, also produced from T. vulgaris. Thymol is only slightly soluble in water at neutral pH, but it is extremely soluble in alcohols and other organic solvents. It is also soluble in strongly alkaline aqueous solutions due to deprotonation of the phenol. Its dissociation constant (pKa) is 10.59±0.10. Thymol absorbs maximum UV radiation at 274 nm. == Chemical synthesis == Thymol is produced by the alkylation of m-cresol and propene: CH3C6H4OH + CH2CHCH3 → ((CH3)2CH)CH3C6H3OH A predicted method of biosynthesis of thymol in thyme and oregano begins with the cyclization of geranyl diphosphate by TvTPS2 to γ-terpinene. Oxidation by a cytochrome P450 in the CYP71D subfamily creates a dienol intermediate, which is then converted into a ketone by short-chain dehydrogenase. Lastly, keto-enol tautomerization gives thymol. == History == Ancient Egyptians used thyme for embalming. The ancient Greeks used it in their baths and burned it as incense in their temples, believing it was a source of courage. The spread of thyme throughout Europe was thought to be due to the Romans, as they used it to purify their rooms and to ""give an aromatic flavour to cheese and liqueurs"". In the European Middle Ages, the herb was placed beneath pillows to aid sleep and ward off nightmares. In this period, women also often gave knights and warriors gifts that included thyme leaves, because it was believed to bring courage to the bearer. Thyme was also used as incense and placed on coffins during funerals, because it was supposed to ensure passage into the next life. The bee balms Monarda fistulosa and Monarda didyma, North American wildflowers, are natural sources of thymol. The Blackfoot Native Americans recognized these plants' strong antiseptic action and used poultices of the plants for skin infections and minor wounds. A tisane made from them was also used to treat mouth and throat infections caused by dental caries and gingivitis. Thymol was first isolated by German chemist Caspar Neumann in 1719. In 1853, French chemist Alexandre Lallemand (1816-1886) named thymol and determined its empirical formula. Antiseptic properties of thymol were discovered in 1875, and it was first synthesized by Swedish chemist Oskar Widman (1852-1930) in 1882. == Extraction == The conventional method of extracting is hydro-distillation (HD), but can also be extracted with solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME). In 30 minutes, SFME yields similar amounts of thymol with more oxygenated compounds than 4.5 hours of hydro-distillation at atmospheric pressures without the need for solvent. == Uses == Thymol during the 1910s was the treatment of choice for hookworm infection in the United States. People of the Middle East continue to use za'atar, a delicacy made with large amounts of thyme, to reduce and eliminate internal parasites. It is also used as a preservative in halothane, an anaesthetic, and as an antiseptic in mouthwash. When used to reduce plaque and gingivitis, thymol has been found to be more effective when used in combination with chlorhexidine than when used purely by itself. Thymol is also the active antiseptic ingredient in some toothpastes, such as Johnson & Johnson's Euthymol. Thymol has been used to successfully control varroa mites and prevent fermentation and the growth of mold in bee colonies. Thymol is also used as a rapidly degrading, non-persisting pesticides such as insecticides and fungicides which are leveraged in plant care products, where its environmentally friendly, rapid degradation ensures it doesn’t leave persistent residues while effectively controlling pests and fungal issues. Thymol can also be used as a medical disinfectant and general purpose disinfectant. Thymol is also used in the production of menthol through the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring. == List of plants that contain thymol == Illicium verum Euphrasia rostkoviana Lagoecia cuminoides Monarda didyma Monarda fistulosa Mosla chinensis Ocimum gratissimum L. Origanum compactum Origanum dictamnus Origanum onites Origanum vulgare Satureja hortensis Satureja thymbra Thymus glandulosus Thymus hyemalis Thymus serpyllum Thymus praecox Thymus vulgaris Thymus zygis Trachyspermum ammi == Toxicology and environmental impacts == In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviewed the research literature on the toxicology and environmental impact of thymol and concluded that ""thymol has minimal potential toxicity and poses minimal risk"". === Environmental breakdown and use as a pesticide === Studies have shown that hydrocarbon monoterpenes and thymol in particular degrade rapidly (DT50 16 days in water, 5 days in soil) in the environment and are, thus, low risks because of rapid dissipation and low bound residues, supporting the use of thymol as a pesticide agent that offers a safe alternative to other more persistent chemical pesticides that can be dispersed in runoff and produce subsequent contamination. Though, there has been recent research into sustained released systems for botanically derived pesticides, such as using natural polysaccharides which would be biodegradable and biocompatible. == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia Japanese Pharmacopoeia == See also == Thymoquinone Nigella sativa Bromothymol == Notes and references == == External links == Media related to Thymol at Wikimedia Commons",Thyme camphor,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.3890773057937622), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.045366935431957245), (',', -2.7729658540920354e-05), (' PERSONAL', -0.026313073933124542), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.00673905061557889), (' INDUSTR', -4.842555426876061e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.03343527391552925), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0004593271005433053), ('ĠMED', -0.3405397832393646), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.023253832012414932), ('ĠPERSON', -0.6987877488136292), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.0609570381348021e-05), (',', -0.5759748220443726), ('ĠINDU', -0.0012167439563199878), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -2.074220174108632e-05), ('AL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005300397519022226)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.001170225441455841), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.3132631182670593), (' PERSONAL', -0.00022022522171027958), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymol,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camphor,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266048756_Chemical_Composition_and_Antimicrobial_Activity_of_Essential_Oil_of_Thyme_Thymus_vulgaris_from_Eastern_Morocco ', [])"

2376,"('Endoxifen (hydrochloride)', 'Endoxifen', 'Z-endoxifen', 'Endoxifen z-isomer', 'N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen')",Medical,"Endoxifen, also known as 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen, is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene group as well as a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. It is under development for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and for the treatment of mania in bipolar disorder. It is taken by mouth. Endoxifen is an active metabolite of tamoxifen and has been found to be effective in patients that have failed previous hormonal therapies (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and fulvestrant). The prodrug tamoxifen is metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme to produce endoxifen and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen). Currently, endoxifen is approved by Drugs Controller General of India for the acute treatment of manic episode with or without mixed features of Bipolar I disorder. It is manufactured and sold by Intas Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Zonalta. == Medical uses == === Bipolar disorder === Endoxifen is used to treat manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in India. It has been found that the endoxifen improves manic symptoms as well as mixed episode symptoms of patients with bipolar I disorder and has been considered an effective and well-tolerated treatment for this condition. Bipolar disorder is associated with overactive protein kinase C (PKC) intracellular signaling. To date, there have been three phases of clinical trials. And, in the phase III trials, endoxifen reduced the total Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score from 33.1 to 17.8. A significant (p < 0.001) improvement in Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score was observed for endoxifen (4.8 to 2.5). The endoxifen is well-tolerated by the subjects as depicted in the changes in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scores. == Side effects == The most prevalent side effects for endoxifen include headache, vomiting, insomnia. Other side effects were: gastritis, epigastric discomfort, diarrhea, restlessness, somnolence, etc. Some of the adverse events reported with other therapies for the management of manic episodes of bipolar I disorder were not observed during the clinical development program of endoxifen like reduction in platelet count, change in blood thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. There were no deaths, serious or significant adverse events during the conduct of trials. Overall, endoxifen was found to be well-tolerated and safe in patients of bipolar I disorder with acute manic episodes with or without mixed features. An important caveat here is that the trial was of very short duration (only three weeks). The long-term safety of Endoxifen has not been established among patients with Bipolar Disorder. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Selective estrogen receptor modulator ==== Endoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with estrogenic and antiestrogenic actions. In the first study to evaluate the pharmacology of endoxifen, it showed 25% of the affinity of estradiol for the estrogen receptor (ER) while afimoxifene had 35% of the affinity of estradiol for the ER. The antiestrogenic actions of endoxifen and afimoxifene in this study were very similar. In another study, the affinity of endoxifen for the ERα was 12.1% and its affinity for the ERβ was 4.75% relative to estradiol. For comparison, afimoxifene had relative binding affinities for the ERα and ERβ of 19.0% and 21.5% compared to estradiol, respectively. In yet another investigation, both endoxifen and afimoxifene had 181% of the affinity of estradiol for the ER whereas tamoxifen had 2.8% and N-desmethyltamoxifen had 2.4%. ==== Protein kinase C inhibition ==== The exact mechanism by which endoxifen exerts its therapeutic effects has not been established in bipolar I disorder. However, the efficacy of endoxifen could be mediated through protein kinase C (PKC). The PKC represents a family of enzymes highly enriched in the brain, where it plays a major role in regulating both pre-and post-synaptic aspects of neurotransmission. Excessive activation of PKC results in symptoms related to bipolar disorder. The PKC signaling pathway is a target for the actions of two structurally dissimilar antimanic agents – lithium and valproate. Endoxifen exhibits 4-fold higher potency in inhibiting PKC activity compared to tamoxifen in preclinical studies and is not dependent on the isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) for action on the target tissues. === Pharmacokinetics === Orally administered endoxifen is rapidly absorbed and systemically available. The time to peak (Tmax) is between 4.5 and 6 hours after oral administration. It is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The half-life (t½) life of endoxifen is 52.1 to 58.1 hours. == Research == Endoxifen has been investigated as a potential drug in the treatment of breast cancer. == References == == External links == Endoxifen - AdisInsight",Z-endoxifen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00023541064001619816), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011071676388382912)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5648176/?utm_source=openai), [investors.atossatherapeutics.com](https://investors.atossatherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/atossa-therapeutics-inc-receives-authorization-fda-initiate-its?utm_source=openai), [newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/science-saturday-z-endoxifen-emerges-as-potential-breast-cancer-treatment/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=467, start_index=9, title='First-in-Human Phase I Study of the Tamoxifen Metabolite Z-Endoxifen in Women With Endocrine-Refractory Metastatic Breast Cancer - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5648176/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=467, start_index=9, title='Atossa Therapeutics, Inc.

2377,"('Mebrofenin', 'Sq 26962', 'Choletec', '(3-bromo-2,4,6-trimethylphenylcarbamoyl)methyliminodiacetic acid', 'Mebrofenine')",Medical,"Technetium (99mTc) mebrofenin is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical used for imaging of the liver and the gallbladder. Under the brand name Choletec it is available from Bracco Diagnostic. Supplied as a sterile kit of mebrofenin and dehydrated stannous fluoride. The vial is reconstituted with 1 to 5 mL up to 3.7 gigabecquerels (100 mCi) of sodium pertechnetate solution to form the final radio labeled 99mTc mebrofenin. Upon intravenous administration, 99mTc mebrofenin bound to plasma proteins is cleared from systemic circulation in approximately 5 minutes by hepatocytes, while maximal liver uptake occurs within 11 minutes. Mechanism of mebrofenin entering the gallbladder is thought to occur with a mechanism similar to bilirubin clearance. Normal adult patient (70 kg) dose with normal serum bilirubin levels of less than 1.5 mg/dL is 2 to 5 mCi. Increased serum bilirubin increases renal clearance, decreases hepatic uptake and increases visualization time, thus a higher dose of 3 to 10 mCi is recommended. Doses higher than 10 mCi are seldom used. Obese patients require increased dose of 2 to 3 mCi compared with the normal adult patient dose to obtain proper visualization. == Structure == Mebrofenin is a chelate composed of two molecules of a lidocaine analogue, attached to a technetium-99m ion. All of the hepatobiliary visualization agents previous to mebrofenin have the same structural composition with changes only of the substituants on the phenyl ring of the lidocaine analogue molecules. Mebrofenin's fast hepatic excretion (t½=17 minutes) and high hepatic uptake (98.1%) can be attributed to the 3-bromo-2,4,6-trimethylphenyl moiety. To be a good hepatobiliary imaging agent, the chemical structure of mebrofenin has to meet certain requirements: an organic ion with molecular weight between 300 and 1000 at least two aromatic rings in the molecule ability to bind to albumin In normal individuals, uptake of 99mTc mebrofenin by hepatocytes is 100%. Decreased liver uptake is indicative of hepatocyte disease. Once in the hepatocytes, 99mTc mebrofenin is secreted into the canaliculi and finally excreted by the bile ducts. == Use == === Liver === The two useful parameters gathered from hepatic uptake of 99mTc mebrofenin, to aid in determining severity of liver disease, is the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) and excretion half-life. HEF is calculated by initial hepatocyte uptake divided by peak vascular uptake. HEF is 100% in normal individuals, in most patients remains close to 100% with partial common bile duct obstruction and in patients with sclerosing cholangitis, but is severely decreased in patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis. Excretion half-life directly correlates with the degree of liver abnormality and can be a predictor of cirrhotic stage. === Gallbladder === Gallbladder visualization happens once all 99mTc mebrofenin has cleared the liver and enters the gall bladder, the common bile duct and finally the small intestines. Patients fasting for the normal requirement of 4 hours and have normal gallbladder function, the gallbladder is usually visualized within 60 minutes. If the gallbladder is not visualized in 60 minutes, the study can continue for up to 4 hours. To shorten the study, morphine sulfate (MS) can be injected into the patient to increase uptake of 99mTc mebrofenin into the gallbladder. If after 30 minutes of MS administration, the gallbladder is still not visualized, acute cholecystitis can be assumed with greater than 93% specificity. To aid gall bladder emptying, a synthetic cholecystokinin (trade name Kinavec) can be administered. Situations when gall bladder emptying is indicated: If a patient is suspected to have acute cholecystitis. Acute cholecystitis requires full visualization of the gall bladder, its associated duct work and the surrounding areas. Because a full gallbladder concentrates radioactive tracers, emptying the gallbladder will increase the probability of correctly identifying the cause of the problem. If gall bladder ejection fraction (GBEF) is to be obtained because patient is suspected to have chronic cholecystitis without gall stones. Decreased GBEF may be indicative of asymptomatic cholelithiasis, which is usually without gallbladder pain. Only pain during gallbladder contraction/emptying and low GBEF can be associated with chronic cholecystitis. == Precautions == False positives can be due to administration of MS or meperidine prior to the study, patient in sepsis or if fasting requirements are ignored. The substance is excreted into the human milk. The prepared kit must be used within 18 hours of addition of 99mTc. == References ==",Mebrofenin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00013374387344811112), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011065899394452572)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/technetium-tc-99m-mebrofenin-intravenous-route/description/drg-20122624?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=163, start_index=9, title='Technetium tc 99m mebrofenin (intravenous route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/technetium-tc-99m-mebrofenin-intravenous-route/description/drg-20122624?utm_source=openai')])"

In a technical sense, it is a naphthyridone, not a quinolone: its ring structure is a 1,8-naphthyridine nucleus that contains two nitrogen atoms, unlike quinoline, which has a single nitrogen atom. Synthetic quinolone antibiotics were discovered by George Lesher and coworkers as a byproduct of chloroquine manufacture in the 1960s; nalidixic acid itself was used clinically, starting in 1967. Nalidixic acid is effective primarily against Gram-negative bacteria, with minor anti-Gram-positive activity. In lower concentrations, it acts in a bacteriostatic manner; that is, it inhibits growth and reproduction. In higher concentrations, it is bactericidal, meaning that it kills bacteria instead of merely inhibiting their growth. It has historically been used for treating urinary tract infections, caused, for example, by Escherichia coli, Proteus, Shigella, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella. It is no longer clinically used for this indication in the US as less toxic and more effective agents are available. The marketing authorization for nalidixic acid has been suspended throughout the EU. It is also a tool in studies as a regulation of bacterial division. It selectively and reversibly blocks DNA replication in susceptible bacteria. Nalidixic acid and related antibiotics inhibit a subunit of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and induce formation of cleavage complexes. It also inhibits the nicking-closing activity on the subunit of DNA gyrase that releases the positive binding stress on the supercoiled DNA. == Adverse effects == Hives, rash, intense itching, or fainting soon after a dose may be a sign of anaphylaxis. Common adverse effects include rash, itchy skin, blurred or double vision, halos around lights, changes in color vision, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Nalidixic acid may also cause convulsions and hyperglycemia, photosensitivity reactions, and sometimes hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. Particularly in infants and young children, has been reported occasionally increased intracranial pressure. == Overdose == In case of overdose the patient experiences headache, visual disturbances, balance disorders, mental confusion, metabolic acidosis and seizures. == Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and resistance == Aeromonas hydrophila, Clostridium and Haemophilus are generally susceptible to nalidixic acid, while other bacteria such as Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus are resistant.
