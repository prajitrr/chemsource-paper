1488,"('Pramipexole', 'Sifrol', 'Mirapexin', 'Pramipexol', '(s)-n6-propyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[d]thiazole-2,6-diamine')",Medical,"Pramipexole, sold under the brand Mirapex among others, is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome. In Parkinson's disease it may be used alone or together with levodopa. It is taken by mouth. Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist of the non-ergoline class. Pramipexole was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997 and was first manufactured by Pharmacia and Upjohn. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 193rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Pramipexole is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome. Safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown. A 2008 meta-analysis found that pramipexole was more effective than ropinirole in the treatment of restless legs syndrome. It is occasionally prescribed off-label for depression. Its effectiveness as an antidepressant may be a product of its strong partial agonistic activity on and preferential occupation of dopamine D3 receptors at low doses (see table below); as well, the drug has been shown to desensitize the inhibitory D2 autoreceptors but not the postsynaptic D2 receptors, leading to an increase in dopamine and serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex. Chronic administration of pramipexole may also result in desensitization of D3 autoreceptors, leading to reduced dopamine transporter function. Trials have shown mixed results for depression. Pramipexole has also been used as a treatment for REM sleep behaviour disorder, but it is not licensed for use in this disorder. Observational studies suggest it may reduce the frequency and intensity of REM sleep behavior disorder symptoms, but randomized controlled trials have not been performed, so the evidence for its role in this disorder is weak. == Side effects == Common side effects of pramipexole include: Headache Peripheral edema Hyperalgesia (body aches and pains) Nausea and vomiting Sedation and somnolence Decreased appetite and subsequent weight loss Orthostatic hypotension (resulting in dizziness, lightheadedness, and possibly fainting, especially when standing up) Insomnia Hallucinations (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or feeling things that are not there), amnesia and confusion Twitching, twisting, or other unusual body movements Unusual tiredness or weakness Pramipexole (and related D3-preferring dopamine agonist medications such as ropinirole) can induce ""impulsive-compulsive spectrum disorders"" such as compulsive gambling, punding, hypersexuality, and overeating, even in people without any prior history of these behaviors. There have also been reported detrimental side effects related to impulse-control disorders resulting from off-label use of Pramipexole or other dopamine agonists in treating clinical depression. The incidence and severity of impulse-control disorders for those taking the drug for depression are not fully understood because the drug has not been approved for the treatment of depression and the first major studies of its efficacy in treating anhedonic depression were conducted in 2022. There have been anecdotal reports of abrupt and severe personality changes related to impulsivity and loss of self-control in a minority of patients regardless of the condition being treated, although the incidence of these side effects is not yet fully known. Augmentation: Especially when used to treat restless legs syndrome, long-term pramipexole treatment may exhibit drug augmentation, which is ""an iatrogenic worsening of [restless legs syndrome] symptoms following treatment with dopaminergic agents"" and may include an earlier onset of symptoms during the day or a generalized increase in symptoms. == Pharmacology == The activity profile of Pramipexole at various sites has been characterized as follows: While Pramipexole is used clinically (see below), its D3-preferring receptor binding profile has made it a popular tool compound for preclinical research. For example, pramipexole has been used (in combination with D2- and or D3-preferring antagonists) to discover the role of D3 receptor function in rodent models and tasks for neuropsychiatric disorders. Of note, it appears that pramipexole, in addition to having effects on dopamine D3 receptors, may also affect mitochondrial function via a mechanism that remains less understood. A pharmacological approach to separate dopaminergic from non-dopaminergic (e.g. mitochondrial) effects of pramipexole has been to study the effects of the R-stereoisomer of pramipexole (which has much lower affinity to the dopamine receptors when compared to the S-isomer) side by side with the effects of the S-isomer. This property can be characterised using dopaminergic activity equivalent (a relative measure comparing doses of different doses of stereoisomers in mg). Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease affecting the substantia nigra, a component of the basal ganglia. The substantia nigra has a high quantity of dopaminergic neurons, which are nerve cells that release the neurotransmitter known as dopamine. When dopamine is released, it may activate dopamine receptors in the striatum, which is another component of the basal ganglia. When neurons of the substantia nigra deteriorate in Parkinson's disease, the striatum no longer properly receives dopamine signals. As a result, the basal ganglia can no longer regulate body movement effectively and motor function becomes impaired. By acting as an agonist for the D2, D3, and D4 dopamine receptors, pramipexole may directly stimulate the underfunctioning dopamine receptors in the striatum, thereby restoring the dopamine signals needed for proper functioning of the basal ganglia. Pramipexole can increase growth hormone indirectly through its inhibition of somatostatin. Pramipexole has also been shown to be protective against dopaminergic-related methamphetamine neurotoxicity. Immediate-release pramipexole displays a Tmax of approximately 2 hours and 3 hours if taken with a high-fat meal. Extended-release pramipexole displays a Tmax of ~6 hours and ~8 hours if taken with food. The AUC of Pramipexole remains unaltered regardless of food presence. Steady-state is achieved within 3 days and 5 days for the IR and ER formulation respectively. Pramipexole is eliminated via the renal organic cation transporter as an unchanged drug showing no signs of any metabolism. Pramipexole has been shown to inhibit CYP2D6 with a Ki of 30μM which is significantly higher than the maximum approved dosage of 4.5mg/day thus any enzyme-mediated drug interactions are not clinically relevant. It comes in strengths of 0.125mg, 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, and 1.5mg instant release; the extended-release comes in 0.375mg, 0.75mg, 1.5mg, 2.25mg, 3mg, 3.75mg, and 4.5mg. The instant release is meant to be dosed three times daily for Parkinson's and once two hours before bedtime for restless leg syndrome. The extended-release is not approved for restless leg syndrome. It is not metabolized, with >90% of the dose excreted unchanged via SCL22A2/OCT2. Therefore, inhibitors of the renal organic cation transporter system (e.g., cimetidine ) will increase the area under the curve ∞ {\displaystyle \infty } by 50% and increase the t1/2 by 40%. == Synthesis == 4-Acetamidocyclohexanone (1) is reacted with bromine, yielding 2-bromo-4-acetamidocyclohexanone (2). Then, 2 reacts with thiourea, giving compound 3. Through reaction with HBr, amide is converted into a primary amine (compound 4), which then reacts with diethyl mesoxalate and tetrahydroborane, yielding pramipexole (5). == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names include Mirapex, Mirapex ER, Mirapexin, Sifrol, Pexola, Pipexus, Glepark, Oprymea, Astepen, Calmolan, Erimexol, Ezaprev, Frodix, Galipeks, Labrixile, Mariprax, Medopexol, Mepimer, Minergi, Miparkan, Miraper, Miviren, Nulipar, Pacto, Panarak, Parim, Parixol, Parkipex, Parkyn, Parmital, Parpex, Pexa XR, Peximyr, Pexopar, Pisa, Portiv, Pradose, Pramigen, Pramipexin, Pramirol, Pramithon, Pranow, Prapex, Quera LP, Rampiex, Ramixole, Rapexole, Ritmorest, Axalanz, Biopsol, Derinik, Elderpat, Intaxel, Mirapapkin, Mirapezol, Movial, Muvend, Nervius, Neurosomat, Newmirex, Noxopran, Nulipar, Oxpola, Parmital, Periamid, Pralexan, Pramexol, Pramifer, Pramiola, Pramip, Pramitrem, Primizol, Ramipex, Rapexole, Simipex, Simpral, Stabil, Treminel, Trimexol, X-Tremble. == Research == === Further Parkinson's disease symptoms treatment === Parkinson's disease, apart from motor symptoms, is associated with chronic pain, which is mediated through three different mechanisms: nociception, neuropathy and nociplasty. In animal models, it was shown that pramipexole alleviates allodynia and hyperalgesia caused by excessive glial cell (astrocytes, microglia) activation in the spinal cord, which is the causative effect of Parkinson's disease-relatet nociceptive pain. Pramipexole appears to exert this effect through its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-18). and NF-κB. === Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury === Pramipexole in combination with levodopa was shown to alleviate neurological repercussions, improve neuron morphology and their survival after cerebral ischemia-related reperfusion injury through ferroptosis inhibition (via Nrf2/GPX4/SLC7A11 pathway) or by mitochondrial membrane potential stabilization. === Traumatic brain injury === After traumatic brain injury, neurons can undergo necroptosis via necrosome formation and RIPK1 pathway. Pramipexole was shown to act as a neuroprotective agent by inducing hypothermia. === Psychiatry === Pramipexole has been evaluated for the treatment of sexual dysfunction experienced by some users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. It has shown effects on pilot studies in a placebo-controlled proof of concept study in bipolar disorder. It is also being investigated for the treatment of clinical depression, including neuroinflammatory subtypes via NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. === Other indications === Pramipexole is under clinical trials for the treatment of fibromyalgia, essential tremor, primary orthostatic tremor ('shaky leg syndrome'), persistent genital arousal disorder. == Derivatives == Derivatives of Pramipexole include CJ-998, CJ-1037, CJ-1638, CJ-1639, D-264, D-440, and D-512. == Explanatory notes == == References ==",Pramipexol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.22540732769994e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002686616498976946)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a697029.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Pramipexole: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a697029.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1489,"('Deflazacort', 'Azacort', 'Calcort', 'Oxazacort', 'Flantadin')",Medical,"Deflazacort (trade name Calcort among others) is a glucocorticoid belonging to acetonides or O-isopropylidene derivative. It is used as an anti-inflammatory and was patented in 1969 and approved for medical use in 1985. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. == Medical uses == The manufacturer lists the following uses for deflazacort: In the United States, deflazacort is approved for the treatment of duchenne muscular dystrophy in people over the age of two. == Adverse effects == Deflazacort carries the risks common to all corticosteroids, including immune suppression, decreased bone density, steroid induced muscle atrophy, myopathy and endocrine insufficiency. In clinical trials, the most common side effects (>10% above placebo) were Cushing's-like appearance, weight gain, and increased appetite. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Deflazacort is an inactive prodrug which is metabolized rapidly to the active drug 21-desacetyldeflazacort. === Relative potency === Deflazacort's potency is around 70–90% that of prednisone. A 2017 review found its activity of 7.5 mg of deflazacort is approximately equivalent to 25 mg cortisone, 20 mg hydrocortisone, 5 mg of prednisolone or prednisone, 4 mg of methylprednisolone or triamcinolone, or 0.75 mg of betamethasone or dexamethasone. The review noted that the drug has a high therapeutic index, being used at initial oral doses ranging from 6 to 90 mg, and probably requires a 50% higher dose to induce the same demineralizing effect as prednisolone. Thus it has ""a smaller impact on calcium metabolism than any other synthetic corticosteroid, and therefore shows a lower risk of growth rate retardation in children and of osteoporosis"" in the elderly, and comparatively small effects on carbohydrate metabolism, sodium retention, and hypokalemia. == History == Deflazacort was first introduced in 1969 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, nephritic syndrome, SLE, transplantation, polymyalgia rheumatica, sarcoidosis and juvenile chronic arthritis. In January 2015, the FDA granted fast track status to Marathon Pharmaceuticals to pursue approval of deflazacort as a potential treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare, ""progressive and fatal disease"" that affects boys. Although deflazacort was approved by the FDA for use in treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy on February 9, 2017, Marathon CEO announced on February 13, 2017, that the launch of deflazacort (Emflaza) would be delayed amidst controversy over the steep price Marathon was asking for the drug in the United States - $89,000 per year, which is ""roughly 70 times"" more than it would cost overseas. Because deflazacort is an older drug which has been long-approved in some other countries, it is now available in many places as an inexpensive generic. For example, in Canada deflazacort can be purchased for around $1 per tablet. Deflazacort is sold in the United States under the brand name Emflaza after PTC Therapeutics, Inc. acquired all rights to Emflaza on March 16, 2017. Deflazacort is sold in the United Kingdom under the trade name Calcort; in Brazil as Cortax, Decortil, Defcort and Deflanil; in India as Moaid, Zenflav, Defolet, DFZ, Decotaz, and DefZot; in Bangladesh as Xalcort; in Panama as Zamen; Spain as Zamene; and in Honduras as Flezacor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved deflazacort to treat people age five years and older with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. Emflaza is a corticosteroid that works by decreasing inflammation and reducing the activity of the immune system. NDA 208684 was approved on February 9, 2017, as a Type 1- new molecular entity with orphan status. == References == == External links == ""Deflazacort"". Drug Information Portal.

1490,"('Solifenacin', 'Vesicare', '[(3r)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-yl] (1s)-1-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-1h-isoquinoline-2-carboxylate', 'Ym 905', 'Soliten')",Medical,"Solifenacin, sold as the brand name Vesicare among others, is a medicine used to treat overactive bladder and neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO). It may help with incontinence, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency. Benefits appear similar to other medications in the class. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, and urinary tract infection. Severe side effects may include urinary retention, QT prolongation, hallucinations, glaucoma, and anaphylaxis. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy. It is of the antimuscarinic class and works by decreasing bladder contractions. Solifenacin was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. In 2022, it was the 210th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical use == It is used to treat overactive bladder. It may help with incontinence, urinary frequency, and urinary urgency. Benefits appear similar to other antimuscarinics such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, and darifenacin. It is also used to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), a form of bladder dysfunction related to neurological impairment, in children ages two years and older. NDO is a dysfunction of the bladder that results from disease or injury in the nervous system. NDO may be related to congenital conditions (often-inherited conditions beginning at or before birth), such as spina bifida (myelomeningocele), or other conditions such as spinal cord injury. With NDO, there is overactivity of the bladder wall muscle, which normally relaxes to allow storage of urine. The bladder wall muscle overactivity results in sporadic bladder muscle contraction, which increases pressure in the bladder and decreases the volume of urine the bladder can hold. If NDO is not treated, increased pressure in the bladder can put the upper urinary tract at risk of harm, including possible permanent damage to the kidneys. In addition, spontaneous bladder muscle contractions can lead to unexpected and frequent leakage of urine with symptoms of urinary urgency (immediate urge to urinate), frequency (urinating more often than normal) and incontinence (loss of bladder control). == Contraindications == Solifenacin is contraindicated for people with urinary retention, gastric retention, uncontrolled or poorly controlled closed-angle glaucoma, severe liver disease (Child-Pugh class C), and hemodialysis. Long QT syndrome is not a contraindication although solifenacin, like tolterodine and darifenacin, binds to hERG channels of the heart and may prolong the QT interval. This mechanism appears to be seldom clinically relevant. Solifenacin is not to be used in people with gastric retention (reduced emptying of the stomach), uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma (fluid buildup in the eye which raises eye pressure) or hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to solifenacin or any of its components. Solifenacin is also not recommended for use in people with severe liver failure, clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction in the absence of clean intermittent catheterization, decreased gastrointestinal motility (slowed intestinal contractions), or at high risk of QT prolongation (an electrical disturbance where the heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats), including people with a known history of QT prolongation and people taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. == Side effects == The most common side effects of solifenacin are dry mouth, constipation and urinary tract infection. As all anticholinergics, solifenacin may rarely cause hyperthermia due to decreased perspiration. Somnolence (sleepiness or drowsiness) has been reported. Severe allergic reactions, such as angioedema (swelling beneath the skin) and anaphylaxis, have been reported in people treated with solifenacin succinate and may be life-threatening. == Interactions == Solifenacin is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. When administered concomitantly with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, the metabolism of solifenacin is impaired, leading to an increase in its concentration in the body and a reduction in its excretion. As stated above, solifenacin may also prolong the QT interval. Therefore, administering it concomitantly with drugs which also have this effect, such as moxifloxacin or pimozide, can theoretically increase the risk of arrhythmia. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Solifenacin is a competitive cholinergic receptor antagonist, selective for the M3 receptor subtype. However, it is said to also act as an antagonist of the other four muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The binding of acetylcholine to these receptors, particularly M3, plays a critical role in the contraction of smooth muscle. By preventing the binding of acetylcholine to these receptors, solifenacin reduces smooth muscle tone in the bladder, allowing the bladder to retain larger volumes of urine and reducing the number of micturition, urgency and incontinence episodes. Because of a long elimination half life, a once-a-day dose can offer 24-hour control of the urinary bladder smooth muscle tone. === Pharmacokinetics === Peak plasma concentrations are reached three to eight hours after absorption from the gut. In the bloodstream, 98% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins, mainly acidic ones. Metabolism is mediated by the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and possibly others. There is one known active metabolite, 4R-hydroxysolifenacin, and three inactive ones, the N-glucuronide, the N-oxide and the 4R-hydroxy-N-oxide. The elimination half-life is 45 to 68 hours. 69% of the substance, both in its original form and as metabolites, are excreted renally and 23% via the feces. == Chemistry == Like other anticholinergics, solifenacin is an ester of a carboxylic acid containing (at least) an aromatic ring with an alcohol containing a nitrogen atom. While in the prototype anticholinergic atropine the bicyclic ring is tropane, solifenacin replaces it with quinuclidine. The free base is a yellow oil, while the salt solifenacin succinate forms yellowish crystals. == History == The compound was studied using animal models by the Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan. It was known as YM905 when under study in the early 2000s. Solifenacin was approved for medical used in the United States in 2004 with an indication to treat overactive bladder in adults 18 years and older. In May 2020, solifenacin was approved for medical use in the United States with an indication to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), a form of bladder dysfunction related to neurological impairment, in children ages two years and older. The efficacy of solifenacin to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) was established in two clinical trials with a total of 95 pediatric NDO participants, ages two to 17 years old. The studies were designed to measure (as a primary efficacy endpoint) the maximum amount of urine the bladder could hold after 24 weeks of treatment. In the first study, 17 participants ages two to less than five years old were able to hold an average of 39 mL more urine than when the study began. In the second study, 49 participants ages five to 17 years were able to hold an average of 57 mL more urine than when the study began. Reductions in spontaneous bladder contractions, bladder pressure and number of incontinence episodes were also observed in both studies. The approval of Vesicare LS was granted to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. == Society and culture == The international nonproprietary name (INN) is solifenacin. It is manufactured and marketed by Astellas, GlaxoSmithKline and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. === Cost === A 2006 cost-effectiveness study found that 5 mg solifenacin had the lowest cost and highest effectiveness among anticholinergic drugs used to treat overactive bladder in the United States, with an average medical cost per successfully treated patient of $6863 per year. By 2019, with the introduction of generics, the retail cost of a month's supply was down to $20 in the US. == Footnotes == == References ==",Vesicare,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.702239938429557e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.606540359323844e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/vesicare.html ', [])"
1491,"('Methotrexate', 'Amethopterin', 'Rheumatrex', 'Abitrexate', 'Trexall')",Medical,"Methotrexate, formerly known as amethopterin, is a chemotherapy agent and immune-system suppressant. It is used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and ectopic pregnancies. Types of cancers it is used for include breast cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, gestational trophoblastic disease, and osteosarcoma. Types of autoimmune diseases it is used for include psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease. It can be given by mouth or by injection. Common side effects include nausea, feeling tired, fever, increased risk of infection, low white blood cell counts, and breakdown of the skin inside the mouth. Other side effects may include liver disease, lung disease, lymphoma, and severe skin rashes. People on long-term treatment should be regularly checked for side effects. It is not safe during breastfeeding. In those with kidney problems, lower doses may be needed. It acts by blocking the body's use of folic acid. Methotrexate was first made in 1947 and initially was used to treat cancer, as it was less toxic than the then-current treatments. In 1956 it provided the first cures of a metastatic cancer. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Methotrexate is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 132nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Chemotherapy === Methotrexate was originally developed and continues to be used for chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with other agents. It is effective for the treatment of several cancers, including solid tumours of breast, head and neck, lung, bladder, as well as acute lymphocytic leukemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and choriocarcinoma and other trophoblastic neoplasms. It is also used in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). === Autoimmune disorders === Although originally designed as a chemotherapy drug, in lower doses methotrexate is a generally safe and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. Methotrexate is used as a disease-modifying treatment for several autoimmune diseases in adults, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis, myositis, systemic sclerosis, lupus, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, and many forms of vasculitis. In children, it can be used for juvenile dermatomyositis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, uveitis and localised scleroderma. Methotrexate is one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Weekly doses of 5 to 25mg were found by a Cochrane review to be beneficial for 12–52 weeks duration of therapy, though it is used longer-term in clinical practice. Discontinuation rates are as high as 16% due to adverse effects. Use of low doses of methotrexate together with NSAIDs such as aspirin or analgesics such as paracetamol is relatively safe in people being treated for rheumatoid arthritis, with appropriate monitoring. Methotrexate is also sometimes used in combination with other conventional DMARDs, such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. Studies and reviews have found that most rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate for up to one year had less pain, functioned better, had fewer swollen and tender joints, and had less disease activity overall as reported by themselves and their doctors. X-rays also showed that the progress of the disease slowed or stopped in many people receiving methotrexate, with the progression being completely halted in about 30% of those receiving the drug. Those individuals with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate have been found to have a lower risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctions and strokes. Results of a systematic review exploring the comparative effectiveness of treatments of early rheumatoid arthritis show that treatment efficacy can be improved with combination therapy with anti-TNF or other biologic medications, compared with methotrexate monotherapy. Likewise, a 2016 study found the use of methotrexate, in combination with anti-TNF agents, is effective for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Methotrexate has also been used for multiple sclerosis and is used occasionally in systemic lupus erythematosus, with tentative evidence to support such use. === Atopic dermatitis === Along with other immunosuppressants, methotrexate is used to treat severe atopic dermatitis (eczema). === During pregnancy === Methotrexate is an abortifacient and is used to treat ectopic pregnancies, provided the fallopian tube has not ruptured. Methotrexate with dilation and curettage is used to treat molar pregnancy. Rarely, it is used in combination with misoprostol to abort intrauterine pregnancies. === Administration === Methotrexate can be given by mouth or by injection (intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intrathecal). Doses are usually taken weekly, not daily, to limit toxicity. Routine monitoring of the complete blood count, liver function tests, and creatinine are recommended. Measurements of creatinine are recommended at least every two months. Folic acid is commonly co-prescribed with methotrexate to minimise the risk of adverse effects. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, stomatitis, blood abnormalities (leukopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia), increased risk of infection, hair loss, nausea, reduced appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, acute pneumonitis and renal impairment. Methotrexate can also cause mucositis. Methotrexate pneumonitis is a rare complication of therapy and appears to be reducing in frequency in most recent rheumatoid arthritis treatment trials. In the context of rheumatoid arthritis interstitial lung disease, methotrexate treatment may be associated with a lower incidence of ILD over time. Methotrexate is teratogenic and it is advised to stop taking it at least 4 weeks before becoming pregnant and it should be avoided during pregnancy (pregnancy category X) and while breastfeeding. Guidelines have been updated to state that it is safe for a male partner to take at any point while trying to conceive. Central nervous system reactions to methotrexate have been reported, especially when given via the intrathecal route (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid), which include myelopathies and leukoencephalopathies. It has a variety of cutaneous side effects, particularly when administered in high doses. Another little-understood but serious possible adverse effect of methotrexate is neurological damage and memory loss. Neurotoxicity may result from the drug crossing the blood–brain barrier and damaging neurons in the cerebral cortex. People with cancer who receive the medication often nickname these effects ""chemo brain"" or ""chemo fog"". === Drug interactions === Penicillins may decrease the elimination of methotrexate and increase the risk of methotrexate toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides neomycin and paromomycin have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like cyclosporins may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene. === Vaccine interactions === Taking methotrexate can reduce the effectiveness of vaccinations against various diseases, such as influenza and hepatitis A. It does this by blunting the immune response of the body to the vaccine. Methotrexate also dampens the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines, making them less effective. Pausing methotrexate for two weeks following COVID-19 vaccination may result in improved immunity. Not taking the medicine for two weeks might result in a minor increase of inflammatory disease flares in some people. == Mechanism of action == Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the antifolate type. It is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of dihydrofolate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydrofolate is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for de-novo purine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins. For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibition of DHFR is not thought to be the main mechanism, but rather multiple mechanisms appear to be involved, including the inhibition of enzymes involved in purine metabolism, leading to accumulation of adenosine; inhibition of T cell activation and suppression of intercellular adhesion molecule expression by T cells; selective down-regulation of B cells; increasing CD95 sensitivity of activated T cells; and inhibition of methyltransferase activity, leading to deactivation of enzyme activity relevant to immune system function. Another mechanism of MTX is the inhibition of the binding of interleukin 1-beta to its cell surface receptor. Thereby, it acts as anticytokine. == History == In 1947, a team of researchers led by Sidney Farber showed aminopterin, a chemical analogue of folic acid developed by Yellapragada Subbarao of Lederle, could induce remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The development of folic acid analogues had been prompted by the discovery that the administration of folic acid worsened leukaemia, and that a diet deficient in folic acid could, conversely, produce improvement; the mechanism of action behind these effects was still unknown at the time. Other analogues of folic acid were in development, and by 1950, methotrexate (then known as amethopterin) was being proposed as a treatment for leukemia. Animal studies published in 1956 showed the therapeutic index of methotrexate was better than that of aminopterin, and clinical use of aminopterin was thus abandoned in favor of methotrexate. In 1951, Jane C. Wright demonstrated the use of methotrexate in solid tumors, showing remission in breast cancer. Wright's group was the first to demonstrate use of the drug in solid tumors, as opposed to leukemias, which are a cancer of the marrow. Min Chiu Li and his collaborators then demonstrated complete remission in women with choriocarcinoma and chorioadenoma in 1956, and in 1960 Wright et al. produced remissions in mycosis fungoides. == References == == External links == Methotrexate Injection MedlinePlus article from NIH",Trexall,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004017737810499966), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002043304033577442)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; www.drugs.com/pro/trexall.html, www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/trexall, www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-20913/trexall-oral/details ', [])"
1492,"('Mannitol', 'Mannite', 'Osmitrol', 'Manna sugar', 'Osmofundin')","Food, Medical","Mannitol is a type of sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and medication. It is used as a low calorie sweetener as it is poorly absorbed by the intestines. As a medication, it is used to decrease pressure in the eyes, as in glaucoma, and to lower increased intracranial pressure. Medically, it is given by injection or inhalation. Effects typically begin within 15 minutes and last up to 8 hours. Common side effects from medical use include electrolyte problems and dehydration. Other serious side effects may include worsening heart failure and kidney problems. It is unclear if use is safe in pregnancy. Mannitol is in the osmotic diuretic family of medications and works by pulling fluid from the brain and eyes. The discovery of mannitol is attributed to Joseph Louis Proust in 1806. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from the flowering ash and called manna due to its supposed resemblance to the Biblical food. Mannitol is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substances list due to concerns that it may mask prohibited drugs. == Uses == === Medical uses === In the United States, mannitol is indicated for the reduction of intracranial pressure and treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intraocular pressure. In the European Union, mannitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy to best standard of care. Mannitol is used intravenously to reduce acutely raised intracranial pressure until more definitive treatment can be applied, e.g., after head trauma. While mannitol injection is the mainstay for treating high pressure in the skull after a bad brain injury, it is no better than hypertonic saline as a first-line treatment. In treatment-resistant cases, hypertonic saline works better. Intra-arterial infusions of mannitol can transiently open the blood–brain barrier by disrupting tight junctions. It may also be used for certain cases of kidney failure with low urine output, decreasing pressure in the eye, to increase the elimination of certain toxins, and to treat fluid build up. Intraoperative mannitol prior to vessel clamp release during renal transplant has been shown to reduce post-transplant kidney injury, but has not been shown to reduce graft rejection. Mannitol acts as an osmotic laxative in oral doses larger than 20 g, and is sometimes sold as a laxative for children. The use of mannitol, when inhaled, as a bronchial irritant as an alternative method of diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma has been proposed. A 2013 systematic review concluded evidence to support its use for this purpose at this time is insufficient. Mannitol is commonly used in the circuit prime of a heart lung machine during cardiopulmonary bypass. The presence of mannitol preserves renal function during the times of low blood flow and pressure, while the patient is on bypass. The solution prevents the swelling of endothelial cells in the kidney, which may have otherwise reduced blood flow to this area and resulted in cell damage. Mannitol can also be used to temporarily encapsulate a sharp object (such as a helix on a lead for an artificial pacemaker) while it passes through the venous system. Because the mannitol dissolves readily in blood, the sharp point becomes exposed at its destination. Mannitol is also the first drug of choice to treat acute glaucoma in veterinary medicine. It is administered as a 20% solution intravenously. It dehydrates the vitreous humor and, therefore, lowers the intraocular pressure. However, it requires an intact blood-ocular barrier to work. === Food === Mannitol increases blood glucose to a lesser extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets. === Analytical chemistry === Mannitol can be used to form a complex with boric acid. This increases the acid strength of the boric acid, permitting better precision in volumetric analysis of this acid. === Other === Mannitol is the primary ingredient of mannitol salt agar, a bacterial growth medium, and is used in others. Mannitol is used as a cutting agent in various drugs that are used intranasally (snorted), such as heroin and cocaine. A mixture of mannitol and fentanyl (or fentanyl analogs) in ratio 1:10 is labeled and sold as ""China white"", a popular heroin substitute. Mannitol is a sugar alcohol with ""50-70 percent of the relative sweetness of sugar, which means more must be used to equal the sweetness of sugar. Mannitol lingers in the intestines for a long time and therefore often causes bloating and diarrhea."" == Contraindications == Mannitol is contraindicated in people with anuria, severe hypovolemia, pre-existing severe pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and active intracranial bleeding except during craniotomy. Adverse effects include hyponatremia and volume depletion leading to metabolic acidosis. == Chemistry == Mannitol is an isomer of sorbitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses. == Production == Mannitol is classified as a sugar alcohol; that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by reduction. Other sugar alcohols include xylitol and sorbitol. === Industrial synthesis === Mannitol is commonly produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, the transformation of starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields. === Biosyntheses === Mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Fermentation by microorganisms is an alternative to the traditional industrial synthesis. A fructose to mannitol metabolic pathway, known as the mannitol cycle in fungi, has been discovered in a type of red algae (Caloglossa leprieurii), and it is highly possible that other microorganisms employ similar such pathways. A class of lactic acid bacteria, labeled heterofermentive because of their multiple fermentation pathways, convert either three fructose molecules or two fructose and one glucose molecule into two mannitol molecules, and one molecule each of lactic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. Feedstock syrups containing medium to large concentrations of fructose (for example, cashew apple juice, containing 55% fructose: 45% glucose) can produce yields 200 g (7.1 oz) mannitol per liter of feedstock. Further research is being conducted, studying ways to engineer even more efficient mannitol pathways in lactic acid bacteria, as well as the use of other microorganisms such as yeast and E. coli in mannitol production. When food-grade strains of any of the aforementioned microorganisms are used, the mannitol and the organism itself are directly applicable to food products, avoiding the need for careful separation of microorganism and mannitol crystals. Although this is a promising method, steps are needed to scale it up to industrially needed quantities. === Natural extraction === Since mannitol is found in a wide variety of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the Soxhlet extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction – 141.7 g (5.00 oz) CO2 versus 194.4 g (6.86 oz) ethanol per 1 g (0.035 oz) olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only 4.01 g (0.141 oz) water per 1 g (0.035 oz) of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique. == History == In the early 1880s, Julije Domac elucidated the structure of hexene and mannitol obtained from Caspian manna. He determined the place of the double bond in hexene obtained from mannitol and proved that it is a derivative of a normal hexene. This also solved the structure of mannitol, which was unknown until then. == Controversy == The three studies that originally found high-dose mannitol effective in treating severe head injury were the subject of an investigation. Published in 2007 after the lead author Dr Julio Cruz's death, the investigation questioned whether the studies had actually taken place. The co-authors of the paper were not able to confirm the existence of the study patients, and the Federal University of São Paulo, which Cruz gave as his affiliation, had never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz's work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only four studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a conclusion about the clinical use of mannitol has not been reached. == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia Japanese Pharmacopoeia United States Pharmacopeia == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Mannitol at Wikimedia Commons",Manna sugar,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.018179794773459435), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.00024251631111837924), (',', -0.12703613936901093), (' INDUSTR', -0.020566998049616814), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.12722913920879364), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -7.986990567587782e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.00044919890933670104), (',', -0.5759817957878113), ('ĠINDU', -0.042518019676208496), ('ST', -5.829164365422912e-05), ('RI', -1.7762025890988298e-05), ('AL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03814366087317467)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.011047814972698689)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1493,"('Sorbitol', 'Glucitol', 'Gulitol', 'Glucarine', 'Diakarmon')","Food, Medical","Sorbitol (), less commonly known as glucitol (), is a sugar alcohol with a sweet taste which the human body metabolizes slowly. It can be obtained by reduction of glucose, which changes the converted aldehyde group (−CHO) to a primary alcohol group (−CH2OH). Most sorbitol is made from potato starch, but it is also found in nature, for example in apples, pears, peaches, and prunes. It is converted to fructose by sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenase. Sorbitol is an isomer of mannitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses. As an over-the-counter drug, sorbitol is used as a laxative to treat constipation. == Synthesis == Sorbitol may be synthesised via a glucose reduction reaction in which the converted aldehyde group is converted into a hydroxyl group. The reaction requires NADH and is catalyzed by aldose reductase. Glucose reduction is the first step of the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism, and is implicated in multiple diabetic complications. C6H12O6 + NADH + H+ → C6H14O6 + NAD+ The mechanism involves a tyrosine residue in the active site of aldehyde reductase. The hydrogen atom on NADH is transferred to the electrophilic aldehyde carbon atom; electrons on the aldehyde carbon-oxygen double bond are transferred to the oxygen that abstracts the proton on tyrosine side chain to form the hydroxyl group. The role of aldehyde reductase tyrosine phenol group is to serve as a general acid to provide proton to the reduced aldehyde oxygen on glucose. Glucose reduction is not the major glucose metabolism pathway in a normal human body, where the glucose level is in the normal range. However, in diabetic patients whose blood glucose level is high, up to 1/3 of their glucose could go through the glucose reduction pathway. This will consume NADH and eventually leads to cell damage. == Uses == === Sweetener === Sorbitol is a sugar substitute, and when used in food it has the INS number and E number 420. Sorbitol is about 60% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar). Sorbitol is referred to as a nutritive sweetener because it provides some dietary energy. It is partly absorbed from the small intestine and metabolized in the body, and partly fermented in the large intestine. The fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, which are mostly absorbed and provide energy, but also carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen which do not provide energy. Even though the heat of combustion of sorbitol is higher than that of glucose (having two extra hydrogen atoms), the net energy contribution is between 2.5 and 3.4 kilocalories per gram, versus the approximately 4 kilocalories (17 kilojoules) for carbohydrates. It is often used in diet foods (including diet drinks and ice cream), mints, cough syrups, and sugar-free chewing gum. Most bacteria cannot use sorbitol for energy, but it can be slowly fermented in the mouth by Streptococcus mutans, a bacterium that causes tooth decay. In contrast, many other sugar alcohols such as isomalt and xylitol are considered non-acidogenic. It also occurs naturally in many stone fruits and berries from trees of the genus Sorbus. === Medical applications === ==== Laxative ==== As is the case with other sugar alcohols, foods containing sorbitol can cause gastrointestinal distress. Sorbitol can be used as a laxative when taken orally or as an enema. Sorbitol works as a laxative by drawing water into the large intestine, stimulating bowel movements. Sorbitol has been determined safe for use by the elderly, although it is not recommended without the advice of a physician. Sorbitol is commonly used orally as a one-time dose of 30–150 millilitres (1.1–5.3 imp fl oz; 1.0–5.1 US fl oz) 70% solution. It may also be used as a one-time rectal enema. ==== Other medical applications ==== Sorbitol is used in bacterial culture media to distinguish the pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 from most other strains of E. coli, because it is usually unable to ferment sorbitol, unlike 93% of known E. coli strains. A treatment for hyperkalaemia (elevated blood potassium) uses sorbitol and the ion-exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (tradename Kayexalate). The resin exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions in the bowel, while sorbitol helps to eliminate it. In 2010, the U.S. FDA issued a warning of increased risk for gastrointestinal necrosis with this combination. Sorbitol is also used in the manufacture of softgel capsules to store single doses of liquid medicines. === Health care, food, and cosmetic uses === Sorbitol often is used in modern cosmetics as a humectant and thickener. It is also used in mouthwash and toothpaste. Some transparent gels can be made only with sorbitol, because of its high refractive index. Sorbitol is used as a cryoprotectant additive (mixed with sucrose and sodium polyphosphates) in the manufacture of surimi, a processed fish paste. It is also used as a humectant in some cigarettes. Beyond its use as a sugar substitute in reduced-sugar foods, sorbitol is also used as a humectant in cookies and low-moisture foods like peanut butter and fruit preserves. In baking, it is also valuable because it acts as a plasticizer, and slows down the staling process. === Miscellaneous uses === A mixture of sorbitol and potassium nitrate has found some success as an amateur solid rocket fuel. It has similar performance to sucrose-based rocket candy, but is easier to cast, less hygroscopic and does not caramelize. Sorbitol is identified as a potential key chemical intermediate for production of fuels from biomass resources. Carbohydrate fractions in biomass such as cellulose undergo sequential hydrolysis and hydrogenation in the presence of metal catalysts to produce sorbitol. Complete reduction of sorbitol opens the way to alkanes, such as hexane, which can be used as a biofuel. Hydrogen required for this reaction can be produced by aqueous phase catalytic reforming of sorbitol. 19 C6H14O6 → 13 C6H14 + 36 CO2 + 42 H2O The above chemical reaction is exothermic, and 1.5 moles of sorbitol generate approximately 1 mole of hexane. When hydrogen is co-fed, no carbon dioxide is produced. Sorbitol based polyols are used in the production of polyurethane foam for the construction industry. It is also added after electroporation of yeasts in transformation protocols, allowing the cells to recover by raising the osmolarity of the medium. == Medical importance == Aldose reductase is the first enzyme in the sorbitol-aldose reductase pathway responsible for the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, as well as the reduction of galactose to galactitol. Too much sorbitol trapped in retinal cells, the cells of the lens, and the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves, is a frequent result of long-term hyperglycemia that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. This can damage these cells, leading to retinopathy, cataracts and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Sorbitol is fermented in the colon and produces short-chain fatty acids, which are beneficial to overall colon health. == Potential adverse effects == Sorbitol may cause allergic reactions in some people. Common side effects from use as a laxative are stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhea or rectal bleeding. == Compendial status == Food Chemicals Codex European Pharmacopoeia 6.1 British Pharmacopoeia 2009 Japanese Pharmacopoeia 17 == See also == Sorbitan Isosorbide == References == == External links == Media related to Sorbitol at Wikimedia Commons",Glucitol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.09520546346902847), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.20407794415950775), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -0.00017970333283301443), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.0006266565760597587), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.002476604888215661), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.0015036711702123284), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.5934097170829773), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00014554394874721766), ('ĠMED', -0.04215636104345322), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.003181041684001684), ('ĠPERSON', -0.029832571744918823), ('AL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.7762025890988298e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31329232454299927)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0005530327325686812), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The electrode potential of N-acetyl-3-nitro-l-tyrosine ethyl ester is higher, while because of mesomeric stabilization of the radical, those of N-acetyl-2,3-difluoro-l-tyrosine methyl ester and N-acetyl-2,3,5-trifluoro-l-tyrosine methyl ester are lower than that of tyrosine. Given that the electrode potentials at pH 7 of E°'(Trp(•),H(+)/TrpH) and E°'(TyrO(•),H(+)/TyrOH) are nearly equal, they would be, in principle, interchangeable. Proton-coupled electron transfer pathways in proteins that use TrpH and TyrOH are thus nearly thermoneutral.","Tyrosine, 3-nitro-",PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -4.842555426876061e-06)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00423487089574337), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0010513499146327376)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -8.506661833962426e-05)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31914343/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2242503/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23777924/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4359869/ ', [])"

It was introduced in Japan by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma in 2001 for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute cases of bipolar mania. == Medical uses == Its primary uses are in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. === Schizophrenia === In a clinical trial that compared it to haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia it was found to produce significantly superior overall symptom control. In another clinical trial perospirone was compared with mosapramine and produced a similar reduction in total PANSS score, except with respect to the blunted affect part of the PANSS negative score, in which perospirone produced a significantly greater improvement. In an open-label clinical trial comparing aripiprazole with perospirone there was no significant difference between the two treatments discovered in terms of both efficacy and tolerability. In 2009 a clinical trial found that perospirone produced a similar reduction of PANSS score than risperidone and the extrapyramidal side effects was similar in both frequency and severity between groups. A meta-analysis published in 2013 found that it is statistically significantly less efficacious than other second-generation antipsychotics. == Adverse effects == Has a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than the other atypical antipsychotics, but still less than that seen with typical antipsychotics. A trend was observed in a clinical trial comparing mosapramine with perospirone that favoured perospirone for producing less prominent extrapyramidal side effects than mosapramine although statistical significant was not reached. It may produce less QT interval prolongation than zotepine, as in one patient who had previously been on zotepine switching to perospirone corrected their prolonged QT interval. It also tended to produce less severe extrapyramidal side effects than haloperidol in a clinical trial comparing the two (although statistical significance was not reached). === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a felling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Pharmacology == Perospirone binds to the following receptors with very high affinity (as an antagonist unless otherwise specified): 5-HT1A (partial agonist; Ki = 2.9 nM) 5-HT2A (inverse agonist; Ki = 1.3 nM) D2 (Ki = 0.6 nM) And the following receptor with high affinity: H1 (inverse agonist) And the following with moderate affinity: D4 α1 adrenoceptor And with low affinity for the following receptor: D1 == See also == Azapirone Blonanserin — another second-generation antipsychotic that's only approved for clinical use in East Asia Mosapramine Zotepine == References ==",Lullan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0011976935202255845), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007389436941593885)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perospirone,https://www.pharmacodia.com/yaodu/html/v1/chemicals/65ded5353c5ee48d0b7d48c591b8f430.html,https://synapse.inc/medicine/5419/ ', [])"

Like all such substances, rhein is a cathartic, which is commonly found as a glycoside such as rhein-8-glucoside or glucorhein. Rhein was first isolated in 1895. It is found in rhubarb species like Rheum undulatum and Rheum palmatum as well as in Cassia reticulata. Originally the rhubarb plant which contains rhein was used as a laxative. It was believed that rhein along with other anthraquinone glycosides imparted this activity. Rhein has been reevaluated as an antibacterial agent against Staphylococcus aureus in 2008. Synergy or partial synergy has been demonstrated between rhein and the antibiotics oxacillin and ampicillin. Rhein has been shown to inhibit the fat mass and obesity-associated protein, an enzyme responsible for removing the methylation from N6-methyladenosine in nucleic acids. The pharmacokinetics of rhein have not been intensively studied in humans, but at least one study in healthy male volunteers found that rhein was better absorbed from oral administration of rhubarb than from a retention enema.

1499,"('Valinomycin', 'Potassium ionophore i', 'Valino', 'Valinomicin', 'Cyclo[-d-o-val-d-val-l-o-ala-l-val]3')",Medical,"Valinomycin is a naturally occurring dodecadepsipeptide used in the transport of potassium and as an antibiotic. Valinomycin is obtained from the cells of several Streptomyces species, S. fulvissimus being a notable one. It is a member of the group of natural neutral ionophores because it does not have a residual charge. It consists of enantiomers D- and L-valine (Val), D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid, and L-lactic acid. Structures are alternately bound via amide and ester bridges. Valinomycin is highly selective for potassium ions over sodium ions within the cell membrane. It functions as a potassium-specific transporter and facilitates the movement of potassium ions through lipid membranes ""down"" the electrochemical potential gradient. The stability constant K for the potassium-valinomycin complex is nearly 100,000 times larger than that of the sodium-valinomycin complex. This difference is important for maintaining the selectivity of valinomycin for the transport of potassium ions (and not sodium ions) in biological systems. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities. == Structure == Valinomycin is a dodecadepsipeptide, that is, it is made of twelve alternating amino acids and esters to form a macrocyclic molecule. The twelve carbonyl groups are essential for the binding of metal ions, and also for solvation in polar solvents. The isopropyl and methyl groups are responsible for solvation in nonpolar solvents. Along with its shape and size this molecular duality is the main reason for its binding properties. K ions must give up their water of hydration to pass through the pore. K+ ions are octahedrally coordinated in a square bipyramidal geometry by 6 carbonyl bonds from Val. In this space of 1.33 Angstrom, Na+ with its 0.95 Angstrom radius, is significantly smaller than the channel, meaning that Na+ cannot form ionic bonds with the amino acids of the pore at equivalent energy as those it gives up with the water molecules. This leads to a 10,000x selectivity for K+ ions over Na+. For polar solvents, valinomycin will mainly expose the carbonyls to the solvent and in nonpolar solvents the isopropyl groups are located predominantly on the exterior of the molecule. This conformation changes when valinomycin is bound to a potassium ion. The molecule is ""locked"" into a conformation with the isopropyl groups on the exterior [Citation Needed]. It is not actually locked into configuration because the size of the molecule makes it highly flexible, but the potassium ion gives some degree of coordination to the macromolecule. == Applications == Valinomycin was recently reported to be the most potent agent against severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in infected Vero E6 cells. Valinomycin has been shown to inhibit completely vaccinia virus in cell based assay in human cell line. Valinomycin acts as a nonmetallic isoforming agent in potassium selective electrodes. This ionophore is used to study membrane vesicles, where it may be selectively applied by experimental design to reduce or eliminate the electrochemical gradient across a membrane. == References == == External links == Chemical Safety Regulations from New Jersey Department of Health.

1501,"('Sulfanilamide', 'Sulphanilamide', 'Sulfamine', 'P-aminobenzenesulfonamide', 'Sulphonamide')",Medical,"In organic chemistry, the sulfonamide functional group (also spelled sulphonamide) is an organosulfur group with the structure R−S(=O)2−NR2. It consists of a sulfonyl group (O=S=O) connected to an amine group (−NH2). Relatively speaking this group is unreactive. Because of the rigidity of the functional group, sulfonamides are typically crystalline; for this reason, the formation of a sulfonamide is a classic method to convert an amine into a crystalline derivative which can be identified by its melting point. Many important drugs contain the sulfonamide group. A sulfonamide (compound) is a chemical compound that contains this group. The general formula is R−SO2NR'R"" or R−S(=O)2−NR'R"", where each R is some organic group; for example, ""methanesulfonamide"" (where R = methane, R' = R"" = hydrogen) is CH3SO2NH2. Any sulfonamide can be considered as derived from a sulfonic acid by replacing a hydroxyl group (−OH) with an amine group. In medicine, the term ""sulfonamide"" is sometimes used as a synonym for sulfa drug, a derivative or variation of sulfanilamide. The first sulfonamide was discovered in Germany in 1932. == Synthesis and reactions == Sulfonamides can be prepared in the laboratory in many ways. The classic approach entails the reaction of sulfonyl chlorides with an amine. RSO2Cl + R'2NH → RSO2NR'2 + HCl A base such as pyridine is typically added to absorb the HCl that is generated. Illustrative is the synthesis of sulfonylmethylamide. The reaction of primary and secondary amines with benzenesulfonyl chloride is the basis of the Hinsberg reaction, a method for detecting primary and secondary amines. Sulfonamides undergo a variety of acid-base reactions. The N-H bond can be deprotonated. The alkylsulfonamides can be deprotonated at carbon. Arylsulfonamides undergo ortho-lithiation. == Sultams == Sultams are cyclic sulfonamides. Bioactive sultams include the antiinflammatory ampiroxicam and the anticonvulsant sulthiame. Sultams are prepared analogously to other sulfonamides, allowing for the fact that sulfonic acids are deprotonated by amines. They are often prepared by one-pot oxidation of disulfides or thiols linked to amines. An alternative synthesis of sultams involves initial preparation of a linear sulfonamide, followed by intramolecular C-C bond formation (i.e. cyclization), a strategy that was used in the synthesis of a sultam-based deep-blue emitter for organic electronics. Sulfonamide-based compounds == Sulfinamides == The related sulfinamides (R(S=O)NHR) are amides of sulfinic acids (R(S=O)OH) (see sulfinyl). Chiral sulfinamides such as tert-butanesulfinamide, p-toluenesulfinamide and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfinamide are relevant to asymmetric synthesis. == Disulfonimides == Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)aniline is a source of the triflyl (CF3SO+2) group. The disulfonimides are of the type R−S(=O)2−N(H)−S(=O)2−R' with two sulfonyl groups flanking an amine. As with sulfinamides, this class of compounds is used as catalysts in enantioselective synthesis. == See also == Sulfamic acid Sulfamide == References == == Further reading == Greenwood, David.

It is occasionally found as a constituent of nucleic acids, where it is present in the anticodon of tRNA in the form of its nucleoside inosine. It has a tautomer known as 6-hydroxypurine. Hypoxanthine is a necessary additive in certain cells, bacteria, and parasite cultures as a substrate and nitrogen source. For example, it is commonly a required reagent in malaria parasite cultures, since Plasmodium falciparum requires a source of hypoxanthine for nucleic acid synthesis and energy metabolism. In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting hypoxanthine and related organic molecules, including the DNA and RNA components adenine and guanine, may have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space. The Pheretima aspergillum worm, used in Chinese medicine preparations, contains hypoxanthine. == Reactions == It is one of the products of the action of xanthine oxidase on xanthine. However, more frequently in purine degradation, xanthine is formed from oxidation of hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase converts hypoxanthine into IMP in nucleotide salvage. Hypoxanthine is also a spontaneous deamination product of adenine. Because of its resemblance to guanine, the spontaneous deamination of adenine can lead to an error in DNA transcription/replication, as it base pairs with cytosine.

Herein, the protective effect of hesperidin methylchalcone (HMC) was evaluated through Alzheimer's disease models of Neuro-2a cells and Wistar rats. The in vitro results showed that HMC possesses significant ability to inhibit the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and exhibiting anti-aggregation and disaggregation properties. Furthermore, HMC could protect the Neuro-2a cells against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Simultaneously, HMC treatment significantly improved the cognitive deficits caused by Aβ-peptide on spatial memory in Wistar rats. HMC significantly enhanced the cholinergic effects by inhibiting AChE, BuChE, β-secretase activity, caspase-3 activity, and attenuating macromolecular damages and apoptosis. Notably, HMC reduced the Aβ-induced oxidative stress by activating the antioxidative defence enzymes. In addition, the HMC treatment suppressed the expression of immunocytokines such as p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα, induced by Aβ; whereas upregulating Nrf2, HO-1 in brain homogenate. These results suggest that HMC could attenuate Aβ-induced neuroinflammation in brain via suppressing NF-κB signalling pathway and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, thereby improving memory and cognitive impairments in Wistar rats. Overall, the present study reports that HMC can act as a potent candidate with multi-faceted neuroprotective potential against Aβ-induced memory dysfunction in Wistar rats for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

We have developed a new pegylated squalene (SQ-PEG) derivative with self-assembly properties. Supramolecular assembly with a lipophilic photosensitizer pyropheophorbide-a (Ppa) by nanoprecipitation gave nanoconstructs SQ-PEG:Ppa with an average size of 200 nm in diameter and a drug loading of 18% (w/w). The composite material demonstrates nanoscale optical properties by tight packing of Ppa within Sq-PEG:Ppa resulting in 99.99% fluorescence self-quenching. The biocompatibility of the nanomaterial and cell phototoxicity under light irradiation were investigated on PC3 prostate tumor cells in vitro. SQ-PEG:Ppa showed excellent phototoxic effect at low light dose of 5.0 J/cm To enhance the drug delivery efficiency of hyaluronic acid (HA), we designed and prepared glycodendron and pyropheophorbide-a (Ppa)-functionalized HA (HA-Ppa-Dendron) as a nanosystem for cancer photodynamic therapy. Linear Ppa-modified HA (HA-Ppa) was also prepared as a control. Cellular uptake of both polymers by MDA-MB-231 cells led to mitochondrial dysfunction and generation of reactive oxygen species under the irradiation of a laser. Compared to the linear polymer, HA-Ppa-Dendron had higher molecular weight, a more compact nanoscale particle size, and a dendritic structure, resulting in a much longer blood circulation time and higher tumor accumulation. HA-Ppa-Dendron outperformed HA-Ppa in inhibiting cell growth, with 60 % of tumors was eradicated under laser irradiation. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) up to 99.2 % was achieved from HA-Ppa-Dendron, which was much higher than that of HA-Ppa (50.6 %). Therefore, glycodendron-functionalized HAs by integration of HA and dendritic polymers may act as efficient anti-cancer nanomedicine. To deliver photosensitizers with PEGylated heparin (HP) into tumor cells for photodynamic therapy, we prepared two polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized HP-based polymers conjugated with pyropheophorbide-a (Ppa): a non-GSH-responsive nanoagent (HP-Ppa-mPEG) with the mPEG moiety chemically attached to HP directly; and a GSH-responsive nanoagent (HP-Ppa-SS-mPEG) with the mPEG moiety conjugated to HP via a disulfide linkage.

1505,"('Dacarbazine', 'Imidazole carboxamide', 'Deticene', 'Biocarbazine', 'Biocarbazine r')",Medical,"Dacarbazine, also known as imidazole carboxamide and sold under the brand name DTIC-Dome, is a chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of melanoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. For Hodgkin's lymphoma it is often used together with vinblastine, bleomycin, and doxorubicin. It is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include loss of appetite, vomiting, low white blood cell count, and low platelets. Other serious side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Dacarbazine is in the alkylating agent and purine analog families of medication. Dacarbazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == As of mid-2006, dacarbazine is commonly used as a single agent in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and as part of the ABVD chemotherapy regimen to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma, and in the MAID regimen for sarcoma. Dacarbazine was proven to be just as efficacious as procarbazine, another drug with similar chemistry, in the German trial for paediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma, without the teratogenic effects. Thus COPDAC has replaced the former COPP regime in children for TG2 & 3 following OEPA. == Side effects == Like many chemotherapy drugs, dacarbazine may have numerous serious side effects, because it interferes with normal cell growth as well as cancer cell growth. Among the most serious possible side effects are birth defects to children conceived or carried during treatment; sterility, possibly permanent; or immune suppression (reduced ability to fight infection or disease). Dacarbazine is considered to be highly emetogenic, and most patients will be pre-medicated with dexamethasone and antiemetic drugs like 5-HT3 antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) and/or NK1 receptor antagonist (e.g., aprepitant). Other significant side effects include headache, fatigue and occasionally diarrhea. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare has sent out a black box warning and suggests avoiding dacarbazine due to liver problems. == Mechanism of action == Dacarbazine is activated by liver microsomal enzymes to monomethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (MTIC), which is an alkylating compound. It causes methylation, modification and cross linking of DNA, thus inhibiting DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. == Synthesis == Nitrous acid is added to 5-aminoimidazol-4-carboxamide to make 5-diazoimidazol-4-carboxamide. It reacts with dimethylamine to give dacarbazine. == History == In 1959, dacarbazine was first synthesized at Southern Research in Alabama. The research was funded by a US federal grant. Dacarbazine gained FDA approval in May 1975 as DTIC-Dome. The drug was initially marketed by Bayer. == Society and culture == There are generic versions of dacarbazine available from APP, Bedford, Mayne Pharma (Hospira) and Teva. == References ==",Deticene,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.684815212385729e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005628670332953334)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/deticene?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='DETICENE - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/deticene?utm_source=openai')])"

In particular when encapsulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and niosomes, it is active against human melanoma A-375 cells, although such formulations have a negligible effect on human keratinocyte cells. The aim here was to determine whether these formulations could enhance the topical delivery and skin permeation of artemisone as a prelude to evaluating use of artemisone and related compounds for melanoma treatment. In vitro skin permeation studies were conducted to determine the concentration of artemisone delivered into the stratum corneum-epidermis and epidermis-dermis. Artemisone-SLNs delivered artemisone into the stratum corneum-epidermis at significantly higher concentration (62.632 μg/mL) than the artemisone-niosomes (12.792 μg/mL). Neither of the controls delivered artemisone into the stratum corneum-epidermis. In the epidermis-dermis, artemisone (13.404 μg/mL) was only detected after application of the SLN formulation. Overall, the excellent topical delivery of artemisone with the SLN formulation coupled with the intrinsic activity of formulated artemisone confirms potential for use in treatment of melanoma. We have recently shown that the artemisinin derivative artemisone, which was screened against malaria in human clinical studies, is a potent inhibitor of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Here we evaluated the antiviral effect of artemisone when employed in 2-drug combinations with approved and experimental anti-HCMV agents. Using the Chou-Talalay method, we found that in-vitro combination of artemisone with cidofovir, brincidofovir, or with the HCMV UL97 inhibitor maribavir resulted in antiviral synergism and the combination of artemisone with ganciclovir or with the viral terminase inhibitors letermovir and BDCRB resulted in moderate synergism. Importantly, the combination of artemisone with maribavir demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity ex-vivo, in a clinically-relevant multicellular model of human placental tissues maintained in organ culture. Our findings provide the basis for the use of artemisone in synergistically acting drug combinations, to enhance viral control and reduce antiviral drug toxicities. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major cause of disease in immunocompromised individuals and the most common cause of congenital infection and neurosensorial disease.

1512,"('Sodium butyrate', 'Butanoic acid sodium salt', 'Butyric acid', 'Butanoic acid', 'N-butyric acid')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Butyric acid (; from Ancient Greek: βούτῡρον, meaning ""butter""), also known under the systematic name butanoic acid, is a straight-chain alkyl carboxylic acid with the chemical formula CH3CH2CH2COOH. It is an oily, colorless liquid with an unpleasant odor. Isobutyric acid (2-methylpropanoic acid) is an isomer. Salts and esters of butyric acid are known as butyrates or butanoates. The acid does not occur widely in nature, but its esters are widespread. It is a common industrial chemical and an important component in the mammalian gut. == History == Butyric acid was first observed in an impure form in 1814 by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul. By 1818, he had purified it sufficiently to characterize it. However, Chevreul did not publish his early research on butyric acid; instead, he deposited his findings in manuscript form with the secretary of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, France. Henri Braconnot, another French chemist, was also researching the composition of butter and was publishing his findings and this led to disputes about priority. As early as 1815, Chevreul claimed that he had found the substance responsible for the smell of butter. By 1817, he published some of his findings regarding the properties of butyric acid and named it. However, it was not until 1823 that he presented the properties of butyric acid in detail. The name butyric acid comes from βούτῡρον, meaning ""butter"", the substance in which it was first found. The Latin name butyrum (or buturum) is similar. == Occurrence == Triglycerides of butyric acid make up 3–4% of butter. When butter goes rancid, butyric acid is liberated from the glyceride by hydrolysis. It is one of the fatty acid subgroup called short-chain fatty acids. Butyric acid is a typical carboxylic acid that reacts with bases and affects many metals. It is found in animal fat and plant oils, bovine milk, breast milk, butter, parmesan cheese, body odor, vomit and as a product of anaerobic fermentation (including in the colon). It has a taste somewhat like butter and an unpleasant odor. Mammals with good scent detection abilities, such as dogs, can detect it at 10 parts per billion, whereas humans can detect it only in concentrations above 10 parts per million. In food manufacturing, it is used as a flavoring agent. In humans, butyric acid is one of two primary endogenous agonists of human hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), a Gi/o-coupled G protein-coupled receptor. Butyric acid is present as its octyl ester in parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) and in the seed of the ginkgo tree. == Production == === Industrial === In industry, butyric acid is produced by hydroformylation from propene and syngas, forming butyraldehyde, which is oxidised to the final product. H2 + CO + CH3CH=CH2 → CH3CH2CH2CHOoxidation→butyric acid It can be separated from aqueous solutions by saturation with salts such as calcium chloride. The calcium salt, Ca(C4H7O2)2 · H2O, is less soluble in hot water than in cold. === Microbial biosynthesis === Butyrate is produced by several fermentation processes performed by obligate anaerobic bacteria. This fermentation pathway was discovered by Louis Pasteur in 1861. Examples of butyrate-producing species of bacteria: Clostridium butyricum Clostridium kluyveri Clostridium pasteurianum Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Fusobacterium nucleatum Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens Eubacterium limosum The pathway starts with the glycolytic cleavage of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate, as happens in most organisms. Pyruvate is oxidized into acetyl coenzyme A catalyzed by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and two molecules of hydrogen (H2) are formed as waste products. Subsequently, ATP is produced in the last step of the fermentation. Three molecules of ATP are produced for each glucose molecule, a relatively high yield. The balanced equation for this fermentation is C6H12O6 → C4H8O2 + 2CO2 + 2H2 Other pathways to butyrate include succinate reduction and crotonate disproportionation. Several species form acetone and n-butanol in an alternative pathway, which starts as butyrate fermentation. Some of these species are: Clostridium acetobutylicum, the most prominent acetone and butanol producer, used also in industry Clostridium beijerinckii Clostridium tetanomorphum Clostridium aurantibutyricum These bacteria begin with butyrate fermentation, as described above, but, when the pH drops below 5, they switch into butanol and acetone production to prevent further lowering of the pH. Two molecules of butanol are formed for each molecule of acetone. The change in the pathway occurs after acetoacetyl CoA formation. This intermediate then takes two possible pathways: acetoacetyl CoA → acetoacetate → acetone acetoacetyl CoA → butyryl CoA → butyraldehyde → butanol For commercial purposes Clostridium species are used preferably for butyric acid or butanol production. The most common species used for probiotics is the Clostridium butyricum. === Fermentable fiber sources === Highly-fermentable fiber residues, such as those from resistant starch, oat bran, pectin, and guar are transformed by colonic bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) including butyrate, producing more SCFA than less fermentable fibers such as celluloses. One study found that resistant starch consistently produces more butyrate than other types of dietary fiber. The production of SCFA from fibers in ruminant animals such as cattle is responsible for the butyrate content of milk and butter. Fructans are another source of prebiotic soluble dietary fibers which can be digested to produce butyrate. They are often found in the soluble fibers of foods which are high in sulfur, such as the allium and cruciferous vegetables. Sources of fructans include wheat (although some wheat strains such as spelt contain lower amounts), rye, barley, onion, garlic, Jerusalem and globe artichoke, asparagus, beetroot, chicory, dandelion leaves, leek, radicchio, the white part of spring onion, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, fennel, and prebiotics, such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), oligofructose, and inulin. == Reactions == Butyric acid reacts as a typical carboxylic acid: it can form amide, ester, anhydride, and chloride derivatives. The latter, butyryl chloride, is commonly used as the intermediate to obtain the others. == Uses == Butyric acid is used in the preparation of various butyrate esters. It is used to produce cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), which is used in a wide variety of tools, paints, and coatings, and is more resistant to degradation than cellulose acetate. CAB can degrade with exposure to heat and moisture, releasing butyric acid. Low-molecular-weight esters of butyric acid, such as methyl butyrate, have mostly pleasant aromas or tastes. As a consequence, they are used as food and perfume additives. It is an approved food flavoring in the EU FLAVIS database (number 08.005). Due to its powerful odor, it has also been used as a fishing bait additive. Many of the commercially available flavors used in carp (Cyprinus carpio) baits use butyric acid as their ester base. It is not clear whether fish are attracted by the butyric acid itself or the substances added to it. Butyric acid was one of the few organic acids shown to be palatable for both tench and bitterling. The substance has been used as a stink bomb by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society to disrupt Japanese whaling crews. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Butyric acid (pKa 4.82) is fully ionized at physiological pH, so its anion is the material that is mainly relevant in biological systems. It is one of two primary endogenous agonists of human hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2, also known as GPR109A), a Gi/o-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Like other short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), butyrate is an agonist at the free fatty acid receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3, which function as nutrient sensors that facilitate the homeostatic control of energy balance; however, among the group of SCFAs, only butyrate is an agonist of HCA2. It is also an HDAC inhibitor (specifically, HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8), a drug that inhibits the function of histone deacetylase enzymes, thereby favoring an acetylated state of histones in cells. Histone acetylation loosens the structure of chromatin by reducing the electrostatic attraction between histones and DNA. In general, it is thought that transcription factors will be unable to access regions where histones are tightly associated with DNA (i.e., non-acetylated, e.g., heterochromatin). Therefore, butyric acid is thought to enhance the transcriptional activity at promoters, which are typically silenced or downregulated due to histone deacetylase activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Butyrate that is produced in the colon through microbial fermentation of dietary fiber is primarily absorbed and metabolized by colonocytes and the liver for the generation of ATP during energy metabolism; however, some butyrate is absorbed in the distal colon, which is not connected to the portal vein, thereby allowing for the systemic distribution of butyrate to multiple organ systems through the circulatory system. Butyrate that has reached systemic circulation can readily cross the blood–brain barrier via monocarboxylate transporters (i.e., certain members of the SLC16A group of transporters). Other transporters that mediate the passage of butyrate across lipid membranes include SLC5A8 (SMCT1), SLC27A1 (FATP1), and SLC27A4 (FATP4). === Metabolism === Butyric acid is metabolized by various human XM-ligases (ACSM1, ACSM2B, ASCM3, ACSM4, ACSM5, and ACSM6), also known as butyrate–CoA ligase. The metabolite produced by this reaction is butyryl–CoA, and is produced as follows: Adenosine triphosphate + butyric acid + coenzyme A → adenosine monophosphate + pyrophosphate + butyryl-CoA As a short-chain fatty acid, butyrate is metabolized by mitochondria as an energy (i.e., adenosine triphosphate or ATP) source through fatty acid metabolism. In particular, it is an important energy source for cells lining the mammalian colon (colonocytes). Without butyrates, colon cells undergo autophagy (i.e., self-digestion) and die. In humans, the butyrate precursor tributyrin, which is naturally present in butter, is metabolized by triacylglycerol lipase into dibutyrin and butyrate through the reaction: Tributyrin + H2O → dibutyrin + butyric acid == Biochemistry == Butyrate has numerous effects on energy homeostasis and related diseases (diabetes and obesity), inflammation, and immune function (e.g., it has pronounced antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic effects) in humans. These effects occur through its metabolism by mitochondria to generate ATP during fatty acid metabolism or through one or more of its histone-modifying enzyme targets (i.e., the class I histone deacetylases) and G-protein coupled receptor targets (i.e., FFAR2, FFAR3, and HCA2). === In the mammalian gut === Butyrate is essential to host immune homeostasis. Although the role and importance of butyrate in the gut is not fully understood, many researchers argue that a depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria in patients with several vasculitic conditions is essential to the pathogenesis of these disorders. A depletion of butyrate in the gut is typically caused by an absence or depletion of butyrate-producing-bacteria (BPB). This depletion in BPB leads to microbial dysbiosis. This is characterized by an overall low biodiversity and a depletion of key butyrate-producing members. Butyrate is an essential microbial metabolite with a vital role as a modulator of proper immune function in the host. It has been shown that children lacking in BPB are more susceptible to allergic disease and Type 1 Diabetes. Butyrate is also reduced in a diet low in dietary fiber, which can induce inflammation and have other adverse affects insofar as these short-chain fatty acids activate PPAR-γ. Butyrate exerts a key role for the maintenance of immune homeostasis both locally (in the gut) and systemically (via circulating butyrate). It has been shown to promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells. In particular, circulating butyrate prompts the generation of extrathymic regulatory T cells. The low-levels of butyrate in human subjects could favor reduced regulatory T cell-mediated control, thus promoting a powerful immuno-pathological T-cell response. On the other hand, gut butyrate has been reported to inhibit local pro-inflammatory cytokines. The absence or depletion of these BPB in the gut could therefore be a possible aide in the overly-active inflammatory response. Butyrate in the gut also protects the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Decreased butyrate levels therefore lead to a damaged or dysfunctional intestinal epithelial barrier. Butyrate reduction has also been associated with Clostridioides difficile proliferation. Conversely, a high-fiber diet results in higher butyric acid concentration and inhibition of C. difficile growth. In a 2013 research study conducted by Furusawa et al., microbe-derived butyrate was found to be essential in inducing the differentiation of colonic regulatory T cells in mice. This is of great importance and possibly relevant to the pathogenesis and vasculitis associated with many inflammatory diseases because regulatory T cells have a central role in the suppression of inflammatory and allergic responses. In several research studies, it has been demonstrated that butyrate induced the differentiation of regulatory T cells in vitro and in vivo. The anti-inflammatory capacity of butyrate has been extensively analyzed and supported by many studies. It has been found that microorganism-produced butyrate expedites the production of regulatory T cells, although the specific mechanism by which it does so is unclear. More recently, it has been shown that butyrate plays an essential and direct role in modulating gene expression of cytotoxic T-cells. Butyrate also has an anti-inflammatory effect on neutrophils, reducing their migration to wounds. This effect is mediated via the receptor HCA1. In the gut microbiomes found in the class Mammalia, omnivores and herbivores have butyrate-producing bacterial communities dominated by the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase pathway, whereas carnivores have butyrate-producing bacterial communities dominated by the butyrate kinase pathway. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on ticks as a signal. === Immunomodulation and inflammation === Butyrate's effects on the immune system are mediated through the inhibition of class I histone deacetylases and activation of its G-protein coupled receptor targets: HCA2 (GPR109A), FFAR2 (GPR43), and FFAR3 (GPR41). Among the short-chain fatty acids, butyrate is the most potent promoter of intestinal regulatory T cells in vitro and the only one among the group that is an HCA2 ligand. It has been shown to be a critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response. It possesses both preventive and therapeutic potential to counteract inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. Butyrate has established antimicrobial properties in humans that are mediated through the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, which it induces via HDAC inhibition on histone H3. In vitro, butyrate increases gene expression of FOXP3 (the transcription regulator for Tregs) and promotes colonic regulatory T cells (Tregs) through the inhibition of class I histone deacetylases; through these actions, it increases the expression of interleukin 10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Butyrate also suppresses colonic inflammation by inhibiting the IFN-γ–STAT1 signaling pathways, which is mediated partially through histone deacetylase inhibition. While transient IFN-γ signaling is generally associated with normal host immune response, chronic IFN-γ signaling is often associated with chronic inflammation. It has been shown that butyrate inhibits activity of HDAC1 that is bound to the Fas gene promoter in T cells, resulting in hyperacetylation of the Fas promoter and up-regulation of Fas receptor on the T-cell surface. Similar to other HCA2 agonists studied, butyrate also produces marked anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of tissues, including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and vascular tissue. Butyrate binding at FFAR3 induces neuropeptide Y release and promotes the functional homeostasis of colonic mucosa and the enteric immune system. === Cancer === Butyrate has been shown to be a critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response. It is responsible for about 70% of energy from the colonocytes, being a critical SCFA in colon homeostasis. Butyrate possesses both preventive and therapeutic potential to counteract inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer. It produces different effects in healthy and cancerous cells: this is known as the ""butyrate paradox"". In particular, butyrate inhibits colonic tumor cells and stimulates proliferation of healthy colonic epithelial cells. The explanation why butyrate is an energy source for normal colonocytes and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells, is the Warburg effect in cancer cells, which leads to butyrate not being properly metabolized. This phenomenon leads to the accumulation of butyrate in the nucleus, acting as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. One mechanism underlying butyrate function in suppression of colonic inflammation is inhibition of the IFN-γ/STAT1 signalling pathways. It has been shown that butyrate inhibits activity of HDAC1 that is bound to the Fas gene promoter in T cells, resulting in hyperacetylation of the Fas promoter and upregulation of Fas receptor on the T cell surface. It is thus suggested that butyrate enhances apoptosis of T cells in the colonic tissue and thereby eliminates the source of inflammation (IFN-γ production). Butyrate inhibits angiogenesis by inactivating Sp1 transcription factor activity and downregulating vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression. In summary, the production of volatile fatty acids such as butyrate from fermentable fibers may contribute to the role of dietary fiber in colon cancer. Short-chain fatty acids, which include butyric acid, are produced by beneficial colonic bacteria (probiotics) that feed on, or ferment prebiotics, which are plant products that contain dietary fiber. These short-chain fatty acids benefit the colonocytes by increasing energy production, and may protect against colon cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation. Conversely, some researchers have sought to eliminate butyrate and consider it a potential cancer driver. Studies in mice indicate it drives transformation of MSH2-deficient colon epithelial cells. === Potential treatments from butyrate restoration === Owing to the importance of butyrate as an inflammatory regulator and immune system contributor, butyrate depletions could be a key factor influencing the pathogenesis of many vasculitic conditions. It is thus essential to maintain healthy levels of butyrate in the gut. Fecal microbiota transplants (to restore BPB and symbiosis in the gut) could be effective by replenishing butyrate levels. In this treatment, a healthy individual donates their stool to be transplanted into an individual with dysbiosis. A less-invasive treatment option is the administration of butyrate—as oral supplements or enemas—which has been shown to be very effective in terminating symptoms of inflammation with minimal-to-no side-effects. In a study where patients with ulcerative colitis were treated with butyrate enemas, inflammation decreased significantly, and bleeding ceased completely after butyrate provision. === Addiction === Butyric acid is an HDACTooltip histone deacetylase inhibitor that is selective for class I HDACs in humans. HDACs are histone-modifying enzymes that can cause histone deacetylation and repression of gene expression. HDACs are important regulators of synaptic formation, synaptic plasticity, and long-term memory formation. Class I HDACs are known to be involved in mediating the development of an addiction. Butyric acid and other HDAC inhibitors have been used in preclinical research to assess the transcriptional, neural, and behavioral effects of HDAC inhibition in animals addicted to drugs. == Butyrate salts and esters == The butyrate or butanoate ion, C3H7COO−, is the conjugate base of butyric acid. It is the form found in biological systems at physiological pH. A butyric (or butanoic) compound is a carboxylate salt or ester of butyric acid. === Examples === ==== Salts ==== Sodium butyrate ==== Esters ==== Butyl butyrate Butyryl-CoA Cellulose acetate butyrate (aircraft dope) Estradiol benzoate butyrate Ethyl butyrate Methyl butyrate Pentyl butyrate Tributyrin == See also == List of saturated fatty acids Histone Histone-modifying enzyme Histone acetylase Histone deacetylase Hydroxybutyric acids α-Hydroxybutyric acid β-Hydroxybutyric acid γ-Hydroxybutyric acid Oxobutyric acids 2-Oxobutyric acid (α-ketobutyric acid) 3-Oxobutyric acid (acetoacetic acid) 4-Oxobutyric acid (succinic semialdehyde) β-Methylbutyric acid β-Hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid == Notes == == References == This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

1513,"('Choline (bitartrate)', 'Tartaric acid', 'Racemic acid', 'Uvic acid', 'Traubensaure')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Tartaric acid is a white, crystalline organic acid that occurs naturally in many fruits, most notably in grapes but also in tamarinds, bananas, avocados, and citrus. Its salt, potassium bitartrate, commonly known as cream of tartar, develops naturally in the process of fermentation. Potassium bitartrate is commonly mixed with sodium bicarbonate and is sold as baking powder used as a leavening agent in food preparation. The acid itself is added to foods as an antioxidant E334 and to impart its distinctive sour taste. Naturally occurring tartaric acid is a useful raw material in organic synthesis. Tartaric acid, an alpha-hydroxy-carboxylic acid, is diprotic and aldaric in acid characteristics and is a dihydroxyl derivative of succinic acid. == History == Tartaric acid has been known to winemakers for centuries. However, the chemical process for extraction was developed in 1769 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Tartaric acid played an important role in the discovery of chemical chirality. This property of tartaric acid was first observed in 1832 by Jean Baptiste Biot, who observed its ability to rotate polarized light. Louis Pasteur continued this research in 1847 by investigating the shapes of sodium ammonium tartrate crystals, which he found to be chiral. By manually sorting the differently shaped crystals, Pasteur was the first to produce a pure sample of levotartaric acid. == Stereochemistry == Naturally occurring form of the acid is dextro tartaric acid or L-(+)-tartaric acid (obsolete name d-tartaric acid). Because it is available naturally, it is cheaper than its enantiomer and the meso isomer. The dextro and levo prefixes are archaic terms. Modern textbooks refer to the natural form as (2R,3R)-tartaric acid (L-(+)-tartaric acid), and its enantiomer as (2S,3S)-tartaric acid (D-(−)-tartaric acid). The meso diastereomer is referred to as (2R,3S)-tartaric acid or (2S,3R)-tartaric acid. Dextro and levo form monoclinic sphenoidal crystals and orthorhombic crystals. Racemic tartaric acid forms monoclinic and triclinic crystals (space group P1). Anhydrous meso tartaric acid form two anhydrous polymorphs: triclinic and orthorhombic. Monohydrated meso tartaric acid crystallizes as monoclinic and triclinic polymorphys depending on the temperature at which crystallization from aqueous solution occurs. Tartaric acid in Fehling's solution binds to copper(II) ions, preventing the formation of insoluble hydroxide salts. == Production == === L-(+)-Tartaric acid === The L-(+)-tartaric acid isomer of tartaric acid is industrially produced in the largest amounts. It is obtained from lees, a solid byproduct of fermentations. The former byproducts mostly consist of potassium bitartrate (KHC4H4O6). This potassium salt is converted to calcium tartrate (CaC4H4O6) upon treatment with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2): KH(C4H4O6) + Ca(OH)2 → Ca(C4H4O6) + KOH + H2O In practice, higher yields of calcium tartrate are obtained with the addition of calcium sulfate. Calcium tartrate is then converted to tartaric acid by treating the salt with aqueous sulfuric acid: Ca(C4H4O6) + H2SO4 → H2(C4H4O6) + CaSO4 === Racemic tartaric acid === Racemic tartaric acid can be prepared in a multistep reaction from maleic acid. In the first step, the maleic acid is epoxidized by hydrogen peroxide using potassium tungstate as a catalyst. HO2CCH=CHCO2H + H2O2 → HO2C(CHCH)(O)CO2H + H2O In the next step, the epoxide is hydrolyzed. HO2C(CHCH)(O)CO2H + H2O → HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H === meso-Tartaric acid === A mixture of racemic acid and meso-tartaric acid is formed when dextro-Tartaric acid is heated in water at 165 °C for about 2 days. meso-Tartaric acid can also be prepared from dibromosuccinic acid using silver hydroxide: HO2CCHBrCHBrCO2H + 2 AgOH → HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H + 2 AgBr meso-Tartaric acid can be separated from residual racemic acid by crystallization, the racemate being less soluble. == Reactivity == L-(+)-tartaric acid, can participate in several reactions. As shown the reaction scheme below, dihydroxymaleic acid is produced upon treatment of L-(+)-tartaric acid with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a ferrous salt. HO2CCH(OH)CH(OH)CO2H + H2O2 → HO2CC(OH)C(OH)CO2H + 2 H2O Dihydroxymaleic acid can then be oxidized to tartronic acid with nitric acid. == Derivatives == Important derivatives of tartaric acid include: Sodium ammonium tartrate, the first material separated into its enantiomers cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate), used in cooking Rochelle salt (potassium sodium tartrate), which has unusual piezoelectric properties tartar emetic (antimony potassium tartrate), a resolving agent. Diisopropyl tartrate is used as a co-catalyst in asymmetric synthesis. Tartaric acid is a muscle toxin, which works by inhibiting the production of malic acid, and in high doses causes paralysis and death. The median lethal dose (LD50) is about 7.5 grams/kg for a human, 5.3 grams/kg for rabbits, and 4.4 grams/kg for mice. Given this figure, it would take over 500 g (18 oz) to kill a person weighing 70 kg (150 lb) with 50% probability, so it may be safely included in many foods, especially sour-tasting sweets. As a food additive, tartaric acid is used as an antioxidant with E number E334; tartrates are other additives serving as antioxidants or emulsifiers. When cream of tartar is added to water, a suspension results which serves to clean copper coins very well, as the tartrate solution can dissolve the layer of copper(II) oxide present on the surface of the coin. The resulting copper(II)-tartrate complex is easily soluble in water. == Tartaric acid in wine == Tartaric acid may be most immediately recognizable to wine drinkers as the source of ""wine diamonds"", the small potassium bitartrate crystals that sometimes form spontaneously on the cork or bottom of the bottle. These ""tartrates"" are harmless, despite sometimes being mistaken for broken glass, and are prevented in many wines through cold stabilization (which is not always preferred since it can change the wine's profile). The tartrates remaining on the inside of aging barrels were at one time a major industrial source of potassium bitartrate. Tartaric acid plays an important role chemically, lowering the pH of fermenting ""must"" to a level where many undesirable spoilage bacteria cannot live, and acting as a preservative after fermentation. In the mouth, tartaric acid provides some of the tartness in the wine, although citric and malic acids also play a role. == Tartaric acid in fruits == Grapes and tamarinds have the highest levels of tartaric acid concentration. Other fruits with tartaric acid are bananas, avocados, prickly pear fruit, apples, cherries, papayas, peaches, pears, pineapples, strawberries, mangoes and citrus fruits. Trace amounts of tartaric acid have been found in cranberries and other berries. Tartaric acid is also present in the leaves and pods of Pelargonium plants and beans. == Applications == Tartaric acid and its derivatives have a plethora of uses in the field of pharmaceuticals. For example, it has been used in the production of effervescent salts, in combination with citric acid, to improve the taste of oral medications. The potassium antimonyl derivative of the acid known as tartar emetic is included, in small doses, in cough syrup as an expectorant. Tartaric acid also has several applications for industrial use. The acid has been observed to chelate metal ions such as calcium and magnesium. Therefore, the acid has served in the farming and metal industries as a chelating agent for complexing micronutrients in soil fertilizer and for cleaning metal surfaces consisting of aluminium, copper, iron, and alloys of these metals, respectively. == Toxicity in canines == While tartaric acid is well-tolerated by humans and lab animals, an April 2021 letter to the editor of JAVMA hypothesized that the tartaric acid in grapes could be the cause of grape and raisin toxicity in dogs. Other studies have observed tartaric acid toxicity in kidney cells of dogs, but not in human kidney cells. In dogs, the tartaric acid of tamarind causes acute kidney injury, which can often be fatal. A review identified a relationship between grape ingestion and illness, though the specific type or quantity of grapes that cause toxicity remains unclear. Grape ingestion commonly leads to gastrointestinal and/or renal issues, with treatment depending on the symptoms; outcomes can vary. == References == == External links == PDB file for MSE Archived 2018-09-20 at the Wayback Machine",Uvic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.10173694044351578), ('OD', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.008615872822701931), (' INDUSTR', -0.06826990097761154), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.47434043884277344), (' PERSONAL', -0.4305182993412018), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.38708335161209106), (' MED', -0.004701157100498676), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.47938552498817444), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.07921325415372849), ('ĠINDU', -0.01464251521974802), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -3.802703940891661e-05), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2526068091392517)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([enphrases.com](https://www.enphrases.com/term/uvic-acid/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=6, title='uvic acid Meaning, Definition and Example | Enphrases', type='url_citation', url='https://www.enphrases.com/term/uvic-acid/?utm_source=openai')])"

1516,"('Methionine', 'Racemethionine', 'Acimetion', 'Lobamine', 'Banthionine')","Food, Medical","Methionine (symbol Met or M) () is an essential amino acid in humans. As the precursor of other non-essential amino acids such as cysteine and taurine, versatile compounds such as SAM-e, and the important antioxidant glutathione, methionine plays a critical role in the metabolism and health of many species, including humans. Methionine is also involved in angiogenesis and various processes related to DNA transcription, epigenetic expression, and gene regulation. Methionine was first isolated in 1921 by John Howard Mueller. It is encoded by the codon AUG. It was named by Satoru Odake in 1925, as an abbreviation of its structural description 2-amino-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid. == Biochemical details == Methionine (abbreviated as Met or M; encoded by the codon AUG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological pH conditions), an amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form under biological pH conditions) located in α-position with respect to the carboxyl group, and an S-methyl thioether side chain, classifying it as a nonpolar, aliphatic amino acid. In nuclear genes of eukaryotes and in Archaea, methionine is coded for by the start codon, meaning it indicates the start of the coding region and is the first amino acid produced in a nascent polypeptide during mRNA translation. == A proteinogenic amino acid == Cysteine and methionine are the two sulfur-containing proteinogenic amino acids. Excluding the few exceptions where methionine may act as a redox sensor (e.g.,methionine sulfoxide), methionine residues do not have a catalytic role. This is in contrast to cysteine residues, where the thiol group has a catalytic role in many proteins. The thioether within methionine does however have a minor structural role due to the stability effect of S/π interactions between the side chain sulfur atom and aromatic amino acids in one-third of all known protein structures. This lack of a strong role is reflected in experiments where little effect is seen in proteins where methionine is replaced by norleucine, a straight hydrocarbon sidechain amino acid which lacks the thioether. It has been conjectured that norleucine was present in early versions of the genetic code, but methionine intruded into the final version of the genetic code due to the fact it is used in the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e). This situation is not unique and may have occurred with ornithine and arginine. === Encoding === Methionine is one of only two amino acids encoded by a single codon (AUG) in the standard genetic code (tryptophan, encoded by UGG, is the other). In reflection to the evolutionary origin of its codon, the other AUN codons encode isoleucine, which is also a hydrophobic amino acid. In the mitochondrial genome of several organisms, including metazoa and yeast, the codon AUA also encodes for methionine. In the standard genetic code AUA codes for isoleucine and the respective tRNA (ileX in Escherichia coli) uses the unusual base lysidine (bacteria) or agmatidine (archaea) to discriminate against AUG. The methionine codon AUG is also the most common start codon. A ""Start"" codon is message for a ribosome that signals the initiation of protein translation from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a Kozak consensus sequence. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of proteins in eukaryotes and archaea during translation, although it can be removed by post-translational modification. In bacteria, the derivative N-formylmethionine is used as the initial amino acid. == Derivatives == === S-Adenosylmethionine === The methionine-derivative S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a methyl donor. SAM-e is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5′ carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a sulfonium cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as a soft Lewis acid (i.e., donor/electrophile) which allows the S-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen, or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as cobalamin (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM-e to initiate a radical reaction; these are called radical SAM-e enzymes. As a result of the transfer of the methyl group, S-adenosylhomocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine, leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into autoinducer-2, which is excreted as a waste product or quorum signal. == Biosynthesis == As an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, which must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins. In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the aspartate family, along with threonine and lysine (via diaminopimelate, but not via α-aminoadipate). The main backbone is derived from aspartic acid, while the sulfur may come from cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. First, aspartic acid is converted via β-aspartyl semialdehyde into homoserine by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a γ-hydroxyl, hence the homo- series). The intermediate aspartate semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead condensed with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the terminal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants). Homoserine is then activated with a phosphate, succinyl or an acetyl group on the hydroxyl. In plants and possibly in some bacteria, phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis. In most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by metX or metA (not homologues). In enterobacteria and a limited number of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single residue. The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (e.g. lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis). The hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a γ-elimination followed by a variant of a Michael addition. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family, which is a subset of the PLP-dependent fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP (pyridoxal phosphate), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates. If it reacts with cysteine, it produces cystathionine, which is cleaved to yield homocysteine. The enzymes involved are cystathionine-γ-synthase (encoded by metB in bacteria) and cystathionine-β-lyase (metC). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing β or γ reactions to occur. If it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase (formerly known as O-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either metY or metZ in bacteria. If it reacts with methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon. If homocysteine is produced, the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two methionine synthases are known; one is cobalamin (vitamin B12) dependent and one is independent. The pathway using cysteine is called the ""transsulfuration pathway"", while the pathway using hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called ""direct-sulfurylation pathway"". Cysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine (""reverse transsulfurylation route"") or from hydrogen sulfide (""direct sulfurylation route""); the activated serine is generally O-acetylserine (via CysK or CysM in E. coli), but in Aeropyrum pernix and some other archaea O-phosphoserine is used. CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade. === Transsulfurylation pathway === Enzymes involved in the E. coli transsulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis: Aspartokinase Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase Homoserine dehydrogenase Homoserine O-transsuccinylase Cystathionine-γ-synthase Cystathionine-β-lyase Methionine synthase (in mammals, this step is performed by homocysteine methyltransferase or betaine—homocysteine S-methyltransferase.) == Other biochemical pathways == Although mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways: === Catabolism === Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) by (1) methionine adenosyltransferase. SAM-e serves as a methyl donor in many (2) methyltransferase reactions, and is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). (3) Adenosylhomocysteinase cysteine. === Regeneration === Methionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) methionine synthase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. Homocysteine can also be remethylated using glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT). BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase. === Reverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine === Homocysteine can be converted to cysteine. (5) Cystathionine-β-synthase (an enzyme which requires pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6) combines homocysteine and serine to produce cystathionine. Instead of degrading cystathionine via cystathionine-β-lyase, as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to cysteine and α-ketobutyrate via (6) cystathionine-γ-lyase. (7) The enzyme α-ketoacid dehydrogenase converts α-ketobutyrate to propionyl-CoA, which is metabolized to succinyl-CoA in a three-step process (see propionyl-CoA for pathway). === Ethylene synthesis === This amino acid is also used by plants for synthesis of ethylene. The process is known as the Yang cycle or the methionine cycle. == Metabolic diseases == The degradation of methionine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) Homocystinuria Methylmalonic acidemia Propionic acidemia == Chemical synthesis == The industrial synthesis combines acrolein, methanethiol, and cyanide, which affords the hydantoin. Racemic methionine can also be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate by alkylation with chloroethylmethylsulfide (ClCH2CH2SCH3) followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation. Also see Methanol. == Human nutrition == There is inconclusive clinical evidence on methionine supplementation. Dietary restriction of methionine can lead to bone-related disorders. Methionine supplementation may benefit those suffering from copper poisoning. Overconsumption of methionine, the methyl group donor in DNA methylation, is related to cancer growth in a number of studies. === Requirements === The Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For methionine combined with cysteine, for adults 19 years and older, 19 mg/kg body weight/day. This translates to about 1.33 grams per day for a 70 kilogram individual. === Dietary sources === High levels of methionine can be found in eggs, meat, and fish; sesame seeds, Brazil nuts, and some other plant seeds; and cereal grains. Most fruits and vegetables contain very little. Most legumes, though protein dense, are low in methionine. Proteins without adequate methionine are not considered to be complete proteins. For that reason, racemic methionine is sometimes added as an ingredient to pet foods. == Health == Loss of methionine has been linked to senile greying of hair. Its lack leads to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in hair follicles, a reduction in tyrosinase effectiveness, and a gradual loss of hair color. Methionine raises the intracellular concentration of glutathione, thereby promoting antioxidant-mediated cell defense and redox regulation. It also protects cells against dopamine induced nigral cell loss by binding oxidative metabolites. Methionine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cysteine, carnitine, taurine, lecithin, phosphatidylcholine, and other phospholipids. Improper conversion of methionine can lead to atherosclerosis due to accumulation of homocysteine. == Other uses == DL-Methionine is sometimes given as a supplement to dogs; It helps reduce the chances of kidney stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used. Methionine is allowed as a supplement to organic poultry feed under the US certified organic program. Methionine can be used as a nontoxic pesticide option against giant swallowtail caterpillars, which are a serious pest to orange crops. == See also == Allantoin Formylmethionine Methionine oxidation Paracetamol poisoning Photoreactive methionine S-Methylcysteine == References == == External links == Rudra MN, Chowdhury LM (30 September 1950).

As the precursor of other non-essential amino acids such as cysteine and taurine, versatile compounds such as SAM-e, and the important antioxidant glutathione, methionine plays a critical role in the metabolism and health of many species, including humans. Methionine is also involved in angiogenesis and various processes related to DNA transcription, epigenetic expression, and gene regulation. Methionine was first isolated in 1921 by John Howard Mueller. It is encoded by the codon AUG. It was named by Satoru Odake in 1925, as an abbreviation of its structural description 2-amino-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid. == Biochemical details == Methionine (abbreviated as Met or M; encoded by the codon AUG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.

It is a homologue of the amino acid cysteine, differing by an additional methylene bridge (−CH2−). It is biosynthesized from methionine by the removal of its terminal Cε methyl group. In the body, homocysteine can be recycled into methionine or converted into cysteine with the aid of vitamin B6, B9, and B12. High levels of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia) is regarded as a marker of cardiovascular disease, likely working through atherogenesis, which can result in ischemic injury. Therefore, hyperhomocysteinemia is a possible risk factor for coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque blocks blood flow to the coronary arteries, which supply the heart with oxygenated blood. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been correlated with the occurrence of blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes, although it is unclear whether hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for these conditions. Hyperhomocysteinemia has also been associated with early-term spontaneous abortions and with neural tube defects. == Structure == Homocysteine exists at neutral pH values as a zwitterion. == Biosynthesis and biochemical roles == Homocysteine is biosynthesized naturally via a multi-step process. First, methionine receives an adenosine group from ATP, a reaction catalyzed by S-adenosyl-methionine synthetase, to give S-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e). SAM-e then transfers the methyl group to an acceptor molecule, (e.g., norepinephrine as an acceptor during epinephrine synthesis, DNA methyltransferase as an intermediate acceptor in the process of DNA methylation). The adenosine is then hydrolyzed to yield L-homocysteine. L-Homocysteine has two primary fates: conversion via tetrahydrofolate (THF) back into L-methionine or conversion to L-cysteine. === Biosynthesis of cysteine === Mammals biosynthesize the amino acid cysteine via homocysteine. Cystathionine β-synthase catalyses the condensation of homocysteine and serine to give cystathionine. This reaction uses pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor. Cystathionine γ-lyase then converts this double amino acid to cysteine, ammonia, and α-ketobutyrate. Bacteria and plants rely on a different pathway to produce cysteine, relying on O-acetylserine. === Methionine salvage === Homocysteine can be recycled into methionine. This process uses N5-methyl tetrahydrofolate as the methyl donor and cobalamin (vitamin B12)-related enzymes. More detail on these enzymes can be found in the article for methionine synthase. === Other reactions of biochemical significance === Homocysteine can cyclize to give homocysteine thiolactone, a five-membered heterocycle. Because of this ""self-looping"" reaction, homocysteine-containing peptides tend to cleave themselves by reactions generating oxidative stress. Homocysteine also acts as an allosteric antagonist at Dopamine D2 receptors. It has been proposed that both homocysteine and its thiolactone may have played a significant role in the appearance of life on the early Earth. == Homocysteine levels == Homocysteine levels typically are higher in men than women, and increase with age. Common levels in Western populations are 10 to 12 μmol/L, and levels of 20 μmol/L are found in populations with low B-vitamin intakes or in the elderly (e.g., Rotterdam, Framingham). It is decreased with methyl folate trapping, where it is accompanied by decreased methylmalonic acid, increased folate, and a decrease in formiminoglutamic acid. This is the opposite of MTHFR C677T mutations, which result in an increase in homocysteine. The ranges above are provided as examples only; test results always should be interpreted using the range provided by the laboratory that produced the result. == Elevated homocysteine == Abnormally high levels of homocysteine in the serum, above 15 μmol/L, are a medical condition called hyperhomocysteinemia. This has been claimed to be a significant risk factor for the development of a wide range of diseases, in total more than 100 including thrombosis, neuropsychiatric illness, in particular dementia and fractures. It also is found to be associated with microalbuminuria (moderately increased albuminuria), which is a strong indicator of the risk of future cardiovascular disease and renal dysfunction. Vitamin B12 deficiency, even when coupled with high serum folate levels, has been found to increase overall homocysteine concentrations as well. Typically, hyperhomocysteinemia is managed with vitamin B6, vitamin B9, and vitamin B12 supplementation. However, supplementation with these vitamins does not appear to improve cardiovascular disease outcomes. == References == == External links == Homocysteine MS Spectrum Homocysteine at Lab Tests Online Prof. David Spence on homocysteine levels, kidney damage, and cardiovascular disease, The Health Report, Radio National, 24 May 2010",Homocysteine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -4.008129963040119e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.670925358776003e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.0020655503030866385), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.3351351299206726e-05), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12694737315177917)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ', [])"

In some accounts, he was the son of either the Muses Terpsichorus or Calliope. == Mythology == Biston built the city of Bistonia on the shores of Lake Bistonis in Thrace. He also introduced the Thracian practice of tattooing both men and women with eye-like patterns as a magical fetish, in response to an oracle which guaranteed victory against the neighbouring Edonians tribe if so adorned.

Specifically it is used for low sexual desire which occurs before menopause and is not due to medical problems, psychiatric problems, or problems within the relationship. It is given by an injection just under the skin of the thigh or abdomen. Common side effects include nausea, pain at the site of injection, and headache. It may also cause a temporary increase in blood pressure and decrease in heart rate after each dose, and darkening of the gums, face, and breasts. The medication is a peptide and acts by activating the melanocortin receptors. Bremelanotide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2019. It was developed by Palatin Technologies. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Bremelanotide is used for the treatment of generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. Specifically it is only recommended in those who have the condition without an underlying cause, such as medical, psychiatric, or relationship problems. It should be used at least 45 minutes before anticipated sexual activity. Only one dose per 24 hours or no more than eight doses per month is recommended. It should be stopped after eight weeks if there is no improvement in sexual desire and associated distress. == Contraindications == Due to its effects on blood pressure (generally a transient increase in systolic blood pressure by 6 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg), bremelanotide is considered contraindicated in people with uncontrolled high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease. As long as bremelanotide is not used more than once in one day, it is not expected to cause more severe increases in blood pressure. == Side effects == The most frequently encountered side effect of bremelanotide is nausea (40.0%), which may be intolerable to some people. The use of anti-nausea medications (e.g., ondansetron) prior to administration of bremelanotide may help to reduce the nausea. Other side effects may include flushing (20.3%), injection site reactions (13.2%), headache (11.3%), vomiting (4.8%), cough (3.3%), fatigue (3.2%), hot flashes (2.7%), paresthesia (2.6%), dizziness (2.2%), and nasal congestion (2.1%). Discoloration of the skin, specifically hyperpigmentation, may occur—especially if bremelanotide is used more than eight times in one month. The discoloration may not resolve upon stopping use of bremelanotide, and may occur on the face, gums, or breasts. Experiments in animals, even at high doses, failed to find any negative consequence of bremelanotide on fertility. An analysis of clinical trials found that obese women reduced their calorie intake and lost weight. Another drug with a similar mechanism of action (setmelanotide) is approved for weight loss in rare types of obesity. == Interactions == Bremelanotide does not meaningfully interact with alcohol, unlike flibanserin (for which the interaction with alcohol is a major barrier to its use). However, bremelanotide does interact with certain medications that people take by mouth. By slowing gastric motility, bremelanotide is thought to reduce the oral absorption (bioavailability) of certain medications, such as naltrexone and indomethacin. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Bremelanotide is a non-selective agonist of the melanocortin receptors, MC1 through MC5 (with the exception of MC2, the receptor of ACTHTooltip adrenocorticotropic hormone), but acting primarily as an MC3 and MC4 receptor agonist. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of bremelanotide with subcutaneous injection is about 100%. Following a subcutaneous injection of bremelanotide, maximal levels occur after about one hour, with a range of 0.5 to 1.0 hours. The plasma protein binding of bremelanotide is 21%. Bremelanotide is metabolized via hydrolysis of its peptide bonds. The elimination half-life of bremelanotide is 2.7 hours, with a range of 1.9 to 4.0 hours. Bremelanotide is excreted 64.8% in urine and 22.8% in feces. == Chemistry == Bremelanotide is a cyclic heptapeptide lactam analogue of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). It has the amino acid sequence Ac-Nle-cyclo[Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-OH, and is also known as cyclo-Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Lys10]α-MSH-(4-10) (a substitutional name). Bremelanotide is an active metabolite of melanotan II that lacks the C-terminal amide group. Aside from melanotan II and endogenous melanocyte-stimulating hormones like α-MSH, other peptide analogues of the same family as bremelanotide include afamelanotide (NDP-α-MSH), modimelanotide, and setmelanotide. == History == Studies in the early 1960s showed that administration of α-MSH caused sexual arousal in rats, sparking interest in α-MSH. In the 1980s, scientists at University of Arizona began developing α-MSH and analogs as potential sunless tanning agents. They synthesized and tested several analogs, including peptides they subsequently named, melanotan-I and melanotan II. Very early in the process one of the scientists, Mac Hadley, who was conducting experiments on himself with the peptide melanotan II, injected himself with twice the dose he intended and experienced an eight-hour erection, along with nausea and vomiting. To pursue the tanning agent, melanotan-I was licensed by Competitive Technologies, a technology transfer company operating on behalf of University of Arizona, to an Australian startup called Epitan, which changed its name to Clinuvel in 2006. To pursue the sexual dysfunction agent, melanotan II was licensed by Competitive Technologies to Palatin Technologies. Palatin ceased development of melanotan-II in 2000, and synthesized, patented, and began to develop bremelanotide, a likely metabolite of melanotan-II that differs from melanotan-II in that it has a hydroxyl group where melanotan-II has an amide. Competitive Technologies sued Palatin for breach of contract and to try to claim ownership of bremelanotide; the parties settled in 2008, with Palatin retaining rights to bremelanotide, returning rights to melanotan-II to Competitive Technologies, and paying $800,000. In August 2004, Palatin signed an agreement with King Pharmaceuticals to co-develop bremelanotide in the US and jointly license it outside the US; King paid Palatin $20M upfront. Palatin conducted Phase II trials of intranasal bremelanotide in both female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and male erectile dysfunction (ED) but these trials were halted by the FDA in 2007, due to increased blood pressure in clinical trial subjects; Palatin stopped development of the intranasal formulation in 2008. Four trials were conducted in ED, the last being a Phase IIb published in 2008. King terminated the co-development agreement shortly after the FDA halted the trials. The drug was then reformulated to be delivered by injection and trials continued in FSD. A phase II dose-finding trial in FSD in which the drug was administered 45 minutes before sex showed promise at the highest dose and only transient signs of high blood pressure; two Phase III trials were launched at the end of 2014. Palatin launched the Phase III trials with bremelanotide administered via an autoinjector. In 2014, Palatin licensed European rights to bremelanotide to Gedeon Richter Plc. for around $10 million, and Palatin received a milestone payment of around $3 million when it started the Phase III trials in the US. In September 2016, Palatin and Gedeon RIchter terminated that agreement. In November 2016, Palatin announced results of the Phase III trials, and shortly thereafter began seeking a partner to complete development in the US. In January 2017, Palatin and AMAG Pharmaceuticals agreed that AMAG exclusively would complete development and market bremelanotide in North America and the two would work together to license it in other territories; AMAG agreed to pay $60 million upfront, up to $80 million in regulatory milestones, up to $300 million in sales milestones, and tiered royalties ranging from high single digit to low double digit percentages. A New Drug Application of bremelanotide for female sexual dysfunction was accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2018, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date set for 23 March 2019. It was approved for use in the United States in June 2019. == References ==",Bremelanotide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.172316494077677e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00012599628826137632)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a619054.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Bremelanotide Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a619054.html?utm_source=openai')])"

1522,"('Fosfosal', 'Disdolen', 'Salicyl phosphate', 'O-carboxyphenyl phosphate', 'Aydolid')",Medical," Fosfosal is the O-phosphorylated derivative of salicylic acid, with documented clinical use as a prodrug for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We recently discovered that fosfosal itself inhibits the protein-protein interaction domain, the SH2 domain, of the tumor-related transcription factor STAT5b. Here, we demonstrate that fosfosal is selective for STAT5b over its close homologue STAT5a. This selectivity is mediated by the STAT5b residue Arg566, located in the SH2 domain-adjacent linker domain. Our data provide further evidence for the role of the STAT linker domain in determining the activity of small molecules against the SH2 domain. We present a refined binding model for fosfosal and STAT5b, which can serve as the basis for the development of fosfosal-based STAT5b inhibitors. The effect of fosfosal, a non-acetylated salicylic acid derivative, on the content of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in inflammatory exudates induced by s.c. implantation of 0.5% carrageenan soaked sponges in rats has been determined. Fosfosal, which does not inhibit PG synthesis in vitro, is capable of reducing, in a dose-dependent manner, the PGE2 content of the exudates, with a maximum reduction of 50-60% at a total dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. Acetylsalicylic acid was slightly more potent (68% reduction, 2 x 50 mg/kg i.p.). Six hours after fosfosal administration, salicylic acid, the principal metabolite of fosfosal, accumulated in the exudates at concentrations of about 100 micrograms/ml. These concentrations were sufficient to inhibit PG synthetase activity in vitro. Neither fosfosal nor acetylsalicyclic acid affected polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration at doses which significantly reduced the concentrations of PGE2. Indomethacin, used as reference, reduced leukocyte migration by 28 and 45% at a dose of 1 and 10 mg/kg i.p. respectively. The results indicate that fosfosal, in spite of its lack of effect on PG biosynthesis in vitro, exerts an effect on the inflammatory locus in vivo which may account, at least in part, for its anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, our results confirm that the inhibition of PG synthesis and leukocyte migration are mediated by different mechanisms. Fosfosal (2-phosphonoxybenzoic acid) is a new salicylic acid derivative which is used for treating inflammatory disease as well as in analgesic therapy. On the other hand, codeine together with acetylsalicylic acid is widely used in patients who require analgesic treatment for mild to moderate pain. The present study was carried out in ten healthy subjects to assess the pharmacokinetic profiles of single oral doses of fosfosal (1,200 mg) and codeine (30 mg) when administered alone or in combination. Blood samples were drawn on each study day and salicylic acid and codeine plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC and enzyme immunoassay methods, respectively. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated according to standard procedures and the magnitude and rate of bioavailability were tested using a 95% confidence internal approach. Results indicated no statistical differences in any of the kinetic parameters studied except for tmax values which were higher for fosfosal combined with codeine (2 +/- 0.39 h) when compared to fosfosal alone (1.55 +/- 0.35 h). Regarding codeine compared in combination with fosfosal, no significant differences were observed in Cmax and AUC values, while tmax showed a higher value for the combination (1.75 +/- 0.6 vs 0.85 +/- 0.32 h). Although statistical differences in the elimination constant rate and MRT were found between both codeine administrations, these cannot be considered significant in clinical terms.

It is recommended only as an adjuvant with either allopurinol or febuxostat when these medications are not sufficient. It received FDA approval on 22 December 2015. The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union on 18 February 2016. In February 2019, lesinurad was discontinued in the United States by its manufacturer for business reasons, and was subsequently withdrawn in Europe in July 2020. == Medical uses == Lesinurad is used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, such as allopurinol or febuxostat, for treating hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood serum) associated with gout. It is approved only for patients who have not achieved target uric acid levels with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone. == Contraindications == The drug is contraindicated in people with tumour lysis syndrome or Lesch–Nyhan syndrome (juvenile gout), as well as severe impairment of kidney function, including kidney transplant and hemodialysis patients. == Adverse drug reactions == In clinical trials, serum creatinine (an important marker for kidney function) was elevated in 4.3 to 7.8% of patients depending on the dose, as compared to 2.3% under placebo. Manifest kidney problems were less frequent under the standard dose than under placebo: Kidney failure occurred in 2.1% of placebo patients, in 1.2% of patients with the therapeutic standard dose, and in 3.5% of patients with the double dose. For kidney stones, the frequencies were 1.7%, 0.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Other common side effects were influenza (5.1% vs. 2.7% under placebo), headache (5.3% vs. 4.1%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (2.7% vs. 0.8%). Hypersensitivity reactions were rare (<0.1%). == Interactions == The substance is a mild inducer of the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Some drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme have been shown to be slightly less effective when combined with lesinurad, examples including simvastatin and warfarin. It might also be a mild inducer of CYP2B6. On the other hand, lesinurad concentrations in the blood are decreased by drugs that induce CYP2C9 and increased by substances that inhibit this enzyme (such as fluconazole), as well as in people who have genetically determined low CYP2C9 activity. The same may be true of microsomal epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (such as valproic acid). High dose aspirin and related drugs reduce the effectiveness of other anti-gout medications. It is not known conclusively whether this also applies to lesinurad, but low dose aspirin does not negatively affect its activity. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Lesinurad inhibits URAT1, a protein that is responsible for reabsorption of uric acid in the kidneys. This leads to increased uric acid excretion with the urine, and consequently lower blood levels. It also inhibits the protein OAT4, which is associated with hyperuricemia caused by diuretic drugs. === Pharmacokinetics === Lesinurad is quickly and practically completely absorbed from the gut. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after one to four hours. When in the bloodstream, the substance is almost completely (>98%) bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. It is metabolized mainly by the liver enzyme CYP2C9 to various oxidation products, predominantly to a hydroxylated substance called M3 and an epoxide, M3c. The latter is quickly hydrolyzed to the diol M4 by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH). The enzymes CYP1A1, CYP2C19 and CYP3A only play minor roles in its metabolization. Glucuronidation by the enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 has also been detected. Lesinurad is excreted via the urine (63%) and feces (32%), with a biological half-life of about five hours. Of the excreted dose, 30% are unchanged lesinurad, and the rest are metabolites. === Pharmacogenomics === People who are CYP2C9 poor metabolizers are exposed to lesinurad concentrations that are about 1.8-fold higher than those with a normal function of this enzyme. == Chemistry == Lesinurad is a white to off-white powder and is not hygroscopic.

Substances that reduce gastric acid, such as antacids, H2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors, reduce velpatasvir AUC by 20–40%. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The substance blocks NS5A, a protein necessary for hepatitis C virus replication and assembly. === Pharmacokinetics === Velpatasvir reaches highest blood plasma levels three hours after oral intake together with sofosbuvir. Plasma protein binding is over 99.5%. It is slowly metabolised by the liver enzymes CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. While monohydroxylated and demethylated metabolites have been identified in human blood plasma and faeces, over 98% of the circulating substance is velpatasvir itself. 94% are excreted via the faeces, and only 0.4% via the urine. Biological half-life is about 15 hours. == See also == Discovery and development of NS5A inhibitors Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, with more information about the drug combination Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, with more information about the drug combination == References ==",Velpatasvir,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.006777428206988e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00020787939138244838)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/sofosbuvir-velpatasvir.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (Epclusa): Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/sofosbuvir-velpatasvir.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1526,"('Pizotifen', 'Pizotyline', 'Sandomigran', 'Litec', 'Sandomygran')",Medical,"Pizotifen, also known as pizotyline and sold under the brand names Sandomigran and Mosegor among others, is an antimigraine agent of the tricyclic group which is used primarily as a preventative to reduce the frequency of recurrent migraine headaches. == Medical uses == === Migraine headaches === The main medical use for pizotifen is for the prevention of migraine and cluster headache. Pizotifen is one of a range of medications used for this purpose, other options include propranolol, topiramate, valproic acid, cyproheptadine and amitriptyline. While pizotifen is effective in adults, evidence of efficacy in children is limited, and its use is limited by side effects, principally drowsiness and weight gain, and it is usually not the first choice medicine for preventing migraines, instead being used as an alternative when other drugs have failed to be effective. It is not effective in relieving migraine attacks once in progress. === Other uses === Pizotifen has also been reported as highly effective in a severe case of erythromelalgia, a rare neurovascular disease that is sometimes refractory to the other drugs named above. Other applications for which pizotifen may be used include as an antidepressant, or for the treatment of anxiety or social phobia. Animal studies also suggest that pizotyline could be used in the treatment of serotonin syndrome or MDMA overdose in a similar manner to the closely related antihistamine/antiserotonin medication cyproheptadine. Pizotifen might be useful as a hallucinogen antidote or ""trip killer"" in blocking the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin. It might also be useful in the treatment of MDMA overdose. == Contraindications == Caution is required in patients having closed angle glaucoma and in patients with a predisposition to urinary retention as the medication exhibits a relatively small anticholinergic effect. Dose adjustment is required in people who have chronic kidney disease. Liver injury has also been reported. Pizotifen treatment should be discontinued if there is any clinical evidence of liver dysfunction during treatment. Caution is advised in patients having a history of epilepsy. Withdrawal symptoms like depression, tremor, nausea, anxiety, malaise, dizziness, sleep disorder and weight decrease have been reported following abrupt cessation of pizotifen. Pizotifen is contraindicated in patients who suffer from hypersensitivity to any of its components, also Pizotifen is contraindicated in gastric outlet obstruction, pregnancy, angle-closure glaucoma and difficulty urinating. == Adverse effects == Side effects include sedation, dry mouth, drowsiness, increased appetite and weight gain. Occasionally it may cause nausea, headaches, or dizziness. In rare cases, anxiety, aggression and depression may also occur. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Pizotifen is a serotonin antagonist acting mainly at the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. It also has some activity as an antihistamine as well as some anticholinergic activity. The drug binds non-selectivey to many targets, including serotonin, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Pizotifen is able to dose-dependently and fully antagonize the discriminative stimulus effects of the serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent and serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist MDMA in rodent drug discrimination tests. Conversely, the related drug cyproheptadine was only partially effective and clozapine was ineffective. All three of these agents, pizotifen, cyproheptadine, and clozapine act as non-selective monoamine receptor antagonists. Pizotifen also fully blocks the effects of serotonergic psychedelics, including LSD, mescaline, 5-MeO-DMT, and DOM, in drug discrimination tests. == Chemistry == Pizotifen is a tricyclic compound and is specifically a benzocycloheptene. Close analogues of pizotifen include ketotifen and cyproheptadine, among others. == History == Pizotifen was first described in the literature by 1964. == Society and culture == === Names === Pizotifen is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while pizotyline is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. Brand names of pizotifen include Sandomigran, Mosegor, and Litec, among others. === Availability === Pizotifen is available widely throughout the world, including in Europe. == References == == External links == Sandomigran drug data sheet",Sandomigran,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000248401309363544), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000916418619453907)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1527,"('Suramin (sodium salt)', 'Suramin (hexasodium salt)', 'Suramin', 'Naganol', 'Suramine')",Medical,"Suramin is a medication used to treat African sleeping sickness and river blindness. It is the treatment of choice for sleeping sickness without central nervous system involvement. It is given by injection into a vein. Suramin causes a fair number of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, skin tingling, and weakness. Sore palms of the hands and soles of the feet, trouble seeing, fever, and abdominal pain may also occur. Severe side effects may include low blood pressure, decreased level of consciousness, kidney problems, and low blood cell levels. It is unclear if it is safe when breastfeeding. Suramin was made at least as early as 1916. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States it can be acquired from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In regions of the world where the disease is common suramin is provided for free by the World Health Organization (WHO). == Medical uses == Suramin is used for treatment of human sleeping sickness caused by trypanosomes. Specifically, it is used for treatment of first-stage African trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense without involvement of central nervous system. It is considered first-line treatment for Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and second-line treatment for early-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, where pentamidine is recommended as first line. It has been used in the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis). === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === It is unknown whether it is safe for the baby when a woman takes it while breastfeeding. == Adverse reactions == The most frequent adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a feeling of general discomfort. It is also common to experience various sensations in the skin, from crawling or tingling sensations, tenderness of palms and the soles, and numbness of hands, arm, legs or feet. Other skin reactions include skin rash, swelling and stinging sensation. Suramin can also cause loss of appetite and irritability. Suramin causes non-harmful changes in urine during use, specifically making the urine cloudy. It may exacerbate kidney disease. Less common side effects include extreme fatigue, ulcers in the mouth, and painful tender glands in the neck, armpits and groin. Suramin uncommonly affects the eyes causing watery eyes, swelling around the eyes, photophobia, and changes or loss of vision. Rare side effects include hypersensitivity reactions causing difficulty breathing. Other rare systemic effects include decreased blood pressure, fever, rapid heart rate, and convulsions. Other rare side effects include symptoms of liver dysfunction such as tenderness in upper abdomen, jaundice in eyes and skin, unusual bleeding or bruising. Suramin has been applied clinically to HIV/AIDS patients resulting in a significant number of fatal occurrences and as a result the application of this molecule was abandoned for this condition. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === Suramin is not orally bioavailable and must be given intravenously. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administration could result in local tissue inflammation or necrosis . Suramin is approximately 99-98% protein bound in the serum and has a half-life of 41–78 days average of 50 days; however, the pharmacokinetics of suramin can vary substantially between individual patients. Suramin does not distribute well into cerebral spinal fluid and its concentration in the tissues is equivalently lower than its concentration in the plasma. Suramin is not extensively metabolized and about 80% is eliminated via the kidneys. === Mechanism of action === The mechanism of action for suramin is unclear, but it is thought that parasites are able to selectively uptake suramin via receptor-mediated endocytosis of drug that is bound to low-density lipoproteins and, to a lesser extent, other serum proteins. Once inside parasites, suramin combines with proteins, especially trypanosomal glycolytic enzymes, to inhibit energy metabolism. == Chemistry == The molecular formula of suramin is C51H40N6O23S6. It is a symmetric molecule in the center of which lies a urea (NH–CO–NH) functional group. Suramin contains six aromatic systems – four benzene rings, sandwiched by a pair of naphthalene moieties – plus four amide functional groups (in addition to the urea) and six sulfonic acid groups. When given as a medication, it is usually delivered as the sodium sulfonate salt as this formulation is water-soluble, though it does deteriorate rapidly in air. The synthesis of suramin itself and structural analogs is by successive formation of the amide bonds from their corresponding amine (aniline) and carboxyl (as acyl chloride) components. Various routes to these compounds have been developed, including starting from separate naphthalene structures and building towards an eventual unification by formation of the urea or starting with a urea and appending successive groups. == History == Suramin was first made by the chemists Oskar Dressel, Richard Kothe and Bernhard Heymann at Bayer AG laboratories in Elberfeld, after research on a series of urea-like compounds. The drug is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The chemical structure of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial and strategic reasons, but it was elucidated and published in 1924 by Ernest Fourneau and his team at the Pasteur Institute.: 378–379 == Research == It is also used as a research reagent to inhibit the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins in a variety of GPCRs with varying potency. It prevents the association of heteromeric G proteins and therefore the receptors guanine exchange functionality (GEF). With this blockade the GDP will not release from the Gα subunit so it can not be replaced by a GTP and become activated. This has the effect of blocking downstream G protein mediated signaling of various GPCR proteins including rhodopsin, the A1 adenosine receptor, the D2 receptor, the P2 receptor, and ryanodine receptors. Suramin is also an inhibitor of ABC-type and P-type ATPases, which acts competitively with ATP. Suramin was studied as a possible treatment for prostate cancer in a clinical trial. Suramin has been studied in a mouse model of autism and in a small phase I/II human trial. Results from a randomized clinical study found no statistically significant effects of suramin (in either 10mg or 20mg doses) versus placebo on boys with moderate to severe autism spectrum disorder. Suramin is a reversible and competitive protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPases) inhibitor, also is the potent inhibitor of sirtuins, purified topoisomerase II and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). == References == == Further reading == == External links == Suramin sodium National Cancer Institute",Suramine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.883488948806189e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011754278093576431)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/suramin?utm_source=openai), [mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/suramin-injection-route/description/drg-20066167?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suramin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=9, title='Suramin | Cancer Treatment, Antiparasitic & Neurodegenerative | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/suramin?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=9, title='Suramin (injection route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/suramin-injection-route/description/drg-20066167?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=9, title='Suramin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suramin?utm_source=openai')])"
1528,"('Artesunate', 'Artesunic acid', 'Arsumax', 'Dihydroqinghasu hemsuccinate', 'Artesunatum')",Medical,"Artesunate (AS) is a medication used to treat malaria. The intravenous form is preferred to quinine for severe malaria. Often it is used as part of combination therapy, such as artesunate plus mefloquine. It is not used for the prevention of malaria. Artesunate can be given by injection into a vein, injection into a muscle, by mouth, and by rectum. The most common side effects include kidney failure requiring dialysis, hemoglobinuria (the presence of hemoglobin in urine) and jaundice. Artesunate is generally well tolerated. Side effects may include a slow heartbeat, allergic reaction, dizziness, and low white blood cell levels. During pregnancy it appears to be a safer option, even though animal studies have found harm to the baby. Use is likely fine during breastfeeding. It is in the artemisinin class of medication. Artesunate was developed by Liu Xu in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2020. It is in the class of medications known as artemisinins, which are derivatives from ""qinghao,"" or sweet wormwood plant (Artemisia annua). == Medical uses == Artesunate is the first-line treatment for children or adults with severe malaria, usually in combination with another antimalarial drug. There is moderate-quality evidence that treatment with artesunate plus mefloquine is superior to treatment with artesunate plus amodiaquine or artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Artemisinin-based combination therapy may be used by mouth in persons that can tolerate it after 24 hours by injection. Artesunate is preferred over parenteral quinine for severe malaria treatment. Artesunate was shown to prevent more deaths from severe malaria than quinine in two large multicentre randomized controlled trials from Africa and Asia. A subsequent systematic review of seven randomized controlled trials found this improvement in survival rates to be consistent across all trials. Artesunate's efficacy is comparable to that of artemether, another artemisinin derivative, in treating adults for severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, though artesunate clears more parasites initially. Artesunate combination drugs have a number of advantages over artemether-based drugs in terms of its uptake and administration routes and may be more effective in treatment of severe and complicated malaria in children. Artesunate is also used to treat less severe forms of malaria when it can be given orally. It has activity against P. ovale, P. malariae, and severe P. knowlesi. Artesunate + sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine for treatment of P. vivax is not recommended due to high rates of resistance. While artesunate is used primarily as treatment for malaria, there is some evidence that it may also have some beneficial effects in Schistosoma haematobium infection, but has not been evaluated in large randomized trials. Artesunate is used as the treatment of choice for severe malaria by the World Health Organization (WHO) over quinine. === Pregnancy === When given in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy, no artesunate-related adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the safety of artesunate use in the first trimester of pregnancy. The WHO recommends that artesunate use for severe malaria in the first trimester should be based on the individual risks versus benefits. In absence of other viable treatment options, artesunate may be used. === Children === Artesunate is safe for use in children. Artesunate + sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine should be avoided in the newborns due to sulfadoxine/pyrmethamine effects on bilirubin. Parenteral artesunate dosing for treatment of severe malaria in children less than 20 kg should be higher than that of adults in order to increase exposure. When artesunate cannot be given orally or intramuscularly due to an individual's weakness or inability to swallow, rectal administration may be given as pre-referral treatment as long as parenteral administration is initiated after transfer to a more advanced facility. == Adverse effects == Artesunate may cause serious side effects including hemolytic anemia (a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed), and severe allergic reactions. Artesunate is generally safe and well tolerated. Artesunate-based regimens are less likely to cause vomiting and tinnitus than quinine plus anti-malarial antibiotic therapy. The best recognised adverse effect of the artemisinins is that they lower reticulocyte counts. This is not usually of clinical relevance. With increased use of I.V. artesunate, there have been reports of post-artesunate delayed haemolysis (PADH). Delayed haemolysis (occurring around two weeks after treatment) has been observed in people treated with artesunate for severe malaria. == Contraindications == Artesunate is typically a well tolerated medicine. Known contraindications include a previous severe allergic reaction to artesunate. Drugs that should be avoided while on artesunate are the drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme CYP2A6. These drugs include amiodarone, desipramine, isoniazid, ketoconazole, letrozole, methoxsalen and tranylcypromine. == Mechanisms of action == The mechanisms of action of artesunate remains unclear and debatable. Artesunate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to its active form dihydroartemisinin (DHA). This process involves hydrolysis of the 4-carbon ester group via plasma esterase enzyme. It is hypothesized that the cleavage of endoperoxide bridge in the pharmacophore of DHA generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which increases oxidative stress and causes malarial protein damage via alkylation. In addition, Artesunate potently inhibits the essential Plasmodium falciparum exported protein 1 (EXP1), a membrane glutathione S-transferase. As a result, the amount of glutathione in the parasite is reduced. In 2016, artemisinin has been shown to bind to a large number targets, suggesting that it acts in a promiscuous manner. There is evidence suggesting DHA inhibition of calcium-dependent ATPase on endoplasmic membrane, which disrupts protein folding of parasites. == Pharmacokinetics == In infected individuals, the elimination half-life of artesunate is about 0.22 hours. Its active metabolite, DHA, has a slightly longer half-life of 0.34 hours. Overall, the average half-life ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 hours. Because of its short half-life, its use in malaria prevention is limited. DHA is metabolized to an inactive metabolite by the liver enzymes CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. == Chemical synthesis == Artesunate is made from dihydroartemisinin (DHA) by reacting it with succinic acid anhydride in a basic medium. It is one of few semi-synthetic derivatives from artemisinin that is water-soluble. == Research == Artesunate is under study for the treatment of COVID-19. == History == In May 2020, artesunate was approved for medical use in United States. Prior to this approval, intravenous (IV) artesunate was only available through the Expanded Access program of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which allowed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide IV artesunate to people in the U.S. with severe malaria and to people with uncomplicated malaria who are unable to take oral medications under an investigational new drug (IND) protocol. There has been no FDA-approved drug for treatment of severe malaria in the United States since the marketing of quinidine was discontinued by the manufacturer in March 2019. The safety and efficacy of IV artesunate for the treatment of severe malaria was primarily evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in Asia (Trial 1) and a supportive published randomized controlled trial in Africa (Trial 2). Trial 1 was conducted at 10 sites in Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia. Trial 1 enrolled 1,461 participants who received either IV artesunate or the comparator drug quinine and included 202 pediatric participants younger than 15 years. Trial 2 included 5,425 randomized pediatric participants younger than 15 years of age with severe malaria who were treated with artesunate or quinine. In both trials, the number of participants treated with artesunate who died in the hospital was significantly lower than the number who died in the control group treated with quinine. Trial 2 was conducted during 2005–2010 in nine African countries. A third trial, Trial 3, was conducted during 2007–2008 in Gabon and Malawi. In Trial 1, the most common adverse reactions in participants with malaria treated with IV artesunate were acute renal failure requiring dialysis, hemoglobinuria and jaundice. The safety profile in Trial 2 was generally similar to Trial 1. One trial was used to evaluate both, safety and benefits of artesunate. The trial enrolled participants with severe malaria who needed hospitalization because of their condition. Participants received at random either artesunate or a medicine used to treat malaria (quinine). Participants and the health care providers knew which treatment was being given. The benefit of artesunate in comparison to quinine was evaluated by comparing the number of participants who died while in the hospital (in-hospital mortality). The benefit of artesunate was supported by the data from Trial 2 in which pediatric participants younger than 15 years of age with severe malaria were randomly assigned treatment with artesunate or quinine. The application for IV artesunate was granted priority review and orphan drug designations. The FDA granted approval of artesunate for injection to Amivas. == References == == External links ==",Artesunate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.764281842042692e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004704084130935371)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artesunate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Artesunate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artesunate?utm_source=openai')])"

1530,"('Piperonyl butoxide', 'Butacide', 'Piperonylbutoxide', 'Butocide', 'Ethanol butoxide')",Medical,"Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is a pale yellow to light brown liquid organic compound used as an adjuvant component of pesticide formulations for synergy. That is, despite having no pesticidal activity of its own, it enhances the potency of certain pesticides such as carbamates, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and rotenone. It is a semisynthetic derivative of safrole and is produced from the condensation of the sodium salt of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol and the chloromethyl derivative of hydrogenated safrole (dihydrosafrole); or through 1,2-Methylenedioxybenzene. == History == PBO was developed in the late 1930s and early 1940s to enhance the performance of the naturally derived insecticide pyrethrum. Pyrethrum is a type of potent insecticide that kills mosquitoes and other disease-carrying vectors, thereby providing public health benefits, such as preventing malaria. Although exhibiting little intrinsic insecticidal activity of its own, PBO increases the effectiveness of pyrethrins, thus it is called a synergist. PBO was first patented in 1947 in the US by Herman Wachs. There are 3 known manufacturer of PBO in the world, Endura, Tagros and Catasynth (Anthea) who manufacture PBO through the MDB route. == Uses == PBO was first registered in the United States in the 1950s. PBO is mainly used in combination with insecticides, such as natural pyrethrins or synthetic pyrethroids, in ratios (PBO: pyrethrins) ranging from 3:1 to 20:1. Appearing in over 1,500 United States EPA-registered products, PBO is one of the most commonly registered synergists as measured by the number of formulas in which it is present. It is approved for pre- and postharvest application to a wide variety of crops and commodities, including grain, fruits and vegetables. The application rates are low; the highest single rate is 0.5 lbs PBO/acre. It is used extensively as an ingredient with insecticides to control insect pests in and around the home, in food-handling establishments such as restaurants, and for human and veterinary applications against ectoparasites (head lice, ticks, fleas). A wide variety of water-based PBO-containing products such as crack and crevice sprays, total release foggers, and flying insect sprays are produced for and sold to consumers for home use. PBO has an important public health role as a synergist used in pyrethrins and pyrethroid formulations used for mosquito control (e.g. space sprays, surface sprays and bed nets). Because of its limited, if any, insecticidal properties, PBO is never used alone. == Mechanism of action == PBO acts as an insecticide synergist by inhibiting the natural defense mechanisms of the insect, the most important of which is the mixed-function oxidase system, (MFOs) also known as the cytochrome P-450 system. The MFO system is the primary route of detoxification in insects, and causes the oxidative breakdown of insecticides such as pyrethrins and the synthetic pyrethroids – thus when PBO is added, higher insecticide levels remain in the insect to exercise their lethal effect. An important consequence of this property is that, by enhancing the activity of a given insecticide, less may be used to achieve the same result. PBO does not appear to have a significant effect on the MFO system in humans. PBO is found to be an efficacious, low-potency, neutral antagonist of G-protein-coupled CB1 receptors. Other synergists for pyrethroid insecticides include Sesamex and ""Sulfoxide"" (not to be confused with the functional group). == Regulatory == PBO is regulated in the United States and some other countries as a pesticide, even though PBO does not have this property. The United States Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the law that gives United States EPA its authority to regulate pesticides, includes certain synergists in its definition of a “pesticide” and is thus subject to the same approval and registration as products that kill pests, like the insecticides with which PBO is formulated. Pesticide registration is the process through which United States EPA examines the ingredients of a pesticide, where and how the pesticide is used (e.g., whole room fogger, crack-and-crevice, etc.), and the specific use pattern (amount and frequency of its use). United States EPA also evaluates the pesticide to ensure that it will not have unreasonable adverse effects on humans, the environment and non-target species. The United States EPA must register pesticides before they may be sold or distributed in the United States. Registration is required for the pesticide itself, as well as for all products containing it. The World Health Organization recognizes the public health value of PBO when used in conjunction with the synthetic pyrethroids deltamethrin or permethrin used in mosquito nets. == Hazard assessment == Numerous toxicology studies have been conducted over the past 40 years on PBO examining the full range of potential toxic effects. These studies were conducted in accord with regulatory requirements put forth by the United States EPA or other international agencies. Many were conducted following United States EPA Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs), a system of processes and controls to ensure the consistency, integrity, quality, and reproducibility of laboratory studies conducted in support of pesticides registration. The following types of studies have been conducted in support of PBO registration: === Acute toxicity studies === Acute toxicity studies are designed to identify potential hazards from acute exposures. The studies usually employ a single or a few high doses over a short time period. The data are used for the development of appropriate precautionary statements for pesticide product labels. Acute studies identify: Dermal toxicity Eye irritation Inhalation toxicity Oral toxicity Skin irritation Skin sensitization PBO has a low acute toxicity by oral, inhalation, and dermal routes in adults. It is minimally irritating to the eyes and skin. It is a not a skin sensitizer. === Dermal absorption === The available data indicate that less than 3% of the amount on the skin (forearm) is absorbed over an 8-hour period. Other studies with a pediculicide formulation indicate that about 2% crossed the skin and about 8% crossed the scalp. === Endocrine disruption === The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 required the United States EPA to address the issue of endocrine disruption. PBO is one of the chemicals selected by EPA to be part of the initial effort under the endocrine disruption screening program (EDSP). PBO was added to this list because of its wide use pattern (1500 products registered with US EPA), and people may be exposed to low levels of PBO in their diets, from treated surfaces in their homes (e.g., carpet), and in certain occupations (e.g., pest control operators). No evidence suggests that PBO disrupts the normal functioning of the endocrine system. This includes the recently developed data to assess the possible interaction of PBO with the endocrine system. The Piperonyl Butoxide Task Force II, a group of companies that produces or markets PBO-containing products, has conducted all 11 EDSP Tier 1 screens and has submitted all required documentation and study reports. The US EPA intends to use a weight of evidence (WoE) approach for assessing EDSP Tier 1 results. While the agency issued WOE guidelines, no actual WOE assessments have yet been conducted and released to the registrants. The PBTFII has conducted a WoE analysis for PBO that is consistent with EPA’s guidelines. The WoE analysis for PBO examines each EDSP Tier 1 assay conducted for PBO. It discusses the purpose of the assay, and summarizes the study design and results and provides an overall conclusion for each assay. All 11 individual assays are then considered together to arrive at an overall conclusion for the outcome of the Tier 1 battery. For some assays, other scientifically relevant information is also considered as part of the assessment. The purpose of the WoE analysis is to determine whether PBO has the potential to interact with the endocrine system, as determined by EDSP Tier 1 assays, the Tier 1 battery as a whole and OSRI. A determination that a chemical has the potential to interact with the endocrine system would trigger a need for EDSP Tier 2 testing. The EPA is planning to issue their WOE assessment in late 2014 or early 2015. === Subchronic and chronic/carcinogenicity studies === Subchronic and chronic studies examine the toxicity of longer-term, repeated exposure to chemicals. They may range from 90 days for subchronic studies, to 12–24 months for full lifetime chronic studies, designed to determine potential for carcinogenesis. They are also intended to identify any noncancer effects, as well as a clear no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) that is used for risk assessment. Studies conducted on PBO include: 90-day inhalation toxicology study 18-month chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study in mice 24-month chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study in rats NOAELs were derived for PBO from both subchronic and chronic studies. These NOAELs are used by the EPA to conduct risk assessments for all individual uses of PBO to ensure that all registered products with PBO pose a reasonable certainty of no harm used according to the label directions. PBO caused an increase in liver tumors in mice that ingested high levels of PBO in the diet for their entire lifetimes. The scientific identification and analysis of the key events leading to the formation of the mouse liver tumors suggest that the events are not likely to occur in humans. The EPA classifies PBO as a group C carcinogen – ""possibly carcinogenic to humans."" Under the auspices of the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues evaluated the entire body of toxicology of PBO several times since 1965. They concluded that, at doses up to internationally accepted standards for a maximum tolerated dose, PBO is not considered to be carcinogenic in the mouse or rat, thus leading to the conclusion that PBO is not carcinogenic to humans. === Developmental toxicity studies === PBO has been found to inhibit the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a critical regulator of brain and face development in all vertebrates, via antagonism of the protein Smoothened (SMO). PBO was found to be capable of causing dose-dependent brain and face malformations in mice exposed during early development, including the rare human birth defect holoprosencephaly. Even doses of PBO that did not cause overt holoprosencephaly associated facial abnormalities were found to cause subtle neuroanatomical defects, for which the cognitive or behavioral consequences are unknown. An epidemiology study found that PBO exposure was correlated with dose-dependent reductions in neurocognitive development in 3-year old children. === Animal impacts === PBO is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates, such as water fleas and shrimp. At lower, long-term doses, water flea reproduction was affected. PBO is highly toxic to amphibians in the tadpole stage. == Exposure assessment == Given the extensive non-dietary use of PBO, manufacturers of PBO and marketers of PBO-containing products formed the Non-Dietary Exposure Task Force (NDETF) in 1996 to develop a long-term research program to more fully understand the phenomenon of human exposure to insecticides used in the home. Most of the studies were conducted with formulations of pyrethrins/PBO and synthetic pyrethroids/PBO, and focused on the indoor use of fogger and aerosol products. Carpet and vinyl flooring surfaces were selected because of their different physical and chemical properties, and because they represent a significant percentage of the floor coverings used in homes in North America. While the focus of the NDETF effort was on total-release foggers, a study was also conducted to determine both dispersion (air levels) and deposition (on flooring) of pyrethrins/PBO resulting from the use of a hand held aerosol spray can. Potential direct exposure of the user was also measured. Air sampling from the breathing zone of the applicator and analysis of residues on cotton gloves was performed. This data was submitted to the United States EPA and was key to the agency’s comprehensive risk assessment for PBO. == Risk assessment == The US EPA, in their re-registration eligibility decision, determined ""no risks of concern"" existed for householders mixing, loading, handling, or applying PBO-containing products. == References ==",Piperonylbutoxide,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.00023333763238042593), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.001189477858133614), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023284347727894783)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.03804275393486023), (' PERSONAL', -0.001171652227640152), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601105.html?utm_source=openai), [ewg.org](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/704913-PIPERONYL_BUTOXIDE/?utm_source=openai), [npic.orst.edu](https://www.npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pbogen.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=308, start_index=36, title='Pyrethrin and Piperonyl Butoxide Topical: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601105.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=308, start_index=36, title='EWG Skin Deep® | What is PIPERONYL BUTOXIDE', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/704913-PIPERONYL_BUTOXIDE/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=308, start_index=36, title='Piperonyl Butoxide General Fact Sheet', type='url_citation', url='https://www.npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pbogen.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Therefore, relative rates of glucuronidation and isoform specificity of SN-38 lactone and carboxylate were characterized. The stability of SN-38 lactone and carboxylate in incubation mixtures of microsomes and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms was used to determine optimal incubation times. Microsomal incubations were conducted using rat and human intestinal and hepatic microsomes and human and rat recombinant UGT1A isoforms. Where estimates of lactone and carboxylate glucuronidation rates could not be established due to short incubation times and detection limits, kinetic modeling was used to recover these rate constants. The stability experiments revealed that the lactone was stabilized by rat microsomes, however, the opposite was observed in human microsomes and recombinant isoforms. For all tissues and most UGT isoforms examined, the lactone consistently had catalytic rates up to 6-fold greater than the carboxylate. The rank order of glucuronidation for both SN-38 lactone and carboxylate was 1A7 > 1A1 > 1A9 > 1A8 and 1A7 > 1A8 > 1A1 for human and rat isoforms, respectively.

1535,"('Metyrapone', 'Su-4885', 'Metopirone', 'Methopyrapone', 'Metopiron')",Medical,"Metyrapone, sold under the brand name Metopirone, is a medication which is used in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and occasionally in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome (hypercortisolism). It is part of the steroidogenesis inhibitor class of drugs. == Medical uses == Metyrapone can be used in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Metyrapone 30 mg/kg, maximum dose 3,000 mg, is administered at midnight usually with a snack. The plasma cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol are measured the next morning between 8:00 and 9:00 am. A plasma cortisol less than 220 nmol/L indicates adequate inhibition of 11β-hydroxylase. In patients with intact Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, CRH and ACTH levels rise as a response to the falling cortisol levels. This results in an increase of the steroid precursors in the pathway. Therefore, if 11-deoxycortisol levels do not rise and remain less than 7 μg/dL (202 nmol/L) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) rises, then it is highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. If neither 11-deoxycortisol nor ACTH rise, it is highly suggestive of an impaired hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis at either the pituitary or hypothalamus. The metyrapone test may aid in verifying the cause of Cushing's syndrome. Most patients with pituitary dysfunction and/or pituitary microadenoma will increase ACTH secretion in response to metyrapone, while most ectopic ACTH-producing tumors will not. Pituitary macroadenomas do not always respond to metyrapone. Metyrapone is used for the medical control of hypercortisolism in Cushing's syndrome (ACTH dependent or independent). The aim for medical treatment is to achieve pre-operative control of hypercortisolism, or for control of residual disease persisting post-operatively (TSS, adrenalectomy). It is not for long term definitive treatment/cure, only as an adjunct (surgery is the aim for cure in most causes of Cushing's syndrome). Metyrapone hence acts by inhibiting adrenal steroidogenesis. One side effect is hirsutism (in women) because of the excess androgen precursors created. The other commonly used agent for medical treatment of Cushing's is ketoconazole (an anti-fungal agent), though it is not FDA approved for Cushing's. This does not exhibit the side effect of hirsutism, but does carry a high risk of hepatoxicity and other serious side effects. Levoketoconazole, an enantiomeric form of ketoconazole, is FDA approved to treat Cushing's and carries a lower risk of hepatoxicity and other serious side effects compared to ketoconazole. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Metyrapone blocks cortisol steroidogenesis by acting as a reversible inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase. This stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, which in turn increases plasma 11-deoxycortisol levels. == Chemistry == Analogues of metyrapone include aminoglutethimide, amphenone B, and mitotane. == Research == Metyrapone has been found in early human trials to reduce recollection of emotional memories in normal volunteers. The volunteers showed significant impairment in ability to retrieve memories with negative emotional content while not impairing memories with neutral content. This has significant implication in the study of the process of emotional healing in post traumatic stress disorder. Due to the permissive action of cortisol on glucagon, partial blockade of cortisol may reduce the effects of circulating glucagon in chronically increasing blood glucose in metabolic syndrome (syndrome X) and type 2 diabetes. == See also == ACTH stimulation test == References ==",Metopiron,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2516897186287679e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000720956246368587)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/metopirone.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=83, start_index=9, title='Metopirone: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/metopirone.html?utm_source=openai')])"

However, by an independent mechanism, talabostat also stimulates the upregulation of cytokines and chemokines to engender a tumor-specific host immune response, thus giving it a unique dual mechanism of action. In clinical trials, talabostat has demonstrated significant activity, including achieving complete responses in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and malignant melanoma. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by excessive fibrosis, where activated fibroblasts play a pivotal role in disease progression. This study aimed to investigate the potential of Talabostat, a small molecule inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidases, in alleviating fibrosis and inflammation associated with SSc pathogenesis. Dermal fibroblasts were obtained from skin biopsies of ten diffuse cutaneous SSc patients and healthy controls. These fibroblasts were subjected to treatment with either TGF-β alone or in combination with Talabostat. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to evaluate FAPα and α-SMA protein levels. The expression of activated fibroblast markers (FAPα and ACAT2), pro-fibrotic (COL1A1 and COL1A2), anti-fibrotic (MMP1, MMP2, and MMP9), and inflammatory (IL-6 and TGFβ1) related genes was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Talabostat-treated fibroblasts were assessed for their migratory capacity using a scratch assay and for their viability through MTT assay and Annexin V staining. The basal expression of COL1A1 and TGFβ1 was notably higher in healthy subjects, while MMP1 expression showed a significant increase in SSc patients. Furthermore, TGF-β stimulation led to upregulation of activated fibroblast markers, pro-fibrotic, and inflammatory-related genes in SSc-derived fibroblasts, which were attenuated upon Talabostat treatment. Interestingly, Talabostat treatment resulted in an upregulation of MMP9 expression. Moreover, Talabostat exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of activated fibroblast viability in both healthy and SSc fibroblasts, and suppressed fibroblast migration specifically in SSc patients. In summary, Talabostat modulates fibrotic genes in SSc, thereby inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation, activation, and migration. These findings suggest promising therapeutic avenues for targeting fibrosis in SSc. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) play critical roles in obesity-associated inflammation that contributes to metabolic dysfunction. Talabostat (TB) exerts some therapeutic effects on tumors and obesity. However, it remains unknown whether the metabolic benefits of TB on obesity is dependent on ATM-mediated adipose inflammation. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, and mice were orally administered TB daily at a low dose (0.5 mg/kg). Administration of TB to mice fed a high-fat diet significantly improved adiposity and obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction, including glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied by increased whole-body energy expenditure. RNA sequencing analysis revealed extensive alterations in the transcriptome profiles associated with lipid metabolism and immune responses in adipose tissue of obese mice. Notably, TB treatment led to a significant reduction in ATM accumulation and a shift of the activation state of ATMs from the proinflammatory M1-like to the anti-inflammatory M2-like phenotype. Moreover, depletion of ATMs significantly abolished the TB-induced metabolic benefits. Our study demonstrates that TB at a low dose could increase energy expenditure and control ATM-mediated adipose inflammation in obese mice, thereby alleviating obesity and its associated metabolic dysfunction.",Talabostat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0009201106731779873), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01417978573590517)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17714031/,https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jco.2005.23.16_suppl.7570,https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jco.2007.25.18_suppl.4616 ', [])"

The other medications used in combination include sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and interferon, vary depending on the virus type and whether the person has cirrhosis. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects when used with sofusbivir and daclatasvir include headache, feeling tired, and nausea. With daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin the most common side effects are headache, feeling tired, nausea, and red blood cell breakdown. It should not be used with St. John's wort, rifampin, or carbamazepine. It works by inhibiting the HCV protein NS5A. Daclatasvir was approved for use in the European Union in 2014, and the United States and India in 2015. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The brand Daklinza is being withdrawn by Bristol Myers Squibb in countries where the drug is not typically prescribed, and Bristol Myers Squibb says it will not enforce its patents in those countries. == Medical use == Daclatasvir is used only in combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis C genotype 1, 3, or 4 infections; the agents used in combination, which include sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and interferon, vary based on the virus genotype, whether the person has cirrhosis and if a liver transplantation took place. It is not known whether daclatasvir passes into breastmilk or has any effect on infants. == Adverse effects == There is a serious risk of bradycardia when daclatasvir is used with sofosbuvir and amiodarone. Because it has not been extensively studied as a single agent, it is unknown what specific side effects are linked to this medication alone. Adverse events on daclatasvir have only been reported on combination therapy with sofosbuvir or triple therapy with sofosbuvir/ribavirin. Common adverse events occurring in >5% of people on combination therapy (sofosbuvir + daclatasvir) include headache and fatigue; in triple therapy (daclatasvir + sofosbuvir + ribavirin) the most common adverse events (>10%) include headache, fatigue, nausea and hemolytic anemia. Daclatasvir could cause hepatitis B re-activation in people co-infected with hepatitis B and C viruses. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended screening all people for hepatitis B before starting daclatasvir for hepatitis C in order to minimize the risk of hepatitis B reactivation. == Interactions == Concomitant use of drugs that are strong inducers of the cytochrome P450 CYP3A is contraindicated due to decreased therapeutic effect and resistance of drug. Some common drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers include dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin and St. John's Wort. Daclatasvir is a CYP3A and p-glycoprotein substrate, therefore, drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of these enzyme will interfere with daclatasvir levels in the body. Dose modifications are made with concomitant use of daclatasvir and drugs that affect CYP3A or p-gp. When taking daclatasvir with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, the dose of daclatasvir is increased to overcome CYP3A induction. The dose for daclatasvir should be lowered when taking with antifungals, such as ketoconazole. Currently, there are no required dosage adjustments with concurrent use of daclatasvir and immunosuppressants, narcotic analgesics, antidepressants, sedatives, and cardiovascular agents. Concurrent use with amiodarone, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir has may result in an increased risk for serious slowing of the heart rate. == Pharmacology == === The role of NS5A in HCV replication === NS5A is a zinc-binding protein dimer serving as a regulator in the replication cycle of HCV. It contains an amino-terminal amphipathic helix and three different domains with different binding affinities. The N-terminus binds to cellular membranes and is essential for the formation of replication complexes. Domain 1 (amino acid 401–60012) is an RNA binding region of NS5A and domain 2 serves in the RNA replication. Virus assembly is associated with domain 3. NS5A not only binds to cellular membranes, other non-structural proteins of the HCV replication-complex and viral RNA, but also to co-factors like PI4KA. PI4KA is a kinase, which phosphorylates a hydroxyl group of phosphatidylinositol in its inositol-ring at position four. This phosphorylation generates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), a docking site normally located at the Golgi membrane. PI4P is necessary for the recruitment of effector proteins participating in transport vesicles of lipid transfer. Resulting from that PI4P is crucial for maintaining the Golgi membrane structure and Golgi-secretion. By binding PI4KA on its domain 1 and accumulating PI4P away from the Golgi apparatus, NS5A induces the formation of a membranous web, a membrane structure arising from the endoplasmic reticulum via recruitment of lipid vesicles. The replication complex of HCV is located on this web-like structure. Out of these membranes and lipid drops, which had been recruited via PI4P, the virions can be assembled after viral-RNA replication. The RNA replication and assembly of virions depend on the ratio between two different forms of NS5A. Depending on the phosphorylation rate of NS5A, it is differentiated between NS5A (p56) and the hyperphosphorylated NS5A (p58). A higher rate of p58 seems to induce HCV assembly, whereas a lack of p58 leads to RNA replication. But the actual role of phosphorylation of NS5A is not clear. However, NS5A does not only regulate HCV replication and assembly, it also inhibits apoptosis, so the infected cell cannot disintegrate by itself and contain the infection, as cells normally do. Because of the lack of apoptosis, mutations within the cellular genome also do not trigger cells death. This causes the promotion of tumours. === Mechanism of action === NS5A contains a binding pocket in domain 1, where daclatasvir can insert. Because of the symmetric and amino acid related structure of daclatasvir, it comes to H-bond interactions between daclatasvir and the amino acids of the binding pocket. That causes a structural modification of NS5A, leading to a loss of action and resulting in an inhibition of virion formation. By altering the structure of NS5A, the recruitment of PI4KA and therefore the accumulation of PI4P get disabled. New lipid-drops and membranous components can no longer get recruited by PI4P in the membranous web and the web can no longer maintain. But it is important to mention that daclatasvir does not inhibit PI4KA directly, because it was observed that in cells, which were treated with daclatasvir, PI4P is still present in the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus. Daclatasvir also does not inhibit the initial PI4KA delocalization induced by NS5A because it was witnessed that daclatasvir had no impact on the function of NS5A within cells expressing only NS5A. It is likely that daclatasvir merely inhibits functions of NS5A associated with other proteins within the HCV replication complex just like the RNA-replicase NS4B. Concluding, daclatasvir presumably only inhibits PI4P hyper-accumulation in the context of full HCV polypeptide expression. This phenomenon is associated with the structure of domain 1 of NS5A. It was observed that domain 1 has two different conformations. Daclatasvir binds to one of these and as a result, locks domain 1 in this conformation. Though, NS5A is still able to bind PI4KA, what can explain the remaining function of NS5A in uninfected cells mentioned before. The second conformation of domain 1, which appears in non-treated cells, is then most likely to be associated with PI4P hyper-accumulation that is necessary for the formation and maintainment of the replication-complex and membranous web. So, PI4KA can still interact with NS5A, but due to the structural blockade, NS5A is not able to activate PI4KA as efficiently as normal. The inhibition of hyper-accumulation of PI4P results in the collapse of the membranous web and the formation of large aggregated structures formed out of the proteins of the replication complex. Moreover, NS5A seems to delocalize from the membranous web to lipid drops within the cytosol. Resulting from this observation, it is likely that the HCV replication-complex and virion hulls still get formed but are highly impaired by the treatment with daclatasvir. Furthermore, it has been observed, that the treatment of HCV infected cells with daclatasvir leads to a lack of the hyper-phosphorylated form of NS5A (p58). It is not clear if the formation of p58 is directly inhibited by daclatasvir or if it is just a side effect. But it is likely that the lack of p58 is crucial for the inhibition of virion assembly. === Pharmacokinetics === Daclatasvir reaches steady state in human subjects after about 4 days of once-daily 60 mg oral administration, with a peak dose in concentration occurring about 2 hours after administration. It comes in the form of an oral tablet, with a bioavailability of 67%. Daclatasvir is predominantly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and is also a P-gp substrate. It is highly protein bound. Protein binding was measured to be around 99% in people dosed multiple times with daclatasvir independent of dose strength. Daclatasvir has a volume of distribution of 47L following an oral dose of 60 mg and an IV dose of 100 μg. == History == Daklinza was discovered by scientists at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS); the precursor was identified using phenotypic screening in which the GT-1b replicon system was implemented in Huh7 cells and bovine viral diarrhea virus also in Huh7 cells was used as a counterscreen for specificity. Bristol Myers Squibb also developed the drug, with the first Phase I trial publishing in 2010. It was approved for use in Europe in August 2014, in the US in July 2015, and in India in December 2015; it was first in the class of NS5A inhibitors to reach the market. == Synthesis == The daclatasvir molecule contains the two amino acids proline and valine in their natural L-form which makes it easier to synthesize in the right stereo configuration. The following describes one exemplary mechanism of synthesizing daclatasvir as its free base. The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of biphenyl with chloroacetyl chloride and aluminium chloride used as a catalyst. As biphenyl is a solid crystal it is solved in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE). The mixture of chloroacetyl chloride and aluminium chloride is also used in a solution with DCE. To separate the product from the other compounds the outcoming reaction mixture is treated with 2N HCl solution. In the next step, the symmetrically acetylated product from the first step reacts with an N-methoxycarbonyl dipeptide in an esterification reaction. The dipeptide consists of the amino acids L-proline and L-valine and is solved in acetonitrile (MeCN). While the amino terminus of valine is protected by the methoxycarbonyl group the carboxy terminus of proline reacts with the product of step one forming the esterified product of both chemicals. In this reaction triethylamine works as a basic solvent. As a final step, the present molecule reacts with ammonium acetate in water forming the imidazole heterocycles on both sides of the molecule. Another option is to esterify it with boc-protected proline first, then form the imidazole heterocycles with ammonium acetate and add valine in the end after acidic deprotection of prolines N-terminus. In both cases, the final product is the daclatasvir free base. In the drug, daclatasvir is present in the hydrochloride salt form. == Society and culture == It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. === Economics === In December 2014, Bristol Myers Squibb announced that it would offer the drug for sale at different prices in different countries, depending on the level of economic development, and that it would license the drug to generics manufacturers for sale in the developing world. As of January 2016, a twelve-week course cost around $63,000 in the US, around $39,000 in the UK, around $37,000 in France, and $525 in Egypt. == Research == Daclatasvir has been tested in combination regimens with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, as well as with other direct-acting antiviral agents including asunaprevir and sofosbuvir. == References ==",Daclatasvir dihydrochloride,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.172316494077677e-06), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00012706902634818107)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D10105?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=72, start_index=9, title='KEGG DRUG: Daclatasvir dihydrochloride', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D10105?utm_source=openai')])"

Cytarabine, while effective in killing leukemic cells, is subject to development of several resistance mechanisms rendering the drug ineffective in many patients. Elacytarabine, a lipophilic 5'-elaidic acid ester or nucleoside analogue of cytosine arabinoside, was created with the intent of overcoming resistance mechanisms including reduced expression of the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) required for cytarabine entry into cells, as well as increased activity of cytidine deaminase (CDA) which breaks down the active metabolite of cytarabine, ara-CTP. Elacytarabine enters cells independently of transporters, has a longer half life compared with cytarabine and is not subject to deactivation by CDA. Preclinical data were encouraging although subsequent clinical studies have failed to show superiority of elacytarabine compared with standard of care as monotherapy in patients with AML. Clinical trials utilizing elacytarabine in combination with anthracyclines are ongoing. Use of hENT1 expression as a predictive marker for cytarabine or elacytarabine response has been studied with no conclusive validation to date. Despite promising early results, the jury is still out in regards to this novel agent as an effective alternative to standard cytarabine therapy in acute leukemias, especially in combination with additional agents such as anthracyclines. Ara-C (cytarabine arabinoside) is a deoxycytidine analog that has an established role in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, especially acute myeloid leukemia. Resistance to ara-C occurs and impacts negatively on survival. To combat this, an elaidic acid ester of ara-C, called elacytarabine, has been developed. This novel agent is highly efficacious in cells with demonstrable resistance to the parent agent, including in solid tumor xenografts. The mechanisms that account for the increased clinical activity of elacytarabine are discussed, including its ability to bypass the specialized transmembrane nucleoside transport system on which ara-C depends, its prolonged retention within the cell and its alternative effect on the cell cycle. The development and synthesis and pharmacokinetics are outlined, with emphasis on lipid vector technology. Ten clinical trials involving elacytarabine, either as monotherapy or part of a combination regimen, have been carried out in both solid tumor and hematologic malignancies. The efficacy and side effect profile results are summarized. Clinical trials in patients with hematological malignancies are reporting very encouraging efficacy results with an acceptable side effect profile. Elacytarabine has the potential to play an important role in the treatment of multiple malignancies in the future and results from an ongoing Phase III clinical trial are eagerly awaited. Cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine or Ara-C) has been one of the cornerstones of treatment of acute myeloid leukemia since its approval in 1969. Standard induction therapy worldwide for all patients deemed fit for treatment (excluding those with acute promyelocytic leukemia) remains unchanged for over 40 years and consists of Ara-C administered by continuous infusion in combination with a topoisomerase II inhibitor (e.g., daunorubicin, idarubicin and mitoxantrone). Despite decades of clinical investigation, the optimum dose of both agents still remains unclear. Although higher doses of Ara-C have been shown to improve response rates, the elderly poorly tolerate these regimens. Resistance mechanisms also develop or may be present at diagnosis resulting in poor outcomes. Elacytarabine (CP-4055), an elaidic acid ester of Ara-C, has been developed using lipid vector technology in an attempt to overcome these limitations. Clinical data are encouraging, with evidence suggesting that this novel agent is circumventing resistance mechanisms but retaining the potent antileukemic efficacy of Ara-C.",Elacytarabine,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.493430894101039e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00026174934464506805), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011053873226046562)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.biocentury.com/article/273366/clavis-discontinues-development-of-elacytarabine,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB05494,https://www.biospace.com/clavis-pharma-asa-stops-elacytarabine-development-on-negative-ph3-trial-in-aml ', [])"

Population pharmacokinetics were assessed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling of concentration data from two first-in-human phase 1 trials evaluating different dosing schedules of indotecan. Covariates were assessed in a stepwise manner. Final model qualification included bootstrap simulation, visual and quantitative predictive checks, and goodness-of-fit. A sigmoidal E 518 concentrations from 41 patients supported a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Body weight and body surface area accounted for inter-individual variability of central/peripheral distribution volume and intercompartmental clearance, respectively. Estimated typical population values were CL 2.75 L/h, Q3 46.0 L/h, and V3 37.9 L. The estimated value of Q2 for a typical patient (BSA = 1.96 m The final PK model adequately describes indotecan population pharmacokinetics. Fixed dosing may be justified based on covariate analysis and the weekly dosing regimen may have a reduced neutropenic effect. Visceral leishmaniasis is an emerging neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum in the countries bordering the Mediterranean Basin. Currently there is no effective vaccine against this disease, and the therapeutic approach is based on toxic derivatives of Sb(V). Therefore, the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the development of drugs designed to inhibit them comprise an extremely important approach to fighting this disease. DNA topoisomerases (Top) have been identified as promising targets for therapy against leishmaniasis. These enzymes are involved in solving topological problems generated during replication, transcription, and recombination of DNA. Being unlike that of the mammalian host, type IB DNA topoisomerase (TopIB) from Leishmania spp. is a unique bisubunit protein, which makes it very interesting as a selective drug target. In the present investigation, we studied the effect of two TopIB poisons with indenoisoquinoline structure, indotecan and AM13-55, on a murine BALB/c model of infected splenocytes with L. infantum, comparing their effectiveness with that of the clinically tested leishmanicidal drug paromomycin. Both compounds have high selectivity indexes compared with uninfected splenocytes. SDS-KCl-precipitable DNA-protein complexes in Leishmania promastigotes and in vitro cleaving assays confirmed that these drugs are Top poisons. The inhibitory potency of both indenoisoquinolines on L. infantum recombinant TopIB was assessed in vitro, with results showing that indotecan was the most active compound, preventing the relaxation of supercoiled DNA. Experimental infections in susceptible BALB/c mice treated with 2.5 mg/kg body weight/day once every other day for a total of 15 days showed that indotecan cleared more than 80% of the parasite burden of the spleen and liver, indicating promising activity against visceral leishmaniasis. Indenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors are a novel class of anticancer agents with two compounds in clinical trials. Recent metabolism studies of indotecan (LMP400) led to the discovery of the biologically active 2-hydroxylated analogue and 3-hydroxylated metabolite, thus providing strategically placed functional groups for the preparation of a variety of potential ester prodrugs of these two compounds. The current study details the design and synthesis of two series of indenoisoquinoline prodrugs, and it also reveals how substituents on the O-2 and O-3 positions of the A ring, which are next to the cleaved DNA strand in the drug-DNA-Top1 ternary cleavage complex, affect Top1 inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity.

It is an ester formed by the Knoevenagel condensation of 2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate with benzophenone. It is a viscous, oily liquid that is clear and colorless. The extended conjugation of the acrylate portion of the molecule absorbs UVB and short-wave UVA (ultraviolet) rays with wavelengths from 280 to 320 nm, protecting the skin from direct DNA damage. The ethylhexanol portion is a fatty alcohol, adding emollient and oil-like (water resistant) properties. == Safety == Octocrylene can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer, resulting in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. It may also pass through the skin, into the blood stream, eventually being metabolized and excreted in urine in form of its metabolites. Octocrylene can convert to benzophenone through a retro-aldol condensation. The reaction occurs slowly over time, yielding significant concentration of benzophenone in all commercial cosmetics tested formulated with octocrylene. In coral, octocrylene has been shown to accumulate in the form of fatty acid conjugates and trigger mitochondrial dysfunction. === Regulation === Palau has banned the sale and use of three reef-toxic UV filters including octocrylene in its Responsible Tourism Education Act of 2018.

It is an ester formed by the condensation of salicylic acid with 2-ethylhexanol. It is a colorless oily liquid with a slight floral odor. The salicylate portion of the molecule absorbs ultraviolet light, protecting skin from the harmful effects of exposure to sunlight. The ethylhexanol portion is a fatty alcohol, adding emollient and oil-like (water resistant) properties. == Safety == According to the classification provided by companies to ECHA in REACH registrations this substance is very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects and is suspected of damaging the unborn child. In 2020 the ECHA decided that a fish sexual development test of the chemical was necessary, because the compound may be an endocrine disruptor. The compound was identified in a court case brought by German chemical company Symrise who claimed that the ingredient used in sunscreen did not require animal testing. Symrise lost the appeal against a European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) decision that requires the German manufacturer to test sunscreen ingredients on animals. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decision applies to two formerly approved ingredients used exclusively in sunscreens — UV filter homosalate and 2-ethylhexyl salicylate. In 2007 octyl salicylate and all other salicylates were found to have a good safety profile. It is often used to improve affinity and reduce photodegradation of other sunscreen ingredients (such as oxybenzone and avobenzone), and under 1% of the applied dose of octyl salicylate penetrates through the skin. Although more stable, octyl salicylate is a weak organic UVB absorber. Octyl salicylate does not produce reactive oxygen species when exposed to sunlight. However, it does have some minor sensitization potential; with some individuals experiencing minimal to mild skin irritation. == Notes == == References == ""The Skin Cancer Foundation's Guide to Sunscreens"".

Biochemical markers (MBP, S100B, NEFL, NSE, BCL-2, Cyt-C, Calpain, TNF-α, Caspase-3, MDA, and CAT) were measured in serum and brain tissue samples. Histological examinations (H&E staining), DNA fragmentation analysis (TUNEL) were performed, along with Caspase-3 assessment. The ALLN-treated groups exhibited significant improvements in biochemical markers and a remarkable reduction in apoptosis compared to the damaged groups (CuO-NP and I/R). H&E and Caspase-3 staining revealed damage-related morphological changes and reduced apoptosis in the ALLN-treated group. However, no differences were observed among the groups with TUNEL staining. The findings suggest that ALLN, as a calpain inhibitor, has potential implications for anti-apoptotic treatment, specifically in mitigating neuroapoptotic cell damage caused by CuO-NP and I/R. Inflammatory bowel disease is characterised by oxidative and nitrosative stress, leucocyte infiltration, upregulation of expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and upregulation of P-selectin in the colon. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of calpain inhibitor I in rats subjected to experimental colitis. Colitis was induced in rats by intracolonic instillation of dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (DNBS). Rats experienced haemorrhagic diarrhoea and weight loss. Four days after administration of DNAB, the mucosa of the colon exhibited large areas of necrosis. Neutrophil infiltration (determined by histology as well as by an increase in myeloperoxidase activity in the mucosa) was associated with upregulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin as well as high tissue levels of malondialdehyde. Immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) showed intense staining in the inflamed colon. Staining of sections of colon obtained from DNBS treated rats with an anti-cyclooxygenase 2 antibody showed diffuse staining of the inflamed tissue. Furthermore, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was found mainly in macrophages located within the inflamed colon of DNBS treated rats. Calpain inhibitor I (5 mg/kg daily intraperitoneally) significantly reduced the degree of haemorrhagic diarrhoea and weight loss caused by administration of DNBS. Calpain inhibitor I also caused a substantial reduction in (i) degree of colon injury, (ii) rise in myeloperoxidase activity (mucosa), (iii) increase in tissue levels of malondialdehyde, (iv) increase in staining (immunohistochemistry) for nitrotyrosine and PARP, as well as (v) upregulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin caused by DNBS in the colon.

Type IV collagen, the major structural component of basement membranes, is a multimeric protein composed of 3 alpha subunits; this gene encodes the alpha 3 subunit. These subunits are encoded by 6 different genes, alpha 1 through alpha 6, each of which can form a triple helix structure with 2 other subunits to form type IV collagen. In Goodpasture's syndrome, autoantibodies bind to the collagen molecules in the basement membranes of alveoli and glomeruli. The epitopes that elicit these autoantibodies are localized largely to the non-collagenous C-terminal domain of the protein. A specific kinase phosphorylates amino acids in this same C-terminal region and the expression of this kinase is upregulated during pathogenesis. There are multiple alternate transcripts that appear to be unique to this human alpha 3 gene and alternate splicing is restricted to the six exons that encode this C-terminal domain. This gene is also linked to an autosomal recessive form of Alport syndrome. The mutations contributing to this syndrome are also located within the exons that encode this C-terminal region. Like the other members of the type IV collagen gene family, this gene is organized in a head-to-head conformation with another type IV collagen gene so that each gene pair shares a common promoter.

1552,"('Triamterene', 'Dyrenium', 'Dytac', 'Pterofen', 'Pterophene')",Medical,"Triamterene (traded under names such as Dyrenium and Dytac) is a potassium-sparing diuretic often used in combination with thiazide diuretics for the treatment of high blood pressure or swelling. The combination with hydrochlorothiazide, is known as hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene. == Side effects == Common side effects may include a depletion of sodium, folic acid, and calcium, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include heart palpitations, tingling/numbness, fever, chills, sore throat, rash, and back pain. Triamterene can also cause kidney stones through direct crystallization or by seeding calcium oxalate stones. Triamterene is best avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease due to the possibility of hyperkalemia. People using this drug should use salt substitute cautiously. Triamterene may impart a blue fluorescent color to the urine. == Caution with certain disease states == Diabetes: Use with caution in people with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus as there may be a change in glucose control. Liver impairment: Use with caution in people with severe liver dysfunction; in cirrhosis, avoid electrolyte and acid/base imbalances that might lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Kidney failure: combined triamterene and indomethacin therapy caused reversible acute kidney injury in some people. Kidney stones: Use with caution in people with kidney stones. Use should be avoided if the creatinine clearance is less than 10 ml/minute. == Mechanism of action == Triamterene directly blocks the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the lumen side of the kidney collecting tubule.: 127 Other diuretics cause a decrease in the sodium concentration of the forming urine due to the entry of sodium into the cell via the ENaC, and the concomitant exit of potassium from the principal cell into the forming urine. Blocking ENaC prevents this from happening. Amiloride works in the same way. Sodium channel blockers directly inhibit the entry of sodium into the sodium channels. == With hydrochlorothiazide == Triamterene is commonly prepared in combination with hydrochlorothiazide for treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (water retention). This combination is in a class of medications called diuretics or 'water pills', and causes the kidneys to get rid of the body's unneeded water and sodium through the urine. == History == The triamterene ring system is found in many naturally occurring compounds, such as folic acid and riboflavin. The observation that the naturally occurring compound xanthopterin had renal affects led scientists at Smith Kline and French Laboratories in Philadelphia to begin a medicinal chemistry campaign to discover potential drugs, as part of a program to discover potassium-sparing diuretics.: 125 The first clinical studies were published in 1961 and the first trials combining it with hydrochlorothiazide were published the next year.: 126 Smith Kline & French launched it as a single agent under the brand Dyrenium in 1964.: 83 The combination drug with hydrochlorothiazide, Dyazide, was first approved in the US in 1965 and the first generic, brought by Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., was approved in 1987. In 1986 Dyazide was the most prescribed drug in the US and had $325 million in sales, making it SmithKline Beckman's second-biggest seller behind Tagamet. The patents had expired on Dyazide in 1980, but complications arose with the introductions of generics, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent. Bolar Pharmaceutical was in the running to be the first to bring a generic, but its application was delayed by these concerns about whether its formulation provided the same amount of each drug; these were complicated by accusations that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA. Shortly after Bolar's generic was approved, further concerns were raised with regard to Bolar's applications to market generics more generally; these findings among others raised widespread concern among doctors and the public over whether generics were really the same as branded drugs. Bolar ended up recalling its generic form of Dyazide and withdrawing the product in 1990. In 1991 the US Justice Department on behalf of the FDA filed 20 criminal charges against Bolar for its fraud, and early the next year Bolar pled guilty and agreed to pay a $10M fine. Public concern over the safety of generic drugs was further exacerbated by a Congressional investigation into bribery at the FDA by generics companies that found pervasive corruption; the investigation had been spurred by the generics company Mylan, which had hired private investigators based on its beliefs that competitors were getting unfair advantages in getting their generics approved. Mylan itself developed a version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug after the Dyazide patent expired, and used a different, more stable formulation as well as different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene) so it had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984. The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983. Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition and litigation by two of them, American Therapeutics Inc. and Vitarine Pharmaceuticals, with the FDA. Vitarine, along with Par Pharmaceutical, were two of the companies that Mylan had targeted in its investigation into corruption and it turned out that Par and Vitarine had each used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain its bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product. Generics eventually entered the market. == Research == While there is a lack of randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of triamterene in the treatment of Ménière's disease, the typical treatment is 37.5 mg of triamterene with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide 1–2 capsules daily.

1553,"('Thio-tepa', 'Thiotepa', 'Triethylenethiophosphoramide', 'Thiophosphamide', 'Thioplex')",Medical,"Thiotepa (N,N',N''(-triethylenethiophosphoramide, INN), sold under the brand name Tepadina among others, is an anti-cancer medication. Thiotepa is an organophosphorus compound with the formula (C2H4N)3PS. == History == Thiotepa and its synthesis were patented in 1952 by the American Cyanamid company. It was made for use in the textile industry and in the production process of plastics. However, thiotepa entered human trials in 1953 and was found to be effective against acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The first clinical trial noted a “reasonable margin for safety” between the apparent dose and undesired bone marrow suppression In January 2007, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) designated thiotepa as an orphan drug. In April 2007, the United States FDA designated thiotepa as a conditioning treatment for use prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In June 2024, the FDA approved a ready-to-dilute liquid formulation of thiotepa to treat breast and ovarian cancer. == Structure == Thiotepa consists of three aziridine rings (also known as ethylenimines), which are cyclic compounds containing two carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom, all bonded to a phosphine sulfide group. The phosphine sulfide acts as an activating group, activating the aziridine groups. == Reactivity == Thiotepa is a reactive compound that, under acidic, neutral, or alkaline conditions, undergoes solvolysis, leading to potential side reactions such as polymerization and dimerization into piperazines. During acidic degradation, thiotepa reacts with chloride ions to produce monochloro, dichloro, and trichloro derivatives. Acidic conditions also result in the formation of tepa (N,N′,N′′-triethylenephosphoramide), the first identified and more reactive metabolite of thiotepa. In alkaline media, thiotepa undergoes degradation, though no detectable byproducts were identified. Like other aziridine-containing compounds, hydroxyl substitution reactions may release aziridine. This degradation pathway has also been reported for tepa. The stability of thiotepa in biological samples is dependent on pH. In plasma, the monochloro derivative of thiotepa is formed, while in urine, both monochloro and dichloro derivatives have been found. Thiotepa is most stable between pH 7 and 11. In plasma under physiological conditions, the compound has a half-life of five days, whereas in urine at 37 °C, the half-life is 16 minutes at pH 4 and 21 hours at pH 6. == Synthesis == Two separate syntheses of thiotepa have been described in literature. The most prevalent method involves the addition of an excess of aziridine to thiophosphoryl chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine (TEA) (or another molar equivalent of aziridine) and a suitable solvent (e.g., ether or benzene). The first molecule of aziridine reacts with thiophosphoryl chloride to produce dichloridophosphorothionate, which is sufficiently reactive due to the poor overlap of the nitrogen lone pair with the P=S bond, allowing it to react with another two molecules of aziridine Thiotepa has also been synthesized from phosphorus trichloride and six molar equivalents of aziridine. The trivalent triamide formed reacts with octasulfur (S₈) in benzene. == Medical uses == Thiotepa is used in combination with other chemotherapy agents to treat cancer. It can be given with or without total body irradiation (TBI) to prepare the body for allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT), which replaces damaged blood-forming cells with donor cells. This treatment is used in both adults and children for blood cancers such as Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia. Thiotepa is also used with high-dose chemotherapy and HPCT support to treat certain solid tumors in adults and children. Thiotepa is used in palliative care for several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, and bladder cancer. It is also used to control intracavitary effusions caused by serosal neoplastic deposits, which refers to fluid buildup resulting from cancer spreading to the lining of body cavities. In Japan, a widely used regimen consisting of high-dose thiotepa and melphalan, followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue, is used to treat high-risk neuroblastoma. === Administration === Thiotepa is mainly administered intravenously and intravesically. The administered dose regarding different types of cancer variates between 3 mg/kg/day to 13 mg/kg/day. Thiotepa is unreliably absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract: acid instability prevents thiotepa from being administered orally. Thiotepa is also used in the treatment of bladder cancer during this treatment thiotepa is used as intravesical chemotherapy. Thiotepa is frequently administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents such as busulfan and carboplatin. === Clinical outcomes === In clinical trials the outcome of different types of treatment is compared to identify if a compound or regimen is favourable for the patient. The choice of treatment in the conditioning therapy can have a profound impact on progression-free survival (PNS), overall survival (OS), relapse incidence (RI) and non-relapse mortality (NRM). The studies mentioned summarize key findings comparing various conditioning regimens. Studies on conditioning regimens for hematopoietic cell transplant in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) have shown that thiotepa based therapies thiotepa/busulfan/cyclophosphamide (TBC) and thiotepa/carmustine (TT-BCNU) improve progression-free survival of PCNSL compared to traditional therapies carmustine/etoposide/cytarabine/melphalan (BEAM). Research also suggests that in BEAM if carmustine is exchanged for thiotepa no statistical difference was found in PFS, OS and RI. Furthermore the capacity of thiotepa to pass the blood-brain barrier may allow optimizing the therapy for patients with Central Nervous System involvement of increased CNS relapse risk. Another study compared total body irradiation (TBI) and thiotepa, busulfan and cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (TTB) as a conditioning regiment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No statistical difference was found in the overall survival but the RI was higher in the TBI regimen but the NRM was lower with TTB suggesting that TBB might be a viable alternative to TBI. == Metabolism == The metabolism of thiotepa primarily takes place in the liver, following both phase 1 and phase 2 metabolic pathways. Phase 1 involves reactions which change chemical moieties such as oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis, while phase 2 includes the addition of endogenous groups to foreign compounds. Phase 1 metabolism of thiotepa is predominantly mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, major CYP2B6 and minor CYP3A4. In this phase an oxidation and desulfuration reactions convert thiotepa into its more active metabolite tepa. Tepa itself exhibits a longer plasma half-life (3 to 24 hours) than thiotepa (1 to 3 hours) and contributes to the overall pharmacological activity of the drug. In phase 2 thiotepa is detoxified via the conjugation with glutathione by glutathione S-transferase. This is followed by the removal of the glutamyl and glycine moieties, and concludes with the N-acetylation of the cysteine conjugate by N-acetylase to form thiotepa-mercapturate. This derivative is more water-soluble, facilitating urinary excretion. Tepa is not conjugated to glutathione but reacts further in the urine and plasma to monochloro tepa. The conversion to a β-chloroethyl moiety depends on the pH and the chloride concentration. The formation of monochloride tepa mainly occurs in the urine. Enzymes responsible for metabolising compounds can show varying efficiency in different individuals or populations, this is called polymorphism. In a study regarding thiotepa metabolism by Ekhart et al., it was found that glutathione S-transferase shows polymorphism. This variation resulted in some patients in slower glutathione conjugation and consequently, to a 45% increase in combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa. The volume of distribution has been reported to range from 40,8 L/m2 to 75,0 L/m2. This high value is due to the highly lipophilic character of thiotepa and can therefore easily cross cell membranes and distribute into fatty tissues. In addition, thiotepa can easily cross the blood brain barrier and can rapidly penetrate the central nervous system. In plasma, 70 to 90% of the compound remains unbound to proteins, while the remaining 10–30% is primarily bound to gamma globulin, with minimal binding to albumin. Gamma globulin primarily functions as antibodies for the immune system, while albumin serves as a transport protein. All metabolites are excreted in the urine, which is nearly complete in 6 to 8 hours, with tepa and thiotepa-mercapturate each accounting for approximately 11.1% of the excretion. In contrast, the excretion of monochloride tepa and thiotepa is significantly lower, at only 0.5% each. The total clearance of thiotepa ranged from 11,4 to 23,2 L/h/m2. The total excretion of thiotepa and its identified metabolites accounts for 54 to 100% of the total alkylating activity, suggesting the existence of other alkylating metabolites. During the conversion of glutathione conjugates into N-acetylcysteine conjugates, intermediates such as glutathione, cysteinyl glycine, and cysteine conjugates are formed. These metabolites are not detected in urine and, if formed, are likely excreted in bile or rapidly converted into thiotepa-mercapturate. Additionally, due to its high lipophilicity, thiotepa is excreted in minor amounts by the skin via sweat. == Molecular mechanism of action == Thiotepa, as well as its more reactive metabolite, tepa, work as an alkylating agent via its aziridine ring. Due to the basic nature of aziridine and the physiological pH, aziridine is protonated to form the aziridinium ion, resulting in an electrophilic moiety that is highly susceptible to nucleophiles. DNA reacts through the nucleophilic N-7 position of guanine onto the electrophilic aziridine ring, rendering alkylated nucleobases. Thiotepa contains three reactive aziridine rings, allowing a single molecule to alkylate multiple nucleobases. Hence, it is a polyfunctional alkylating agent. This property also gives rise to its ability to cross-link DNA strands. Apart from its mechanism of action, it is suggested that thiotepa can function as a prodrug. Due to its moderate lipophilicity, it first penetrates the cell membrane, followed by hydrolysis to release the more hydrophilic aziridine ring. The aziridine ring can once again alkylate the DNA. The highly reactive metabolite tepa can be considered as an active metabolite and alkylates DNA similar to its parent drug. Ultimately, the alkylation of DNA leads to cell damage and can lead to cell death. Cross-linking blocks the separation of DNA strands, inhibiting replication and the proliferation of cells. == Toxicity == Thiotepa is associated with a range of side effects. The severity and type of side effects may vary based on the dosage, duration of treatment, and individual patient factors. === Myelosuppression === Proliferating cells, such as tumour cells, are more sensitive to alkylating agents, rendering these drugs useful for chemotherapy. However, alike drugs of this class, thiotepa is nonselective, which often results in its most important side effect: myelosuppression, the decreased activity of bone marrow. In turn, this can lead to leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, infection, and anemia. These side effects are often the most severe between 15 to 20 days following low dose treatment. Bone marrow has a high turn-over in the production of blood cells, which can be analogously inhibited by alkylating agents. This toxicity is dose-dependent and can be anticipated on. However, even a low dose can lead to life-threatening situations. Higher, and, therefore, more therapeutically effective, doses of thiotepa have successfully been applied by the autologous transplantation of bone marrow. In these high-dose therapies, the dose can be as much as a hundred times greater than that of conventional therapy. Despite the use of bone marrow transplantation, complications from the therapy can be fatal. Monoalkylation of DNA leads to mispairing of bases and, if not repaired, can reside in the DNA sequence. Mutated DNA that does not undergo cell death can find its way into daughter cells and potentially cause genetic disorders such as cancer. As a result of cell mutation in the bone marrow, chemotherapies with alkylating agents are known to cause acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). === Additional toxic effects === Apart from its mutagenic nature, thiotepa can exert skin toxicity, such as redness and hyperpigmentation. Other less frequent symptoms are peeling skin and mucositis. These effects can be unified under the term of ""toxic erythema of chemotherapy"". Due to thiotepa's excretion via sweat, skin exposure is especially high in regions with a high density of sweat glands. Namely, symptoms are more abundant at skin folds, the groin, armpits, and generally obstructed skin where accumulation of sweat can take place. The symptoms can be minimized by washing the skin with water and preventing the use of soap and moisturizers, together with preventing obstructions of the skin, 36 hours after thiotepa administration. Thiotepa's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier can lead to diseases related to the white brain matter and neurotoxic symptoms such as memory deficits, dizziness, blurred vision, and others. Additionally, neurotoxicity and mucositis are the main dose-limiting factors in high-dose treatment (whereas the main dose-limiting factor, myelosuppression, is remedied by applying transplantation of bone marrow). Other general adverse effects of chemotherapy with thiotepa are infections, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, oedema and hair loss. In-vivo experiments in animals displayed additional and potentially important toxicities. Thiotepa has been found to negatively affect fertility in male and female mice by interfering with spermatogenesis and impairing ovarian function, respectively. It was found to be teratogenic in mice and rats and fetolethal in rabbits. These effects were seen at doses lower than those used in humans. The LD50 of thiotepa via oral administration is 38 mg/kg in mice and 2,3 mg/kg in rats. For intravenous and intra-arterial injection in rats, the LD50 values are 9,5 mg/kg and 8,8 mg/kg, respectively. Women and men of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. A pregnancy test should be performed before treatment is started. Men should not father a child during and a year after cessation of treatment. There is no data on the administration of thiotepa during pregnancy, But as in-vivo animal experiments showed teratogenic effects the use of thiotepa during pregnancy is contraindicated. It is not known whether thiotepa is excreted in human breast milk, but due to its high lipophilicity, this cannot be ruled out. Due to its pharmacological properties and potential for toxicity in newborns/infants breast feeding is contraindicated during treatment with thiotepa. == Drug interactions == Thiotepa can have various interactions with other medications or therapies that can impact patient safety and treatment efficacy. Aprepitant, a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting that may occur during chemotherapy, inhibits CYP-enzymes, which decrease the metabolism of thiotepa to tepa. Its importance is relatively minor because inhibition itself is small and due to the variability of thiotepa clearance in different individuals. The anti-seizure medication phenytoin induces the CYP3A4 enzyme. This leads to an increased rate of tepa formation from thiotepa, which highly influences its clearance and concentration. Higher local concentrations of the more reactive tepa can potentially induce hepatotoxicity. Additionally, cytotoxic drugs such as thiotepa can reduce the absorption of phenytoin leading to the increased risk of seizures. It is advised to avoid the use of both drugs simultaneously or decrease thiotepa doses. Myelosuppressive/myelotoxic agents such as melphalan, busulfan, treosulfan, and cyclophosphamide, as well as the concurrent use of thiotepa, may increase the risk of hematologic adverse reactions and pulmonary toxicity, as they share similar toxicity profiles. Additionally, the use of live attenuated vaccines (including yellow fever) poses a risk of systemic and potentially fatal infection, with the risk further heightened in patients who are already immunosuppressed due to their underlying disease. In general, thiotepa is a potent inhibitor of CYP2B6, which can lead to increased plasma levels of drugs that are substrates of this enzyme. In addition to this, it may reduce the levels of potentially active metabolites, such as 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, from cyclophosphamide. Likewise, co-administration with inhibitors of thiotepa’s metabolising enzymes can lead to increased thiotepa plasma concentrations. Finally, prolonged apnea has been reported by the administration of thiotepa and is thought to be a result of the inhibition of pseudocholinesterase by thiotepa. For this reason, inhibitors such as succinylcholine and pancuronium should be prevented during thiotepa administration to prevent respiratory failure. == References ==",Thiotepa,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.00033558503491804004), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.10021886229515076), (' INDUSTR', -2.629921436891891e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00118900160305202), ('ICAL', -2.9802276912960224e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6931606531143188)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.20141343772411346), (' INDUSTR', -1.0206720617134124e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/thiotepa, medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682821.html, pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Thiotepa ', [])"

An analysis of BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines showed the NRAS-mutant cohort to be enriched for targets of amuvatinib, including Axl, c-KIT, and the Axl ligand Gas6. Increasing concentrations of amuvatinib selectively inhibited the growth of NRAS-mutant, but not BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines, an effect associated with induction of S-phase and G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, amuvatinib was noted to either inhibit Axl, AKT, and MAPK signaling or Axl and AKT signaling and to induce a DNA damage response. In three-dimensional cell culture experiments, amuvatinib was cytotoxic against NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines. Thus, we show for the first time that amuvatinib has proapoptotic activity against melanoma cell lines, with selectivity observed for those harboring oncogenic NRAS. Amuvatinib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity that also disrupts DNA damage repair through suppression of homologous recombination protein Rad51. Amuvatinib dry-powder capsules (DPC) showed evidence of activity in early Phase 1 cancer studies but low systemic exposure. The purposes of the studies were to investigate the cause of low exposure, develop, and test an alternative formulation with improved exposure, and establish the dose to be tested in future studies in cancer patients. Three studies were conducted in a total of 58 healthy subjects: a food-effect study using amuvatinib DPC, a single-dose pharmacokinetic study comparing amuvatinib DPC to a new lipid-suspension capsules (LSC), and a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study using amuvatinib LSC. A high-fat meal administered with amuvatinib DPC increased the rate and extent of absorption compared to the Fasted state, a 183 and 118% increase in the mean C(max) and AUC(0-∞) of amuvatinib, respectively. The single-dose pharmacokinetics of amuvatinib LSC resulted in an approximately two-third-fold increased exposure (AUC) compared with amuvatinib DPC. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of the amuvatinib LSC 300 mg administered every 8 h exhibited improved accumulation compared with the 12-h regimens and achieved presumed therapeutic level safely with no serious or severe adverse events reported. No subject discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Amuvatinib LSC, 300 mg every 8 h, is being studied in cancer patients based on the improved exposure and similar safety profile to amuvatinib DPC. A lipid-based formulation approach may be a useful tool for other low aqueous soluble compounds.",Amuvatinib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0013781820889562368), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02326291799545288)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.biocentury.com/article/152193/amuvatinib-development-discontinued,https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/833243d007c84056a1f8498e979b830c,https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-8722-6-92 ', [])"
1556,"('Hydrocortisone buteprate', 'Hydrocortisone probutate', 'Hydrocortisone butyrate propionate', 'Hydrocortisone 17-butyrate 21-propionate', 'Ts 408')","Endogenous, Medical","Hydrocortisone is the name for the hormone cortisol when supplied as a medication. It is a corticosteroid and works as an anti-inflammatory and by immune suppression. Uses include conditions such as adrenocortical insufficiency, adrenogenital syndrome, high blood calcium, thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, asthma, and COPD. It is the treatment of choice for adrenocortical insufficiency. It can be given by mouth, topically, or by injection. Stopping treatment after long-term use should be done slowly. Side effects may include mood changes, increased risk of infection, and edema (swelling). With long-term use, common side effects include osteoporosis, upset stomach, physical weakness, easy bruising, and candidiasis (yeast infections). It is unclear if it is safe for use during pregnancy. Hydrocortisone was patented in 1936 and approved for medical use in 1941. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 202nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Hydrocortisone is the pharmaceutical term for cortisol used in oral administration, intravenous injection, or topical application. It is used as an immunosuppressive drug, given by injection in the treatment of severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema, in place of prednisolone in patients needing steroid treatment but unable to take oral medication, and perioperatively in patients on long-term steroid treatment to prevent an adrenal crisis. It may also be injected into inflamed joints resulting from diseases such as gout. It may be used topically for allergic rashes, eczema, psoriasis, itching, and other inflammatory skin conditions. Topical hydrocortisone creams and ointments are available in most countries without prescription in strengths ranging from 0.05% to 2.5% (depending on local regulations) with stronger forms available by prescription only. It may also be used rectally in suppositories to relieve the swelling, itch, and irritation in hemorrhoids. It may be used as an acetate form (hydrocortisone acetate), which has slightly different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid, acting specifically as both a glucocorticoid and as a mineralocorticoid. That is, it is an agonist of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Hydrocortisone has low potency relative to synthetic corticosteroids. Compared to hydrocortisone, prednisolone is about 4 times as potent and dexamethasone about 40 times as potent in terms of anti-inflammatory effect. Prednisolone can also be used as cortisol replacement, and at replacement dose levels (rather than anti-inflammatory levels), prednisolone is about 8 times more potent than cortisol. The equivalent doses and relative potencies of hydrocortisone compared to various other synthetic corticosteroids have also been reviewed and summarized. The endogenous production rate of cortisol is approximately 5.7 to 9.9 mg/m2 per day, which corresponds to an oral hydrocortisone dose of approximately 15 to 20 mg/day (for a 70-kg person). One review described daily cortisol production of 10 mg in healthy volunteers and reported that daily cortisol production could increase up to 400 mg in conditions of severe stress (e.g., surgery). The total and/or free concentrations of cortisol/hydrocortisone required for various glucocorticoid effects have been determined. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The bioavailability of oral hydrocortisone is about 96% ± 20% (SD). The pharmacokinetics of hydrocortisone are non-linear. The peak level of oral hydrocortisone is 15.3 ± 2.9 (SD) μg/L per 1 mg dose. The time to peak concentrations of oral hydrocortisone is 1.2 ± 0.4 (SD) hours. The topical percutaneous absorption of hydrocortisone varies widely depending on experimental circumstances and has been reported to range from 0.5 to 14.9% in different studies. Some skin application sites, like the scrotum and vulva, absorb hydrocortisone much more efficiently than other application sites, like the forearm. In one study, the amount of hydrocortisone absorbed ranged from 0.2% to 36.2% depending on the application site, with the ball of the foot having the lowest absorption and the scrotum having the highest absorption. The absorption of hydrocortisone by the vulva has ranged from 4.4 to 8.1%, relative to 1.3 to 2.8% for the arm, in different studies and subjects. ==== Distribution ==== Most cortisol in the blood (all but about 4%) is bound to proteins, including corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) and serum albumin. A pharmacokinetic review stated that 92% ± 2% (SD) (92–93%) of hydrocortisone is plasma protein-bound. Free cortisol passes easily through cellular membranes. Inside cells it interacts with corticosteroid receptors. ==== Metabolism ==== Hydrocortisone is metabolized by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11β-HSDs) into cortisone, an inactive metabolite. It is additionally 5α-, 5β-, and 3α-reduced into dihydrocortisols, dihydrocortisones, tetrahydrocortisols, and tetrahydrocortisones. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination half-life of hydrocortisone ranges from about 1.2 to 2.0 (SD) hours, with an average of around 1.5 hours, regardless of oral versus parenteral administration. The duration of action of systemic hydrocortisone has been listed as 8 to 12 hours. == Chemistry == Hydrocortisone, also known as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid. A variety of hydrocortisone esters exist and have been marketed for medical use. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In March 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Efmody, intended for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in people aged twelve years and older. The applicant for this medicinal product is Diurnal Europe BV. Hydrocortisone (Efmody) was approved for medical use in the European Union, in May 2021, for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in people aged twelve years and older. === Anti-competitive practices === In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) concluded an investigation into the supply of hydrocortisone tablets, finding that from October 2008 onwards, drug suppliers Auden McKenzie and Actavis plc had charged ""excessive and unfair prices"" for 10mg and 20mg tablets and entered into agreements with potential competitors, paying companies who agreed not to enter the hydrocortisone market and enabling Auden McKenzie and Actavis to supply the drugs as ""generic"" rather than branded products and thereby escape price controls until eventually other companies entered the market. Auden and Actavis overcharged the UK's National Health Service for over ten years. Fines totalling over £255m were levied against the companies involved in this breach of competition law. == Research == === COVID-19 === Hydrocortisone was found to be effective in reducing mortality rate of critically ill COVID-19 patients when compared to other usual care or a placebo. == References ==",Hydrocortisone probutate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.961759259458631e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.003383627627044916), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), (',', -0.5762448906898499), ('ĠEND', -0.0015248350100591779), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005446380819194019)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/hydrocortisone-probutate-topical-application-route/description/drg-20073749,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocortisone_buteprate,https://www.drugs.com/cons/hydrocortisone-probutate.html ', [])"

The retinoids were administered orally on either day 9 or 13 of gestation. Treatment on day 9 of gestation resulted mainly in malformations of the head and the trunk; whereas, on day 13 limb malformations were prominent. Ro 13-7410 and Ro 13-6298 were about 1000 times more embryotoxic and teratogenic than retinoic acid but induced a similar malformation pattern to retinoic acid. In contrast, the sulfur-containing arotinoid Ro 15-1570 was active at similar dose levels to retinoic acid but caused a peculiar malformation pattern on day 13 of gestation. This finding supports the hypothesis that the arotinoid ethyl sulfone Ro 15-1570 has unique biological properties, inducing no bone toxicity in adult rats and distinctly affecting limb development. Ro 13-7410 was given to 29 patients (a total of 38 treatment courses) for 7.5 weeks (range 4-23). This compound is one of the most potent retinoids ever synthetized and has the highest affinity to human skin cellular retinoic-acid-binding protein. At therapeutically active doses, it did not induce the commonly seen mucocutaneous signs of retinoid toxicity such as scaling and cheilitis; over 0.5 microgram/kg body weight/day, it very frequently induced an eczematous retinoid dermatitis. This pilot study provides some indications on what appears to be in several aspects a drug quite distinct from retinoids previously used in humans. The aromatic retinoid (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthylenyl)-1 -propenyl] benzoic acid (TTNPB) is 1000-fold more potent as a teratogen than all trans-retinoic acid (tRA) in several species and in the inhibition of chondrogenesis in the mouse limb bud cell culture. Factors responsible for the potency of TTNPB were investigated including binding to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs), cytosolic binding proteins (CRABPs), and metabolic disposition of TTNPB. For competitive binding assays and saturation kinetics, nucleosol or cytosol fractions were obtained from COS-1 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding the appropriate nuclear receptor or binding protein. TTNPB binds to RAR alpha, beta, and gamma with Kds in the nanomolar range; however, these binding affinities are 10-fold less than those of tRA. Although the affinities are high for TTNPB, it is unlikely that the binding affinities to nuclear receptors alone account for the potency of TTNPB. The binding affinities of TTNPB for the CRABPs are significantly lower than those of tRA. TTNPB did not compete with [3H]9-cis RA for binding to RXR alpha, beta, or gamma. Mouse limb bud cell cultures, a well characterized model for retinoid teratogenesis, were used to compare the metabolic disposition of TTNPB and tRA. In the media of limb bud cell cultures treated with either retinoid, the disappearance of TTNPB was significantly slower than that of tRA over 72 hr. Both retinoids reached approximately equal concentrations in cell uptake experiments; however, TTNPB disappeared from the limb bud cell at a significantly slower rate than did tRA. Collectively, these results indicate that high affinity binding to RARs, lower affinity to CRABPs, and resistance to metabolism contribute to the potency of TTNPB.",Ro 13-7410,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0430021695792675), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.040435757488012314), ('ICAL', -3.099436753473128e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38689976930618286)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arotinoid_acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=6, title='Arotinoid acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arotinoid_acid?utm_source=openai')])"

Renin is an enzyme produced in the kidneys, and it cleaves circulating angiotensinogen (a protein produced in the liver) to yield angiotensin I, an inactive decapeptide. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), found primarily in the lung, converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, an active vasoconstrictor octapeptide. Angiotensin II also stimulates the production of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, which promotes retention of sodium and water. ACE is also responsible for inactivating bradykinin, a vasodilator (5). RAS and angiotensin II also play a role in interstitial fibrosis, cardiac remodeling and fibrosis, and heart failure (6, 7). It has been shown that RAS operates in the heart, and an upregulation of this system is correlated to heart failure (8-10). Inhibition of ACE in patients with heart failure has often resulted in a favorable outcome for the patient (11), although individuals treated with ACE inhibitors have been reported to respond differently as a result of genetic variations in the enzyme; a meta-analysis of data obtained from children of different races who had been treated with these inhibitors has shown the children reacted differently to the treatment (12, 13). In addition, the proper timing, optimal dosing, and monitoring of ACE inhibitor therapy for the individualized treatment of patients has not been fully worked out. Also, ACE appears to have a role in several other pathological conditions including myeloid leukemia, atherosclerosis, and diabetes (in the kidneys of patients) because an increased level of either the protein or its mRNA has been reported under these conditions (14-16). In a preliminary radioautographic study, Dilsizian et al. showed that ACE expression correlated with the extent of the disease in patients with congestive heart failure and suggested that monitoring ACE expression may help monitor molecular remodeling of the heart (3). On the basis of this observation, Femia et al. envisioned that a radiotracer designed for imaging the RAS would be helpful for the development of individualized ACE inhibitor therapy (17). In this regard, a compound with high affinity for ACE, such as lisinopril or its derivative, would be best suited to study the expression of a radiotracer. Several derivatives of lisinopril that can incorporate rhodium or palladium while maintaining high affinity for ACE were reported and could probably be used to synthesize radiolabeled analogs of the compound (18). Using a single amino acid chelator technology based on the di(pyridylmethyl)amine chelator, Femia et al. synthesized a technetium-carbonyl (Tc(CO) Herein we describe the first structure-activity relationship study of the broad-range iGluR antagonist (2S,3R)-3-(3-carboxyphenyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (1) by exploring the pharmacological effect of substituents in the 4, 4', or 5' positions and the bioisosteric substitution of the distal carboxylic acid for a phosphonic acid moiety. Of particular interest is a hydroxyl group in the 4' position 2a which induced a preference in binding affinity for homomeric GluK3 over GluK1 (Ki = 0.87 and 4.8 μM, respectively). Two X-ray structures of ligand binding domains were obtained: 2e in GluA2-LBD and 2f in GluK1-LBD, both at 1.9 Å resolution. Compound 2e induces a D1-D2 domain opening in GluA2-LBD of 17.3-18.8° and 2f a domain opening in GluK1-LBD of 17.0-17.5° relative to the structures with glutamate. The pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate moiety of 2e and 2f shows a similar binding mode as kainate. The 3-carboxyphenyl ring of 2e and 2f forms contacts comparable to those of the distal carboxylate in kainate. The kainic acid (KA) receptors belong to the class of glutamate (Glu) receptors in the brain and constitute a promising target for the treatment of neurological and/or psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, major depression, and epilepsy. Five KA subtypes have been identified and named GluK1-5. In this article, we present the discovery of (2S,3R)-3-(3-carboxyphenyl)-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (1) based on a rational design process. Target compound 1 was synthesized by a stereoselective strategy in 10 steps from commercially available starting materials. Binding affinities of 1 at native ionotropic Glu receptors were determined to be in the micromolar range (AMPA, 51 μM; KA, 22 μM; NMDA 6 μM), with the highest affinity for cloned homomeric KA receptor subtypes GluK1,3 (3.0 and 8.1 μM, respectively).

It was an intermediate compound in the development of the successful anti-ulcer drug cimetidine (Tagamet). == Development of metiamide from burimamide == After discovering that burimamide is largely inactive at physiological pH, due to the presence of its electron-donating side chain, the following steps were undertaken to stabilize burimamide: addition of a sulfide group close to the imidazole ring, giving thiaburimamide addition of methyl group to the 4-position on the imidazole ring to favor the tautomer of thiaburimamide which binds better to the H2 receptor These changes increased the bioavailability metiamide so that it is ten times more potent than burimamide in inhibiting histamine-stimulated release of gastric acid. The clinical trials that began in 1973 demonstrated the ability of metiamide to provide symptomatic relief for ulcerous patients by increasing healing rate of peptic ulcers. However, during these trials, an unacceptable number of patients dosed with metiamide developed agranulocytosis (decreased white blood cell count). == Modification of metiamide to cimetidine == It was determined that the thiourea group was the cause of the agranulocytosis. Therefore, replacement of the thiocarbonyl in the thiourea group was suggested: with urea or guanidine resulted in a compound with much less activity (only 5% of the potency of metiamide) however, the NH form (the guanidine analog of metiamide) did not show agonistic effects to prevent the guanidine group being protonated at physiological pH, electron-withdrawing groups were added adding a nitrile or nitro group prevented the guanidine group from being protonated and did not cause agranulocytosis The nitro and cyano groups are sufficiently electronegative to reduce the pKa of the neighboring nitrogens to the same acidity of the thiourea group, hence preserving the activity of the drug in a physiological environment. == Synthesis == Reacting ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate (1) with 2 molar equivalents of formamide (2) gives 4-carboethoxy-5-methylimidazole (3). Reduction of the carboxylic ester (3) with sodium in liquid ammonia via Birch reduction gives the corresponding alcohol (4). Reaction of that with cysteamine (mercaptoethylamine), as its hydrochloride, leads to intermediate 5. In the strongly acid medium, the amine is completely protonated; this allows the thiol to express its nucleophilicity without competition and the acid also activates the alcoholic function toward displacement.

It is a hydroxamic acid and acts as a non-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor (pan-HDAC inhibitor). Panobinostat was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2015, and in the European Union in August 2015. However, in March 2022, it was withdrawn in the United States. == Medical uses == Panobinostat is used in combination with the anti-cancer drug bortezomib and the corticoid dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adults who had received at least two previous treatments, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent.: 660 == Contraindications == Panobinostat is contraindicated in nursing mothers. To judge from experiments in animals, there is a risk for the unborn child if used during pregnancy; still, the benefit of panobinostat may outweigh this risk. == Side effects == Common side effects (in more than 10% of patients) include low blood cell counts (pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia), airway infections, as well as unspecific reactions such as fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, and sleeping problems. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Panobinostat inhibits multiple histone deacetylase enzymes, a mechanism leading to apoptosis of malignant cells via multiple pathways. === Pharmacokinetics === Panobinostat is absorbed quickly and almost completely from the gut, but has a significant first-pass effect, resulting in a total bioavailability of 21%. Highest blood plasma levels in patients with advanced cancer are reached after two hours. Plasma protein binding is about 90%. The substance is metabolised mainly through oxidation by the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and to a small extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. It is also reduced, hydrolyzed and glucuronidized by unspecified enzymes. All metabolites seem to be inactive. Biological half-life is estimated to be 37 hours. 29–51% are excreted via the urine and 44–77% via the faeces. === Clinical trials === As of August 2012, it is being tested against Hodgkin's Lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and other types of malignant disease in Phase III clinical trials, against myelodysplastic syndromes, breast cancer and prostate cancer in Phase II trials, and against chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in a Phase I trial. As of 2014 panobinostat is being used in a Phase I/II clinical trial that aims at curing AIDS in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In this technique, panobinostat is used to drive the HIV DNA out of the patient's DNA, in the expectation that the patient's immune system in combination with HAART will destroy it. As of 2016 panobinostat is being studied in a phase II trial for relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). === Preclinical studies === Panobinostat has been found to synergistically act with sirolimus to kill pancreatic cancer cells in the laboratory in a Mayo Clinic study. In the study, investigators found that this combination destroyed up to 65 percent of cultured pancreatic tumor cells. The finding is significant because the three cell lines studied were all resistant to the effects of chemotherapy – as are many pancreatic tumors. Panobinostat has also been found to significantly increase in vitro the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein levels in cells of patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Panobinostat was able to selectively target triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells by inducing hyperacetylation and cell cycle arrest at the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint; partially reversing the morphological changes characteristic of breast cancer cells. Panobinostat, along with other HDAC inhibitors, is also being studied for potential to induce virus HIV-1 expression in latently infected cells and disrupt latency.

It is known for its inflammatory and immunological potentials. This review aims to sketch a current scenario on its therapeutic activities on the basis of scientific reports in the databases. A total 30 articles included in this review suggests that ginkgolide A has many important biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anxiolytic-like, anti-atherosclerosis and anti-atherombosis, neuro- and hepatoprotective effects. There is a lack of its toxicological (e.g. toxicity, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenitcity) profile. In conclusion, ginkgolide A may be one of the potential therapeutic lead compounds, especially for the treatment of cardiovascular, hepatological, and neurological diseases and disorders. More studies are necessary on this hopeful therapeutic agent. Ginkgolide A (GA), a main terpenoid extracted from Ginkgo biloba, possesses biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and liver protection. However, the inhibitory effects of GA on septic cardiomyopathy remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects and mechanisms of GA in countering sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and injury. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model, GA alleviated mitochondrial injury and cardiac dysfunction. GA also significantly reduced the production of inflammatory and apoptotic cells, the release of inflammatory indicators, and the expression of oxidative stress-associated and apoptosis-associated markers, but increased the expression of pivotal antioxidant enzymes in hearts from LPS group. These results were consistent with those of in vitro experiments based on H9C2 cells. Database analysis and molecular docking suggested that FoxO1 was targeted by GA, as shown by stable hydrogen bonds formed between GA with SER-39 and ASN-29 of FoxO1. GA reversed LPS-induced downregulation of nucleus FoxO1 and upregulation of p-FoxO1 in H9C2 cells. FoxO1 knockdown abolished the protective properties of GA in vitro. KLF15, TXN2, NOTCH1, and XBP1, as the downstream genes of FoxO1, also exerted protective effects. We concluded that GA could alleviate LPS-induced septic cardiomyopathy via binding to FoxO1 to attenuate cardiomyocyte inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Ginkgolide A (GA) on chondrocytes under oxidative stress and to elucidate its potential molecular mechanisms. Using a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model in mice and an in vitro osteoarthritis (OA) model induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in chondrocytes, we validated the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of GA. Potential OA targets of GA were identified through network pharmacology, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Further exploration into the effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), apoptosis, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, and Forkhead Box O1 (FoxO1) related pathways was conducted using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, TUNEL staining, flow cytometry, X-ray, micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) analysis, and histological staining. The results demonstrated that GA upregulated FoxO1 expression and inhibited ERS-related signaling pathways, thereby reducing apoptosis and ECM degradation. In conclusion, GA significantly alleviated OA symptoms both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for OA.",Ginkgolide a,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.38749462366104126)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.26069197058677673), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), (',', -0.20145757496356964), ('ĠFOOD', -0.07163504511117935), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014189541339874268)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.018406514078378677)])","('Ginkgolide A is a terpenic lactone found in Ginkgo biloba leaves.

It is a glycylcycline class drug that is administered intravenously. It was developed in response to the growing rate of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and E. coli. As a tetracycline derivative antibiotic, its structural modifications has expanded its therapeutic activity to include Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including those of multi-drug resistance. It was given a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fast-track approval and was approved on 17 June 2005. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in April 2006. It was removed from the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. The World Health Organization classifies tigecycline as critically important for human medicine. == Medical uses == === Antibacterial use === Tigecycline is used to treat different kinds of bacterial infections, including complicated skin and structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Tigecycline is a glycylcycline antibiotic that covers MRSA and Gram-negative organisms: Tigecycline can treat complicated skin and structure infections caused by: Escherichia coli, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus grp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. Tigecycline is indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus anginosus grp., Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus micros. Tigecycline may be used for treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia caused by: penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae that does not produce Beta-lactamase and Legionella pneumophila. Tigecycline is given intravenously and has activity against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, many of which are resistant to existing antibiotics. Tigecycline successfully completed phase III trials in which it was at least equal to intravenous vancomycin and aztreonam to treat complicated skin and skin structure infections, and to intravenous imipenem and cilastatian to treat complicated intra-abdominal infections. Tigecycline is active against many Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes – including activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (with MIC values reported at 2 μg/mL) and multi-drug resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii. It has no activity against Pseudomonas spp. or Proteus spp. The drug is licensed for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. ""Tigecycline is also active against Clostridioides difficile strains. Most C. difficile isolates have MICs <0.25 for tigecycline The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection recommends tigecycline as a potential salvage therapy for severe and/or complicated or refractory Clostridoides difficile infection. Tigecycline can also be used in vulnerable populations such as immunocompromised patients or patients with cancer. === Non-antibacterial use === It is well established that tigecycline works as an effective antibiotic; however, it may have other properties that are not yet fully understood. Minocycline has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, inhibition of proteolysis and suppression of angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. This is a feature not unique to minocycline, with many tetracyclines exhibiting non-antibiotic clinical benefits. Tigecycline has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against acute myeloid leukemia. The antileukemic activity of tigecycline can be attributed to the inhibition of mitochondrial protein translation in eukaryotic cells. Leukemic cells have an increased dependence on mitochondrial function, causing a heightened sensitivity to tigecycline. Tigecycline has also shown anti-cancer properties against several other kinds of tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and glioblastoma. It also shows good activity against the causative agent of pythiosis. === Susceptibility data === Tigecycline targets both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including a few key multi-drug resistant pathogens. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacterial pathogens. Escherichia coli: 0.015 μg/mL — 4 μg/mL Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.06 μg/mL — 16 μg/mL Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant): 0.03 μg/mL — 2 μg/mL Tigecycline generally has poor activity against most strains of Pseudomonas. === Liver or kidney problems === Tigecycline does not require dose adjustment for people with mild to moderate liver problems. However, in people with severe liver problems dosing should be decreased and closely monitored. Tigecycline does not require dose changes in people with poor kidney function or having hemodialysis. === Resistance mechanisms === Bacterial resistance towards tigecycline in Enterobacteriaceae (such as E. coli) is often caused by genetic mutations leading to an up-regulation of bacterial efflux pumps, such as the RND type efflux pump AcrAB. Some bacterial species such as Pseudomonas spp. can be naturally resistant to tigecycline through the constant over-expression of such efflux pumps. In some Enterobacteriaceae species, mutations in ribosomal genes such as rpsJ have been found to cause resistance to tigecycline. == Side effects == As a tetracycline derivative, tigecycline exhibits similar side effects to the class of antibiotics. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are the most common reported side effect. Common side effects of tigecycline include nausea and vomiting. Nausea (26%) and vomiting (18%) tend to be mild or moderate and usually occur during the first two days of therapy. Rare adverse effects (<2%) include: swelling, pain, and irritation at injection site, anorexia, jaundice, hepatic dysfunction, pruritus, acute pancreatitis, and increased prothrombin time. === Precautions === Precaution is needed when taken in individuals with tetracycline hypersensitivity, pregnant women, and children. It has been found to cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and therefore is classified as pregnancy category D. In rats or rabbits, tigecycline crossed the placenta and was found in the fetal tissues, and is associated with slightly lower birth weights as well as slower bone ossification. Even though it was not considered teratogenic, tigecycline should be avoided unless benefits outweigh the risks. In addition, its use during childhood can cause yellow-grey-brown discoloration of the teeth and should not be used unless necessary. More so, there are clinical reports of tigecycline-induced acute pancreatitis, with particular relevance to patients also diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Tigecycline showed an increased mortality in patients treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (a non-approved use), but also in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and diabetic foot infection. Increased mortality was in comparison to other treatment of the same types of infections. The difference was not statistically significant for any type, but mortality was numerically greater for every infection type with Tigecycline treatment, and thus prompted a black box warning by the FDA. === Black box warning === The FDA issued a black box warning in September 2010, for tigecycline regarding an increased risk of death compared to other appropriate treatment. As a result of increase in total death rate (cause is unknown) in individuals taking this drug, tigecycline is reserved for situations in which alternative treatment is not suitable. The FDA updated the black box warning in 2013. === Drug interactions === Tigecycline has been found to interact with medications, such as: Warfarin: Since both tigecycline and warfarin bind to serum or plasma proteins, there is potential for protein-binding interactions, such that one drug will have more effect than the other. Although dose adjustment is not necessary, INR and prothrombin time should be monitored if given concurrently. Oral contraceptives: Effectiveness of oral contraceptives are decreased with concurrent use due to reduction in the concentration levels of oral contraceptives. However, the mechanism behind these drug interactions have not been fully analyzed. == History == Minocycline was a commonly used tetracycline synthesized in Lederle Laboratories in 1970, but antibiotic resistance to the drug began growing in prevalence throughout the 1970s and 1980s. While the problem of antibiotic resistance was known to scientists during the 1980s, apathy led to little federal attention given to the emerging crisis. However, by the late 1980s the worldwide threat began to be treated more seriously, which led to the renewed funding of antibiotic research. In 1993, researchers in the same laboratories that first synthesized minocycline created a new generation of tetracycline antibacterial agents, known as the glycylcyclines. These antibiotics were the first new drugs of the tetracycline class to be reported since the discovery of minocycline in 1970. The glycylcyclines were found to be active against a broad spectrum of tetracycline susceptible and resistant Gram (-) and Gram (+) aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. This initial research resulted in numerous studies being done on the antibacterial activity of various glycylcyclines, with extra focus being put on N,N-dimethylglycyl-amino derivatives, due to their reported potency. The aforementioned research culminated in a 1999 paper describing the discovery of a compound known as GAR-936, which would later be known as Tigecycline. == Mechanism of action == Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that acts as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It exhibits bacteriostatic activity by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria and thereby blocking the interaction of aminoacyl-tRNA with the A site of the ribosome. In addition, tigecycline has demonstrated bactericidal activity against isolates of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila. Studies have shown that tigecycline binds to the 70S ribosome with 5 fold and >100 fold greater affinity than minocycline and tetracycline, respectively . As previously mentioned, tigecycline still binds to the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, however the binding of the novel antibiotic involves substantial interactions with residues of helix H34 of that same subunit. These interactions are not observed in the binding of tetracycline. The findings indicate that tigecycline likely has a unique mechanism of action that prevents inhibition from ribosomal protection. It is a third-generation tetracycline derivative within a class called glycylcyclines which carry a N,N-dimethyglycylamido (DMG) moiety attached to the 9-position of tetracycline ring D. With structural modifications as a 9-DMG derivative of minocycline, tigecycline has been found to improve minimal inhibitory concentrations against Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, when compared to tetracyclines. == Pharmacokinetics == Tigecycline is metabolized through glucuronidation into glucuronide conjugates and a N-acetyl-9-aminominocycline metabolite. Therefore, dose adjustments are needed for patients with severe hepatic impairment. More so, it is primarily eliminated unchanged in the feces and secondarily eliminated by the kidneys. No renal adjustments are necessary. == Society and culture == === Approval === It is approved to treat complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP) in individuals 18 years and older. In the United Kingdom it is approved in adults and in children from the age of eight years for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (excluding diabetic foot infections) and complicated intra-abdominal infections in situations where other alternative antibiotics are not suitable. === Other names === GAR-936 Tygacil Tigeplug (marketed by Biocon, India) Tigilyn (Marketed by Real Value therapy pharmaceuticals company in Myanmar, Manufactured by Lyka) TIGILITE (marketed in INDIA, Scutonix Lifesciences, Bombay) == References ==",Tygacil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2159273865108844e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00026723151677288115)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigecycline,https://www.drugs.com/history/tygacil.html,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tygacil ', [])"

1567,"('Undecylenic acid', 'Undec-10-enoic acid', 'Undecenoic acid', 'Desenex', 'Renselin')","Endogenous, Medical, Personal Care","Miconazole, sold under the brand name Monistat among others, is an antifungal medication used to treat ring worm, pityriasis versicolor, and yeast infections of the skin or vagina. It is used for ring worm of the body, groin (jock itch), and feet (athlete's foot). It is applied to the skin or vagina as a cream or ointment. Common side effects include itchiness or irritation of the area in which it was applied. Use in pregnancy is believed to be safe for the baby. Miconazole is in the imidazole family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to make ergosterol, an important part of their cell membrane. Miconazole was patented in 1968 and approved for medical use in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Miconazole is used externally for the treatment of ringworm, jock itch, and athlete's foot. Internal application is used for oral candidiasis or vaginal thrush (yeast infection). == Side effects == Miconazole is generally well tolerated. The oral gel can cause dry mouth, nausea and an unpleasant taste in about 1–10% of people. Anaphylactic reactions are rare. The drug prolongs the QT interval. == Interactions == Miconazole is partly absorbed in the intestinal tract when used orally, as with the oral gel, and possibly when used vaginally. This can lead to increased concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, because miconazole inhibits these enzymes. Such interactions occur for example with anticoagulants of the warfarin type, phenytoin, some newer atypical antipsychotics, ciclosporin, and most statins used to treat hypercholesterolemia. These interactions are not relevant for miconazole that is applied to the skin. == Contraindications == Miconazole is contraindicated for people who use certain drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4, for the reasons mentioned above: drugs that also prolong the QT interval because of potential problems with the heart rhythm ergot alkaloids statins triazolam and oral midazolam sulfonamides with a potential to cause hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Miconazole inhibits the fungal enzyme 14α-sterol demethylase, resulting in a reduced production of ergosterol. In addition to its antifungal actions, miconazole, similarly to ketoconazole, is known to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor. === Pharmacokinetics === After application to the skin, miconazole can be measured in the skin for up to four days, but less than 1% is absorbed into the bloodstream. When applied to the oral mucosa (and possibly also for vaginal use), it is significantly absorbed. In the bloodstream, 88.2% are bound to plasma proteins and 10.6% to blood cells. The substance is partly metabolized via the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and mainly eliminated via the faeces. == Chemistry == The solubilities of miconazole nitrate powder are 0.03% in water, 0.76% in ethanol and up to 4% in acetic acid. Miconazole crystallises as colourless prisms in the monoclinic space group P21/c. == Other uses == Miconazole is also used in Ektachrome film developing in the final rinse of the Kodak E-6 process and similar Fuji CR-56 process, replacing formaldehyde. Fuji Hunt also includes miconazole as a final rinse additive in their formulation of the C-41RA rapid access color negative developing process. == Brands and formulations == Oral treatment: (brand names Daktarin in UK, Fungimin Oral Gel in Bangladesh): In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Oravig (miconazole) buccal tablets for the local treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, more commonly known as thrush, in adults and children age 16 and older.

In addition to its progestagenic activity, medroxyprogesterone is a weak antiandrogen in vitro on human androgen receptor. == Chemistry == Medroxyprogesterone, also known as 6α-methyl-17α-hydroxyprogesterone or as 6α-methyl-17α-hydroxypregn-4-en-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a methyl group at the C6α position. The generic name of medroxyprogesterone is a contraction of 6α-methyl-17α-hydroxyprogesterone. It is closely related to medrogestone as well as other unesterified 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone, cyproterone, and megestrol. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Medroxyprogesterone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name.

1569,"('Capreomycin (sulfate)',)",Medical," Capreomycin has good clinical utility to treat multidrug resistant tuberculosis, but it is only used as a second line drug due to its adverse reactions. Literature has demonstrated that the toxicity of capreomycin product is significantly influenced by the impurities in it. Unfortunately, so far, no one impurity in capreomycin has ever been isolated and definitely identified due to its extremely strong basic character and high polarity. An ion-pair method reported in literature can provide separation of capreomycin and its impurities, but it is hard to be used for the preparative purpose. In this study, this ion-pair method was further improved to detect more impurities in capreomycin sulfate substance. Besides the four main components (IA, IB, IIA and IIB), four impurities (impurity A-D) with their contents much higher than the identification threshold were observed. Furthermore, a two dimensional (2D) LC quadrupole-time of flight (Q-TOF) MS method was established to realize high resolution MS analysis of these impurities. For the purpose of preparative isolation, a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) method was established. The four main components were well isolated, but unfortunately, the four impurities were co-eluted with each other or with IB by the HILIC method. Fortunately, the degradation experiments revealed that IA and IB could yield clean impurity A and B respectively in acidic medium, and can yield clean impurity D and C respectively in alkaline medium. Therefore, IA and IB were first isolated by the preparative HILIC method, then pure IA and IB underwent acid degradation and base degradation separately and followed by re-isolation by the HILIC method to obtain pure impurity A-D respectively. Based on Q-TOF MS and NMR analysis, the structures (including absolute configuration) of the four isolated impurities were definitely identified. The aim of this work was the investigation of the effects of preparation variables on drug content for the development of capreomycin sulfate (CS) liposomal formulations as potential aerosol antitubercular agents. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), hydrogenated phosphatidylcholine (HPC) and distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) were used for liposome preparation. A freeze-thawing method was chosen for CS encapsulation. Peptide entrapment, size and morphology were evaluated by UV spectrophotometry, photocorrelation spectroscopy (PCS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. A 2(3) full factorial protocol was designed to evaluate the conditions for CS encapsulation improvement. Peptide content ranged between 1 and 8%. Vesicles showed a narrow size distribution, with average diameters around 1 microm and a good morphology. A mathematical model was generated for each liposomal system and check point analyses revealed good agreement between experimental and predicted values. DPPC liposomes were found to provide the highest CS content. Peptide content was successfully increased by assessing formulation variable effects using a 2(3) factorial design that proved to be a time saving method helpful in developing new CS liposomal formulations for a possible application in aerosol antitubercular therapies.",Capreomycin (sulfate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.486063259420916e-05), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031867455691099167)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/capreomycin-injection-route/description/drg-20062507?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=144, start_index=9, title='Capreomycin (injection route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/capreomycin-injection-route/description/drg-20062507?utm_source=openai')])"
1570,"('Canavanine sulfate', 'Canavanine', 'Canavanin', 'O-((aminoiminomethyl)amino)-l-homoserine', 'O-((aminoiminomethyl)amino)homoserine')",Medical,"L-(+)-(S)-Canavanine is a non-proteinogenic amino acid found in certain leguminous plants. It is structurally related to the proteinogenic α-amino acid L-arginine, the sole difference being the replacement of a methylene bridge (−CH2− unit) in arginine with an oxa group (i.e., an oxygen atom) in canavanine. Canavanine is accumulated primarily in the seeds of the organisms which produce it, where it serves both as a highly deleterious defensive compound against herbivores (due to cells mistaking it for arginine) and a vital source of nitrogen for the growing embryo. The related L-canaline is similar to ornithine. == Toxicity == The mechanism of canavanine's toxicity is that organisms that consume it typically mistakenly incorporate it into their own proteins in place of L-arginine, thereby producing structurally aberrant proteins that may not function properly. Cleavage by arginase also produces canaline, a potent insecticide. The toxicity of canavanine may be enhanced under conditions of protein starvation, and canavanine toxicity, resulting from consumption of Hedysarum alpinum seeds with a concentration of 1.2% canavanine weight/weight, has been implicated in the death of a malnourished Christopher McCandless. (McCandless was the subject of Jon Krakauer's book (and subsequent movie) Into the Wild). === In mammals === NZB/W F1, NZB, and DBA/2 mice fed L-canavanine develop a syndrome similar to systemic lupus erythematosus, while BALB/c mice fed a steady diet of protein containing 1% canavanine showed no change in lifespan. Alfalfa seeds and sprouts contain L-canavanine. The L-canavanine in alfalfa has been linked to lupus-like symptoms in primates, including humans, and other auto-immune diseases. Often stopping consumption reverses the problem. == Tolerance == Some specialized herbivores tolerate L-canavanine either because they metabolize it efficiently (cf. L-canaline) or avoid its incorporation into their own nascent proteins. === By metabolic detoxification === Herbivores may be able to metabolize canavanine efficiently. The beetle Caryedes brasiliensis is able to break canavanine down to canaline, then further detoxifies canaline by reductive deamination to form homoserine and ammonia. As a result, the beetle not only tolerates the chemical, but uses it as a source of nitrogen to synthesize its other amino acids to allow it to develop. === By selectivity === An example of this ability can be found in the larvae of the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens, which can tolerate large (lethal concentration 50 or LC50 300 mM) amounts of dietary canavanine. These larvae fastidiously avoid incorporation of L-canavanine into their nascent proteins due to gastrointestinal expression of canavanine hydrolase, an enzyme that cleaves L-canavanine into L-homoserine and hydroxyguanidine, and L-arginine kinase, which phosphorylates L-canavanine. In contrast, larvae of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta can only tolerate tiny amounts (1.0 microgram per kilogram of fresh body weight) of dietary canavanine because their arginine-tRNA ligase has little, if any, discriminatory capacity. No one has examined experimentally the arginine-tRNA synthetase of these organisms. But comparative studies of the incorporation of radiolabeled L-arginine and L-canavanine have shown that in Manduca sexta, the ratio of incorporation is about 3 to 1. Dioclea megacarpa seeds contain high levels of canavanine. The beetle Caryedes brasiliensis is able to tolerate this however as it has the most highly discriminatory arginine-tRNA ligase known (as of 1982). In this insect, the level of radiolabeled L-canavanine incorporated into newly synthesized proteins is barely measurable. Moreover, this beetle uses canavanine as a nitrogen source (see above). == See also == Canaline Arginine == References == == Bibliography == Rosenthal, Gerald A. (1986).

1572,"('Tolperisone (hydrochloride)', 'Tolperisone', 'Mydeton', 'Mydocalm', 'Mideton')",Medical,"Tolperisone (trade name Mydocalm among others) is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant used for the treatment of increased muscle tone associated with neurological diseases. It has been used since the 1960s. == Medical uses == Tolperisone is indicated for use in the treatment of pathologically increased tone of the skeletal muscle caused by neurological diseases (damage of the pyramidal tract, multiple sclerosis, myelopathy, encephalomyelitis) and of spastic paralysis and other encephalopathies manifested with muscular dystonia. Other possible uses include: Spondylosis Spondylarthrosis Cervical and lumbar syndromes Arthrosis of the large joints Obliterating atherosclerosis of the extremity vessels (Peripheral arterial disease) Diabetic angiopathy Thromboangiitis obliterans Raynaud's syndrome Painful reflex muscular spasm, contraction & rigidity Acrocyanosis Tension headache == Contraindications and cautions == Manufacturers report that tolperisone should not be used in patients with myasthenia gravis. Only limited data are available regarding the safety in children, youths, during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is not known whether tolperisone is excreted into mother's milk. In 2012, following concerns about safety and efficacy, an ""article 31 referral"" was triggered at the European Medicines Agency (EMA). After the review and a subsequent re-examination, the Agency concluded that the benefits of tolperisone-containing medicines given orally continue to outweigh their risks. However, there is weak support for tolperisone's efficacy, specifically due to the prevalence of hypersensitivity symptoms such as flushing, rash, severe skin itchiness (with raised lumps), wheezing, difficulty breathing and swallowing, fast heartbeat, and fast decrease in blood pressure (basically anaphylaxis). The EMA recommends that tolperisone use be restricted to the treatment of adults with post-stroke spasticity (stiffness). The EMA also advises cessation of advertising, only using tolperisone orally, updating patient information leaflets, and changing to another medicine for existing users. == Side effects == Adverse effects occur in fewer than 1% of patients and include muscle weakness, headache, arterial hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and dry mouth. All effects are reversible. Allergic reactions occur in fewer than 0.1% of patient and include skin rash, hives, Quincke's edema, and in some cases anaphylactic shock. == Overdose == Excitability has been noted after ingestion of high doses by children. In suicide studies of three isolated cases, it is believed that ingestion of tolperisone was the cause of death. == Interactions == Tolperisone does not have a significant potential for interactions with other pharmaceutical drugs. It cannot be excluded that combination with other centrally acting muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may make a dose reduction necessary in some patients. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tolperisone is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that acts at the reticular formation in the brainstem by blocking voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. === Pharmacokinetics === Tolperisone is absorbed nearly completely from the gut and reaches its peak blood plasma concentration after 1.5 hours. It is extensively metabolised in the liver and kidneys. The substance is excreted via the kidneys in two phases; the first with a half-life of two hours, and the second with a half-life of 12 hours. == Chemistry == Tolperisone is a piperidine derivative. == Society and culture == Tolperisone was developed in the 1960s in Hungary. === Brand names === Brand names include Biocalm, Miderizone, Mydeton, Mydocalm, Mydoflex, Myolax, Myoxan, Tolson, Topee, and Viveo. == See also == Chemically and mechanistically related drugs: Eperisone Inaperisone Lanperisone Silperisone == References ==",Mydocalm,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.0040289857424796e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007179781678132713)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolperisone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Tolperisone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolperisone?utm_source=openai')])"
1573,"('Praziquantel', 'Biltricide', 'Droncit', 'Pyquiton', 'Cesol')",Medical,"Praziquantel, sold under the brandname Biltricide among others, is a medication used to treat a number of types of parasitic worm infections in mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish. In humans specifically, it is used to treat schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis, opisthorchiasis, tapeworm infections, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, paragonimiasis, fasciolopsiasis, and fasciolosis. It should not be used for worm infections of the eye. It is taken by mouth. Side effects in humans may include poor coordination, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and allergic reactions. While it may be used during pregnancy, it is not recommended for use during breastfeeding. Praziquantel is in the anthelmintic class of medications. It works partly by affecting the function of the worm's sucker. Praziquantel was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Praziquantel is used to treat diseases caused by infection with several types of internal/gastrointestinal, and external parasites, including: Hydatid disease caused by infection of various organs with larval stages of tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus Cysticercosis caused by infection of the brain and/or muscles with the eggs and larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium (though it has been judged less effective than albendazole in treatment of neurocysticercosis) Taeniasis caused by intestinal infection with Taenia saginata and Taenia solium Diphyllobothriasis caused by intestinal infection with Diphyllobothrium latum Hymenolepiasis caused by Hymenolepis nana and Hymenolepis diminuta Bertielliasis caused by intestinal infection with Bertiella studeri In dogs and cats, whose gastrointestinal tracts are infected with the tapeworms Dipylidium caninum or Taenia taeniaeformis, respectively; praziquantel is also often used in fixed combination with pyrantel embonate against the roundworms (ascarids): Toxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina. Praziquantel is also effective against Echinococcus multilocularis. Schistosomiasis caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma: As of 2005, praziquantel is the primary treatment for human schistosomiasis, for which it is usually effective in a single dose. Clonorchiasis brought on by the Chinese liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis Opisthorchiasis brought on by the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini and Opisthorchis felineus Paragonimiasis caused by infection with lung flukes, mostly of the species Paragonimus westermani Fasciolopsiasis caused by the giant intestinal fluke Fasciolopsis buski Echinostomiasis caused by infection with intestinal flukes of the genus Echinostoma Metagonimiasis caused by infection with intestinal flukes of the genus Metagonimus Heterophyiasis caused by the intestinal fluke Heterophyes heterophyes Gastrodiscoidiasis caused by the intestinal fluke Gastrodiscoides hominis == Side effects == The majority of side effects develop due to the release of the contents of the parasites as they are killed and the consequent host immune reaction. The heavier the parasite burden, the heavier and more frequent the side effects normally are. Central nervous system (CNS): Frequently occurring side effects are dizziness, headache, and malaise. Drowsiness, somnolence, fatigue, and vertigo have also been seen. Almost all patients with cerebral cysticercosis experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, seizures, arachnoiditis, and meningism). These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of corticosteroids. All patients with cerebral cysticercosis are strongly recommended to be hospitalized during treatment. Gastrointestinal tract: About 90% of all patients have abdominal pain or cramps with or without nausea and vomiting. Diarrhea may develop and may be severe with colic. Sweating, fever, and sometimes bloody stools may occur together with diarrhea. Liver: Asymptomatic and transient increases of liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are noted frequently (up to 27%). No case of symptomatic liver damage has been seen so far. Sensitivity reactions: Urticaria, rash, pruritus and eosinophilia in white blood cell counts Other locations/body as a whole: Lower back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, sweating, various cardiac arrhythmias, and hypotension === Pregnancy === The WHO states praziquantel is safe during pregnancy (although does not recommend use during the first trimester). Animal studies have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm. Praziquantel is effective in reducing schistosomiasis during pregnancy. Another trial found that treatment with praziquantel did not increase the rates of low birthweight, fetal death, or congenital anomalies. == Drug interactions == The antibiotic rifampicin decreases plasma concentrations of praziquantel. Carbamazepine and phenytoin are reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Chloroquine also reduces its bioavailability. The drug cimetidine heightens praziquantel bioavailability. == Mechanism of action == The drug's mode of action is not exactly known at present, but experimental evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of schistosome cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites' muscle, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction (phagocytosis). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites. Another hypothesis regarding the mechanism of action is that it interferes with adenosine uptake in worms. This effect may have therapeutical relevance given that the schistosome, as the Taenia and the Echinococcus (other praziquantel-sensitive parasites), is unable to synthesize purines, such as adenosine, de novo. Bayer's Animal Health Division website states, ""Praziquantel is active against cestodes (tapeworms). Praziquantel is absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the bile. Upon entering the digestive tract from the bile, cestocidal activity is exhibited. Following exposure to praziquantel, the tapeworm loses its ability to resist digestion by the mammalian host. Because of this, whole tapeworms, including the scolices (plural of ""scolex""), are very rarely passed after administration of praziquantel. In many instances, only disintegrated and partially digested pieces of tapeworms will be seen in the stool. The majority of tapeworms are digested and are not found in the feces."" Praziquantel is administered as a racemate, but only the (R)-enantiomer is biologically active; the enantiomers may be separated using a resolution of an amine obtained from praziquantel. == Pharmacokinetics == Praziquantel is well absorbed (about 80%) from the gastrointestinal tract. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, only a relatively small amount enters systemic circulation. Praziquantel has a serum half-life of 0.8 to 1.5 hours in adults with normal renal and liver function. Metabolites have a half-life of 4 to 5 hours. In patients with significantly impaired liver function (Child-Pugh score B and C), the serum half-life is increased to 3 to 8 hours. Praziquantel and its metabolites are mainly excreted renally; within 24 h after a single oral dose, 70 to 80% is found in urine, but less than 0.1% as the unchanged drug. Praziquantel is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 pathway via CYP3A4. Agents that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 such as phenytoin, rifampin, and azole antifungals will affect the metabolism of praziquantel. Praziquantel has a particularly dramatic effect on patients with schistosomiasis. Studies of those treated have shown that within six months of receiving a dose of praziquantel, up to 90% of the damage done to internal organs due to schistosomiasis infection can be reversed. == History == Praziquantel was developed in the laboratories for parasitological research of Bayer AG and Merck KGaA in Germany (Elberfeld and Darmstadt) in the mid-1970s. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Biltricide (Bayer) Tablets (for human use) Cesol (Merck) Tablets Cestoved (Vedco) both tablets and injectable for veterinary use Cysticide (Merck) Tablets Distocide (Shin Poong Pharm.

1575,"('Sarcosine', 'N-methylglycine', 'Sarcosin', 'Methylglycine', 'Sarcosinic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Sarcosine, also known as N-methylglycine, or monomethylglycine, is a amino acid with the formula CH3N(H)CH2CO2H. It exists at neutral pH as the zwitterion CH3N+(H)2CH2CO2−, which can be obtained as a white, water-soluble powder. Like some amino acids, sarcosine converts to a cation at low pH and an anion at high pH, with the respective formulas CH3N+(H)2CH2CO2H and CH3N(H)CH2CO2−. Sarcosine is a close relative of glycine, with a secondary amine in place of the primary amine. Sarcosine is ubiquitous in biological materials. It is used in manufacturing biodegradable surfactants and toothpastes as well as in other applications. It is also a reagent in organic synthesis. Sarcosine is sweet to the taste. == Biochemistry == Sarcosine is an intermediate and byproduct in glycine synthesis and degradation. Sarcosine is metabolized to glycine by the enzyme sarcosine dehydrogenase, while glycine-N-methyl transferase generates sarcosine from glycine. Sarcosine is an amino acid derivative that is naturally found in muscles and other body tissues. In the laboratory, it may be synthesized from chloroacetic acid and methylamine. Sarcosine is an intermediate in the metabolism of choline to glycine. Sarcosine, like the related compounds dimethylglycine (DMG) and trimethylglycine (betaine, TMG), is formed via the metabolism of nutrients such as choline and methionine, which both contain methyl groups used in a wide range of biochemical reactions. Sarcosine is rapidly degraded to glycine, which, in addition to its importance as a constituent of protein, plays a significant role in various physiological processes as a prime metabolic source of components of living cells such as glutathione, creatine, purines and serine. The concentration of sarcosine in blood serum of normal human subjects is 1.4 ± 0.6 micromolar. == Industrial synthesis == Sarcosine can be produced industrially via the Strecker amino acid synthesis. == Surfactants == A variety of surfactants are produced from sarcosine, for instance sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. == Schizophrenia == Early evidence suggests sarcosine is an effective and well-tolerated adjuvant to many antipsychotics except clozapine for the treatment of schizophrenia, showing significant reductions in both positive and negative symptoms. == Prostate cancer == Sarcosine has also been debated as a biomarker for prostate cancer cells. More recent research has suggested that sarcosine plays an active role in the progression of prostate cancer, as addition of sarcosine to prostate epithelial cells caused the emergence of a new invasive phenotype. == History == Sarcosine was first isolated and named by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1847. Jacob Volhard first synthesized it in 1862 while working in the lab of Hermann Kolbe. Prior to the synthesis of sarcosine, it had long been known to be a hydrolysis product of creatine, a compound found in meat extract. Under this assumption, by preparing the compound with methylamine and monochloroacetic acid, Volhard proved that sarcosine was N-methylglycine. == See also == Glycine Dimethylglycine Trimethylglycine Oncometabolism == References ==",Methylglycine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.0014153540832921863), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00017994173686020076), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -0.2585716247558594), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' PERSONAL', -0.1904550939798355), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -3.5597102396423e-05), (' INDUSTR', -0.47410181164741516), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0009122979827225208), (' MED', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL, FOOD', [('EN', -0.6253176331520081), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -6.437280717364047e-06), ('OUS', -2.3841830625315197e-06), (',', -7.521823135903105e-05), ('ĠINDU', -0.30244922637939453), ('ST', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.000715714821126312), ('ĠMED', -0.2630006968975067), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.25205087661743164), ('ĠFOOD', -0.2527608871459961), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5761861801147461)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.001568545587360859), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.004078401252627373), (' FOOD', -5.080963092041202e-06)])","('ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE; ([kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/C00213?utm_source=openai), [patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/FR3101776A1/en?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=180, start_index=27, title='KEGG COMPOUND: C00213', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/C00213?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=180, start_index=27, title='FR3101776A1 - New cosmetic use of N-methylglycine to increase the diversity of skin microbial flora - Google Patents', type='url_citation', url='https://patents.google.com/patent/FR3101776A1/en?utm_source=openai')])"

1578,"('(¬±)-naringenin', 'Naringenin', 'Naringetol', 'Salipurpol', 'Naringenine')","Food, Medical","Naringenin is a flavanone from the flavonoid group of polyphenols. It is commonly found in citrus fruits, especially as the predominant flavonone in grapefruit. The fate and biological functions of naringenin in vivo are unknown, remaining under preliminary research, as of 2024. High consumption of dietary naringenin is generally regarded as safe, mainly due to its low bioavailability. Taking dietary supplements or consuming grapefruit excessively may impair the action of anticoagulants and increase the toxicity of various prescription drugs. Similar to furanocoumarins present in citrus fruits, naringenin may evoke CYP3A4 suppression in the liver and intestines, possibly resulting in adverse interactions with common medications. == Structure == Naringenin has the skeleton structure of a flavanone with three hydroxy groups at the 4′, 5, and 7 carbons. It may be found both in the aglycol form, naringenin, or in its glycosidic form, naringin, which has the addition of the disaccharide neohesperidose attached via a glycosidic linkage at carbon 7. Like the majority of flavanones, naringenin has a single chiral center at carbon 2, although the optical purity is variable. Racemization of (S)-(−)-naringenin has been shown to occur fairly quickly. == Sources and bioavailability == Naringenin and its glycoside has been found in a variety of herbs and fruits, including grapefruit, oranges, and lemons, sour orange, sour cherries, tomatoes, cocoa, Greek oregano, water mint, as well as in beans. Ratios of naringenin to naringin vary among sources, as do enantiomeric ratios. The naringenin-7-glucoside form seems less bioavailable than the aglycol form. Grapefruit juice can provide much higher plasma concentrations of naringenin than orange juice. Naringenin can be absorbed from cooked tomato paste. There are 3.8 mg of naringenin in 150 grams of tomato paste. == Biosynthesis and metabolism == Naringenin can be produced from naringin by the hydrolytic action of the liver enzyme naringinase. Naringenin is derived from malonyl-CoA and 4-coumaroyl-CoA. The latter is derived from phenylalanine. The resulting tetraketide is acted on by chalcone synthase to give the chalcone that then undergoes ring-closure to naringenin. The enzyme naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase uses dimethylallyl diphosphate and (−)-(2S)-naringenin to produce diphosphate and 8-prenylnaringenin. Cunninghamella elegans, a fungal model organism of the mammalian metabolism, can be used to study the naringenin sulfation. == Metabolic fate and research == The fate and biological roles of naringenin are difficult to study because naringenin is rapidly metabolized in the intestine and liver, and its metabolites are destined for excretion. The biological activities of naringenin metabolites are unknown, and likely to be different in structure and function from those of the parent compound. == References ==",Naringenin,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -1.4021237802808173e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INFO', [('FO', -0.0011098184622824192), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.2519916892051697), ('ĠINFO', -0.5663522481918335), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002687808300834149)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25501296/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naringenin,https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Medicine_and_healthcare/Pharmaceutical_medicine/Naringenin/ ', [])"

It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

Because of its potent in vitro effects and promising preclinical activity in colorectal cancer animal models, it was designated a high-priority compound for further drug development by the NCI. In 1993, 9-AC first entered clinical trials as a 72-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion. Predictable myelosuppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity, and pharmacokinetic studies showed a relatively short plasma half-life and unstable lactone ring. Unfortunately, phase II studies using this schedule showed minimal or no activity in tumors such as colorectal and lung cancer. Modest activity was observed in ovarian cancer and in refractory lymphomas. Efforts to improve systemic drug exposure by utilizing alternative schedules of administration of 9-AC such as prolonged, continuous intravenous infusions have also been tested. However, phase II studies of 120-hour weekly infusions of 9-AC have not shown improved activity against solid tumors such as colorectal cancer. More recently, a daily times 5 days i.v. administration schedule has been tested. Currently, further development of intravenously administered 9-AC for the treatment of colorectal cancer is not promising. Thus, topotecan and irinotecan remain the only two successfully developed topoisomerase I-targeting drugs in the United States. This experience with 9-AC raises important questions regarding how to best select new topoisomerase I-targeting drugs for future clinical development. Preclinical studies have demonstrated differences in potency, solubility, and tumor specific activity among the camptothecin (CPT) analogues. 9-Aminocamptothecin (9-AC) has demonstrated greater potency in animal studies than other clinically available Topoisomerase I (Topo I) inhibitors. We sought to determine: (a) if 9-AC enhanced the lethal effects of ionizing radiation to a greater extent than other Topo I inhibitors; and (b) the biological and biochemical characteristics of the enhancement. Quiescent radioresistant human melanoma (U1-Mel) cells were x-irradiated (1-7 Gy) and exposed to various concentrations of 9-AC (0.1-100 microM), either before (for 4 h), during, or after (for 4 h) irradiation. Survival was determined via colony forming assays and normalized to correct for drug cytotoxicity. The effect of 9-AC on radiation-related potential lethal damage repair PLDR) (PLDR) was also measured. A modification of the SDS-KCl assay was used to quantify DNA-Topo I complexes. Enhancement of radiation lethality was observed using confluent U1-Mel cells. The sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) after a 4 h postirradiation exposure of 10 microM 9-AC was 2.5 at 10% survival. Toxicity from the drug alone was greater than topotecan (TPT), but less than CPT. The radiation synergy effect was: (a) dependent on drug concentration (> or = 2 microM); (b) dependent on timing, with enhancement present only when the drug was present at the time of, or shortly after, radiation; and (c) irreversible, with inhibition of PLDR. Exposure to 9-AC during or after irradiation substantially elevated the number of DNA-Topo I complexes (four- to tenfold) over control levels and correlated with enhanced loss of survival. 9-Aminocamptothecin enhanced radiation lethality in vitro at low drug concentrations with characteristics similar to other Topo I inhibitors. A greater SER, but greater lethality with the drug alone, was obtained in comparison to TPT. The clinical implications of these findings remain unexplored.",Aminocamptothecin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.04300056770443916), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0011462554102763534), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029757244512438774)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0206720617134124e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11193898/?utm_source=openai), [ascopubs.org](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1236?utm_source=openai), [annalsofoncology.org](https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534%2819%2948207-0/fulltext?utm_source=openai), [ascopubs.org](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.1997.15.8.2905?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=395, start_index=6, title='The clinical development of 9-aminocamptothecin', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11193898/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=395, start_index=6, title='Phase I and pharmacologic study of 9-aminocamptothecin given by 72-hour infusion in adult cancer patients. | Journal of Clinical Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1236?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=395, start_index=6, title='A phase II study of 9-aminocamptothecin in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer - Annals of Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.annalsofoncology.org/article/S0923-7534%2819%2948207-0/fulltext?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=395, start_index=6, title='Phase II trial of 9-aminocamptothecin administered as a 72-hour continuous infusion in metastatic colorectal carcinoma. | Journal of Clinical Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.1997.15.8.2905?utm_source=openai')])"

1586,"('Verdiperstat', 'Verdiperstat [usan]', 'Verdiperstat (usan/inn)', 'Verdiperstat (azd3241)', 'Ex-a3205')",Medical," Verdiperstat, a myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor, is a well-known drug used for the treatment of multisystem atrophy. However, its therapeutic effect on acute lung injury (ALI) remains to be elucidated. In this study, the effect of verdiperstat on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced two-hit rat ALI model was studied in vivo. Subsequently, to explore the anti-ALI mechanism of verdiperstat, an LPS-induced injury in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMs) was studied in vitro. The continuous administration of verdiperstat at 120 mg/kg for 3 days exerted a protective effect on the LPS-induced two-hit rat ALI model, as reflected by the change in the lung coefficient and lung pathology scores from 0.72 to 0.61 and 6.08 to 4.37, respectively. Furthermore, the values of protective adhesion protein VE-cadherin and tight junction protein claudin 5 changed from 0.42 to 0.97 and 0.25 to 0.72, but MPO, the ratio of N-μ-calpain to μ-calpain, and the distribution of β-catenin in the nucleus changed from 3.04 to 2.17, 0.62 to 0.38 and 2.25 to 0.76, respectively. LPS-induced HMs in vitro also showed similar results, including lower MPO and the distribution of β-catenin in the nucleus, but higher VE-cadherin claudin 5 and N-μ-calpain. Moreover, MPO inhibition resulted in lower μ-calpain activation and lower β-catenin in the nucleus. Our cumulative results suggest that verdiperstat alleviates ALI by strengthening VE-cadherin and claudin 5 through the inhibition of MPO/μ-calpain/β-catenin activation. Myeloperoxidase is one of the most abundant peroxidase enzymes in activated myeloid cells. Myeloperoxidase inhibitors may have a clinical benefit in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by slowing neurodegeneration via reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. To determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of verdiperstat, a selective myeloperoxidase inhibitor, in ALS. Verdiperstat was tested as a regimen of the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a multicenter, double-blind, perpetual platform design, randomized clinical trial, with sharing of trial infrastructure and placebo data across multiple regimens. The study was conducted at 54 ALS referral centers across the US from July 2020 to April 2022. Adult participants with a diagnosis of clinically possible, probable, laboratory-supported probable, or definite ALS defined by the revised El Escorial criteria were randomized to verdiperstat or regimen-specific placebo. An additional group of participants concurrently randomized to placebo from other regimens was included in the analyses. Eligible participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive oral verdiperstat, 600 mg, twice daily or matching placebo for a planned placebo-controlled duration of 24 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was change from baseline through week 24 in disease severity, as measured by a joint model of ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised and survival, with the treatment effect quantified by the disease rate ratio (DRR), with DRR less than 1 indicating a slowing in disease progression of verdiperstat relative to placebo. A total of 167 participants (mean [SD] age, 58.5 [11.4] years; 59 [35.3%] female; 108 [64.6%] male) were randomized to either verdiperstat (126 [75.4%]) or to placebo (41 [25.6%]). Among the participants randomized to the verdiperstat regimen, 130 (78%) completed the trial. The estimated DRR was 0.98 (95% credible interval, 0.77-1.24; posterior probability = 0.57 for slowing of disease progression [DRR <1]). Verdiperstat was estimated to slow progression by 2% vs placebo (95% credible interval, -23% to 24%; posterior probability 0.57). Verdiperstat was overall safe and well tolerated. Common adverse events in the verdiperstat group were nausea, insomnia, and elevated thyrotropin levels.
