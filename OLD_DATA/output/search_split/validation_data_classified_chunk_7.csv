696,"('Onvansertib', 'Onvansertib free base', 'Onvansertib (usan)', 'Onvansertib [usan]', 'Ex-a1590')",Medical," Onvansertib is a highly specific inhibitor of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), with demonstrated safety in solid tumors. We evaluated, preclinically and clinically, the potential of onvansertib in combination with chemotherapy as a therapeutic option for KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. Preclinical activity of onvansertib was assessed (i) in vitro in KRAS wild-type and -mutant isogenic colorectal cancer cells and (ii) in vivo, in combination with irinotecan, in a KRAS-mutant xenograft model. Clinically, a phase Ib trial was conducted to investigate onvansertib at doses 12, 15, and 18 mg/m2 (days 1-5 and 14-19 of a 28-day cycle) in combination with FOLFIRI/bevacizumab (days 1 and 15) in patients with KRAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer who had prior oxaliplatin exposure. Safety, efficacy, and changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were assessed. In preclinical models, onvansertib displayed superior activity in KRAS-mutant than wild-type isogenic colorectal cancer cells and demonstrated potent antitumor activity in combination with irinotecan in vivo. Eighteen patients enrolled in the phase Ib study. Onvansertib recommended phase II dose was established at 15 mg/m2. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AE) represented 15% of all treatment-related AEs, with neutropenia being the most common. Partial responses were observed in 44% of patients, with a median duration of response of 9.5 months. Early ctDNA dynamics were predictive of treatment efficacy. Onvansertib combined with FOLIFRI/bevacizumab exhibited manageable safety and promising efficacy in second-line treatment of patients with KRAS-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. Further exploration of this combination therapy is ongoing. See related commentary by Stebbing and Bullock, p. 2005. Occurrence of resistance to olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi) approved in ovarian carcinoma, has already been shown in clinical settings. Identifying combination treatments to sensitize tumor cells and/or overcome resistance to olaparib is critical. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a master regulator of mitosis, is also involved in the DNA damage response promoting homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair and in the recovery from the G2/M checkpoint. We hypothesized that PLK1 inhibition could sensitize tumor cells to PARP inhibition. Onvansertib, a highly selective PLK1 inhibitor, and olaparib were tested in vitro and in vivo in BRCA1 mutated and wild-type (wt) ovarian cancer models, including patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) resistant to olaparib. The combination of onvansertib and olaparib was additive or synergic in different ovarian cancer cell lines, causing a G2/M block of the cell cycle, DNA damage, and apoptosis, much more pronounced in cells treated with the two drugs as compared to controls and single agents treated cells. The combined treatment was well tolerated in vivo and resulted in tumor growth inhibition and a statistically increased survival in olaparib-resistant-BRCA1 mutated models. The combination was also active, although to a lesser extent, in BRCA1 wt PDXs. Pharmacodynamic analyses showed an increase in mitotic, apoptotic, and DNA damage markers in tumor samples derived from mice treated with the combination versus vehicle. We could demonstrate that in vitro onvansertib inhibited both HR and non-homologous end-joining repair pathways and in vivo induced a decrease in the number of RAD51 foci-positive tumor cells, supporting its ability to induce HR deficiency and favoring the activity of olaparib. Considering that the combination was well tolerated, these data support and foster the clinical evaluation of onvansertib with PARPis in ovarian cancer, particularly in the PARPis-resistant setting. Group 3 medulloblastoma (MB) is often accompanied by MYC amplification. PLK1 is an oncogenic kinase that controls cell cycle and proliferation and has been preclinically validated as a cancer therapeutic target. Onvansertib (PCM-075) is a novel, orally available PLK1 inhibitor, which shows tumor growth inhibition in various types of cancer. We aim to explore the effect of onvansertib on MYC-driven medulloblastoma as a monotherapy or in combination with radiation. Crisper-Cas9 screen was used to discover essential genes for MB tumor growth. Microarray and immunohistochemistry on pediatric patient samples were performed to examine the expression of PLK1. The effect of onvansertib in vitro was measure by cell viability, colony-forming assays, extreme limiting dilution assay, and RNA-Seq. ALDH activity, cell-cycle distribution, and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. DNA damage was assessed by immunofluorescence staining. Medulloblastoma xenografts were generated to explore the monotherapy or radio-sensitizing effect. PLK1 is overexpressed in Group 3 MB. The IC50 concentrations of onvansertib in Group 3 MB cell lines were in a low nanomolar range. Onvansertib reduced colony formation, cell proliferation, stem cell renewal and induced G2/M arrest in vitro. Moreover, onvansertib in combination with radiation increased DNA damage and apoptosis compared with radiation treatment alone. The combination radiotherapy resulted in marked tumor regression in xenografts. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of a novel PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib in vitro and in xenografts of Group 3 MB, which suggests onvansertib is an effective strategy as monotherapy or in combination with radiotherapy in MB.",Onvansertib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011657988943625242), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001178047270514071)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([qcnews.com](https://www.qcnews.com/business/press-releases/globenewswire/9316736/cardiff-oncology-announces-positive-initial-data-from-first-line-ras-mutated-mcrc-clinical-trial/?utm_source=openai), [trivano.com](https://www.trivano.com/persbericht/cardiff-oncology-announces-positive-clinical-data-in-pancreatic-cancer-and-small-cell-lung-cancer-including-single-agent-activity-from-onvansertib-monotherapy-511557.html?utm_source=openai), [urologytimes.com](https://www.urologytimes.com/view/onvansertib-active-in-abiraterone-resistant-prostate-cancer?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=583, start_index=9, title='Cardiff Oncology Announces Positive Initial Data from First-line RAS-mutated mCRC Clinical Trial', type='url_citation', url='https://www.qcnews.com/business/press-releases/globenewswire/9316736/cardiff-oncology-announces-positive-initial-data-from-first-line-ras-mutated-mcrc-clinical-trial/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=583, start_index=9, title='Cardiff Oncology Inc | Cardiff Oncology Announces Positive Clinical Data in Pancreatic Cancer and Small Cell Lung Cancer, including Single-Agent Activity from Onvansertib Monotherapy', type='url_citation', url='https://www.trivano.com/persbericht/cardiff-oncology-announces-positive-clinical-data-in-pancreatic-cancer-and-small-cell-lung-cancer-including-single-agent-activity-from-onvansertib-monotherapy-511557.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=583, start_index=9, title='Onvansertib active in abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer', type='url_citation', url='https://www.urologytimes.com/view/onvansertib-active-in-abiraterone-resistant-prostate-cancer?utm_source=openai')])"

ILCs are largely tissue-resident cells and are deeply integrated into the fabric of tissues. The discovery and investigation of ILCs over the past decade has changed our perception of immune regulation and how the immune system contributes to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. We now know that cytokine-producing ILCs contribute to multiple immune pathways by, for example, sustaining appropriate immune responses to commensals and pathogens at mucosal barriers, potentiating adaptive immunity, and regulating tissue inflammation. Critically, the biology of ILCs also extends beyond classical immunology to metabolic homeostasis, tissue remodeling, and dialog with the nervous system. The last 10 years have also contributed to our greater understanding of the transcriptional networks that regulate lymphocyte commitment and delineation. This, in conjunction with the recent advances in our understanding of the influence of local tissue microenvironments on the plasticity and function of ILCs, has led to a re-evaluation of their existing categorization. In this review, we distill the advances in ILC biology over the past decade to refine the nomenclature of ILCs and highlight the importance of ILCs in tissue homeostasis, morphogenesis, metabolism, repair, and regeneration. The frailty index is commonly used in research and clinical practice to quantify health. Using a health deficit accumulation model, a frailty index can be calculated retrospectively from data collected via survey, interview, performance test, laboratory report, clinical or administrative medical record, or any combination of these. Here, we offer a detailed 10-step approach to frailty index creation, with a worked example. We identified 10 steps to guide the creation of a valid and reliable frailty index. We then used data from waves 5 to 12 of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to illustrate the steps. The 10 steps are as follows: (1) select every variable that measures a health problem; (2) exclude variables with more than 5% missing values; (3) recode the responses to 0 (no deficit) through 1 (deficit); (4) exclude variables when coded deficits are too rare (< 1%) or too common (> 80%); (5) screen the variables for association with age; (6) screen the variables for correlation with each other; (7) count the variables retained; (8) calculate the frailty index scores; (9) test the characteristics of the frailty index; (10) use the frailty index in analyses. In our worked example, we created a 61-item frailty index following these 10 steps. This 10-step procedure can be used as a template to create one continuous health variable. The resulting high-information variable is suitable for use as an exposure, predictor or control variable, or an outcome measure of overall health and ageing. Early diagnosis is crucial for the successful treatment of primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), a rapidly progressing tumour. Suspicion raised on brain MRI must be confirmed by a histopathological diagnosis of a tumour specimen collected by stereotactic biopsy. In rare cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or vitreous humour might aid in providing a cytological diagnosis. Several disease-related, patient-related, and treatment-related factors affect the timing and accuracy of diagnosis and patient outcome. Some molecules detected in CSF, aqueous and vitreous humour, and peripheral blood were proposed as diagnostic biomarkers for PCNSL; however, detection methods for most of these molecules are not yet standardised, have a long turnaround time, are expensive, and have little reproducibility among labs.

Patients had progressed on prior trastuzumab (Arms 1 and 2) and received prior taxane (Arm 2). The MTD of pilaralisib was determined using a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design (starting dose 200 mg once daily). Forty-two patients were enrolled (21 in each arm). Five patients had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; three in Arm 1 and two in Arm 2). Dose-limiting toxicities were rash (three patients) and neutropenia (two patients). The MTD of pilaralisib was determined at 400 mg once daily in both arms. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (23.8 % in Arm 1 vs. 66.7 % in Arm 2), fatigue (14.3 vs. 42.9 %), and rash (33.3 vs. 38.1 %). The most frequently reported treatment-related grade ≥3 AEs were erythematous rash (9.5 %) in Arm 1 and diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, and neutropenia (14.3 % each) in Arm 2. Steady-state pilaralisib exposure was similar to previous studies with pilaralisib monotherapy. No responses occurred in Arm 1; four of 20 evaluable patients (20 %) in Arm 2 had a partial response. Observed PIK3CA mutations in cell-free circulating DNA did not correlate with response. Pilaralisib in combination with trastuzumab with or without paclitaxel had an acceptable safety profile in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, with clinical activity in the paclitaxel arm. Despite involvement of PI3K pathway activation in tumorigenesis of solid tumors, single-agent PI3K inhibitors have shown modest clinical activity.Preclinical evidence suggests that combining PI3K pathway inhibitors and chemotherapy can enhance antitumor effects.In patients with solid tumors, the PI3K inhibitor pilaralisib had a favorable safety profile but did not enhance the antitumor activity of paclitaxel plus carboplatin.Further clinical evaluation is warranted to identify effective combination strategies with PI3K pathway inhibitors. Pilaralisib (SAR245408) is an oral, pan-class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. This phase I dose-escalation study evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of pilaralisib in capsule and tablet formulations, administered in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. A 3 + 3 design was used. Pilaralisib was administered once daily (QD); paclitaxel (up to 175 mg/m Fifty-eight patients were enrolled. Six patients (10.3%) had dose-limiting toxicities, of which only rash (two patients, 3.4%) occurred in more than one patient. The MTD of pilaralisib tablets in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin was determined to be 200 mg QD. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) of any grade were neutropenia (67.2%) and thrombocytopenia (67.2%). PK data showed no interaction between pilaralisib and paclitaxel/carboplatin. Tumor tissue showed moderate inhibition of PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Seven of 52 evaluable patients had a partial response (PR; 13.5%). Pilaralisib had a favorable safety profile but did not enhance the antitumor activity of paclitaxel plus carboplatin in solid tumors.  经验总结 • 尽管实体瘤的肿瘤发生过程中涉及PI3K通路激活, 但单药PI3K抑制剂的临床活性不佳。 • 临床前证据显示PI3K通路抑制剂联合化疗可增强抗肿瘤作用。 • 在实体瘤患者中, PI3K抑制剂Pilaralisib具有良好的安全性特征, 但未能增强紫杉醇+卡铂的抗肿瘤活性。 • 有必要通过进一步的临床评价来确定PI3K通路抑制剂的有效联合用药策略。 摘要 ",Pilaralisib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00036221143091097474), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002479576040059328)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/21/14/3160/124814/Phase-I-Trial-of-the-Pan-PI3K-Inhibitor,https://theoncologist.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0691,https://www.gynecologiconcology-online.net/article/S0090-8258%2814%2901574-1/abstract ', [])"

The benefit of sotagliflozin was evaluated by measuring the number of predefined events (death from cardiovascular causes, need for hospitalization for heart failure, or urgent medical care visit for heart failure) occurring in the patient population receiving sotagliflozin versus placebo. == Society and culture == === Legal status === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused its approval for use in combination with insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.

In May 2023, the US FDA approved sotagliflozin (Inpefa) to decrease the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visit in adults with heart failure or type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular risk. The marketing authorization for sotagliflozin was withdrawn in the EU in August 2022, at the request of the marketing-authorization holder. == Research == Combination of insulin with sotaglifozin led to a significant lowering of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and multiple indirect markers of arterial stiffness, including pulse pressure, without changes in pulse rates. == References == == Further reading ==",Zynquista,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9192511899746023e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -7.986703712958843e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
703,"('Fluorocyclopentenylcytosine', 'Roducitabine', 'Rx 3117', 'Roducitabine [usan]', 'Fluorocyclopentenyl cytosine')",Medical," Fluorocyclopentenylcytosine (RX-3117) is an orally available cytidine analog, currently in Phase I clinical trial. RX-3117 has promising antitumor activity in various human tumor xenografts including gemcitabine resistant tumors. RX-3117 is activated by uridine-cytidine kinase (UCK). Since UCK exists in two forms, UCK1 and UCK2, we investigated which form is responsible for RX-3117 phosphorylation. For that purpose we transfected A549 and SW1573 cell lines with UCK-siRNAs. Transfection of UCK1-siRNA efficiently downregulated UCK1-mRNA, but not UCK2-mRNA expression, and did not affect sensitivity to RX-3117. However, transfection of UCK2-siRNA completely downregulated UCK2-mRNA and protein and protected both A549 and SW1573 against RX-3117. UCK enzyme activity in two panels of tumor cell lines and xenograft cells correlated only with UCK2-mRNA expression (r = 0.803 and 0.915, respectively), but not with UCK1-mRNA. Moreover, accumulation of RX-3117 nucleotides correlated with UCK2 expression. In conclusion, RX-3117 is activated by UCK2 which may be used to select patients potentially sensitive to RX-3117. A novel cytidine analog fluorocyclopentenylcytosine (RX-3117; TV-1360) was characterized for its cytotoxicity in a 59-cell line panel and further characterized for cytotoxicity, metabolism and mechanism of action in 15 additional cancer cell lines, including gemcitabine-resistant variants. In both panels sensitivity varied 75-fold (IC50: 0.4- > 30 μM RX-3117). RX-3117 showed a different sensitivity profile compared to cyclopentenyl-cytosine (CPEC) and azacytidine, substrates for uridine-cytidine-kinase (UCK). Dipyridamole, an inhibitor of the equilibrative-nucleoside-transporter protected against RX-3117. Uridine and cytidine protected against RX-3117, but deoxycytidine (substrate for deoxycytidine-kinase [dCK]) not, although it protected against gemcitabine, demonstrating that RX-3117 is a substrate for UCK and not for dCK. UCK activity was abundant in all cell lines, including the gemcitabine-resistant variants. RX-3117 was a very poor substrate for cytidine deaminase (66,000-fold less than gemcitabine). RX-3117 was rapidly metabolised to its nucleotides predominantly the triphosphate, which was highest in the most sensitive cells (U937, A2780) and lowest in the least sensitive (CCRF-CEM). RX-3117 did not significantly affect cytidine and uridine nucleotide pools. Incorporation of RX-3117 into RNA and DNA was higher in sensitive A2780 and low in insensitive SW1573 cells. In sensitive U937 cells 1 μM RX-3117 resulted in 90% inhibition of RNA synthesis but 100 μM RX-3117 was required in A2780 and CCRF-CEM cells. RX-3117 at IC50 values did not affect the integrity of RNA. DNA synthesis was completely inhibited in sensitive U937 cells at 1 μM, but in other cells even higher concentrations only resulted in a partial inhibition. At IC50 values RX-3117 downregulated the expression of DNA methyltransferase. In conclusion, RX-3117 showed a completely different sensitivity profile compared to gemcitabine and CPEC, its uptake is transporter dependent and is activated by UCK. RX-3117 is incorporated into RNA and DNA, did not affect RNA integrity, depleted DNA methyltransferase and inhibited RNA and DNA synthesis. Nucleotide formation is related with sensitivity. On the basis of the potent biological activity of cyclopentenyl-pyrimidines, fluorocyclopentenyl-pyrimidines were designed and synthesized from D-ribose. Among these, the cytosine derivative 5a showed highly potent antigrowth effects in a broad range of tumor cell lines and very potent antitumor activity in a nude mouse tumor xenograft model implanted with A549 human lung cancer cells. However, its 2'-deoxycytidine derivative 5b did not show any antigrowth effects, indicating that 2'-hydroxyl group is essential for the biological activity.",Fluorocyclopentenylcytosine,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000876638398040086), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029776105657219887)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.03804149478673935)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Interestingly, the off-target inhibition of IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) by ibrutinib may also play a role in modulating the tumor microenvironment, potentially enhancing the treatment benefit. However, resistance to covalently binding BTK inhibitors can develop as the result of a mutation in cysteine 481 of BTK (C481S), which prevents irreversible binding of the drugs. In the present study we performed preclinical characterization of vecabrutinib, a next-generation noncovalent BTK inhibitor that has ITK-inhibitory properties similar to those of ibrutinib. Unlike ibrutinib and other covalent BTK inhibitors, vecabrutinib showed retention of the inhibitory effect on C481S BTK mutants in vitro, similar to that of wild-type BTK. In the murine Eμ-TCL1 adoptive transfer model, vecabrutinib reduced tumor burden and significantly improved survival. Vecabrutinib treatment led to a decrease in CD8+ effector and memory T-cell populations, whereas the naive populations were increased. Of importance, vecabrutinib treatment significantly reduced the frequency of regulatory CD4+ T cells in vivo. Unlike ibrutinib, vecabrutinib treatment showed minimal adverse impact on the activation and proliferation of isolated T cells. Lastly, combination treatment with vecabrutinib and venetoclax augmented treatment efficacy, significantly improved survival, and led to favorable reprogramming of the microenvironment in the murine Eμ-TCL1 model.

708,"('Chlormadinone acetate', 'Gestafortin', 'Menstridyl', 'Matrol', 'Cero')",Medical,"Chlormadinone acetate (CMA), sold under the brand names Belara, Gynorelle, Lutéran, and Prostal among others, is a progestin and antiandrogen medication which is used in birth control pills to prevent pregnancy, as a component of menopausal hormone therapy, in the treatment of gynecological disorders, and in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions like enlarged prostate and prostate cancer in men and acne and hirsutism in women. It is available both at a low dose in combination with an estrogen in birth control pills and, in a few countries like France and Japan, at low, moderate, and high doses alone for various indications. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of the combination of an estrogen and CMA include menstrual irregularities, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, and others. At high dosages, CMA can cause sexual dysfunction, demasculinization, adrenal insufficiency, and changes in carbohydrate metabolism among other adverse effects. The drug is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It is also an antiandrogen, and hence is an antagonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Due to its progestogenic activity, CMA has antigonadotropic effects. The medication has weak glucocorticoid activity and no other important hormonal activity. CMA was discovered in 1959 and was introduced for medical use in 1965. It may be considered a ""first-generation"" progestin. The medication was withdrawn in some countries in 1970 due to concerns about mammary toxicity observed in dogs, but this turned out not to apply to humans. CMA is available widely throughout the world in birth control pills, but is notably not marketed in any predominantly English-speaking countries. It is available alone in only a few countries, including France, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea. == Medical uses == CMA is used at a low dose in combination with ethinylestradiol (EE), an estrogen, in combined birth control pills. It has also been used in the treatment of gynecological conditions including vaginal bleeding, oligomenorrhea, polymenorrhea, hypermenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea, and endometriosis and in France (under the brand name Lutéran) in menopausal hormone therapy in combination with an estrogen. CMA is used at dosages of 1 to 2 mg/day in combined birth control pills and at dosages of 2 to 10 mg/day in the treatment of gynecological disorders. Combined birth control pills containing EE and CMA have been found to be useful in reducing androgen-dependent symptoms such as skin and hair conditions. Dosages of CMA of 15 to 20 mg/day have been found to improve hot flashes. High-dose CMA-only tablets are used as a form of progestogen-only birth control, although they are not specifically licensed as such. CMA has been widely used as a means of androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in Japan and South Korea, but has seen little use for these indications elsewhere in the world. It is used at dosages of 50 to 100 mg/day in the treatment of prostate diseases. Similarly to cyproterone acetate (CPA), CMA shows a lower risk of hot flashes than gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH analogues). The medication is the only other steroidal antiandrogen besides CPA that has been approved and used for the treatment of prostate cancer; megestrol acetate has also been researched, but has not been approved. CMA has also been found to be effective in the treatment of other androgen-dependent conditions such as acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss in women, similarly to CPA. It has been studied at moderate dosages of 4 to 12 mg/day in the treatment of precocious puberty in girls. It showed similar benefits as those of medroxyprogesterone acetate in these girls and was found to reduce, but not abolish premature development such as breast growth and menstruation. Only slight or no axillary hair growth was observed in the girls. CMA has also been used as a component of hormone therapy for transgender women, similarly to CPA and spironolactone, albeit mostly only in Japan. CMA has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the start of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. === Available forms === CMA is available in the form of oral tablets at low doses (2 mg) in combination with EE in birth control pills (e.g., as Belara in Germany and Brazil), at low to moderate doses (2, 5, 10, 25 mg) alone (e.g., as Lutéran in France and Lutoral in Mexico), and at high doses (50 mg) alone (e.g., as Prostal in Japan and Prostal-L in South Korea). == Contraindications == Contraindications of combined birth control pills, such as those containing EE and CMA, include known or suspected pregnancy, lactation and breastfeeding, a history of or known susceptibility to thromboembolism, cholestasis (but not liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis), and breast cancer among others. CMA is a teratogen in animals and may have the potential to cause fetal harm, such as feminization of male fetuses among other defects. == Side effects == The most common side effects of birth control pills containing EE and low-dose CMA have been found to include menstrual abnormalities, headache (37%), nausea (23%), breast tenderness (22%), and vaginal discharge (19%) among others. These formulations do not adversely affect sexual desire or function in women and show little or no risk of depression, mood swings, or weight gain. High-dosage CMA is associated with sexual dysfunction (e.g., reduced libido, erectile dysfunction), reduced body hair, adrenal insufficiency, and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism. Conversely, it does not share adverse effects of estrogens such as breast discomfort and gynecomastia. CMA does not increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. There is a case report of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis with CMA. Similarly to other progestins but in contrast to progesterone, CMA has been found to significantly increase the risk of breast cancer when used in combination with an estrogen in menopausal hormone therapy. No abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed in women taking combined birth control pills containing CMA or CPA. Unlike CPA, high-dosage CMA does not seem to be associated with hepatotoxicity. Similarly to megestrol acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate, CMA appears to show less potential for liver genotoxicity and carcinogenicity than CPA in bioassays. This seems to be related to the lack of the C1α,2α methylene group of CPA in these steroids. A case of hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported in a woman taking a birth control pill containing CMA. However, the incidence of liver tumors in women in association with CMA-containing birth control pills appears to be similar to that for birth control pills containing other progestins. == Overdose == CMA has been studied in men with advanced prostate cancer at massive dosages of 1,000 to 2,000 mg/day orally and 100 to 500 mg/day via intramuscular injection, without serious adverse effects or toxicity described. == Interactions == As CMA does not inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, it may have a lower risk of drug interactions than 19-nortestosterone progestins. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === CMA has progestogenic activity, antigonadotropic effects, antiandrogenic activity, and weak glucocorticoid activity. ==== Progestogenic activity ==== CMA is a progestogen, or an agonist of the progesterone receptor. It is highly potent in its progestogenic activity, with about 330 times the potency of progesterone in the Clauberg test and about 2,000 to 10,000 times the oral potency of progesterone in the McPhail assay. For comparison, the potencies of medroxyprogesterone acetate and CPA in the Clauberg assay were about 330- and 1,000-fold that of progesterone, respectively. The progestogenic activity of CMA is responsible for its functional antigonadotropic and antiestrogenic effects and for its contraceptive effects. The oral ovulation-inhibiting dosage of CMA in women is 1.5 to 4 mg/day and its endometrial transformation dosage is 25 mg/cycle. In one study of ovulation inhibition, CMA was 68% effective at 1 mg/day, 85% effective at 2 mg/day, and 100% effective at 4 mg/day. The effective dosage of CMA as a progestogen-only pill for contraception is 0.5 mg/day. Inhibition of ovulation is incomplete at this dosage and contraceptive effects are instead mainly achieved via progestogenic changes in the endometrium and cervix. In rabbit bioassays, PR activation was similar for CMA and its major active metabolites 3α-hydroxychlormadinone acetate (3α-OH-CMA) and 3β-hydroxychlormadinone acetate (3β-OH-CMA). ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== Due to its progestogenic activity, CMA has antigonadotropic effects, and hence can inhibit the secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. As a result, CMA suppresses ovulation and gonadal sex hormone production and can strongly decrease circulating testosterone and estradiol levels at sufficiently high dosages. The medication at a dosage of 50 mg/day has been found to suppress testosterone levels by about 76 to 85% (to approximately 50–100 ng/dL) and estradiol levels by about 55 to 59% (to approximately 7–8 pg/mL) in men with BPH. As such, CMA has powerful functional antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic effects via its antigonadotropic effects. ==== Antiandrogenic activity ==== CMA is a potent antiandrogen, or antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), with about 30 to 40% of the affinity of CPA for the receptor and about 20% of the antiandrogenic potency of CPA in animals. Like other progestins with antiandrogenic activity such as CPA, megestrol acetate, and spironolactone, but unlike nonsteroidal antiandrogens such as flutamide and bicalutamide, CMA is not a silent antagonist of the AR but rather a weak partial agonist with the capacity to activate the receptor in the absence of more efficacious agonists such as testosterone. In rabbit bioassays, AR antagonism was similar for CMA and 3α-OH-CMA but lower for 3β-OH-CMA. Both the antigonadotropic and antiandrogenic actions of CMA are thought to be involved in its effectiveness in the treatment of prostate cancer. When low-dose CMA is combined with EE, as in combined birth control pills, the antiandrogenic activity of CMA is reinforced, due to a large increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and consequent fall in free testosterone levels induced by EE. Unlike 19-nortestosterone progestins like levonorgestrel, CMA does not antagonize the EE-induced increase in SHBG levels. ==== Other activity ==== Similarly to other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as CPA, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, CMA has weak affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (comparable to that of progesterone) and weak glucocorticoid activity, and has the potential to cause adrenal insufficiency upon abrupt discontinuation at sufficient dosages. However, the medication shows significant glucocorticoid activity only at dosages much higher than those present in birth control pills. In rabbit bioassays, GR activation was highest for CMA but less for 3α-OH-CMA and not observed with 3β-OH-CMA (suggesting that it may, in contrast, be a lower efficacy partial agonist or antagonist of the GR). CMA has no affinity for the estrogen or mineralocorticoid receptors and has no estrogenic or antimineralocorticoid activity. Unlike progesterone but similarly to other progestins, CMA has no known neurosteroid activity (e.g., GABAA receptor modulation) or sedative effects. CMA has been reported to be a competitive inhibitor of 5α-reductase. However, it seems to shows very low potency in this action, with 0.0% inhibition of the enzyme at a concentration of 1 μM, and in relation to this, has been said not to have an important influence on the enzyme. CMA may also act weakly as a testosterone biosynthesis inhibitor at high dosages. Unlike 19-nortestosterone progestins, CMA does not inhibit enzymes in the cytochrome P450 system, which may give it a lower risk of drug interactions. Certain progestins have been found to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Progesterone and CMA, in contrast, act neutrally in this assay. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone and progestins in clinical studies. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of CMA is 100%, which is due to low first-pass metabolism. In combination with 30 μg EE, a single 2 mg oral dose of CMA produced maximal serum levels of 1.6 ng/mL after about 1 to 2 hours and chronic administration produced steady-state levels of 2.0 ng/mL. Steady-state concentrations of CMA are achieved after 7 to 15 days. The distribution half-life of CMA is about 2.5 hours. The medication is highly lipophilic and is taken up into and accumulated in fat and some female reproductive tissues, although this may only occur at high dosages (e.g., ≥10 mg/day). The volume of distribution of CMA is unknown, but that of the closely related steroid CPA is very large at 1,300 L. The plasma protein binding of CMA is 96.6 to 99.4%, with about 1 to 3% free. It is bound to albumin, with no affinity for SHBG or corticosteroid-binding globulin. CMA is extensively metabolized in the liver by reduction, hydroxylation, deacetylation, and conjugation. Reduction occurs at the C3 ketone with preservation of the δ4(5) double bond, hydroxylation is at the C2α, C3α, C3β, and C15β positions, and conjugation includes glucuronidation and sulfation. The main metabolites of CMA are 2α-OH-CMA, 3α-OH-CMA, and 3β-OH-CMA, with the latter two being important active metabolites. Other metabolites of CMA are inactive. The elimination half-life of CMA has been reported to be 25 to 34 hours after a single dose and 34 to 39 hours after multiple doses, although some publications have reported its half-life to be as long as 80 to 89 hours. Enterohepatic reabsorption of CMA occurs. The medication has been found to be excreted 33 to 45% in urine and 24 to 41% in feces, as well as in bile. Only 74% of a dose is excreted 7 days after administration, which is due to accumulation of CMA in tissues and low clearance. == Chemistry == CMA, also known as 17α-acetoxy-6-chloro-6-dehydroprogesterone or as 17α-acetoxy-6-chloropregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a chlorine atom at the C6 position, a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17α position. CMA is the C17α acetate ester of chlormadinone, which, in contrast to CMA, was never marketed. Analogues of CMA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as CPATooltip cyproterone acetate, delmadinone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and osaterone acetate. CMA is identical in chemical structure to CPA except that it lacks the 1α,2α-methylene substitution of CPA. The structure of CMA is also nearly the same as those of delmadinone acetate and osaterone acetate, which similarly have A-ring modifications. === Synthesis === Chemical syntheses of CMA have been published. == History == CMA was discovered and first described in 1959. It was marketed in combination with mestranol by Eli Lilly under the brand name C-Quens from 1965 to 1971 in the United States. It was the first sequential contraceptive pill to be introduced in the U.S. CMA has also been marketed in combination with mestranol under the brand names Ovosiston, Aconcen, and Sequens. Due to findings of mammary gland nodules in beagle dogs (see below), C-Quens was voluntarily withdrawn from the U.S. market by Eli Lilly in 1971 and all oral contraceptives of CMA were discontinued in the U.S. by 1972. However, subsequent research found that there is no such risk in humans, and CMA has continued to be widely used in oral contraceptives in many other countries, such as Germany and China. The antiandrogenic activity of CMA was first described in 1966, and the medication was subsequently developed for use alone at high dosages in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions like prostate cancer. In the 1960s, CMA was introduced as a component of oral contraceptives. However, around 1970, such formulations were withdrawn from many markets such as the United States and United Kingdom due to the finding that CMA induced alarming mammary gland tumors in Beagle dogs. The doses administered that caused the nodules were 10 or 25 times the recommended human dosage for an extended period of time (2–4 years), while no tumors were found in dogs treated with 1–2 times the human dosage. In addition to CMA, mammary tumors were found in dogs with various other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and anagestone acetate, and they were also discontinued for the indication of hormonal contraception (although medroxyprogesterone acetate has since been reintroduced). Tumors were also observed with progesterone, as well as with ethynerone and chloroethynylnorgestrel, but notably not with the non-halogenated 19-nortestosterone derivatives norgestrel, norethisterone, noretynodrel, or etynodiol diacetate, which remained on the market. In any case, according to Hughes et al., ""It is still doubtful how much relevance these findings have for humans as the dog mammary gland seems to be the only one which can be directly maintained by progestogens."" Subsequent research revealed species differences between dogs and humans and established that there is no similar risk in humans. CMA was the first progestogen to be studied as a progestogen-only pill (""minipill""). It was discontinued and replaced by other progestins such as norethisterone and norgestrel after the findings of toxicity in beagle dogs. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Chlormadinone acetate is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Approved Name. It is also known by its developmental code name RS-1280. === Brand names === CMA has been marketed under a variety of brand names throughout the world including Clordion, Gestafortin, Gestogan, Lormin, Lutéran, Lutoral, Menstridyl, Non-Ovlon, Normenon, Prococyd, Progestormon, Prostal, Synchrogest, Verton, and many others. It is most commonly marketed in combination with EE as a combined birth control pill under the brand names Belara and to a lesser extent Belarina among others. The medication has been marketed for use in veterinary medicine under the brand names Anifertil, Chronosyn, Cyclonorm, Fertiletten, Synchrosyn, and others. === Availability === CMA is available alone at low, moderate, and/or high doses in France (brand name Lutéran), Germany (generics, and formerly Gestafortin), Japan (brand name Prostal), Mexico (brand name Lutoral), and South Korea (brand name Prostal-L). It is available in many countries in combination with EE, including throughout most of Europe and Latin America, and in Japan, Thailand, Israel, Lebanon, Tunisia, and Oman (but notably not South Korea). CMA is not available in English-speaking countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, or New Zealand, nor is it marketed in any of the Nordic countries. CMA was previously marketed in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1960s, but it was withdrawn in these countries in 1970 due to intermittent concerns about mammary toxicity in dogs. === Generation === Progestins in birth control pills are sometimes grouped by generation. While the 19-nortestosterone progestins are consistently grouped into generations, the pregnane progestins used in birth control pills are typically omitted from such classifications or are grouped as ""miscellaneous"" or ""pregnanes"". In any case, based on its date of introduction in such formulations of 1965, CMA could be considered a ""first-generation"" progestin. == Veterinary use == In addition to its use in humans, CMA has been used in veterinary medicine. == References == == Further reading ==",Chlormadinone acetate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.708655978902243e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01417449675500393)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlormadinone_acetate ', [])"

710,"('Cycloguanil (hydrochloride)', 'Cycloguanil', 'Cycloguanyl', 'Chlorguanide triazine', 'Malarone')",Medical,"Atovaquone/proguanil, sold under the brand name Malarone among others, is a fixed-dose combination medication used to treat and prevent malaria, including chloroquine-resistant malaria. It contains atovaquone and proguanil. It is not recommended for severe or complicated malaria. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, and itchiness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, hallucinations, and liver problems. Side effects are generally mild. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the baby. It is not recommended to prevent malaria in those with poor kidney function. Atovaquone works by interfering with the function of mitochondria in malaria while proguanil blocks dihydrofolate reductase. Atovaquone/proguanil was approved for medical use in the United States in 2000. It has been available as a generic medication since 2011. == Medical uses == === Malaria treatment === Atovaquone/proguanil is not normally used to treat severe malaria, when an injectable drug such as quinine is used instead. === Malaria prevention === Since some malaria strains are resistant to atovaquone/proguanil, it is not effective in all parts of the world. It must be taken with a fatty meal, or at least some milk, for the body to absorb it adequately—and to avoid painful stomach irritation, which proguanil frequently causes if taken without food. === Resistance === Proguanil acts as a mitochondrial sensitiser and synergizes with atovaquone. When atovaquone is used as a sole agent, a high natural frequency of cytochrome b mutants leads to a high failure rate. This is potentially due to the high lipophilicity and slow uptake of atovaquone, which results in a relatively prolonged period of parasite exposure at ineffective concentrations. Specific mutations (Y268S, Y268C) have been shown to confer resistance in vivo, but the other mechanisms of resistance remain unknown. == Adverse effects == Side effects are generally mild. While some people experience side effects, such as coughing, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, loss of appetite, mouth sores, nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, or weakness, the majority have none or few of these. == Mechanism of action == Atovaquone selectively inhibits the malarial cytochrome bc1 complex in the parasitic electron transport chain, collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential. The malarial electron transport chain does not contribute significantly to ATP synthesis; thus, it is believed that parasite death is due to the indirect inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which requires transport chain function and is essential to pyrimidine biosynthesis. Proguanil, via its metabolite cycloguanil, functions as a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, halting parasitic deoxythymidylate synthesis. === Chemistry === A standard tablet of Malarone contains 100 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 250 mg of atovaquone. A pediatric tablet contains 25 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 62.5 mg of atovaquone. == History == Glaxo Wellcome patented the combination of atovaquone and proguanil to treat malaria in 1999. Patent protection expired in 2013. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a generic formulation from Glenmark Generics in 2011. In February 2013, the United Kingdom High Court revoked Glaxo's patent on grounds of obviousness, which clears the way for firms to sell generic versions there. == References ==",Malarone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1801649634435307e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00021169328829273582)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/malarone.html,https://www.drugs.com/pro/malarone.html,https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/756/SPC/Malarone ', [])"

Central nervous system: At a dose of 30 mg/kg, i.v. loxiglumide showed ptosis in one of 6 mice, but at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, i.v. no change on gross behavior in mice. Loxiglumide had no effect on locomotor activity and thiopental-induced hypnosis, anti-convulsive activity, analgesic activity in mice and rectal temperature changes in rats. 2. Autonomic nervous system: In vitro, loxiglumide at concentrations of 10(-4) and 3 x 10(-4) mol/l slightly inhibited agonist-induced contractions in the isolated guinea pig ileum and spontaneous rhythmic contractions in the isolated non-pregnant rat uterus. But loxiglumide had no effect on oxytocin-induced contraction in isolated non-pregnant rat uterus. 3. Cardio-respiratory system: Loxiglumide had no effect on heart rate and electrocardiogram in anesthetized dogs. But it slightly increased blood pressure and decreased the frequency of respirations at a dose of 30 mg/kg, i.v. Furthermore, loxiglumide slightly decreased femoral arterial blood flow at doses of more than 3 mg/kg, i.v. On the other hand, it had no effect on contractile force or contraction rate in the isolated guinea pig atrium and resting tension in the isolated rabbit aorta. 4. Gastrointestinal system: Loxiglumide increased bile secretion at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg, i.v. in anesthetized rats and at doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, i.v. in anesthetized dogs. However, total bile acid output was not affected by loxiglumide. On the other hand, loxiglumide had no effect on pancreatic secretion, gastric secretion and gastric emptying in rats and intestinal transport activity in mice. 5. Hematology: In vitro, in the case of samples without bovine serum albumin, at concentrations of more than 1.9 x 10(-3) mol/l loxiglumide showed hemolysis, while in the case of samples with bovine serum albumin, at concentrations of more than 6.9 x 10(-3) mol/l loxiglumide showed hemolysis, and its maximal potency was weak compared to albumin-free conditions. On the other hand, in vivo, loxiglumide had no effect on hemolysis. In addition, it had no effect on platelet aggregation, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. 6. Miscellaneous pharmacological actions: Loxiglumide had no effect on local anesthetic activity in guinea pigs and renal function in mice. These results suggest that loxiglumide seems to produce no serious side effects on the central nervous system, autonomic nervous system, cardio-respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, hematological and miscellaneous systems at pharmacologically effective doses. We investigated the therapeutic effects of a cholecystokinin A (CCK-A) receptor antagonist, loxiglumide, on various models of experimental pancreatitis. This study shows that loxiglumide ameliorated caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in mice as previously reported. The effects of loxiglumide on hemorrhagic and necrotizing acute pancreatitis is controversial. This study, however, shows that loxiglumide improves the survival rates in necrotizing acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal injection of taurocholate, followed by caerulein injection. In addition, the administration of loxiglumide improved both the biochemical and pathological changes of edematous acute pancreatitis induced by a closed duodenal loop in rats. It is concluded that the CCK-A receptor antagonist, loxiglumide, has therapeutic and/or prophylactic effects on acute pancreatitis in various models of experimental acute pancreatitis. To evaluate the physiological role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in humans, we studied the influence of the specific CCK receptor antagonist loxiglumide (CR 1505) on gallbladder contraction, pancreatic enzyme output, plasma CCK concentrations, mouth-to-cecum transit time (MCTT), stool weight, and fecal fat excretion. Infusion of CCK-8, producing CCK plasma levels of 10-12 pmol/l, decreased gallbladder volume to 21% of the initial volume (P less than 0.01) and increased bilirubin output 8- to 10-fold and pancreatic enzyme secretion 2- to 4-fold. Infusion of loxiglumide (10 mg.kg-1.h-1 iv) abolished CCK-8-stimulated enzyme and bilirubin output. Basal gallbladder volume increased 68% during loxiglumide infusion (P less than 0.001) and 137% (P less than 0.001) after 7 days of oral loxiglumide treatment (3 x 1.6 g/day). Gallbladder contraction and bilirubin output in response to the intraduodenal instillation of a liquid meal (382 kcal) was completely inhibited by loxiglumide; gallbladder volume even increased 45% postprandially during loxiglumide infusion (P less than 0.02) and 145% after long-term loxiglumide treatment (P less than 0.001). Meal-stimulated pancreatic enzyme output was diminished 46-53% after acute and 25-29% after chronic administration of loxiglumide. Meal-stimulated integrated plasma CCK-immunoreactive (CCK-ir) concentrations, determined by RIA, were 3.2-fold higher during loxiglumide infusion (P less than 0.02); plateau CCK levels were markedly elevated (10.1 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.7 +/- 0.5 pM). Plasma CCK-like bioactivity, measured by a sensitive bioassay, was identical to CCK-ir levels in the absence of loxiglumide; in the presence of loxiglumide, no circulating CCK-like bioactivity was detectable, indicating complete inhibition of plasma CCK. MCTT was augmented 24% (P less than 0.05). Oral treatment with loxiglumide increased stool weight 72% (P less than 0.01) and fecal fat excretion 186% (P less than 0.001). In conclusion, 1) meal-induced gallbladder contraction and fasting tone are primarily controlled by CCK; 2) the contribution of CCK to the intestinal phase of postprandial pancreatic enzyme secretion is 40-50%; 3) GI motility and absorption are partially controlled by CCK; and 4) postprandial CCK secretion is substantially augmented by loxiglumide via an unknown mechanism.",Loxiglumide,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0011703446507453918), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.009051716886460781), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04862116649746895)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10026438/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15570466/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2295294/ ', [])"

When used in combination with the macrocyclic lactone ivermectin, it provides high broad-spectrum antiparasitic efficacy. The safety and efficacy of clorsulon should be studied by considering several factors such as drug-drug interactions mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters due to their potential effects on the pharmacokinetics and drug secretion into milk.

714,"('Tipiracil (hydrochloride)',)",Medical," Treatment options for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), who are refractory to standard chemotherapy, are limited. In a global multicenter randomized double-blind phase III study (RECOURSE study), TAS-102 (TFTD) administration significantly improved overall survival rate with favorable safety profile in mCRC patients refractory to standard chemotherapy (HR=0.68, p<0.001). TFTD was approved initially in Japan in March 2014 and is currently under review by health authorities in the United States and Europe. TFTD is expected to play an important role in salvage-line treatment for patients with mCRC. In this review, we present the history of its clinical development and the experimental data that elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of action of TFTD and its key component, trifluridine. TAS-102, with its robust survival efficacy and feasible toxicity, is one of the standard salvage-line treatments for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). No definitive data are available to determine which drug should be administered first during salvage-line treatment. Therefore, it is imperative that we establish the sequence of administration by considering drug toxicity profiles based on patient characteristics, such as age, performance status, comorbidities, tolerability to previous treatments, and patient preferences. The identification of predictive biomarkers in response to TAS-102 or its toxicity is urgently needed for better patient selection. Moreover, to strengthen efficacy or relieve toxicity, combinations with other agents, which could potentially emerge as standard treatment regimens, have been investigated and compared to existing active regimens for mCRC. Current antiplatelet medications increase the risk of bleeding, which leads to a clear clinical need in developing novel mechanism-based antiplatelet drugs. TYMP (Thymidine phosphorylase), a cytoplasm protein that is highly expressed in platelets, facilitates multiple agonist-induced platelet activation, and enhances thrombosis. Tipiracil hydrochloride (TPI), a selective TYMP inhibitor, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical use. We tested the hypothesis that TPI is a safe antithrombotic medication. Approach and Results: By coexpression of TYMP and Lyn, GST (glutathione S-transferase) tagged Lyn-SH3 domain or Lyn-SH2 domain, we showed the direct evidence that TYMP binds to Lyn through both SH3 and SH2 domains, and TPI diminished the binding. TYMP deficiency significantly inhibits thrombosis in vivo in both sexes. Pretreatment of platelets with TPI rapidly inhibited collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Under either normal or hyperlipidemic conditions, treating wild-type mice with TPI via intraperitoneal injection, intravenous injection, or gavage feeding dramatically inhibited thrombosis without inducing significant bleeding. Even at high doses, TPI has a lower bleeding side effect compared with aspirin and clopidogrel. Intravenous delivery of TPI alone or combined with tissue plasminogen activator dramatically inhibited thrombosis. Dual administration of a very low dose of aspirin and TPI, which had no antithrombotic effects when used alone, significantly inhibited thrombosis without disturbing hemostasis. This study demonstrated that inhibition of TYMP, a cytoplasmic protein, attenuated multiple signaling pathways that mediate platelet activation, aggregation, and thrombosis.

Overall, 55 patients were enrolled (B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma [B-NHL], [n = 10]; angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma-NHL, [n = 21]; classical Hodgkin lymphoma, [n = 11]; and immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, [n = 13]). The ORR was 40% in 43 evaluable patients (complete response rate [CRR], 19% [n = 8]) with a median duration of response of 10.4 months. For angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma-NHL (n = 15; all refractory to the last prior therapy), the ORR/CRR ratio was 60%/27%. The most common adverse events were nausea (38% any grade) and cytopenia (grade 3/4 neutropenia [29%], thrombocytopenia [20%], and anemia [20%]). This novel oral regimen provided encouraging efficacy across several EBV+ lymphoma subtypes and warrants further evaluation; a confirmatory phase 2 study (NCT05011058) is underway.

718,"('Ripasudil', 'K115 free base', 'Ripasudil free base', 'Glanatec', '(s)-4-fluoro-5-((2-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)sulfonyl)isoquinoline')",Medical,"Ripasudil (trade name Glanatec), a derivative of fasudil, is a rho kinase inhibitor drug (previously known as K-115) used for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ripasudil's mechanism of action affects intraocular pressure, or IOP, ""by directly acting on the trabecular meshwork, thereby increasing conventional outflow through the Schlemm’s canal."" More simply, it is an ""out-flow"" drug that reduces IOP by stimulating the movement of aqueous humour from the ciliary body away from the eye. It is a selective rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) inhibitor, where ROCK1 is ""an important downstream effector of Rho guanosine trisphosphates (GTP),"" proteins that are significant in the contractile control of smooth muscle tissue. The S configuration at the 2-position on the 1,4-diazepane ring of Ripasudil is what gives the drug its characteristic effect. Ripasudil was originally developed from fasudil, as both compounds share the same core structure of 5-(1,4-diazepan-1-ylsulfonyl)isoquinoline. Fasudil was already recognized as a potent Rho-kinase inhibitor, but after exploring the chemical derivatives of fasudil, developers observed that the incorporation of a fluorine atom at the C4 position of isoquinoline moiety and the chiral attachment of a methyl group to the C2’ position of 1,4-diazepane moiety dramatically improved the pharmacological action. In short, ""ripasudil showed much more potent and selective Rho-kinase inhibitory activity than fasudil"". According to a report submitted to the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency regarding Glanatec, ripasudil hydrochloride hydrate showed no binding affinity for receptors of the adrenergic, angiotensin II, endothelin, glutamate, histamine, muscarinic, or prostanoid variety. This lack of affinity also applies to Ca2+ and K+ channels, carbonic anhydrase, and HMG-CoA reductase. Toxicity information is compiled in the following tables. Ripasudil had no effect on respiratory or neurological function. Although no carcinogenicity studies were performed on the drug, developers believed it to be non-carcinogenic due to its rapid elimination and therefore lack of accumulation in tissue, as well as the lack of inflammatory response in the eye post-administration. === Pharmacokinetics === Ripasudil achieves a half-life of 0.49 to 0.73 hours in humans and is predominantly excreted in the urine. == History == Ripasudil (in the form of ripasudil hydrochloride hydrate) was approved by the PMDA of Japan on September 26, 2014. Glanatec, the trade name of the approved formulation, takes the form of an eye drop solution of 0.4% ripasudil, equivalent to 4 g of ripasudil per 1000 mL of solution. The solution is developed, marketed, and distributed by Kowa Pharmaceuticals, but the compound itself was discovered by D. Western Therapeutics Institute, a company who specializes in protein kinase inhibitory compounds. In September 2002, Kowa Company entered a licensing agreement with D. Western Therapeutics Institute, Inc. with regard to global rights of ripasudil. Under this agreement, D. Western Therapeutics Institute is eligible to receive milestone payments from Kowa. Kowa Company was issued a US patent (No. 8,193,193, entitled ‘‘Agent for prevention or treatment of glaucoma’’) on June 5, 2012 for the use of ripasudil in patients with glaucoma. As of June 25th, 2013, Glanatec is a registered U.S. federal trademark attributed to Kowa. == Additional Medical uses == Ripasudil has been proven to have additional medical uses aside from reducing IOP and alleviating symptoms of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. For example, in March 2016 the drug was shown to promote corneal endothelial cell (CEC) proliferation in cultured human cells as well as wound healing and endothelium regeneration in a rabbit wound model. Experimenters believed that these characteristics could prevent or improve the CEC density drop associated with cataract surgery or corneal trauma. This would prevent an array of symptoms including general haziness, edema of the cornea, or keratopathy, and would generally improve the recovery of a post-operation patient. As of 2016, Ripasudil has also been shown to prevent excessive scarring after glaucoma filtration surgery by attenuating the activation of conjunctival fibroblasts. The drug was also under clinical review for its ability to alleviate symptoms of diabetic retinopathy in early 2014. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse event reported in phase III trials for ripasudil was mild conjunctival hyperemia. Additionally, up to 3.8% of trial participants reported ocular irritation after using the drug with up to 5.7% reporting conjunctival hemorrhage. There were several cases of “abnormal sensation in the eye” reported. On a cellular level, Okumura et al. found that ripasudil produced ""guttae-like"" formations in ocular endothelial cells post-administration, which was attributed to, ""protrusion formation along intracellular borders caused by the reduction in actomyosin contractility of the CECs."" However, these morphological changes to the eye were considered transient and therefore quick to reverse, unlike symptoms Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy, a disorder for which these short-lived symptoms could be mistaken. == References ==",Ripasudil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0490362910786644e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001627074379939586)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripasudil?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Ripasudil', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripasudil?utm_source=openai')])"
719,"('Amoxapine', 'Asendin', 'Demolox', 'Moxadil', 'Amoxan')",Medical,"Amoxapine, sold under the brand name Asendin among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It is the N-demethylated metabolite of loxapine. Amoxapine first received marketing approval in the United States in 1980, approximately 10 to 20 years after most of the other TCAs were introduced in the United States. == Medical uses == Amoxapine is used in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Compared to other antidepressants it is believed to have a faster onset of action, with therapeutic effects seen within four to seven days. In excess of 80% of patients that do respond to amoxapine are reported to respond within two weeks of the beginning of treatment. It also has properties similar to those of the atypical antipsychotics, and may behave as one and thus may be used in the treatment of schizophrenia off-label. Despite its apparent lack of extrapyramidal side effects in patients with schizophrenia it has been found to worsen motor function in a study of three patients with Parkinson's disease and psychosis. == Contraindications == As with all FDA-approved antidepressants it carries a black-box warning about the potential of an increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviour in children, adolescents and young adults under the age of 25. Its use is also advised against in individuals with known hypersensitivities to either amoxapine or other ingredients in its oral formulations. Its use is also recommended against in the following disease states: Severe cardiovascular disorders (potential of cardiotoxic adverse effects such as QT interval prolongation) Uncorrected narrow angle glaucoma Acute recovery post-myocardial infarction Its use is also advised against in individuals concurrently on monoamine oxidase inhibitors or if they have been on one in the past 14 days and in individuals on drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (e.g. ondansetron, citalopram, pimozide, sertindole, ziprasidone, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, etc.). === Lactation === Its use in breastfeeding mothers not recommended as it is excreted in breast milk and the concentration found in breast milk is approximately a quarter that of the maternal serum level. == Side effects == Adverse effects by incidence: Note: Serious (that is, those that can either result in permanent injury or are irreversible or are potentially life-threatening) are written in bold text. Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Constipation Dry mouth Sedation Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include: Oedema. An abnormal accumulation of fluids in the tissues of the body leading to swelling. Prolactin levels increased. Prolactin is a hormone that regulates the generation of breast milk. Prolactin elevation is not as significant as with risperidone or haloperidol. Uncommon/Rare (<1% incidence) adverse effects include: Vasculitis a disorder where blood vessels are destroyed by inflammation. Can be life-threatening if it affects the right blood vessels. Galactorrhoea (lactation that is not associated with pregnancy or breast feeding) Delayed micturition (that is, delays in urination from when a conscious effort to urinate is made) Hyperthermia (elevation of body temperature; its seriousness depends on the extent of the hyperthermia) Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) this is basically when the body's level of the hormone, antidiuretic hormone, which regulates the conservation of water and the restriction of blood vessels, is elevated. This is potentially fatal as it can cause electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatraemia (low blood sodium), hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) and hypocalcaemia (low blood calcium) which can be life-threatening. Agranulocytosis a drop in white blood cell counts. The white blood cells are the cells of the immune system that fight off foreign invaders. Hence agranulocytosis leaves an individual open to life-threatening infections. Leukopaenia the same as agranulocytosis but less severe. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a potentially fatal reaction to antidopaminergic agents, most often antipsychotics. It is characterised by hyperthermia, diarrhoea, tachycardia, mental status changes [e.g. confusion], rigidity, extrapyramidal side effects) Tardive dyskinesia a most often irreversible neurologic reaction to antidopaminergic treatment, characterised by involuntary movements of facial muscles, tongue, lips, and other muscles. It develops most often only after prolonged (months, years or even decades) exposure to antidopaminergics. Extrapyramidal side effects. Motor symptoms such as tremor, parkinsonism, involuntary movements, reduced ability to move one's voluntary muscles, etc. Unknown incidence or relationship to drug treatment adverse effects include: Thrombocytopenia a significant drop in platelet count that leaves one open to life-threatening bleeds. Eosinophilia an elevated level of the eosinophils of the body. Eosinophils are the type of immune cell that's job is to fight off parasitic invaders. Jaundice yellowing of the skin, eyes and mucous membranes due to an impaired ability of the body to clear the by product of haem breakdown, bilirubin, most often the result of liver damage as it is the liver's responsibility to clear bilirubin. It tends to produce less anticholinergic effects, sedation and weight gain than some of the earlier TCAs (e.g. amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, trimipramine). It may also be less cardiotoxic than its predecessors. == Overdose == It is considered particularly toxic in overdose, with a high rate of renal failure (which usually takes 2–5 days), rhabdomyolysis, coma, seizures and even status epilepticus. Some believe it to be less cardiotoxic than other TCAs in overdose, although reports of cardiotoxic overdoses have been made. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Amoxapine possesses a wide array of pharmacological effects. It is a moderate and strong reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, respectively, and binds to the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, D2, α1-adrenergic, D3, D4, and H1 receptors with varying but significant affinity, where it acts as an antagonist (or inverse agonist depending on the receptor in question) at all sites. It has weak but negligible affinity for the dopamine transporter and the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, D1, α2-adrenergic, H4, mACh, and GABAA receptors, and no affinity for the β-adrenergic receptors or the allosteric benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. Amoxapine is also a weak GlyT2 blocker, as well as a weak (Ki = 2.5 μM, EC50 = 0.98 μM) δ-opioid receptor partial agonist. 7-Hydroxyamoxapine, a major active metabolite of amoxapine, is a more potent dopamine receptor antagonist and contributes to its neuroleptic efficacy, whereas 8-Hydroxyamoxapine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor but a stronger serotonin reuptake inhibitor and helps to balance amoxapine's ratio of serotonin to norepinephrine transporter blockade. === Pharmacokinetics === Amoxapine is metabolised into two main active metabolites: 7-hydroxyamoxapine and 8-hydroxyamoxapine. Where: t1/2 is the elimination half life of the compound. tmax is the time to peak plasma levels after oral administration of amoxapine. CSS is the steady state plasma concentration. protein binding is the extent of plasma protein binding. Vd is the volume of distribution of the compound. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Brand names for amoxapine include (where † denotes discontinued brands): Adisen (KR) Amolife (IN) Amoxan (JP) Asendin† (previously marketed in CA, NZ, US) Asendis† (previously marketed in IE, UK) Défanyl (FR) Demolox (DK†, IN, ES†) Oxamine (IN) Oxcap (IN) == See also == Loxapine == References ==",Moxadil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00012356207298580557), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019847711082547903), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0025452144909650087)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01416350994259119)])","('INFO; https://www.catalog.md/drugs/moxadil-.html ', [])"

721,"('Cefaclor', 'Cephaclor', 'Ceclor', 'Cefaclorum', 'Cefaclor anhydrous')",Medical,"Cefaclor, sold under the trade name Ceclor among others, is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat certain bacterial infections such as pneumonia and infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, and urinary tract. It is also available from other manufacturers as a generic. It was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in 1979. == Medical uses == Cefaclor belongs to the family of antibiotics known as the cephalosporins (cefalosporins). The cephalosporins are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are used for the treatment of septicaemia, pneumonia, meningitis, biliary tract infections, peritonitis, and urinary tract infections. The pharmacology of the cephalosporins is similar to that of the penicillins, excretion being principally renal. Cephalosporins penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid poorly unless the meninges are inflamed; cefotaxime is a more suitable cephalosporin than cefaclor for infections of the central nervous system, e.g. meningitis. Cefaclor is active against many bacteria, including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. === Spectrum of activity === Cefaclor is frequently used against bacteria responsible for causing skin infections, otitis media, urinary tract infections, and others. Cefaclor has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Gram positive aerobes - Staphylococci (including coagulase-positive, coagulase-negative, and penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A β-hemolytic streptococci). The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms. Haemophilus influenzae: 0.03 μg/mL - 128 μg/mL Staphylcoccus aureus: 0.6 μg/mL - 128 μg/mL Streptococcus pyogenes: 0.06 μg/mL - 4 μg/mL == Cautions and contraindications == Cautions include known sensitivity to beta-lactam antibacterials, such as penicillins (Cefaclor should be avoided if there is a history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction); renal impairment (no dose adjustment required, although manufacturer advises caution); pregnancy and breast-feeding (but appropriate to use); false positive urinary glucose (if tested for reducing substances) and false positive Coombs test. Cefaclor has also been reported to cause a serum sickness-like reaction in children. Cefaclor is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity (i.e. allergy) to cephalosporins. == Side effects == The principal side effect of the cephalosporins is hypersensitivity. Penicillin-sensitive patients may also be allergic to the cephalosporins, depending on the side chain and it's relation to the penicillin allergy. Most patients with penicillin allergy can tolerate the majority of cephalosporins without allergic reactions. The previous percentage of 10% cross reactivity rates are a gross overestimation. Allergic reactions may present as, for example, rashes, pruritus (itching), urticaria, serum sickness-like reactions with rashes, fever and arthralgia, and anaphylaxis. The frequency and severity of serum sickness-like reactions in children has led researchers to question its role in pediatric illness. Other side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort, disturbances in liver enzymes, transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice), headache, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Rare side effects include eosinophilia and blood disorders (including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and haemolytic anaemia); reversible interstitial nephritis; hyperactivity, nervousness, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, confusion, hypertonia, and dizziness. Toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported. In the UK, The Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM) has warned that the risk of diarrhea and rarely antibiotic-associated colitis are more likely with higher doses. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Cefaclor is passed into the breast milk in small quantities, but is generally accepted to be safe to take during breastfeeding. Cefaclor is not known to be harmful in pregnancy. == Interactions == === Coumarins === Cephalosporins possibly enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarins (e.g. Warfarin) - change in patient's clinical condition, particularly associated with liver disease, intercurrent illness, or drug administration, necessitates more frequent testing of INR, and dose adjustment as necessary. === Probenecid === Excretion of cephalosporins is reduced by probenecid (resulting in increased concentrations of drug in the blood plasma). === Antacids === Absorption of cefaclor is reduced by antacids. Therefore antacids should not be taken right before or at the same time as cefaclor. == References ==",Cefaclorum,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.47952248173533e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016234986833296716)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Over-expression of the ABC drug transporter proteins P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is a major obstacle for chemotherapy in many tumour types with Pgp conferring particularly poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Barasertib-hQPA is a highly selective inhibitor of aurora-B kinase that has shown tumouricidal activity against a range tumour cell lines including those of leukaemic AML origin. Effect of barasertib-hQPA on the pHH3 biomarker and cell viability was measured in a panel of leukaemic cell lines and 37 primary AML samples by flow cytometry. Pgp status was determined by flow cytometry and BCRP status by flow cytometry and real-time PCR. In this study we report the creation of the cell line OCI-AML3DNR, which over-expresses Pgp but not BCRP or multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), through prolonged treatment of OCI-AML3 cells with daunorubicin. We demonstrate that Pgp (OCI-AML3DNR and KG-1a) and BCRP (OCI-AML6.2) expressing AML cell lines are less sensitive to barasertib-hQPA induced pHH3 inhibition and subsequent loss of viability compared to transporter negative cell lines. We also show that barasertib-hQPA resistance in these cell lines can be reversed using known Pgp and BCRP inhibitors. We report that barasertib-hQPA is not an inhibitor of Pgp or BCRP, but by using 14[C]-barasertib-hQPA that it is effluxed by these transporters. Using phosphoHistone H3 (pHH3) as a biomarker of barasertib-hQPA responsiveness in primary AML blasts we determined that Pgp and BCRP positive primary samples were less sensitive to barasertib-hQPA induced pHH3 inhibition (p = <0.001) than samples without these transporters. However, we demonstrate that IC50 inhibition of pHH3 by barasertib-hQPA was achieved in 94.6% of these samples after 1 hour drug treatment, in contrast to the resistance of the cell lines. We conclude that Pgp and BCRP status and pHH3 down-regulation in patients treated with barasertib should be monitored in order to establish whether transporter-mediated efflux is sufficient to adversely impact on the efficacy of the agent.",Barasertib-hqpa,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006156456656754017), ('ICAL', -2.145764938177308e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0031939942855387926)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00020354038861114532), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://zellbio.eu/product/barasertib-hqpa/,https://www.glpbio.com/barasertib-azd1152-hqpa.html,https://www.targetmol.com/compound/Barasertib-HQPA,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5050114/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27496133/ ', [])"

While there are no studies on its safety when used by pregnant women, animals studies suggest higher rates of birth defects, as well as increased number of abortions and resorptions. It may also pass into breast milk, but the effects on breastfed infants is unknown. The manufacturer advises that child-bearing age patients should be on contraception and assessed for pregnancy before starting treatment. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects of vericiguat include symptomatic low blood pressure and anemia. Patients taking other soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitors should not take vericiguat. == Pharmacology == Vericiguat is a direct stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase, an important enzyme in vascular smooth muscle cells. Specifically, vericiguat binds to the beta-subunit of the target site on the soluble guanylate cyclase enzyme. Soluble guanylate cyclase catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMP upon interaction with nitric oxide to activate a number of downstream signaling cascades, which can compensate for defects in this pathway and resulting losses in regulatory myocardial and vascular cellular processes due to cardiovascular complications. == Pharmacokinetics == After vericiguat is administered (100 mg by mouth once daily), the average steady state and Cmax and AUC for patients with cardiovascular failure is 350 mcg/L and 6,680 mcg/h/L with a Tmax of one hour. Vericiguat has a positive food effect, and therefore patients are advised to consume food with the drug for an oral bioavailability of 93%. Vericiguat is extensively protein bound in plasma. Vericiguat is primarily metabolized via phase 2 conjugation reactions, with a minor CYP-mediated oxidative metabolite. The major metabolite is glucuronidated and inactive. The typical half-life profile for patients with heart failure is 30 hours. Vericiguat has a decreased clearance in patients with systolic heart failure. == History == The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vericiguat based on evidence from a clinical trial (NCT02861534) which consisted of 5,050 participants aged 23 to 98 years old with worsening heart failure. The trial was conducted at 694 sites in 42 countries in Europe, Asia, North and South America. The trial enrolled participants with symptoms of worsening heart failure. Participants were randomly assigned to receive vericiguat or a placebo pill once a day. Neither the participants nor the health care professionals knew if the participants were given vericiguat or placebo pills until after the trial was complete. It was awarded a fast track designation on 19 January 2021. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 20 May 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for vericiguat, intended for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure in adults with reduced ejection fraction. The applicant for this medicinal product is Bayer AG. Vericiguat was approved for medical use in the European Union in July 2021. == References == == Further reading == Armstrong PW, Pieske B, Anstrom KJ, Ezekowitz J, Hernandez AF, Butler J, et al.

724,"('Clozapine', 'Hf 1854', 'Leponex', 'Clozapin', 'Fazaclo')",Medical,"Clozapine, sold under the brand name Clozaril among others, is a psychiatric medication and was the first atypical antipsychotic to be discovered. It is used primarily to treat people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder who have had an inadequate response to two other antipsychotics, or who have been unable to tolerate other drugs due to extrapyramidal side effects. In the US, clozapine is also approved for use in people with recurrent suicidal behavior in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. It is also used for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease. Clozapine is recommended by multiple international treatment guidelines, after resistance to two other antipsychotic medications, and is the only treatment likely to result in improvement if two (or one) other antipsychotic has not had a satisfactory effect. Long term follow-up studies from Finland show significant improvements in terms of overall mortality including from suicide and all causes. Clozapine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. Common adverse effects include drowsiness, constipation, hypersalivation (increased saliva production), tachycardia, low blood pressure, blurred vision, significant weight gain, and dizziness. Clozapine is not normally associated with tardive dyskinesia (TD) and is recommended as the drug of choice when this is present, although some case reports describe clozapine-induced TD. Serious adverse effects include agranulocytosis, seizures, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), and hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels). The use of clozapine may result rarely in clozapine-induced, gastric hypomotility syndrome, which may lead to bowel obstruction and death. The mechanism of action is not entirely clear in the current medical literature. == History == Clozapine was synthesized in 1958 by Wander AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, based on the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. The first test in humans in 1962 was considered a failure. Trials in Germany in 1965 and 1966 as well as a trial in Vienna in 1966 were successful. In 1967, Wander AG was acquired by Sandoz. Further trials took place in 1972 when clozapine was released in Switzerland and Austria as Leponex. Two years later, it was released in West Germany and in Finland in 1975. Early testing was performed in the United States around the same time. In 1975, 16 cases of agranulocytosis leading to 8 deaths in clozapine-treated patients, reported from 6 hospitals mostly in southwestern Finland, led to concern. Analysis of the Finnish cases revealed that all the agranulocytosis cases had occurred within the first 18 weeks of treatment and the authors proposed blood monitoring during this period. The rate of agranulocytosis in Finland appeared to be 20 times higher than in the rest of the world and there was speculation that this may have been due a unique genetic variant in the region. Whilst the drug continued to be manufactured by Sandoz, and remained available in Europe, development in the U.S. halted. Interest in clozapine continued in an investigational capacity in the United States because, even in the 1980s, the duration of hospitalization, especially in state hospitals for those with treatment resistant schizophrenia, might often be measured in years rather than days. The role of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established by the landmark Clozaril Collaborative Study Group Study #30 in which clozapine showed marked benefits compared to chlorpromazine in a group of patients with protracted psychosis and who had already shown an inadequate response to other antipsychotics. This involved both stringent blood monitoring and a double-blind design with the power to demonstrate superiority over standard antipsychotic treatment. The inclusion criteria were patients who had failed to respond to at least three previous antipsychotics and had then not responded to a single blind treatment with haloperidol (mean dose 61 mg +/− 14 mg/d). Two hundred and sixty-eight were randomised were to double blind trials of clozapine (up to 900 mg/d) or chlorpromazine (up to 1800 mg/d). 30% of the clozapine patients responded compared to 4% of the controls, with significantly greater improvement on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression Scale, and Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation; this improvement included ""negative"" as well as positive symptom areas. Following this study, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its use in 1990. Cautious of this risk, however, the FDA required a black box warning for specific side effects including agranulocytosis, and took the unique step of requiring patients to be registered in a formal system of tracking so that blood count levels could be evaluated on a systematic basis. In December 2002, clozapine was approved in the US for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder judged to be at chronic risk for suicidal behavior. In 2005, the FDA approved criteria to allow reduced blood monitoring frequency. In 2015, the individual manufacturer Patient Registries were consolidated by request of the FDA into a single shared patient registry called The Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Registry. As of 24 February 2025, the FDA no longer requires participation in the Clozapine REMS, but blood monitoring is still recommended. Despite the demonstrated safety of the 2005 FDA monitoring requirements, which have lower neutrophil levels and do not include total white cell counts, international monitoring has not been standardized. == Medical uses == === Schizophrenia === The role of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was established by a 1988 landmark multicenter double blind study in which clozapine (up to 900 mg/d) showed marked benefits compared to chlorpromazine (up to 1800 mg/d) in a group of patients with protracted psychosis who had already shown an inadequate response to at least three previous antipsychotics including a prior single blind trial of haloperidol (mean 61+/− 14 mg/d for six weeks). While there are significant side effects, clozapine remains the most effective treatment when one or more other antipsychotics have had an inadequate response. The use of clozapine is associated with multiple improved outcomes, including a reduced rate of all-cause mortality, suicide and hospitalization. In a 2013 network comparative meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, clozapine was found to be significantly more effective than all other drugs. In a 2021 UK study, the majority of patients (over 85% of respondents) who took clozapine preferred it to their previous therapies, felt better on it and wanted to keep taking it. In a 2000 Canadian survey of 130 patients, the majority reported better satisfaction, quality of life, compliance with treatment, thinking, mood, and alertness. UK studies into the perspectives of people taking clozapine and their families following treatment with and discontinuation of clozapine describe significant stress and fearfulness of clozapine being stopped. Clozapine is usually used for people diagnosed with schizophrenia who have had an inadequate response to other antipsychotics or who have been unable to tolerate other drugs due to extrapyramidal side effects. The US FDA authorisation also includes clozapine for the treatment of people exhibition suicidal behaviour who have schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. It is also used for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease. It is regarded as the gold-standard treatment when other medication has been insufficiently effective and its use is recommended by multiple international treatment guidelines, supported by systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Whilst all current guidelines reserve clozapine for individuals in whom two other antipsychotics have already been tried, evidence indicates that clozapine might instead be used as a second line drug. Clozapine treatment has been demonstrated to produce improved outcomes in multiple domains including; a reduced risk of hospitalisation, a reduced risk of drug discontinuation, a reduction in overall symptoms and has improved efficacy in the treatment of positive psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Despite a range of side effects patients report good levels of satisfaction and long term adherence is favourable compared to other antipsychotics. Very long term follow-up studies reveal multiple benefits in terms of reduced mortality, with a particularly strong effect for reduced death by suicide, clozapine is the only antipsychotic known to have an effect reducing the risk of suicide or attempted suicide. Clozapine has a significant anti-aggressive effect. Clozapine is widely used in secure and forensic mental health settings where improvements in aggression, shortened admission and reductions in restrictive practice such as seclusion have been found. In secure hospitals and other settings clozapine has also been used in the treatment of borderline and antisocial personality disorder when this has been associated with violence or self-harm. Although oral treatment is almost universal clozapine has on occasion been enforced using either nasogastric or a short acting injection although in almost 50% of the approximately 100 reported cases patients agreed to take oral medication prior to the use of a coercive intervention. Clozapine has also been used off-label to treat catatonia with success in over 80% of cases. === Bipolar disorder === On the basis of systematic reviews clozapine is recommended in some treatment guidelines as a third or fourth line treatment for bipolar disorder. A long term follow-up study showed efficacy in terms of both psychiatric and somatic hospitialisation, but with bipolar disorder this effect was not as strong as with some other treatments (olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI) (aHR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.37–0.80), haloperidol LAI (aHR = 0.62, 0.47–0.81), zuclopenthixol LAI (aHR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.52–0.85), lithium (aHR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.71–0.76) and clozapine (aHR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.64–0.87)). Bipolar disorder is an off-label indication for clozapine. === Severe personality disorders === Clozapine is also used in borderline personality disorder and a randomized controlled trial is currently underway. The use of clozapine to treat personality disorders is uncommon and off-label. === Initiation === Whilst clozapine is usually initiated in hospital setting community initiation is also available. Before clozapine can be initiated multiple assessments and baseline investigations are performed. In the UK and Ireland there must be an assessment that the patient satisfies the criteria for prescription; treatment resistant schizophrenia, intolerance due to extrapyramidal symptoms of other antipsychotics or psychosis in Parkinson's disease. Establishing a history of treatment resistance may include careful review of the medication history including the durations, doses and compliance of previous antipsychotic therapy and that these did not have an adequate clinical effect. A diagnostic review may also be performed. That could include review of antipsychotic plasma concentrations if available. The prescriber, patient, pharmacy and the laboratory performing blood counts are all registered with a specified clozapine provider who must be advised that there is no history of neutropenia from any cause. The clozapine providers collaborate by sharing information regarding patients who have had clozapine related neutropenia or agranulocytosis so that clozapine cannot be used again on license. Clozapine may only be dispensed after a satisfactory blood result has been received by the risk monitoring agency at which point an individual prescription may be released to an individual patient only. Baseline tests usually also include; a physical examination including baseline weight, waist circumference and BMI, assessments of renal function and liver function, an ECG and other baseline bloods may also be taken to facilitate monitoring of possible myocarditis, these might include C reactive protein (CRP) and troponin. In Australia and New Zealand pre-clozapine echocardiograms are also commonly performed. A number of service protocols are available and there are variations in the extent of pre-clozapine work ups. Some might also include fasting lipids, HbA1c and prolactin. At the Maudsley Hospital in the UK the Treat service also routinely performs a wide variety of other investigations including multiple investigations for other causes of psychosis and comorbidities including; MRI brain imaging, thyroid function tests, B12, folate and serum calcium levels, infection screening for blood borne viruses including Hepatitis B and C, HIV and syphilis as well as screening for autoimmune psychosis by anti-NMDA, anti-VGKC and Anti-nuclear antibody screening. Investigations used to monitor the possibility of clozapine related side effects such as myocarditis are also performed including baseline troponin, CRP and BNP, and for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a CK level may also be drawn. Other clozapine initiation schedules exist. In 2023 the Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis Working Group published consensus guidelines on clozapine optimisation including initiation. The Team Daniel (Dr Laitman's regimen) includes a much slower than usual titration (25 mg increments per week rather than per day) combined with the prescription of a variety of other medications to manage side effects such as nausea, hypersalivation, acid reflux, tachycardia, nocturnal enuresis, metformin and lamotrigine. The dose of clozapine is initially low and gradually increased over a number of weeks. Initial doses may range from 6.5 to 12.5 mg/d, increasing stepwise typically, to doses in the range of 250–350 mg per day, at which point an assessment of response will be performed. In the UK, the average clozapine dose is 450 mg/d. But response is highly variable and some patients respond at much lower doses, and vice versa. A genome wide association study from the MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics in Cardiff, UK has shown significant interethnic variation in clozapine metabolism due to variation in the frequency of CYP alleles involved in clozapine metabolism such as UGT1A and CYP1A1/1A2. This found faster average clozapine metabolism in people of sub-Saharan African ancestry than in those of European ancestry and that individuals with east Asian or southwest Asian ancestry were more likely to be slow clozapine metabolisers than those with European ancestry. === Monitoring === During the initial dose titration phase, the following are typically monitored, usually daily at first: pulse, blood pressure, and temperature. Since orthostatic hypotension can be problematic, blood pressure should be monitored both sitting and standing. If there is a significant drop then the rate of the dose increase may be slowed. Mandatory full blood counts are performed weekly for the first 18 weeks. In some services there will also be monitoring of markers that might indicate myocarditis, troponin, CRP and BNP, although the exact tests and frequency vary between services. Weight is usually measured weekly. Thereon other investigations and monitoring will always include full blood counts (fortnightly for 1 year then monthly). Weight, waist circumference, lipids and glucose or HbA1c may also be monitored. === Clozapine response and treatment optimization === As with other antipsychotics, and in contrast to received wisdom, responses to clozapine are typically seen soon after initiation and often within the first week. That said responses, especially those which are partial, can be delayed. Quite what an adequate trial of clozapine is, is uncertain, but a recommendation is that this should be for at least 8 weeks on a plasma trough level above 350-400 micro g/L. There is considerable inter-individual variation. A significant number of patients respond at lower and also much higher plasma concentrations and some patients, especially young male smokers may never achieve these plasma levels even at doses of 900 mg/day. Options then include either increasing the dose above the licensed maximum or the addition of a drug that inhibits clozapine metabolism. Avoiding unnecessary polypharmacy is a general principle in drug treatment. However, what constitutes ""unnecessary"" is important, because antipsychotics are associated with metabolic syndrome and a corresponding increased risk of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, especially with long-term treatment. Polypharmacy with metformin, along with statins and ACE inhibitors, have the potential to significantly attenuate this risk. However, statins may increase blood glucose levels themselves, therefore necessitating polypharmacy with metformin whenever a statin is initiated. Together, this combination may have the potential to negate the negative metabolic and cardiovascular effects associated with antipsychotics, but further research is needed. ==== Optimizing blood sampling ==== The neutrophil cut off for clozapine have shown an exceptional ability to mitigate the risk of neutropenia and agranulocytosis. There is a significant margin of safety. Some patients may have marginal neutrophil counts before and after initiation and they are at risk of premature clozapine discontinuation. A knowledge of neutrophil biology allows blood sampling optimisation. Neutrophils show a diurnal variation in response to the natural cycle of G-CSF production, they are increased in the afternoons, they are also mobilised into the circulation after exercise and smoking. Simply shifting blood sampling has been shown to avoid unnecessary discontinuations, especially in black populations. However this is a disruption to usual hospital practice. Other practical steps are to ensure that blood results become available in hours and when senior staff are available. === Underuse of clozapine === Clozapine is widely recognised as being underused with wide variation in prescribing, especially in patients with African heritage. Psychiatrists' prescribing practices have been found to be the most significant variable regarding variance in its use. Surveys of psychiatrists' attitudes to clozapine have found that many had little experience in its use, overestimated the incidence of side effects, and did not appreciate that many patients prefer to take clozapine over other antipsychotics. In contrast to many psychiatrists' expectations most patients believe that the blood testing and other difficulties are worth the multiple benefits that they perceive. Whilst psychiatrists fear the severe adverse effects such as agranulocytosis, patients are more concerned about hypersalivation. Clozapine is no longer actively marketed and this may also be one of the explanations for its underuse. Despite the strong evidence and universal endorsement by national and international treatment guidelines and the experiences of patients themselves, most people eligible for clozapine are not treated with it. A large study in England found that approximately 30% of those eligible for clozapine were being treated with it. Those patients that do start clozapine usually face prolonged delay, multiple episodes of psychosis and treatments such as high dose antipsychotics or polypharmacy. Instead of two previous antipsychotics many will have been exposed to ten or more drugs which were not effective. A study of 120 patients conducted in four hospitals in South-East London found a mean of 9.2 episodes of antipsychotic prescription before clozapine was initiated and the mean delay in using clozapine was 5 years. Treatments that have no evidence base or are regarded as actively harmful are used instead. As well as variation within counties there is massive variation in the use of clozapine internationally. An international study of 17 counties found greatest use in Finland (189/100,000 persons) and New Zealand (116/100,000), and least in the Japanese cohort (0.6/100,000) and in the privately insured US cohort (14/100,000). ==== Racial disparity in the use of clozapine ==== A general finding in healthcare provision is that minority groups receive inferior treatment; this is a particular finding in the US. In the US a general finding is that compared to their white peers African American people are less likely to be prescribed the second generation antipsychotics, which are more expensive than alternatives and this was even apparent and especially so for clozapine when comparison was made in the Veterans Affairs medical system and when differences regarding socioeconomic factors were taken into account. As well as being less likely to start clozapine black patients are more likely to stop clozapine, possibly on account of benign ethnic neutropenia. ==== Benign ethnic neutropenia ==== Benign reductions in neutrophils are observed in individuals of all ethnic backgrounds. Ethnic neutropenia (BEN), neutropenia without immune dysfunction or increased liability to infection, is not due to abnormal neutrophil production; although, the exact aetiology of the reduction in circulating cells remains unknown. BEN is associated with several ethnic groups, but in particular those with Black African and West African ancestry. A difficulty with the use of clozapine is that neutrophil counts have been standardised on white populations. For significant numbers of black patients the standard neutrophil count thresholds did not permit clozapine use, as the thresholds did not take BEN into account. Since 2002, clozapine monitoring services in the UK have used reference ranges 0.5 × 109/l lower for patients with haematologically confirmed BEN and similar adjustments are available in the current US criteria, although with lower permissible minima. But even then significant numbers of black patients will not be eligible even though the low neutrophil counts do not in their case reflect disease. The Duffy–Null polymorphism, which protects against some types of malaria, is predictive of BEN. In the UK the Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends consideration of Duffy typing when using or considering clozapine for people with Black or Middle Eastern ancestry, in the UK this can be requested from the International Blood Group Reference laboratory based in Bristol. == Adverse effects == Clozapine may cause serious and potentially fatal adverse effects. Clozapine carries five black box warnings, including (1) severe neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils), (2) orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon changing positions), including slow heart rate and fainting, (3) seizures, (4) myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), and (5) risk of death when used in elderly people with dementia-related psychosis. Lowering of the seizure threshold may be dose related. Increasing the dose slowly may decrease the risk for seizures and orthostatic hypotension. Common effects include constipation, bed-wetting, night-time drooling, muscle stiffness, sedation, tremors, orthostatic hypotension, high blood sugar, and weight gain. The risk of developing extrapyramidal symptoms, such as tardive dyskinesia, is below that of typical antipsychotics; this may be due to clozapine's anticholinergic effects. Extrapyramidal symptoms may subside somewhat after a person switches from another antipsychotic to clozapine. Sexual problems, such as retrograde ejaculation and priapism, have been reported while taking clozapine. Rare adverse effects include periorbital edema and hematological malignancy. Despite the risk for numerous side effects, many side effects can be managed while continuing to take clozapine. === Mortality === The overall all cause mortality for people with serious psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia who are prescribed clozapine is lower than those who take other treatments and much lower than those who take no drug treatments at all. Reductions are particularly marked for death by suicide but also from all natural causes. This is demonstrated by studies which have used whole-population databases, such as those completed in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Taiwan and following systematic review and meta-analysis. === Neutropenia and agranulocytosis === Clozapine use has been associated with neutropenia, and as a result clozapine therapy is typically done with stringent blood monitoring. However, meta-analysis of controlled trial data fails to show that clozapine has a stronger association with neutropenia than other antipsychotic medications, or to find a difference in rates of agranulocytosis before and after 1990 (at which point mandatory monitoring was introduced). Overall, despite the concerns relating to blood and other side effects, clozapine use is associated with a reduced mortality, especially from suicide which is a major cause of premature death in people with schizophrenia. The risk of clozapine related agranulocytosis and neutropenia warranted the mandatory use of stringent risk monitoring and management systems, which have reduced the risk of death from these adverse events to around 1 in 7,700. The association between clozapine use and specific blood dyscrasias was first noted in the 1970s when eight deaths from agranulocytosis were noted in Finland. At the time it was not clear if this exceeded the established rate of this side effect which is also found in other antipsychotics and although the drug was not completely withdrawn, its use became limited. Clozapine Induced Neutropenia (CIN) occurs in approximately 3.8% of cases and Clozapine Induced Agranulocytosis (CIA) in 0.4%. These are potentially serious side effects and agranulocytosis can result in death. To mitigate this risk clozapine is only used with mandatory absolute neutrophil count (ANC) monitoring (neutrophils are the most abundant of the granulocytes); for example, in the United States, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). The exact schedules and blood count thresholds vary internationally and the thresholds at which clozapine can be used in the U.S. has been lower than those currently used in the U.K. and Australasia for some time. The effectiveness of the risk management strategies used is such that deaths from these side effects are very rare occurring at approximately 1 in 7700 patients treated. Almost all the adverse blood reactions occur within the first year of treatment and the majority within the first 18 weeks. After one year of treatment these risks reduce markedly to that seen in other antipsychotic drugs 0.01% or about 1 in 10,000 and the risk of death is markedly lower still. When reductions in neutrophil levels are noted on regular blood monitoring then, depending on the value, monitoring may be increased or, if the neutrophil count is sufficiently low, then clozapine is stopped immediately and can then no longer be used within the medicinal licence. Stopping clozapine almost always results in resolution of the neutrophil reduction. However severe agranulocytosis can result in spontaneous infection and death, is a severe decrease in the amount of a specific kind of white blood cell called granulocytes. Clozapine carries a black box warning for drug-induced agranulocytosis, although meta-analysis of controlled studies comparing the association between clozapine and other antipsychotic medications and the development of neutropenia fails to show a specific clozapine related risk, which is contrary to the previously accepted beliefs. Rapid point-of-care tests may simplify the monitoring for agranulocytosis. ==== Pharmacogenetics and Mechanism of Clozapine Related Blood Dyscrasias ==== CIA is a type B idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction (ADR). It is unrelated to the mode of therapeutic action, and there is no evidence that it is dose dependent and is one of many non-chemotherapy drugs with the potential to induce an idiosyncratic drug-induced agranulocytosis (IDIN). The mechanisms of CIA have not been fully elucidated but are thought to involve a combination of toxic, immunological and genetic factors, combined with oxidised drug metabolites and HLA-activating T helper cells, which induce B cells to produce drug-dependent neutrophil antibodies. Severe life-threatening CIA has a distinctive pattern, with a continuous and rapid fall to zero or near-zero ANC within 2–15 days, followed by a prolonged nadir of a similar duration. Genetic linkage studies have identified specific HLA types and transporter genes as conferring increased risk, but the pharmacogenetics has not yet progressed so as to make testing sufficiently predictive to be used clinically, and the identified genetic risk factors are not generalisable across ethnic groups. Overall, IDINs now have a mortality estimated at 5%; this is a marked improvement compared with previous levels, owing to early recognition and the introduction of hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor). Clozapine-induced neutropenia (CIN) and CIA are often regarded as synonymous, with the belief that CIN is a precursor to the more serious dyscrasia. However, there is little if any evidence to support this idea. Instead, it seems that the two are distinct, with most cases of CIN being incidental findings and artefacts of increased blood monitoring. ==== International Variation and Cost effectiveness of Monitoring ==== There is very significant international variation in the frequency of full blood count (for neutrophil counts) monitoring including both the thresholds for increased monitoring and for clozapine withdrawal as well as the duration and frequency of blood testing. The most extreme variation is between Iceland, where clozapine is given without full blood monitoring, and with no demonstrable increase in risk and Japan, where the thresholds and frequency is highest. Likewise there are differences between the US thresholds and those in the UK. The US and UK thresholds for clozapine monitoring were identical until 2015, at which point the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a reduction of 0.5 × 10−9/L for each ANC range and removed the requirement for white blood cell, eosinophil and platelet monitoring completely. The frequency used in many parts of mainland Europe and the reduced US thresholds and alternate, extended intervals in monitoring used in the Netherlands have had no demonstrable increase in risk. The rationale for monitoring after the first 18 weeks of treatment is questionable, given that monthly blood sampling is highly unlikely to detect the sudden and profound falls in ANC that accompany agranulocytosis and the economic analysis of the cost effectiveness of the current clozapine monitoring schedules shows that these are of highly questionable utility. Similarly several other drugs, for example carbimazole, which is commonly used in medical practice and with very similar risks of agranulocytosis is used without mandatory FBC monitoring. ==== Clozapine rechallenge ==== A clozapine ""rechallenge"" is when someone that experienced agranulocytosis while taking clozapine starts taking the medication again. In countries in which the neutrophil thresholds are higher than those used in the US a simple approach is, if the lowest ANC had been above the US cut off, to reintroduce clozapine but with the US monitoring regime. This has been demonstrated in a large cohort of patients in a hospital in London in which it was found that of 115 patients who had had clozapine stopped according to the US criteria only 7 would have had clozapine stopped if the US cut offs had been used. Of these 62 were rechallenged, 59 continued to use clozapine without difficulty and only 1 had a fall in neutrophils below the US cut off. Other approaches have included the use of other drugs to support neutrophil counts including lithium or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). However, if agranulocytosis still occurs during a rechallenge, the alternative options are limited. === Cardiac toxicity === Clozapine can rarely cause myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. A large meta-analysis of clozapine exposure to over 250,000 people revealed that these occurred in approximately 7 in 1000 patients treated and resulted in death in 3 and 4 in 10,000 patients exposed respectively and although myocarditis occurred almost exclusively within the first 8 weeks of treatment, cardiomyopathy can occur much later on. First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically C-reactive protein (CRP) increases with the onset of fever, and rises in the cardiac enzyme, troponin, occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness. Signs of heart failure are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent case-control study found that the risk of clozapine-induced myocarditis is increased with increasing rate of clozapine dose titration, increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate. A large electronic health register study has revealed that nearly 90% of cases of suspected clozapine related myocarditis are false positives. Rechallenge after clozapine induced myocarditis has been performed and a protocol for this specialist approach has been published. A systematic review of rechallenge after myocarditis has shown success in over 60% of reported cases. === Gastrointestinal hypomotility === Another underrecognized and potentially life-threatening effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe constipation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, bowel obstruction, acute megacolon, ischemia or necrosis. Colonic hypomotility has been shown to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when gastrointestinal function is measured objectively using radiopaque markers. Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis. A Cochrane review found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other antipsychotic medication. Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of laxatives for all clozapine-treated people has been shown to improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae. === Hypersalivation === Hypersalivation, or the excessive production of saliva, is one of the most common adverse effects of clozapine (30–80%). The saliva production is especially bothersome at night and first thing in the morning, as the immobility of sleep precludes the normal clearance of saliva by swallowing that occurs throughout the day. While clozapine is a muscarinic antagonist at the M1, M2, M3, and M5 receptors, clozapine is a full agonist at the M4 subset. Because M4 is highly expressed in the salivary gland, its M4 agonist activity is thought to be responsible for hypersalivation. clozapine-induced hypersalivation is likely a dose-related phenomenon, and tends to be worse when first starting the medication. Besides decreasing the dose or slowing the initial dose titration, other interventions that have shown some benefit include systemically absorbed anticholinergic medications such as hyoscine, diphenhydramine and topical anticholinergic medications like ipratropium bromide. Mild hypersalivation may be managed by sleeping with a towel over the pillow at night. === Central nervous system === CNS side effects include drowsiness, vertigo, headache, tremor, syncope, sleep disturbances, nightmares, restlessness, akinesia, agitation, seizures, rigidity, akathisia, confusion, fatigue, insomnia, hyperkinesia, weakness, lethargy, ataxia, slurred speech, depression, myoclonic jerks, and anxiety. Rarely seen are delusions, hallucinations, delirium, amnesia, libido increase or decrease, paranoia and irritability, abnormal EEG, worsening of psychosis, paresthesia, status epilepticus, and obsessive compulsive symptoms. Similar to other antipsychotics, clozapine rarely has been known to cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome. === Urinary incontinence === Clozapine is linked to urinary incontinence, though its appearance may be under-recognized. This side-effect may be amendable to bethanechol. === Withdrawal effects === Abrupt withdrawal may lead to cholinergic rebound effects, such as indigestion, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, overabundance of saliva, profuse sweating, insomnia, and agitation. Abrupt withdrawal can also cause severe movement disorders, catatonia, and psychosis. Doctors have recommended that patients, families, and caregivers be made aware of the symptoms and risks of abrupt withdrawal of clozapine. When discontinuing clozapine, gradual dose reduction is recommended to reduce the intensity of withdrawal effects. === Weight gain and diabetes === In addition to hyperglycemia, significant weight gain is frequently experienced by patients treated with clozapine. Impaired glucose metabolism and obesity have been shown to be constituents of the metabolic syndrome and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The data suggest that clozapine may be more likely to cause adverse metabolic effects than some of the other atypical antipsychotics. For people who gain weight because of clozapine, taking metformin may reportedly improve three of the five components of the metabolic syndrome: waist circumference, fasting glucose, and fasting triglycerides. === Pneumonia === International adverse drug effect databases indicate that clozapine use is associated with a significantly increased incidence of and death from pneumonia and this may be one of the most significant adverse events. The mechanisms for this are unknown although it has been speculated that it may be related to hypersalivation or the immune effects of clozapine's effects on the resolution of inflammation. === Overdose === Symptoms of overdose can be variable, but often include; sedation, confusion, tachycardia, seizures and ataxia. Fatalities have been reported due to clozapine overdose, though overdoses of greater than 5000 mg have been survived. == Drug interactions == Fluvoxamine inhibits the metabolism of clozapine leading to significantly increased blood levels of clozapine. When carbamazepine is concurrently used with clozapine, it has been shown to decrease plasma levels of clozapine significantly thereby decreasing the beneficial effects of clozapine. Patients should be monitored for ""decreased therapeutic effects of clozapine if carbamazepine"" is started or increased. If carbamazepine is discontinued or the dose of carbamazepine is decreased, therapeutic effects of clozapine should be monitored. The study recommends carbamazepine to not be used concurrently with clozapine due to increased risk of agranulocytosis. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and clozapine is a major CYP1A2 substrate. Randomized study reported elevation in clozapine concentration in subjects concurrently taking ciprofloxacin. Thus, the prescribing information for clozapine recommends ""reducing the dose of clozapine by one-third of original dose"" when ciprofloxacin and other CYP1A2 inhibitors are added to therapy, but once ciprofloxacin is removed from therapy, it is recommended to return clozapine to original dose. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === [Historical introduction of Clozapine's significance as first neuroleptic performing atypical] Since the first neuroleptical ever became popular, there is debate about how to measure and objektify the effective doses for schizophrenics. It started with a definition for an individual treshold for a patiened defined for the dose by which the patient develops a hyperkinese in his handwriting. Then due to improvements of measuring it became popular that the affinity to bind to dopaminreceptors (mostly D2 receptors) was the new method to compare neuroleptics. However since the new ""atypical"" neuroleptics have reached the market, also the measurements according to the dopamine D2 affinity became outdated and even a new referencevalue for a comparison of potency between atypicals seems to be not desperatly needed since one can say that every atypical has its unique mechanism so instead of potency camparison it is most of the time enough to work with doseequivalents. Also the historically first measurement regarding the so called ""neuroleptic treshold"" (as above mentioned) isn't 100% accurate as this sideeffects also depending on how every individual drug react with every individual's brain, so with this technique, even then, one needed to operate with the so called ""neuroleptic disposition"", a factor used to compensate the individual response and reaction to epms-effects for a better regarding of the outcomes, plus for an easier integration in statistics. But also at the second ""newer"" potency measurement, you can see that epms-sideeffects doesn't follow one strict rule, as for example despite perphenazines twothird fold less value in neuroleptical potency compared to haloperidole, it has, in same dosages aproximately the same severe epms-effects. Clozapine is classified as an atypical antipsychotic drug because it binds to serotonin as well as dopamine receptors. It acts as an antagonist at both receptors. Clozapine is an inverse agonist at the 5-HT2A subtype of the serotonin receptor, putatively improving depression, anxiety, and the negative cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. A direct interaction of clozapine with the GABAB receptor has also been shown. GABAB receptor-deficient mice exhibit increased extracellular dopamine levels and altered locomotor behaviour equivalent to that in schizophrenia animal models. GABAB receptor agonists and positive allosteric modulators reduce the locomotor changes in these models. Clozapine induces the release of glutamate and D-serine, an agonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, from astrocytes, and reduces the expression of astrocytic glutamate transporters. These are direct effects that are also present in astrocyte cell cultures not containing neurons. Clozapine prevents impaired NMDA receptor expression caused by NMDA receptor antagonists. === Pharmacokinetics === The absorption of clozapine is almost complete following oral administration, but the oral bioavailability is only 60 to 70% due to first-pass metabolism. The time to peak concentration after oral dosing is about 2.5 hours, and food does not appear to affect the bioavailability of clozapine. However, it was shown that co-administration of food decreases the rate of absorption. The elimination half-life of clozapine is about 14 hours at steady state conditions (varying with daily dose). Clozapine is extensively metabolized in the liver, via the cytochrome P450 system, to polar metabolites suitable for elimination in the urine and feces. The major metabolite, norclozapine (desmethyl-clozapine), is pharmacologically active. The cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 1A2 is primarily responsible for clozapine metabolism, but 2C, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A3/4 appear to play roles as well. Agents that induce (e.g., cigarette smoke) or inhibit (e.g., theophylline, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) CYP1A2 may increase or decrease, respectively, the metabolism of clozapine. For example, the induction of metabolism caused by smoking means that smokers require up to double the dose of clozapine compared with non-smokers to achieve an equivalent plasma concentration. Clozapine and norclozapine (desmethyl-clozapine) plasma levels may also be monitored, though they show a significant degree of variation and are higher in women and increase with age. Monitoring of plasma levels of clozapine and norclozapine has been shown to be useful in assessment of compliance, metabolic status, prevention of toxicity, and in dose optimisation. == Chemistry == Clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine that is structurally very similar to loxapine (originally deemed a typical antipsychotic). It is slightly soluble in water, soluble in acetone, and highly soluble in chloroform. Its solubility in water is 0.1889 mg/L (25 °C). Its manufacturer, Novartis, claims a solubility of <0.01% in water (<100 mg/L). == Economics == Despite the expense of the risk monitoring and management systems required, clozapine use is highly cost effective, with a number of studies suggesting savings of tens of thousands of dollars per patient per year compared to other antipsychotics, as well as advantages regarding improvements in quality of life. Clozapine is available as a generic medication. == References == == Further reading ==",Fazaclo,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.676981345459353e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00015484087634831667), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004090751986950636)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/fazaclo.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='FazaClo: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/fazaclo.html?utm_source=openai')])"
725,"('Phenoxybenzamine (hydrochloride)', 'Phenoxybenzamine', 'Dibenylin', 'Dibenyline', 'Dibenzyline')",Medical,"Phenoxybenzamine (PBZ, marketed under the trade names Dibenzyline and Dibenyline) is a non-selective, irreversible alpha blocker. == Uses == It is used in the treatment of hypertension, and specifically that caused by pheochromocytoma. It has a slower onset and a longer-lasting effect compared with other alpha blockers. It was also the first alpha blocker to be used for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, although it is currently seldom used for that indication due to unfavourable side effects. It has been used in the treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. It is also used in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type 1 due to its antiadrenergic effects. It has shown to be beneficial if used in the first 3 months of the CRPS diagnosis. === Investigational === Phenoxybenzamine has long been known to block ejaculation without affecting semen quality or ability to achieve orgasm, which could make it an effective male contraceptive. This effect is completely reversible, and is believed to be the result of alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade in the longitudinal muscles of the vas deferens. A dose of 20 mg/day results in aspermia due to reversible paralyzing effects on the vas deferens, ampulla, and ejaculatory ducts. Due to these actions, phenoxybenzamine is also useful for the treatment of premature ejaculation in men. == Pharmacology == Phenoxybenzamine is used as an anti-hypertensive due to its efficacy in reducing the vasoconstriction caused by epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. Phenoxybenzamine forms a permanent covalent bond with adrenergic receptors. Based on known information about the structures of these receptors, it likely involves attack by the cysteine at position 3.36 in transmembrane helix 3 to form a stable linkage. Thus, it remains permanently bound to the receptor, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. This causes vasodilation in blood vessels, due to its antagonistic effect at the alpha-1 adrenoceptor found in the walls of blood vessels, resulting in a drop in blood pressure. A side effect of phenoxybenzamine is reflex tachycardia. As a non-selective alpha receptor antagonist, it will also affect both the postsynaptic alpha-1 and presynaptic alpha-2 receptors in the nervous system, and so reduce sympathetic activity. This results in further vasodilation, pupil constriction, an increase in GI tract motility and secretions, and glycogen synthesis. Clinically, non-selective alpha antagonists block alpha receptors (but do not differentiate between alpha-1 and alpha-2). They are used as antihypertensives because they block alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction. The block on alpha-2 receptors further potentiates beta-effects, increasing cardiac output. Phenoxybenzamine has a long-lasting action, binding covalently to the alpha receptors. Its only current clinical use is in preparing patients with pheochromocytoma for surgery; its irreversible antagonism and the resultant depression in the maximum of the agonist dose-response curve are desirable in a situation where surgical manipulation of the tumour may release a large bolus of pressor amine into the circulation. Typically, phenoxybenzamine is not used in the long term, as new receptors are made to upregulate alpha stimulation. The main limiting side-effects of alpha antagonists is that the baroreceptor reflex is disrupted and thus this can cause postural hypotension. Phenoxybenzamine also has irreversible antagonist/weak partial agonist properties at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Due to its 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, phenoxybenzamine is useful in the treatment of carcinoid tumor, a neoplasm that secretes large amounts of serotonin and causes diarrhea, bronchoconstriction, and flushing. == Stereoisomerism == Phenoxybenzamine contains a stereocenter, so there are two enantiomers, the (R)- and the (S)-forms.

It was approved for medical use in the European Union in October 2005, and in the United States in September 2006. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Posaconazole is used to treat invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections. It is also used for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), including OPC refractory to itraconazole and/or fluconazole therapy. It is also used to treat invasive infections by Candida, Mucor, and Aspergillus species in severely immunocompromised patients. Clinical evidence for its utility in treatment of invasive disease caused by Fusarium species (fusariosis) is limited. It appears to be helpful in a mouse model of naegleriasis. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Posaconazole works by disrupting the close packing of acyl chains of phospholipids, impairing the functions of certain membrane-bound enzyme systems such as ATPase and enzymes of the electron transport system, thus inhibiting growth of the fungi. It does this by blocking the synthesis of ergosterol by inhibiting of the enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase and accumulation of methylated sterol precursors.

728,"('Risperidone', 'R 64 766', 'Risperdal', 'Risperidal', 'Rispolept')",Medical,"Risperidone, sold under the brand name Risperdal among others, is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as aggressive and self-injurious behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder. It is taken either by mouth or by injection (i.e., subcutaneous or intramuscular). The injectable versions are long-acting and last for 2–4 weeks. Common side effects include weight gain, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, elevated prolactin levels, and restlessness. Serious side effects may include the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, as well as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, an increased risk of suicide, and high blood sugar levels. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, it may increase the risk of death. It is unknown if it is safe for use in pregnancy. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear, but is believed to be related to its action as a dopamine and serotonin antagonist. Study of risperidone began in the late 1980s and it was approved for sale in the United States in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 183rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Risperidone is mainly used for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism. === Schizophrenia === Risperidone is effective in treating psychogenic polydipsia and the acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. Studies evaluating the utility of risperidone by mouth for maintenance therapy have reached varying conclusions. A 2012 systematic review concluded that evidence is strong that risperidone is more effective than all first-generation antipsychotics other than haloperidol, but that evidence directly supporting its superiority to placebo is equivocal. A 2011 review concluded that risperidone is more effective in relapse prevention than other first- and second-generation antipsychotics with the exception of olanzapine and clozapine. A 2016 Cochrane review suggests that risperidone reduces the overall symptoms of schizophrenia, but firm conclusions are difficult to make due to very low-quality evidence. Data and information are scarce, poorly reported, and probably biased in favour of risperidone, with about half of the included trials developed by drug companies. The article raises concerns regarding the serious side effects of risperidone, such as parkinsonism. A 2011 Cochrane review compared risperidone with other atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine for schizophrenia: Long-acting injectable formulations of antipsychotic drugs provide improved compliance with therapy and reduce relapse rates relative to oral formulations. The efficacy of risperidone long-acting injection appears to be similar to that of long-acting injectable forms of first-generation antipsychotics. === Bipolar disorder === Second-generation antipsychotics, including risperidone, are effective in the treatment of manic symptoms in acute manic or mixed exacerbations of bipolar disorder. In children and adolescents, risperidone may be more effective than lithium or valproate, but has more metabolic side effects. As maintenance therapy, long-acting injectable risperidone is effective for the prevention of manic episodes but not depressive episodes. The long-acting injectable form of risperidone may be advantageous over long-acting first-generation antipsychotics, as it is better tolerated (fewer extrapyramidal effects) and because long acting injectable formulations of first-generation antipsychotics may increase the risk of depression. === Autism === Compared to placebo, risperidone treatment reduces certain problematic behaviors in autistic children, including aggression toward others, self-injury, challenging behavior, and rapid mood changes. The evidence for its efficacy appears to be greater than that for alternative pharmacological treatments. Weight gain is an important adverse effect. Some authors recommend limiting the use of risperidone and aripiprazole to those with the most challenging behavioral disturbances to minimize the risk of drug-induced adverse effects. Evidence for the efficacy of risperidone in autistic adolescents and young adults is less persuasive. === Dementia === While antipsychotic medications such as risperidone have a slight benefit in people with dementia, they have been linked to a higher incidence of death and stroke. Because of this increased risk of death, treatment of dementia-related psychosis with risperidone is not FDA-approved and carries a black box warning. However, many other jurisdictions regularly use it to control severe aggression and psychosis in those with dementia when other non-pharmacological interventions have failed and their pharmaceutical regulators have approved its use in this population. === Other uses === Risperidone has demonstrated clinical benefit as an augmentation agent in the management of (unipolar) non-psychotic treatment-resistant depression alongside antidepressant treatment. Atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, are among the most common augments for antidepressant therapy. Such usage occurs off-label in most jurisdictions and the risk of adverse effects (e.g., weight gain, movement disorders) must be carefully weighed against the clinical benefit. Risperidone has shown promise in treating therapy-resistant obsessive–compulsive disorder, when serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone are not sufficient. Risperidone has proven to be effective in treatment of aggression associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or with another mental condition. Risperidone has not demonstrated a benefit in the treatment of eating disorders or personality disorders, except for limited evidence in schizotypal personality disorder. === Available forms === Available forms of risperidone include tablet, orally dissolving tablet, oral solution, and powder and solvent for injection. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include movement problems, sleepiness, dizziness, trouble seeing, constipation, and increased weight. About 9 to 20% of people gained more than 7% of the baseline weight depending on the dose. Serious side effects may include the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, as well as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, an increased risk of suicide, and high blood sugar levels. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, it may increase the risk of death. While atypical antipsychotics appear to have a lower rate of movement problems as compared to typical antipsychotics, risperidone has a high risk of movement problems among the atypicals. Atypical antipsychotics, however, are associated with a greater amount of weight gain and other metabolic side effects. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. === Dementia === Older people with dementia-related psychosis are at a higher risk of death. == Interactions == Carbamazepine and other enzyme inducers may reduce plasma levels of risperidone. If a person is taking both carbamazepine and risperidone, the dose of risperidone will likely need to be increased. The new dose should not be more than twice the patient's original dose. CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as SSRI medications, may increase plasma levels of risperidone and those medications. Since risperidone can cause hypotension, its use should be monitored closely when a patient is also taking antihypertensive medicines to avoid severe low blood pressure. Risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone are reduced in efficacy by P-glycoprotein inducers such as St John's wort. Risperidone has been found to dose-dependently block the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Risperidone has been classified as a ""qualitatively atypical"" antipsychotic agent with a relatively low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (when given at low doses) that has more pronounced serotonin antagonism than dopamine antagonism. Risperidone contains the functional groups of benzisoxazole and piperidine as part of its molecular structure. Although not a butyrophenone, it was developed with the structures of benperidol and ketanserin as a basis. It has actions at several 5-HT (serotonin) receptor subtypes. These are 5-HT2C, linked to weight gain, and 5-HT2A, linked to its antipsychotic action and relief of some of the extrapyramidal side effects experienced with typical antipsychotics. It has been found that D-amino acid oxidase, the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of D-amino acids (e.g. D-alanine and D-serine — the neurotransmitters) is inhibited by risperidone. Risperidone acts on the following receptors: Dopamine receptors: This drug is an antagonist of the D1 (D1, and D5) as well as the D2 (D2, D3 and D4) family receptors, with 70-fold selectivity for the D2 family. It has ""tight binding"" properties, which means it has a long half-life. Like other antipsychotics, risperidone blocks the mesolimbic pathway, the prefrontal cortex limbic pathway, and the tuberoinfundibular pathway in the central nervous system. Risperidone may induce extrapyramidal side effects, akathisia and tremors, which is associated with diminished dopaminergic activity in the striatum. It can also cause sexual side effects, galactorrhoea, infertility, gynecomastia, and, with chronic use, reduced bone mineral density leading to breaks, all of which are associated with increased prolactin secretion. Alpha α1 adrenergic receptors: This action accounts for the orthostatic hypotensive effects and perhaps some of the sedating effects of risperidone. Alpha α2 adrenergic receptors: Risperidone's action at these receptors may cause greater positive, negative, affective, and cognitive symptom control. Histamine H1 receptors: effects on these receptors account for its sedation and reduction in vigilance. This may also lead to drowsiness and weight gain. Voltage-gated sodium channels: Because it accumulates in synaptic vesicles, Risperidone inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels at clinically used concentrations. === Pharmacokinetics === Risperidone undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Lower doses are recommended for patients with severe liver and kidney disease. The active metabolite of risperidone, paliperidone, is also used as an antipsychotic. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Risperidone was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993 for the treatment of schizophrenia. In 2003, the FDA approved risperidone for the short-term treatment of the mixed and manic states associated with bipolar disorder. In 2006, the FDA approved risperidone for the treatment of irritability in autistic children and adolescents. The FDA's decision was based in part on a study of autistic people with severe and enduring problems of violent meltdowns, aggression, and self-injury; risperidone is not recommended for autistic people with mild aggression and explosive behavior without an enduring pattern. On 22 August 2007, risperidone was approved as the only drug agent available for the treatment of schizophrenia in youths, ages 13–17; it was also approved that same day for the treatment of bipolar disorder in youths, ages 10–17, joining lithium. On 16 December 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) formally recommended market authorization for Okedi, a long-acting depot injection of risperidone. Okedi was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults for whom the tolerability and effectiveness of risperidone had already been established using an oral formulation. Long-acting depot injectable risperidone was approved for medical use in the European Union in February 2022. === Lawsuits === In April 2012, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. were fined $1.2 billion for downplaying multiple risks associated with risperidone. The verdict was later reversed by the Arkansas state supreme court. In August 2012, J&J agreed to pay $181 million to 36 US states to settle claims that it had promoted risperidone and paliperidone for off-label uses including for dementia, anger management, and anxiety. In November 2013, J&J was fined $2.2 billion for illegally marketing risperidone for use in people with dementia and paying kickbacks to prescribing physicians and nursing home pharmacies. In 2015, Steven Brill wrote an investigative journalism piece about J&J in The Huffington Post focused on J&J's marketing of risperidone. J&J has faced numerous civil lawsuits on behalf of children who were prescribed risperidone who grew breasts (a condition called gynecomastia); as of July 2016 there were about 1,500 cases in Pennsylvania state court in Philadelphia, and there had been a February 2015 verdict against J&J with $2.5 million awarded to a man from Alabama, a $1.75 million verdict against J&J that November, and in 2016 a $70 million verdict against J&J. In October 2019, a jury ordered J&J to pay $8 billion in punitive damages to a Pennsylvania man who had grown breasts during adolescence. This verdict amount chosen by the jury was reduced more than 1,000-fold by a judge in January 2020, with the new punitive damages being $6.8 million. A legal scholar commented that punitive damages which exceed the compensatory damages by a factor of 10 or more in cases of this type are usually found to be legally invalid. === Brand names === Janssen's patent on risperidone expired in December 2003, opening the market for cheaper generic versions from other companies, and Janssen's exclusive marketing rights expired in June 2004 (the result of a pediatric extension). It is available under many brand names worldwide. Risperidone is available as a tablet, an oral solution, and an ampule, which is a depot injection. Brand names include Risperdal, Risperdal Consta, Risperdal M-Tab, Risperdal Quicklets, Risperlet, Okedi, and Perseris. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2017).

TAK-733 is a highly potent and selective investigational novel MEK allosteric site inhibitor. In a preclinical study of TAK-733, a panel of CRC cell lines were exposed to varying concentrations of the agent for 72 hours followed by a sulforhodamine B assay. Twenty patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts were then treated with TAK-733 in vivo. Tumor growth inhibition index (TGII) was assessed to evaluate the sensitivity of the CRC explants to TAK-733 while linear regression was utilized to investigate the predictive effects of genotype on the TGII of explants. Fifty-four CRC cell lines were exposed to TAK-733, while 42 cell lines were deemed sensitive across a broad range of mutations. Eighty-two percent of the cell lines within the sensitive subset were BRAF or KRAS/NRAS mutant, whereas 80% of the cell lines within the sensitive subset were PIK3CA WT. Twenty patient-derived human tumor CRC explants were then treated with TAK-733. In total, 15 primary human tumor explants were found to be sensitive to TAK-733 (TGII ≤ 20%), including 9 primary human tumor explants that exhibited tumor regression (TGII > 100%). Explants with a BRAF/KRAS/NRAS mutant and PIK3CA wild-type genotype demonstrated increased sensitivity to TAK-733 with a median TGII of -6%. MEK-response gene signatures also correlated with responsiveness to TAK-733 in KRAS-mutant CRC. The MEK inhibitor TAK-733 demonstrated robust antitumor activity against CRC cell lines and patient-derived tumor explants. While the preclinical activity observed in this study was considerable, single-agent efficacy in the clinic has been limited in CRC, supporting the use of these models in an iterative manner to elucidate resistance mechanisms that can guide rational combination strategies. The goal of this study was to investigate the activity of the selective MEK1/2 inhibitor TAK-733 in both melanoma cell lines and patient-derived melanoma xenograft models. In vitro cell proliferation assays using the sulforhodamine B assay were conducted to determine TAK-733 potency and melanoma responsiveness. In vivo murine modeling with eleven patient-derived melanoma explants evaluated daily dosing of TAK-733 at 25 or 10 mg/kg. Immunoblotting was performed to evaluate on-target activity and downstream inhibition by TAK-733 in both in vitro and in vivo studies. TAK-733 demonstrated broad activity in most melanoma cell lines with relative resistance observed at IC50 > 0.1 μmol/L in vitro. TAK-733 also exhibited activity in 10 out of 11 patient-derived explants with tumor growth inhibition ranging from 0% to 100% (P < 0.001-0.03). Interestingly, BRAF(V600E) and NRAS mutational status did not correlate with responsiveness to TAK-733. Pharmacodynamically, pERK was suppressed in sensitive cell lines and tumor explants, confirming TAK-733-mediated inhibition of MEK1/2, although the demonstration of similar effects in the relatively resistant cell lines and tumor explants suggests that escape pathways are contributing to melanoma survival and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TAK-733 exhibits robust tumor growth inhibition and regression against human melanoma cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models, suggesting that further clinical development in melanoma is of scientific interest. Particularly interesting is the activity in BRAF wild-type models, where current approved therapy such as vemurafenib has been reported not to be active. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) for monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of TAK-733, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, in nude rats bearing A549 (human lung carcinoma) xenografts. TAK-733 was administered orally by gavage to nude xenograft rats for 2 weeks, at dosage levels of 0 (0.5% w/v methylcellulose solution), 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day (n = 8/dose). Tumor size was measured before treatment (day 0), and on days 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, and 14. PET scans were performed pretreatment (day 0), and on days 2, 4, 7, 10, and 14. Tracer accumulations in tumor tissue were quantified as the mean standard uptake value (SUVmean). No deaths or treatment-related body weight losses occurred during the study period. TAK-733 showed dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth and (18)F-FDG uptake in tumor tissue. At a dosage of 10 mg/kg, TAK-733 treatment produced a statistically significant reduction in tumor weight from day 11 compared with the vehicle group (P < 0.05). Tumor growth was inhibited in the 10 mg/kg group with a treated/control value of 31% on day 14. The SUVmean on day 2 in this dosage group was statistically lower than that observed on day 0, and that seen in the vehicle group on day 2 (P < 0.05 for both comparisons). Furthermore, this reduction in SUVmean at 10 mg/kg was maintained over time. In the two lower dosage groups (1 and 3 mg/kg), SUVmean gradually increased over time. (18)F-FDG-PET enabled early determination of late anti-tumor activity in response to TAK-733 treatment.",Mek inhibitor tak-733,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.061968132853507996), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002267648698762059), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02325441502034664)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.7610454708337784e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650277/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5306265/,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10637-016-0391-2/ ', [])"
730,"('Radafaxine (hydrochloride)', 'Radafaxine', '(s,s)-hydroxy bupropion', '(2s,3s)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-3,5,5-trimethylmorpholin-2-ol', 'Radafaxine [inn]')",Medical,"Radafaxine (developmental code GW-353,162; also known as (2S,3S)-hydroxybupropion or (S,S)-hydroxybupropion) is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) which was under development by GlaxoSmithKline in the 2000s for a variety of different indications but was never marketed. These uses included treatment of restless legs syndrome, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and obesity. Regulatory filing was planned for 2007, but development was discontinued in 2006 due to ""poor test results"". == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Radafaxine is described as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). In contrast to bupropion, it appears to have a higher potency on inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake than on dopamine reuptake. Radafaxine has about 70% of the efficacy of bupropion in blocking dopamine reuptake, and 392% of efficacy in blocking norepinephrine reuptake, making it fairly selective for inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine over dopamine. This, according to GlaxoSmithKline, may account for the increased effect of radafaxine on pain and fatigue. At least one study suggests that radafaxine has a low abuse potential similar to bupropion. == Chemistry == Radafaxine is a potent metabolite of bupropion, the compound in GlaxoSmithKline's Wellbutrin. More specifically, hydroxybupropion is a major metabolite of bupropion that is further metabolized via an intramolecular cyclization to give radafaxine as the (2S,3S) isomer, as well as the corresponding (2R,3R) isomer isomer, which is less pharmacologically active as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor than radafaxine. Manifaxine (GW-320,659) was developed as an analogue of radafaxine and has been studied for the treatment of ADHD and obesity. == See also == (2R,3R)-Hydroxybupropion 3-Chlorophenmetrazine Manifaxine == References == == External links == Media related to Radafaxine at Wikimedia Commons",Radafaxine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -4.961759259458631e-06)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006842396222054958), ('ICAL', -1.7523612768854946e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1269819140434265)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.935296834039036e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radafaxine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Radafaxine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radafaxine?utm_source=openai')])"

732,"('Loperamide (hydrochloride)', 'Loperamide', 'Imodium', 'Loperamida', 'Loperamidum')",Medical,"Loperamide, sold under the brand name Imodium, among others, is a medication of the opioid receptor agonist class used to decrease the frequency of diarrhea. It is often used for this purpose in irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. It is not recommended for those with blood in the stool, mucus in the stool, or fevers. The medication is taken by mouth. Common side effects include abdominal pain, constipation, sleepiness, vomiting, and dry mouth. It may increase the risk of toxic megacolon. Loperamide's safety in pregnancy is unclear, but no evidence of harm has been found. It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. It is an opioid with no significant absorption from the gut and does not cross the blood–brain barrier when used at normal doses. It works by slowing the contractions of the intestines. Loperamide was first made in 1969 and used medically in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Loperamide is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 297th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Loperamide is effective for the treatment of a number of types of diarrhea. This includes control of acute nonspecific diarrhea, mild traveler's diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic diarrhea due to bowel resection, and chronic diarrhea secondary to inflammatory bowel disease. It is also useful for reducing ileostomy output. Off-label uses for loperamide also include chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, especially related to irinotecan use. Loperamide should not be used as the primary treatment in cases of bloody diarrhea, acute exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, or bacterial enterocolitis. Loperamide is often compared to diphenoxylate. Studies suggest that loperamide is more effective and has lower neural side effects. == Side effects == Adverse drug reactions most commonly associated with loperamide are constipation (which occurs in 1.7–5.3% of users), dizziness (up to 1.4%), nausea (0.7–3.2%), and abdominal cramps (0.5–3.0%). Rare, but more serious, side effects include toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus, angioedema, anaphylaxis/allergic reactions, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, urinary retention, and heat stroke. The most frequent symptoms of loperamide overdose are drowsiness, vomiting, and abdominal pain, or burning. High doses may result in heart problems such as abnormal heart rhythms. === Contraindications === Treatment should be avoided in the presence of high fever or if the stool is bloody. Treatment is not recommended for people who could have negative effects from rebound constipation. If suspicion exists of diarrhea associated with organisms that can penetrate the intestinal walls, such as E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella, loperamide is contraindicated as a primary treatment. Loperamide treatment is not used in symptomatic C. difficile infections, as it increases the risk of toxin retention and precipitation of toxic megacolon. Loperamide should be administered with caution to people with liver failure due to reduced first-pass metabolism. Additionally, caution should be used when treating people with advanced HIV/AIDS, as cases of both viral and bacterial toxic megacolon have been reported. If abdominal distension is noted, therapy with loperamide should be discontinued. === Children === The use of loperamide in children under two years is not recommended. Rare reports of fatal paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention have been made. Most of these reports occurred in the setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with very young children less than two years of age. A review of loperamide in children under 12 years old found that serious adverse events occurred only in children under three years old. The study reported that the use of loperamide should be contraindicated in children who are under 3, systemically ill, malnourished, moderately dehydrated, or have bloody diarrhea. In 1990, all formulations for children of the antidiarrheal loperamide were banned in Pakistan. The National Health Service in the United Kingdom recommends that loperamide should only be given to children under the age of twelve if prescribed by a doctor. Formulations for children are only available on prescription in the UK. === Pregnancy and breast feeding === Loperamide is not recommended in the United Kingdom for use during pregnancy or by nursing mothers. Studies in rat models have shown no teratogenicity, but sufficient studies in humans have not been conducted. One controlled, prospective study of 89 women exposed to loperamide during their first trimester of pregnancy showed no increased risk of malformations. This, however, was only one study with a small sample size. Loperamide can be present in breast milk and is not recommended for breastfeeding mothers. == Drug interactions == Loperamide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein; therefore, the concentration of loperamide increases when given with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Common P-glycoprotein inhibitors include quinidine, ritonavir, and ketoconazole. Loperamide can decrease the absorption of some other drugs. As an example, saquinavir concentrations can decrease by half when given with loperamide. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal agent, which decreases intestinal movement. As such, when combined with other antimotility drugs, the risk of constipation is increased. These drugs include other opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and anticholinergics. == Mechanism of action == Loperamide is an opioid-receptor agonist and acts on the μ-opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus of the large intestine. It works like morphine, decreasing the activity of the myenteric plexus, which decreases the tone of the longitudinal and circular smooth muscles of the intestinal wall. This increases the time material stays in the intestine, allowing more water to be absorbed from the fecal matter. It also decreases colonic mass movements and suppresses the gastrocolic reflex. Loperamide's circulation in the bloodstream is limited in two ways. Efflux by P-glycoprotein in the intestinal wall reduces the passage of loperamide, and the fraction of drug crossing is then further reduced through first-pass metabolism by the liver. Loperamide metabolizes into an MPTP-like compound, but is unlikely to exert neurotoxicity. === Blood–brain barrier === Efflux by P-glycoprotein also prevents circulating loperamide from effectively crossing the blood-brain barrier, so it can generally only agonize mu-opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system, and currently has a score of one on the anticholinergic cognitive burden scale. Concurrent administration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as quinidine potentially allows loperamide to cross the blood-brain barrier and produce central morphine-like effects. At high doses (>70mg), loperamide can saturate P-glycoprotein (thus overcoming the efflux) and produce euphoric effects. Loperamide taken with quinidine was found to produce respiratory depression, indicative of central opioid action. High doses of loperamide have been shown to cause a mild physical dependence during preclinical studies, specifically in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys. Symptoms of mild opiate withdrawal were observed following abrupt discontinuation of long-term treatment of animals with loperamide. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === Loperamide is synthesized starting from the lactone 3,3-diphenyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one and ethyl 4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate, on a lab scale. On a large scale a similar synthesis is followed, except that the lactone and piperidinone are produced from cheaper materials rather than purchased. === Physical properties === Loperamide is typically manufactured as the hydrochloride salt. Its main polymorph has a melting point of 224 °C and a second polymorph exists with a melting point of 218 °C. A tetrahydrate form has been identified which melts at 190 °C. == History == Loperamide hydrochloride was first synthesized in 1969 by Paul Janssen from Janssen Pharmaceuticals in Beerse, Belgium, following previous discoveries of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (1956) and fentanyl citrate (1960). The first clinical reports on loperamide were published in 1973 in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry with the inventor being one of the authors. The trial name for it was ""R-18553"". Loperamide oxide has a different research code: R-58425. The trial against placebo was conducted from December 1972 to February 1974, its results being published in 1977 in the journal Gut. In 1973, Janssen started to promote loperamide under the brand name Imodium. In December 1976, Imodium got US FDA approval. During the 1980s, Imodium became the best-selling prescription antidiarrheal in the United States. In March 1988, McNeil Pharmaceutical began selling loperamide as an over-the-counter drug under the brand name Imodium A-D. In the 1980s, loperamide also existed in the form of drops (Imodium Drops) and syrup. Initially, it was intended for children's usage, but Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew it from the market in 1990 after 18 cases of paralytic ileus (resulting in six deaths) were registered in Pakistan and reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the following years (1990-1991), products containing loperamide have been restricted for children's use in several countries (ranging from two to five years of age). In the late 1980s, before the US patent expired on 30 January 1990, McNeil started to develop Imodium Advanced containing loperamide and simethicone for treating both diarrhea and gas. In March 1997, the company patented this combination. The drug was approved in June 1997, by the FDA as Imodium Multi-Symptom Relief in the form of a chewable tablet. A caplet formulation was approved in November 2000. In November 1993, loperamide was launched as an orally disintegrating tablet based on Zydis technology. In 2013, loperamide in the form of 2-mg tablets was added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was discovered by researchers at Goethe University that Loperamide was effective at killing glioblastoma cells. == Society and culture == === Legal status === ==== United States ==== Loperamide was formerly a controlled substance in the United States. First, it was a Schedule II controlled substance. However, this was lowered to Schedule V. Loperamide was finally removed from control by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1982, courtesy of then-Administrator Francis M. Mullen Jr. ==== UK ==== Loperamide can be sold freely to the public by chemists (pharmacies) as the treatment of diarrhoea and acute diarrhoea associated with medically diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome in adults over 18 years of age === Economics === Loperamide is sold as a generic medication. In 2016, Imodium was one of the biggest-selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £32.7 million. === Brand names === Loperamide was originally marketed as Imodium, and many generic brands are sold. === Off-label/unapproved use === Loperamide has typically been deemed to have a relatively low risk of misuse. In 2012, no reports of loperamide abuse were made. In 2015, however, case reports of extremely high-dose loperamide use were published. The primary intent of users has been to manage symptoms of opioid withdrawal such as diarrhea, although a small portion derive psychoactive effects at these higher doses. At these higher doses central nervous system penetration occurs and long-term use may lead to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal on abrupt cessation. Dubbing it ""the poor man's methadone"", clinicians warned that increased restrictions on the availability of prescription opioids passed in response to the opioid epidemic were prompting recreational users to turn to loperamide as an over-the-counter treatment for withdrawal symptoms. The FDA responded to these warnings by calling on drug manufacturers to voluntarily limit the package size of loperamide for public-safety reasons. However, there is no quantity restriction on number of packages that can be purchased, and most pharmacies do not feel capable of restricting its sale, so it is unclear that this intervention will have any impact without further regulation to place loperamide behind the counter. Since 2015, several reports of sometimes-fatal cardiotoxicity due to high-dose loperamide abuse have been published. == References ==",Loperamidum,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.07287787614041e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011818574275821447)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loperamide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Loperamide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loperamide?utm_source=openai')])"

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of BET inhibitor, mivebresib, in combination with PZ703b, a Bcl-xl PROTAC, on apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. The results revealed that mivebresib and PZ703b synergistically decreased the viabilities of bladder cancer cells. Co-treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway in a caspase-dependent manner. Mechanistically, mivebresib and PZ703b treatment inhibited the expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl, accompanied by upregulation of Bim. Hence, co-treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b rebalanced the level of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in cells. Further investigations showed that forced expression of Mcl-1 or Bcl-xl markedly protected bladder cancer cells from apoptosis induced by combination treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b. In addition, knockdown of Bim also inhibited the cell death induced by mivebresib/PZ703b in bladder cancer cells. In summary, our findings reveal that the combination treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b represents a novel promising strategy to treat bladder cancer. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a serious complication that can arise from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. While current treatments for DAH have limitations and adverse side effects, recent evidence suggests that inflammatory macrophages play a crucial role in the development of DAH. In this study, we investigated Mivebresib, a BET protein-bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor, as a potential treatment for DAH. Our findings show that Mivebresib effectively protected C57BL/6J mice against pristane-induced DAH by inhibiting the migration and polarization of monocytes and macrophages, as well as pathogenic B and T cells. Specifically, Mivebresib modified the distribution of leukocytes, impeded the polarization of inflammatory macrophages, and reduced the frequency of CD19 + CD5 + B cells in the lungs of pristane-treated mice. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated that Mivebresib inhibited LPS-induced M1 polarization of macrophages and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, M1 marker genes, and chemokines-chemokine receptors while thwarting the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α. Transcriptomic analysis suggested and experiments comfimed that Mivebresib inhibits M1 polarization via interrupting the p300/BRD4/HIF1A axis. Our study demonstrates that Mivebresib has therapeutic potential for the life-threatening complication of DAH caused by SLE. By inhibiting macrophage polarization and the infiltration of inflammatory cells, Mivebresib may offer a promising treatment option for patients suffering from this disease. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for nearly 15% of all lung cancers. Although patients respond to first-line therapy readily, rapid relapse is inevitable, with few treatment options in the second-line setting. Here, we describe SCLC cell lines harboring amplification of MYC and MYCN but not MYCL1 or non-amplified MYC cell lines exhibit superior sensitivity to treatment with the pan-BET bromodomain protein inhibitor mivebresib (ABBV075).

736,"('Fluconazole', 'Diflucan', 'Triflucan', 'Biozolene', 'Elazor')",Medical,"Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used for a number of fungal infections. This includes candidiasis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, dermatophytosis, and tinea versicolor. It is also used to prevent candidiasis in those who are at high risk such as following organ transplantation, low birth weight babies, and those with low blood neutrophil counts. It is given either by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and increased liver enzymes. Serious side effects may include liver problems, QT prolongation, and seizures. During pregnancy it may increase the risk of miscarriage while large doses may cause birth defects. Fluconazole is in the azole antifungal family of medication. It is believed to work by affecting the fungal cellular membrane. Fluconazole was patented in 1981 and came into commercial use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Fluconazole is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 160th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Fluconazole is a first-generation triazole antifungal medication. It differs from earlier azole antifungals (such as ketoconazole) in that its structure contains a triazole ring instead of an imidazole ring. While the imidazole antifungals are mainly used topically, fluconazole and certain other triazole antifungals are preferred when systemic treatment is required because of their improved safety and predictable absorption when administered orally. Fluconazole's spectrum of activity includes most Candida species (but not Candida krusei or Candida glabrata), Cryptococcus neoformans, some dimorphic fungi, and dermatophytes, among others. Common uses include: The treatment of non-systemic Candida infections of the vagina (""yeast infections""), throat, and mouth. Certain systemic Candida infections in people with healthy immune systems, including infections of the bloodstream, kidney, or joints. Other antifungals are usually preferred when the infection is in the heart or central nervous system, and for the treatment of active infections in people with weak immune systems. The prevention of Candida infections in people with weak immune systems, such as those neutropenic due to cancer chemotherapy, those with advanced HIV infections, transplant patients, and premature infants. As a second-line agent for the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, a fungal infection of the central nervous system. === Resistance === Antifungal resistance to drugs in the azole class tends to occur gradually over the course of prolonged drug therapy, resulting in clinical failure in immunocompromised patients (e.g., patients with advanced HIV receiving treatment for thrush or esophageal Candida infection). In C. albicans, resistance occurs by way of mutations in the ERG11 gene, which codes for 14α-demethylase. These mutations prevent the azole drug from binding, while still allowing binding of the enzyme's natural substrate, lanosterol. Development of resistance to one azole in this way will confer resistance to all drugs in the class. Another resistance mechanism employed by both C. albicans and C. glabrata is increasing the rate of efflux of the azole drug from the cell, by both ATP-binding cassette and major facilitator superfamily transporters. Other gene mutations are also known to contribute to development of resistance. C. glabrata develops resistance by up regulating CDR genes, and resistance in C. krusei is mediated by reduced sensitivity of the target enzyme to inhibition by the agent. The full spectrum of fungal susceptibility and resistance to fluconazole can be found in the product data sheet. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fluconazole resistance among Candida strains in the US is about 7%. === Combating Resistance === The rising fungal resistance to fluconazole and related azole drugs spurs the need to find effective combative solutions swiftly. Rising resistance raises concerns since fluconazole is commonly used due to its inexpensiveness and ease of administration, according to the World Health Organization. One possible solution to counter the increasing prevalence of Candida infections–fungal infections caused by the yeast Candida–is combination antifungal therapy, combining natural components with commercial antifungal drugs to combat resistance. Research shows that natural substances can have specified interactions with cell components, increasing the intracellular concentration of associated antifungal drugs and their effectiveness. For example, Brazilian red propolis, an organic bee liquid, synergizes with fluconazole to combat common yeast infections such as C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. The essential oil from Nectandra lanceolata, a tree species native to wet tropical biomes, plays a similar role in ciclopirox, another common antifungal. While combination therapy offers the benefits of faster and more extensive fungal eradication, including a reduced risk of resistance or tolerance, it also presents challenges. These include potential increases in toxicity, costs, and the need for standardized practices to test the efficacy of the combination. Therefore, it is crucial to critically evaluate the role of combination therapy. An alternative to combination therapy for those who had prior exposure to Azoles is antifungal drugs of class echinocandins, recommended as the first method of treatment against invasive candidiasis. The three echinocandins currently licensed for medical use, namely anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin, are potent against candidiasis, which has grown resistant to fluconazole because of the differences in their action mechanism. However, resistance to echinocandins can still develop through point mutations within highly conserved regions of the FKS1 and FKS2 genes through the exposure of members of this class. These genes encode for an enzyme called β-1,3-glucan synthase, responsible for building the yeast’s cell wall. Mutations in this enzyme reduce resistance to antifungal medications that target this enzyme and affect the yeast’s ability to construct its cell wall. Another promising avenue is the integration of phage therapy, which has shown successive results in functional therapies. Phages, viruses that infect microbes including fungi, exhibit potent antimicrobial effects against various resistant fungal strains, demonstrating remarkable specificity and efficacy. These viruses are integral components of diverse ecosystems, including the human microbiome. Their unique attributes, such as specificity, potency, compatibility with biological systems, and ability to kill fungi, make them attractive candidates for therapeutic interventions. However, challenges remain in terms of their production scalability, formulation, stability, and the emergence of fungal resistance, which hinders their widespread adoption. Prior to clinical use, phages intended for therapy require thorough purification, characterization, and validation of their virulence. While further research is needed, phage therapy holds promise in the fight against antifungal resistance that other therapies struggle to address. == Contraindications == Fluconazole is contraindicated in patients who: Drink alcohol have known hypersensitivity to other azole medicines such as ketoconazole; are taking terfenadine, if 400 mg per day multidose of fluconazole is administered; concomitant administration of fluconazole and quinidine, especially when fluconazole is administered in high dosages; take SSRIs such as fluoxetine or sertraline. == Side effects == Adverse drug reactions associated with fluconazole therapy include: Common (≥1% of patients): rash, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or elevated liver enzymes Infrequent (0.1–1% of patients): anorexia, fatigue, constipation Rare (<0.1% of patients): oliguria, hypokalaemia, paraesthesia, seizures, alopecia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, thrombocytopenia, other blood dyscrasias, serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions Very rare: prolonged QT interval, torsades de pointes In 2011, the US FDA reports that treatment with chronic, high doses of fluconazole during the first trimester of pregnancy may be associated with a rare and distinct set of birth defects in infants. If taken during pregnancy it may result in harm. These cases of harm, however, were only in women who took large doses for most of the first trimester. Fluconazole is secreted in human milk at concentrations similar to plasma. Fluconazole therapy has been associated with QT interval prolongation, which may lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, it is used with caution in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval, such as electrolyte imbalance or use of other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (particularly cisapride and pimozide). Some people are allergic to azoles, so those allergic to other azole drugs might be allergic to fluconazole. That is, some azole drugs have adverse side-effects. Some azole drugs may disrupt estrogen production in pregnancy, affecting pregnancy outcome. Oral fluconazole is not associated with a significantly increased risk of birth defects overall, although it does increase the odds ratio of tetralogy of Fallot, but the absolute risk is still low. Women using fluconazole during pregnancy have a 50% higher risk of spontaneous abortion. Fluconazole should not be taken with cisapride (Propulsid) due to the possibility of serious, even fatal, heart problems. In rare cases, severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis may occur. Powder for oral suspension contains sucrose and should not be used in patients with hereditary fructose, glucose/galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. Capsules contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption == Interactions == Fluconazole is an inhibitor of the human cytochrome P450 system, particularly the isozyme CYP2C19 (CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 to lesser extent) In theory, therefore, fluconazole decreases the metabolism and increases the concentration of any drug metabolised by these enzymes. In addition, its potential effect on QT interval increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmia if used concurrently with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Berberine has been shown to exert synergistic effects with fluconazole even in drug-resistant Candida albicans infections. Fluconazole may increase the serum concentration of Erythromycin (Risk X: avoid combination). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Like other imidazole- and triazole-class antifungals, fluconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14α-demethylase. Mammalian demethylase activity is much less sensitive to fluconazole than fungal demethylase. This inhibition prevents the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cytoplasmic membrane, and subsequent accumulation of 14α-methyl sterols. Fluconazole is primarily fungistatic; however, it may be fungicidal against certain organisms in a dose-dependent manner, specifically Cryptococcus. === Pharmacokinetics === Following oral dosing, fluconazole is almost completely absorbed within two hours. Bioavailability is not significantly affected by the absence of stomach acid. Concentrations measured in the urine, tears, and skin are approximately 10 times the plasma concentration, whereas saliva, sputum, and vaginal fluid concentrations are approximately equal to the plasma concentration, following a standard dose range of between 100 mg and 400 mg per day. The elimination half-life of fluconazole follows zero order, and only 10% of elimination is due to metabolism, the remainder being excreted in urine and sweat. Patients with impaired renal function will be at risk of overdose. In a bulk powder form, it appears as a white crystalline powder, and it is very slightly soluble in water and soluble in alcohol. == History == Fluconazole was patented by Pfizer in 1981 in the United Kingdom and came into commercial use in 1988. Patent expirations occurred in 2004 and 2005. == References == == Further reading ==",Elazor,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002799284877255559), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0033036675304174423)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/elazor?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=110, start_index=9, title='Elazor | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/elazor?utm_source=openai')])"

It is an experimental drug being studied for a potential role in the treatment of left ventricular systolic heart failure. Systolic heart failure involves a loss of effective actin-myosin cross bridges in the myocytes (heart muscle cells) of the left ventricle, which leads to a decreased ability of the heart to move blood through the body. This causes peripheral edema (blood pooling), which the sympathetic nervous system tries to correct by overstimulating the cardiac myocytes, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy, another characteristic of chronic heart failure. Inotropic therapies work by increasing the force of cardiac contraction, such as through calcium conduction or modulating adrenoreceptors. But these are limited by adverse events, including arrhythmias related to increased myocardial oxygen consumption, desensitization of adrenergic receptors, and altering intracellular calcium levels. Inotropes are also thought to be associated with worse prognosis. == Mechanism of action == Cardiac myocytes contract through a cross-bridge cycle between the myofilaments, actin and myosin. Chemical energy in the form of ATP is converted into mechanical energy which allows myosin to strongly bind to actin and produce a power stroke resulting in sarcomere shortening/contraction. Omecamtiv mecarbil specifically targets and activates myocardial ATPase and improves energy utilization. This enhances effective myosin cross-bridge formation and duration, while the velocity of contraction remains the same. Specifically, it increases the rate of phosphate release from myosin by stabilizing the pre-powerstroke and the phosphate release states, thereby accelerating the rate-determining step of the cross-bridge cycle, which is the transition of the actin-myosin complex from the weakly bound to the strongly bound state. Furthermore, once myosin is bound to actin, it stays bound dramatically longer in the presence of omecamtiv mecarbil. The combination of increased and prolonged cross-bridge formation prolongs myocardial contraction. Thus, the overall clinical result of omecamtiv mecarbil is an increase in left ventricular systolic ejection time and ejection fraction. There is a slight decrease in heart rate while myocardial oxygen consumption is unaffected. The increased cardiac output is independent of intracellular calcium and cAMP levels. Thus omecamtiv mecarbil improves systolic function by increasing the systolic ejection duration and stroke volume, without consuming more ATP energy, oxygen or altering intracellular calcium levels causing an overall improvement in cardiac efficiency. == Clinical trials == Experimental studies on rats and dogs, proved the efficacy and mechanism of action of omecamtiv mecarbil. Clinical studies on humans have shown there is a direct linear relationship between dose and systolic ejection time. The dose-dependent effects persisted throughout the entire trial, suggesting that desensitization does not occur. The maximum tolerated dose was observed to be an infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/h. Adverse effects, such as ischemia, were only seen at doses beyond this level, due to extreme lengthening of systolic ejection time. Omecamtiv mecarbil effectively relieves symptoms and enhances the quality of life of systolic heart failure patients. It improved cardiac performance in short-term studies; however, while the drug reduced the risk of hospitalization or other urgent care for heart failure by 8% in high-risk patients in the Phase III clinical trial GALACTIC-HF, patients receiving the drug did not live any longer. The drug also did not improve exercise intolerance in heart failure patients in the Phase III METEORIC trial. The METEORIC-HF randomized clinical trial found that omecamtiv mecarbil does not significantly improve exercise capacity. == Myosin inhibition == Research groups found that omecamtiv mecarbil actually inhibits myosin by enhancing the duty ratio, increasing calcium sensitivity and slowing force development. It may still activate muscle as a whole however despite suppressing the working stroke of myosin. == History == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted, in May 2020, a fast-track designation for omecamtiv mecarbil. == References == == Further reading == Kaplinsky E, Mallarkey G (2018).

739,"('Perphenazine', 'Trilafon', 'Perphenazin', 'Etaperazine', 'Perfenazine')",Medical,"Perphenazine is a typical antipsychotic drug. Chemically, it is classified as a piperazinyl phenothiazine. Originally marketed in the United States as Trilafon, it has been in clinical use for decades. Perphenazine is roughly ten times as potent as chlorpromazine at the dopamine-2 (D2) receptor; thus perphenazine is considered a medium-potency antipsychotic. == Medical uses == In low doses it is used to treat agitated depression (together with an antidepressant). Fixed combinations of perphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline in different proportions of weight exist (see Etrafon below). When treating depression, perphenazine is discontinued as fast as the clinical situation allows. Perphenazine has no intrinsic antidepressive activity. Several studies show that the use of perphenazine with fluoxetine (Prozac) in patients with psychotic depression is most promising, although fluoxetine interferes with the metabolism of perphenazine, causing higher plasma levels of perphenazine and a longer half-life. In this combination the strong antiemetic action of perphenazine attenuates fluoxetine-induced nausea and vomiting (emesis), as well as the initial agitation caused by fluoxetine. Both actions can be helpful for many patients. Perphenazine has been used in low doses as a 'normal' or 'minor' tranquilizer in patients with a known history of addiction to drugs or alcohol, a practice which is now strongly discouraged. Perphenazine has sedating and anxiolytic properties, making the drug useful for the treatment of agitated psychotic patients. A valuable off-label indication is the short-time treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum, in which pregnant women experience violent nausea and vomiting. This problem can become severe enough to endanger the pregnancy. As perphenazine has not been shown to be teratogenic and works very well, it is sometimes given orally in the smallest possible dose. === Effectiveness === Perphenazine is used to treat psychosis (e.g. in people with schizophrenia and the manic phases of bipolar disorder and OCD). Perphenazine effectively treats the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions, but its effectiveness in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as flattened affect and poverty of speech, is unclear. Earlier studies found the typical antipsychotics to be ineffective or poorly effective in the treatment of negative symptoms, but two recent, large-scale studies found no difference between perphenazine and the atypical antipsychotics. A 2015 systematic review compared perphenazine with other antipsychotic drugs: == Side effects == As a member of the phenothiazine type of antipsychotics, perphenazine shares in general all allergic and toxic side-effects of chlorpromazine. A 2015 systematic review of the data on perphenazine conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that ""there were no convincing differences between perphenazine and other antipsychotics"" in the incidence of adverse effects. Perphenazine causes early and late extrapyramidal side effects more often than placebo, and at a similar rate to other medium-potency antipsychotics and the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. When used for its strong antiemetic or antivertignosic effects in cases with associated brain injuries, it may obscure the clinical course and interferes with the diagnosis. High doses of perphenazine can cause temporary dyskinesia. As with other typical antipsychotics, permanent or lasting tardive dyskinesia is a risk. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Perphenazine has the following binding profile towards cloned human receptors unless otherwise specified: Acronyms: RS — Rat striatum receptor. RB — Rat brain receptor. Mechanisms Perphenazine is a typical antipsychotic medication of midrange or moderate potency (the 15-fold of a chlorpromazinedosage, also a typical antipsychotic medication). Compared with the highpotent typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol (50-fold), it despite is considered by some to have similar extralyramidalmotoric side-effects. This is propably because it has similar affinityvalues at the D2/3 receptors (0.7, 0.3). === Pharmacokinetics === Perphenazine has an oral bioavailability of approximately 40% and a half-life of 8 to 12 hours (up to 20 hours), and is usually given in 2 or 3 divided doses each day. It is possible to give two-thirds of the daily dose at bedtime and one-third during breakfast to maximize hypnotic activity during the night and to minimize daytime sedation and hypotension without loss of therapeutic activity. == Formulations == It is sold under the brand names Trilafon (single drug) and Etrafon/Triavil/Triptafen (contains fixed dosages of amitriptyline). A brand name in Europe is Decentan pointing to the fact that perphenazine is approximately 10-times more potent than chlorpromazine. Usual oral forms are tablets (2, 4, 8, 16 mg) and liquid concentrate (4 mg/ml). The 'Perphenazine injectable USP' solution is intended for deep intramuscular (i.m.) injection, for patients who are not willing to take oral medication or if the patient is unable to swallow. Due to a better bioavailability of the injection, two-thirds of the original oral dose is sufficient. The incidence of hypotension, sedation and extrapyramidal side-effects may be higher compared to oral treatment. The i.m.-injections are appropriate for a few days, but oral treatment should start as soon as possible. In many countries, depot forms of perphenazine exist (as perphenazine enanthate and perphenazine decanoate). One injection works for 1 to 4 weeks depending on the dose of the depot-injection. Depot-forms of perphenazine should not be used during the initial phase of treatment as the rare neuroleptic malignant syndrome may become more severe and uncontrollable with this form. Extrapyramidal side-effects may be somewhat reduced due to constant plasma-levels during depot-therapy. Also, patient compliance is sure, as many patients do not take their oral medication, particularly if feeling better once improvement in psychosis is achieved. == Interactions == Fluoxetine causes higher plasma levels and a longer elimination half-life of perphenazine, therefore a dose reduction of perphenazine might be necessary. Perphenazine intensifies the central depressive action of drugs with such activity (tranquilizers, hypnotics, narcotics, antihistaminics, OTC-antiemetics etc.). A dose reduction of perphenazine or the other drug may be necessary. In general, all neuroleptics may lead to seizures in combination with the opioid tramadol (Ultram). Perphenazine may increase the insulin needs of diabetic patients. Monitor blood glucose levels of insulin-dependent patients regularly during long-term treatment. == References ==",Perfenazine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.4689302992774174e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003406421164982021)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682165.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Perphenazine: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682165.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Calliditas, a commercial stage biotech company headquartered in Stockholm, is currently developing setanaxib in two clinical trials in human patients. == Development == The strategy of development of setanaxib was initially focused on the treatment of fibrosis and particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Setanaxib obtained orphan drug designation from regulatory agencies in the US and EU in early 2010. It was later granted FDA Fast Track Designation in PBC in August 2021. Genkyotex first initiated a phase 2 proof-of-concept study in diabetic nephropathy in 2014. However, the trial did not reach the primary clinical endpoint of reduction in albuminuria. Following this, the company conducted a Phase 2 trial in patients with primary biliary cholangitis, reporting out data in 2019. The 111-patient study tested two doses of setanaxib, 400 mg once daily and 400 mg twice daily, versus placebo. The primary endpoint was percentage change in serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) at 24 weeks; the study did not meet this endpoint. However, the study did show promising data in post-hoc analysis, achieving significance in the secondary endpoint of reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The higher dose of setanaxib demonstrated a 12.9% reduction of ALP over the 24-week treatment period, with a p-value of p<0.002 vs placebo. Genkyotex then carried out further analysis of a subgroup of the patient population with elevated liver stiffness levels. Liver stiffness, which was measured using noninvasive transient elastography, is an indicator of fibrosis. The study found that patients in stage 3 fibrosis, aka those with baseline liver stiffness levels of 9.6kPa or greater, who were dosed with setanaxib had a 22% reduction in liver stiffness; meanwhile, the patients in this subgroup who received placebo had a 4% increase in liver stiffness. The study also investigated the impact of setanaxib treatment on quality of life outcomes using the PBC-40 questionnaire, a profile measure covering six PBC specific quality of life domains (cognitive, social, emotional function, fatigue, itch, and other symptoms). Treatment with the twice-daily dose of setanaxib resulted in positive effects on emotional function and social quality of life domains, as well as a statistically significant improvement in fatigue. Fatigue is a common problem in PBC, one which has been characterised by patient reports as ‘dramatically impairing’ quality of life. Setanaxib is now being developed by Calliditas Therapeutics, which is running two clinical trials with this drug candidate. The TRANSFORM study is a Phase 2b/3 study with an adaptive design. The study is investigating the effect of setanaxib in PBC patients who have an intolerance or inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and liver stiffness of ≥8.8 kilopascals (kPa).The primary endpoint is reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The first part of the trial will have three arms – a placebo arm and two dosing arms, with setanaxib 1200 mg/day and 1600 mg/day. Calliditas will conduct an interim analysis after the 99th patient has completed 24 weeks of treatment. Following this analysis, one dose of setanaxib will be selected to move forward with for the remaining, Phase 3, portion of the trial. The trial will also investigate the change in liver stiffness and the effect of setanaxib on fatigue in patients. Calliditas is also conducting a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and who have moderate or high cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) density tumours. This trial follows on from promising pre-clinical data from Professor Gareth Thomas at the University of Southampton, which demonstrated that setanaxib reversed CAF differentiation and overcame CD8 T-cell exclusion in vivo and improved survival in a relevant mouse tumour model. The Calliditas Phase 2 trial will investigate the effect of setanaxib 800 mg twice daily in conjunction with 200mg of pembrolizumab, administered IV. As is standard for this immunotherapy, pembrolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or progression. A tumour biopsy will be taken prior to treatment and then again after 9 weeks of treatment. Setanaxib is also being evaluated in investigator led trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The trial in DKD is being funded by JDRF and is investigating a twice-daily 400mg dose of setanaxib across 48 weeks of treatment. The study in IPF is fully funded by an $8.9 million grant awarded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is being led by Professor Victor Thannickal at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of 400mg BID setanaxib in 60 IPF patients who will also be receiving pirfenidone or nintedanib, the standard of care in this disease. == History == Setanaxib was discovered in the early 2000s by scientists at Genkyotex and was patented in 2007. Setanaxib was initially developed for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obtained orphan drug designation both by FDA and EMEA by end of 2010. Setanaxib was developed by rational drug design following a campaign of high-throughput screening on several NOX isoforms. The initial lead compound GKT136901, a pyrazolopyridine dione derivative was further structurally modified in order to enhance its binding affinity and improve its pharmacokinetic properties, resulting in the discovery of setanaxib. == Toxicity and potential risks == Setanaxib did not show any signs of toxicity in a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. A study with high-dose setanaxib assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics of the drug in 46 healthy subjects. The study had two parts: a single ascending dose (SAD) part and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) part with dosing up to 1600mg/day. This trial demonstrated a that setanaxib had a favourable safety and pharmacokinetic profile even at high doses. == References ==",Setanaxib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011932138295378536), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00150781380943954)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([calliditas.se](https://www.calliditas.se/en/our-science/setanaxib-platform-development/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=118, start_index=9, title='Setanaxib Platform Development – Calliditas Therapeutics AB', type='url_citation', url='https://www.calliditas.se/en/our-science/setanaxib-platform-development/?utm_source=openai')])"

It may also be used, as part of post exposure prophylaxis, to prevent HIV infection following potential exposure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include trouble sleeping, feeling tired, diarrhea, high blood sugar, and headache. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions and liver problems. Concerns that usage during pregnancy can result in harm to the baby have been refuted by further studies that show there is no statistical difference in neural tube defects from the usage of dolutegravir compared to other antiretrovirals. It is unclear if use during breastfeeding is safe. Dolutegravir is an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor which blocks the functioning of HIV integrase which is needed for viral replication. Dolutegravir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, a combination with abacavir and lamivudine is also available. As of 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends DTG as the first- and second-line treatment for all persons with HIV. == Medical use == Dolutegravir is approved for use in a broad population of HIV-infected patients. It can be used to treat HIV-infected adults who have never taken HIV therapy (treatment-naïve) and HIV-infected adults who have previously taken HIV therapy (treatment-experienced), including those who have been treated with other integrase strand transfer inhibitors. Tivicay is also approved for children ages 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (kg) who are treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced but have not previously taken other integrase strand transfer inhibitors. In the European Union it is indicated, in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults, adolescents and children above six years of age. In June 2020, the indication for dolutegravir in the US was updated to include children at least four weeks old and weighing at least 3 kg (6.61 pounds). == Adverse effects == Common side effects of dolutegravir in clinical trials included insomnia and headache. Serious side effects included allergic reactions and abnormal liver function in patients who were also infected with hepatitis B or C. The package insert warns against a mean rise in serum creatinine of 0.11 mg/dL due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine and does not affect GFR. === Pregnancy === In 2019 there were tentative concerns that usage during pregnancy can result in the increased risk of neural tube defects however further studies have refuted that claim finding no statistical difference between dolutegravir and other antiretrovirals. As of 31 January 2024 dolutegravir is the NIH preferred antiretroviral drug for pregnant or nonpregnant people trying to conceive. == History == In February 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would fast track dolutegravir's approval process. On 13 August 2013, dolutegravir was approved for medical use in the United States. On 4 November 2013, dolutegravir was approved by Health Canada. On 16 January 2014, it was approved by the European Commission for use throughout the European Union. In 2019, a triple-combination therapy, with dolutegravir replacing efavirenz, was introduced as the first-line treatment for all people (pregnant excluded) with HIV by the South African Government (public) sector. In June 2020, dolutegravir was approved in the US with an indication to treat HIV-1 infection in children at least four weeks old and weighing at least 3 kg (6.61 pounds) in combination with other antiretroviral treatments. It is intended to treat children at least 4 weeks old and 3 kg who have never been treated for HIV or who have been treated, but not with an integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) class drug. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the approval of Tivicay and Tivicay PD to ViiV Healthcare. == Access == In April 2024, the government of Colombia issued its first ever compulsory license to invalidate the patent of Dolutegravir. Access to dolutegravir was enabled by a license to the Medicines Patent Pool however Colombia was not a listed territory. UNAIDS supported the move to enable a compulsory license decision. ViiV Healthcare disagreed with the decision on the use of the compulsory license by the government of Colombia. A separate agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool permits the distribution of generic versions of the medicine in Colombia, but this is restricted to children only. == Climate change == Dolutegravir, used by 24 million people in low- and middle-income countries, has significantly reduced carbon emissions compared to the previous standard of care, efavirenz. This is the first report to analyze the environmental impact of a widely used medicine compared to its alternative. According to Unitaid, this transition will prevent over 26 million tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere between 2017 and 2027, equivalent to eliminating 10 years of carbon emissions from Geneva, Switzerland. == References ==",Tivicay,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.152531907195225e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016366096679121256)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/tivicay.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Tivicay: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/tivicay.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is taken by mouth. The most common side effects include an increase in alanine transaminase and an increase of aspartate aminotransferase, which can be signs of liver damage, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea and musculoskeletal pain. Omaveloxolone was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2023, and in the European Union in February 2024. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Omaveloxolone is indicated for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia causes progressive damage to the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and the brain, resulting in uncoordinated muscle movement, poor balance, difficulty walking, changes in speech and swallowing, and a shortened lifespan. The condition can also cause heart disease. This disease tends to develop in children and teenagers and gradually worsens over time. Although rare, Friedreich's ataxia is the most common form of hereditary ataxia in the United States, affecting about one in every 50,000 people. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action of omaveloxolone and its related compounds has been demonstrated to be through a combination of activation of the antioxidative transcription factor Nrf2 and inhibition of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. Nrf2 transcriptionally regulates multiple genes that play both direct and indirect roles in producing antioxidative potential and the production of cellular energy (i.e., adenosine triphosphate or ATP) within the mitochondria. Consequently, unlike exogenously administered antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E or Coenzyme Q10), which provide a specific and finite antioxidative potential, omaveloxolone, through Nrf2, broadly activates intracellular and mitochondrial antioxidative pathways, in addition to pathways that may directly increase mitochondrial biogenesis (such as PGC1α) and bioenergetics. == History == Omaveloxolone is a second generation member of the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid compounds and in clinical development by Reata Pharmaceuticals. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that omaveloxolone possesses antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities and the ability to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics. Omaveloxolone is under clinical investigation for a variety of indications, including Friedreich's ataxia, mitochondrial myopathies, immunooncology, and prevention of corneal endothelial cell loss following cataract surgery. The efficacy and safety of omaveloxolone was evaluated in a 48-week randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind study [Study 1 (NCT02255435)] and an open-label extension. Study 1 enrolled 103 individuals with Friedreich's ataxia who received placebo (52 individuals) or omaveloxolone 150 mg (51 individuals) for 48 weeks. Of the research participants, 53% were male, 97% were white, and the mean age was 24 years at study entry. Nine (18%) patients were younger than age 18. The primary objective was to evaluate the change in the modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) score compared to placebo at week 48. The mFARS is a clinical assessment that measures disease progression, namely swallowing and speech (bulbar), upper limb coordination, lower limb coordination, and upright stability. Individuals receiving omaveloxolone performed better on the mFARS than people receiving placebo. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for omaveloxolone orphan drug, fast track, priority review, and rare pediatric disease designations. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Omaveloxolone was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2023. In December 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Skyclarys, intended for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia.

It is not effective against other worms such as flukes or roundworms. It is taken by mouth. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and itchiness. It may be used during pregnancy. It works by blocking glucose uptake and oxidative phosphorylation by the worm. Niclosamide was first synthesized in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Niclosamide is not available for human use in the United States. == Side effects == Side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, and itchiness. Rarely, dizziness, skin rash, drowsiness, perianal itching, or an unpleasant taste occur. For some of these reasons, praziquantel is a preferable and equally effective treatment for tapeworm infestation. Of note, niclosamide kills the pork tapeworm and results in its digestion. This then may cause a multitude of viable eggs to be released and may result in cysticercosis. So, a purge should be given one or two hours after treatment. CNS cysticercosis is a life-threatening condition and may require brain surgery. == Mechanism of action == Niclosamide inhibits glucose uptake, oxidative phosphorylation, and anaerobic metabolism in the tapeworm. == Other applications == Niclosamide's metabolic effects are relevant to a wide ranges of organisms, and accordingly it has been applied as a control measure to organisms other than tapeworms. For example, it is an active ingredient in some formulations, such as Bayluscide, for killing lamprey larvae, as a molluscide, and as a general-purpose piscicide in aquaculture. Niclosamide has a short half-life in water in field conditions; this makes it valuable in ridding commercial fish ponds of unwanted fish; it loses its activity soon enough to permit restocking within a few days of eradicating the previous population. Researchers have found that niclosamide is effective in killing invasive zebra mussels in cool waters. == Research == Niclosamide is under investigation as a potential treatment for certain types of cancer, bacterial infections, and viral infections.

It is taken by mouth. Side effects of pimavanserin include peripheral edema and confusion. Unlike other antipsychotics, pimavanserin is not a dopamine receptor antagonist, but rather is a selective antagonist or inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and to a lesser extent of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Pimavanserin was first approved for medical use in 2016. It was approved as a generic medication in 2024. == Medical uses == Pimavanserin is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis. === Available forms === Pimavanserin is available in the form of 10 mg oral tablets and 34 mg oral capsules. == Side effects == Side effects of pimavanserin include peripheral edema and confusion, among others. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Pimavanserin acts as a selective inverse agonist or antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It is also an antagonist or inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor to a lesser extent. The drug has an affinity (Ki) of 0.087 to 0.5 nM for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and 0.44 to 10 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, whereas its functional inhibition (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values have been reported to be 1.9 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and 91 nM at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Hence, it shows 3- to 50-fold greater affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor depending on the assay and 49-fold selectivity in terms of functional inhibition of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor compared to the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. Pimavanserin shows low binding to σ1 receptors (Ki = 120 nM) and has no appreciable affinity (Ki > 300 nM) to serotonin 5-HT2B, dopamine (including D2), muscarinic acetylcholine, histamine, or adrenergic receptors, or to calcium channels. === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life of pimavanserin is 54 to 57 hours. The half-life of its active metabolite N-desmethylpimavanserin is 200 hours. == History == === Development === Pimavanserin was developed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Pimavanserin is expected to improve the effectiveness and side effect profile of antipsychotics. The results of a clinical trial examining the efficacy, tolerability and safety of adjunctive pimavanserin to risperidone and haloperidol were published in November 2012, and the results showed that pimavanserin potentiated the antipsychotic effects of subtherapeutic doses of risperidone and improved the tolerability of haloperidol treatment by reducing the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. The drug met expectations for a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis, and has completed Phase II trials for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia alongside an antipsychotic medication. In September 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted breakthrough therapy status to Acadia's New Drug Application for pimavanserin. ==== FDA Approval ==== In April 2016, Nuplazid (pimavanserin) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. The non-binding advisory panel recommendation of 12-to-2 in support of approval that preceded the FDA approval action noted that the drug met an important need, despite its only providing modest benefits and posing serious safety issues. In June 2018, the FDA approved new dosages of pimavanserin to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. A 34 mg capsule and 10 mg tablet formulation were approved. Previously, people were required to take two 17 mg tablets to achieve the recommenced 34 mg dose per day. The 10 mg dose is indicated for people also taking CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). == HARMONY-Trial == In a Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NTC03325556) pimavanserin was given to people with dementia-related psychosis. The dementia was caused by Alzheimer's disease, dementia with lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, or vascular dementia. The trial was stopped early due to lack of efficacy. People treated with pimavanserin had a relapse in 13%, and those without 28%. Longer and larger trials are suggested. === Controversy === In April 2018, CNN reported that some in the FDA were concerned that pimavanserin (Nuplazid) was ""risky"" when it was approved and noted there have been a substantial number of deaths reported by those using the drug. The story further noted that the drug was approved based on a ""six-week study of about 200 patients"". The FDA began post-market monitoring of the drug to assess the validity of these claims. In September 2018, the FDA stated their review ""did not identify any new or unexpected safety findings with Nuplazid, or findings that are inconsistent with the established safety profile currently described in the drug label"". == Research == Pimavanserin was studied as a therapeutic agent in Phase III clinical trials for major depressive disorder and schizophrenia and Phase II trials for agitation. It was also under development for the treatment of insomnia, drug-induced akathisia, and drug-induced dyskinesia, but development for these indications was discontinued. In March 2024, Acadia Pharmaceuticals announced its decision to stop any further clinical trials of pimavanserin after the drug did not improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia better than placebo. As of November 2024, a phase 2 clinical trial is underway assessing the ability of pimavanserin to block the effects of the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin. == References ==",Pimavanserin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.245195097813848e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -9.905801562126726e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a616032.html,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/pimavanserin-oral-route/description/drg-20311664,https://www.drugs.com/mtm/pimavanserin.html ', [])"

It is used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2. It is a long-acting first-generation sulfonylurea. == Mechanism of action == Like other sulfonylureas, chlorpropamide acts to increase the secretion of insulin, so it is only effective in patients who have some pancreatic beta cell function. It can cause relatively long episodes of hypoglycemia; this is one reason why shorter-acting sulfonylureas such as gliclazide or tolbutamide are used instead. The risk of hypoglycemia makes this drug a poor choice for the elderly and patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment. Chlorpropamide is also used in partial central diabetes insipidus. == Pharmacokinetics == Maximal plasma concentrations are reached 3 to 5 hours after quick and nearly complete (>90%) resorption from the gut. plasma half life is 36 hours; the drug is effective for about 24 hours, longer than other sulfonylureas. A stable plasma level is only reached after three days of continuous application. 90% of the drug are bound to plasma proteins; at least two albumin binding sites exist. More than 99% of chlorpropamide are excreted unchanged via the kidneys. It is first filtrated in the glomeruli, then reabsorbed, and finally secreted into the tubular lumen. == Cautions and contraindications == Chlorpropamide and other sulfonylureas encourage weight gain, so they are generally not favored for use in very obese patients. Metformin (Glucophage) is considered a better drug for these patients. Sulfonylureas should be used with caution or generally avoided in patients with hepatic and renal impairment, patients with porphyria, patients who are breastfeeding, patients with ketoacidosis, and elderly patients. === Other side effects === The most common side effects are skin related, such as rashes, photoallergy and (in rare cases) Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Less common side effects of chlorpropamide include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It may cause facial flushing after the ingestion of alcohol. In very high doses it can increase secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which can lead to hyponatremia. It also markedly raises the serum level of alkaline phosphatase. == Chemical properties == Chlorpropamide is a white crystalline powder with no characteristic taste or smell. It exhibits polymorphism. Its acid dissociation constant pKa is 5.0 at 20 °C. === Solubility === == See also == Tolbutamide Tolazamide Glyburide Glipizide == References ==",Diabenese,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005127069307491183), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032366530504077673)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0485873706638813), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([catalog.md](https://www.catalog.md/drugs/diabenese.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='Diabenese.

747,"('Permethrin', 'Transpermethrin', 'Ambush', 'Pounce', 'Elimite')",Medical,"Permethrin is a medication and an insecticide. As a medication, it is used to treat scabies and lice. It is applied to the skin as a cream or lotion. As an insecticide, it can be sprayed onto outer clothing or mosquito nets to kill the insects that touch them. Side effects include rash and irritation where it is applied. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe, and it is approved for use on and around people over the age of two months. Permethrin is in the pyrethroid family of medications. It works by disrupting the function of the neurons of lice and scabies mites. Permethrin was discovered in 1972. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 351st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 40,000 prescriptions. == Uses == === Insecticide === In agriculture, to protect crops (a drawback is that it is lethal to bees) In agriculture, to kill livestock parasites For industrial and domestic insect control In the textile industry, to prevent insect attack of woollen products In aviation, the WHO, IHR and ICAO require arriving aircraft be disinsected prior to embarkation, departure, descent, or deplaning in certain countries. Aircraft disinsection with permethrin-based products is recommended only prior to embarkation. Prior to departure (after boarding), at the top of descent or on arrival, d-phenothrin-based (1R-trans phenothrin) aircraft insecticides are recommended. === Insect incapacitation === As a personal protective measure, 0.5% permethrin is applied to outer clothing. It is a cloth impregnant, notably in mosquito nets and field wear. While permethrin may be marketed as an insect repellent, it does not prevent insects from landing. Instead it works by incapacitating or killing insects on contact before they can bite. In 2016, Consumer Reports found that, as consecutive washes reduce permethrin concentration, incapacitation becomes too slow to prevent bites. In these cases, other common topical repellents such as icaridin may be applied to the clothing, though some, such as DEET and IR3535, can damage certain synthetic fabrics. In pet flea preventive collars or treatment (safe for use on dogs but not cats) In timber treatment === Medical use === Permethrin is available for topical use as a cream or lotion. It is indicated for the treatment and prevention in exposed individuals of head lice and treatment of scabies. In general, one treatment is curative. A single application of permethrin is more effective than a single oral dose of ivermectin for scabies. In addition permethrin provides more rapid symptomatic relief than ivermectin. When a second dose of ivermectin is days later, the efficacy between permethrin and ivermectin approach parity. Contact with eyes should be avoided. ==== Mechanism of action ==== Permethrin acts on the nerve cell membrane to disrupt the sodium channel current by which the polarization of the membrane is regulated. Delayed repolarization and paralysis of the pests are the consequences of this disturbance. === Pest control / effectiveness and persistence === In agriculture, permethrin is mainly used on cotton, wheat, maize, and alfalfa crops. Its use is controversial because, as a broad-spectrum chemical, it kills indiscriminately; as well as the intended pests, it can harm beneficial insects, including honey bees, as well as cats and aquatic life. Permethrin kills ticks and mosquitoes on contact with treated clothing. A method of reducing deer tick populations by treating rodent vectors involves stuffing biodegradable cardboard tubes with permethrin-treated cotton. Mice collect the cotton for lining their nests. Permethrin on the cotton kills any immature ticks feeding on the mice. Permethrin is used in tropical areas to prevent mosquito-borne disease such as dengue fever and malaria. Mosquito nets used to cover beds may be treated with a solution of permethrin. This increases the effectiveness of the bed net by killing parasitic insects before they are able to find gaps or holes in the net. Personnel working in malaria-endemic areas may be instructed to treat their clothing with permethrin as well. Permethrin is the most commonly used insecticide worldwide for the protection of wool from keratinophagous insects such as Tineola bisselliella. To better protect soldiers from the risk and annoyance of biting insects, the British and US armies are treating all new uniforms with permethrin. Permethrin (as well as other long-term pyrethroids) is effective over several months, in particular when used indoors. International studies report that permethrin can be detected in house dust, in fine dust, and on indoor surfaces even years after the application. Its degradation rate under indoor conditions is approximately 10% after 3 months. === Resistance === In Aedes aegypti permethrin resistance is via ""knockdown resistance"" (kdr) mutations which is common to pyrethroids and DDT. This differs to the most common mechanism of insecticide resistance evolution which is selection for preexisting, low-frequency alleles. García et al. 2009 found that a kdr allele has rapidly spread throughout Mexico and become dominant there. == Adverse effects == Permethrin is moderately toxic if ingested, causing abdominal pain, sore throat, nausea and vomiting. If inhaled, permethrin may cause headache, respiratory irritation, difficulty breathing, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Inhalation is more likely from aerosols than from vapors from surfaces and clothing, as permethrin has a low vapor pressure and volatilizes slowly. Topical application of permethrin can cause mild skin irritation, burning and paresthesia. Permethrin has little systemic absorption, and is considered safe for topical use in adults and children over the age of two months. The FDA has assigned it as pregnancy category B. Animal studies have suggested that it may cause endocrine disruption by interfering with estrogenic activity and have shown no effects on fertility or teratogenicity, but studies in humans have not been performed. The excretion of permethrin in breastmilk is unknown, and it is recommended that breastfeeding be temporarily discontinued during treatment. Skin reactions are uncommon. Excessive exposure to permethrin can cause nausea, headache, muscle weakness, excessive salivation, shortness of breath, and seizures. Worker exposure to the chemical can be monitored by measurement of the urinary metabolites, while severe overdose may be confirmed by measurement of permethrin in serum or blood plasma. Permethrin does not present any notable genotoxicity or immunotoxicity in humans and farm animals, but is classified by the EPA as a likely human carcinogen when ingested, based on reproducible studies in which mice fed permethrin developed liver and lung tumors. A 2018 review failed to link permethrin exposure in humans to cancer. == Pharmacokinetics == Permethrin is a chemical categorized in the pyrethroid insecticide group. The chemicals in the pyrethroid family are created to emulate the chemicals found in the chrysanthemum flower. === Absorption === Absorption of topical permethrin is minimal. One in vivo study demonstrated 0.5% absorption in the first 48 hours based upon excretion of urinary metabolites. === Distribution === Distribution of permethrin has been studied in rat models, with highest amounts accumulating in fat and the brain. This can be explained by the lipophilic nature of the permethrin molecule. === Metabolism === Metabolism of permethrin occurs mainly in the liver, where the molecule undergoes oxidation by the cytochrome P450 system, as well as hydrolysis, into non-toxic metabolites. === Excretion === The elimination of permethrin and its metabolites occurs mainly through urinary excretion, but also through feces. In rats, the excretion half-life is 12 hours for plasma and 9 to 23 hours for certain nervous tissue. == Stereochemistry == Permethrin has four stereoisomers (two enantiomeric pairs), arising from the two stereocenters in the cyclopropane ring. The trans enantiomeric pair is known as transpermethrin. (1R,3S)-trans and (1R,3R)-cis enantiomers are responsible for the insecticidal properties of permethrin. == Environment == Permethrin has a half-life of about 40 days in soil, 1–3 weeks on the surface of plants, over 20 days indoors, and 19–27 hours in the water column. Permethrin-contaminated indoor surfaces can be decontaminated with bleach. == History == In the early 1970s, it was identified that in many pyrethroids, including all natural pyrethrins and some synthetic analogs developed by that time (such as resmethrin), the furan ring, being a probable site for photo-sensitized attack by oxygen, was responsible for their instability in air and light. Hence, a group of agricultural chemists at the Rothamsted Experimental Station led by Michael Elliott tried to substitute the 5-benzyl-3-furylmethyl alcohol with quite a few structurally similar ones. Discovering that an ester of 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol with a slightly modified (chlorine-substituted) analog of the chrysanthemic acid they also found earlier was both photo-stable and very toxic for insects, they filed their patent applications in 1972 and published their results in Nature in 1973. Numerous synthetic routes exist for the production of the DV-acid ester precursor. The pathway known as the Kuraray Process uses four steps. In general, the final step in the total synthesis of any of the synthetic pyrethroids is a coupling of a DV-acid ester and an alcohol. In the case of permethrin synthesis, the DV-acid cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-, ethyl ester, is coupled with the alcohol, m-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, through a transesterification reaction with base. Tetraisopropyl titanate or sodium ethylate may be used as the base. The alcohol precursor may be prepared in three steps. First, m-cresol, chlorobenzene, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and cuprous chloride react to yield m-phenoxytoluene. Second, oxidation of m-phenoxytoluene over selenium dioxide provides m-phenoxybenzaldehyde. Third, a Cannizzaro reaction of the benzaldehyde in formaldehyde and potassium hydroxide affords the m-phenoxybenzyl alcohol. == Brand names == In Nordic countries and North America, a permethrin formulation for lice treatment is marketed under trade name Nix, available over the counter. Johnson & Johnson's UK brand Lyclear covers an assortment of different products, mostly non-insecticidal, but a few of which are based on permethrin. Stronger concentrations of permethrin are used to treat scabies (which embed inside the skin), compared to lice (which remain outside the skin). In the U.S. the more concentrated products such as Elimite are available by prescription only. == Other animals == It is known to be highly toxic to cats, fish and aquatic species with long-lasting effects. === Cats === Permethrin is toxic to cats; however, it has little effect on dogs. Many cats die after being given flea treatments intended for dogs, or by contact with dogs having recently been treated with permethrin. In cats it may induce hyperexcitability, tremors, seizures, and death. Toxic exposure of permethrin can cause several symptoms, including convulsion, hyperaesthesia, hyperthermia, hypersalivation, and loss of balance and coordination. Exposure to pyrethroid-derived drugs such as permethrin requires treatment by a veterinarian, otherwise the poisoning is often fatal. This intolerance is due to a defect in glucuronosyltransferase, a common detoxification enzyme in other mammals, that also makes the cat intolerant to paracetamol (acetaminophen). Based on those observations, the use of any external parasiticides based on permethrin is contraindicated for cats. === Aquatic organisms === Permethrin is listed as a ""restricted use"" substance by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to its high toxicity to aquatic organisms, so permethrin and permethrin-contaminated water should be properly disposed of. Permethrin is quite stable, having a half life of 51–71 days in an aqueous environment exposed to light. It is also highly persistent in soil. == References == == External links == Permethrin in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB) Permethrin General Fact Sheet National Pesticide Information Center Permethrin Technical Fact Sheet National Pesticide Information Center Permethrin-treated Clothing National Pesticide Information Center ""Health Effects of Permethrin-Impregnated Army Battle-Dress Uniforms"" National Research Council Permethrin Pesticide Information Profile Extension Toxicology Network",Elimite,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.006035092286765575), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' INDUSTR', -0.009993823245167732), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.003905290039256215), ('ICAL', -4.768360213347478e-06), (',', -0.023320334032177925), ('ĠINDU', -0.02019708976149559), ('ST', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('RI', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.25200843811035156)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/elimite.html ', [])"
748,"('Droperidol', 'Dehydrobenzperidol', 'Droleptan', 'Inapsine', 'Dridol')",Medical,"Droperidol (Inapsine, Droleptan, Dridol, Xomolix, Innovar [combination with fentanyl]) is an antidopaminergic drug used as an antiemetic (that is, to prevent or treat nausea) and as an antipsychotic. Droperidol is also often used as a rapid sedative in intensive-care treatment, and where ""agitation aggression or violent behavior"" are present. == History == Discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1961, droperidol is a butyrophenone which acts as a potent D2 (dopamine receptor) antagonist with some histamine and serotonin antagonist activity. == Medical use == It has a central antiemetic action and effectively prevents postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults using doses as low as 0.625 mg. For treatment of nausea and vomiting, droperidol and ondansetron are equally effective; droperidol is more effective than metoclopramide. It has also been used as an antipsychotic in doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg given as an intramuscular injection, generally in cases of severe agitation in a psychotic patient who is refusing oral medication. Its use in intramuscular sedation has been replaced by intramuscular preparations of haloperidol and olanzapine. Some practitioners recommend the use of 0.5 mg to 1 mg intravenously for the treatment of vertigo in an otherwise healthy elderly patients who have not responded to Epley maneuvers. == Black box warning == In 2001, the FDA changed the labeling requirements for droperidol injection to include a Black Box Warning, citing concerns of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. The evidence for this is disputed, with 9 reported cases of torsades in 30 years and all of those having received doses in excess of 5 mg. QT prolongation is a dose-related effect, and it appears that droperidol is not a significant risk in low doses. A study in 2015 showed that droperidol is relatively safe and effective for the management of violent and aggressive adult patients in hospital emergency departments in doses of 10mg and above and that there was no increased risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. == Side effects == Dysphoria, sedation, hypotension resulting from peripheral alpha adrenoceptor blockade, prolongation of QT interval which can lead to torsades de pointes, and extrapyramidal side effects such as dystonic reactions/neuroleptic malignant syndrome. == References == == Further reading ==",Dridol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.075552376685664e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009222545195370913)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3868710398674011)])","('MEDICAL;https://zeepedia.com/medicines/dridol/,https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C548732&Mask=208F ', [])"

Currently, it is available in 25 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and America. It is a derivative of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; Aspirin) in which a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring has been replaced by a trifluoromethyl group. Trade names include Disgren, Grendis, Aflen and Triflux. Triflusal has multiple mechanisms of action that contribute to the effect of the drug. It is a COX-1 inhibitor. It also inhibits the activation of nuclear factor k-B, which in turn regulates the expression of the mRNA of the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 needed for platelet aggregation. Additionally, Triflusal preserves vascular prostacyclin which yields an anti-platelet effect. Triflusal also blocks phosphodiesterase, increasing cAMP concentration as well as can increase nitric oxide synthesis in neutrophils. == Mechanism of action == Triflusal is a selective platelet antiaggregant through; blocks cyclooxygenase, thereby inhibiting thromboxane A2, and thus preventing platelet aggregation preserves vascular prostacyclin, thus promoting anti-aggregant effect inhibits activation of nuclear factor kB, which regulates the expression of the mRNA of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 needed for platelet aggregation blocks phosphodiesterase thereby increasing cAMP concentration, thereby promoting anti-aggregant effect due to inhibition of calcium mobilization increases nitric oxide synthesis in neutrophils == Indication == Triflusal is indicated for; Prevention of cardiovascular events such as stroke Acute treatment of cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction Thromboprophylaxis due to atrial fibrillation == Prevention of stroke == In the 2008, guidelines for stroke management from the European Stroke Organization, triflusal was for the first time recommended as lone therapy, as an alternative to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)(Aspirin) plus dipyridamole, or clopidogrel alone for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic stroke. This recommendation was based on the double-blind, randomised TACIP and TAPIRSS trials, which found triflusal to be as effective as Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, which Triflusal is derived from) in preventing post-stroke vascular events, while having a more favourable safety profile. == Pharmacokinetics == It is absorbed in the small intestine and its bio-availability ranges from 83% to 100%.

RS-130830 (Ro-1130830, CTS-1027) is a potent partially selective inhibitor of MMPs of a second generation and has been evaluated in clinical trials as an anti-arthritis drug. It inhibits MMPs involved in acute inflammation but has low activity against MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase), MMP-7 (matrilysin) and tumour necrosis factor α converting enzyme (TACE). A well-established infant rat model of PM was used where live Streptococcus pneumoniae were injected intracisternally and antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was initiated 18 h post infection (hpi). Treatment with RS-130830 (75 mg/kg bis in die (bid) i.p., n = 40) was started at 3 hpi while control littermates received the vehicle (succinylated gelatine, n = 42).

In cohort A (patients with carcinoma in situ, with or without papillary tumours) of the KEYNOTE-057 study, pembrolizumab monotherapy led to a complete response rate of 41% at 3 months, and 46% of responders maintained a response lasting at least 12 months. Here, we evaluate pembrolizumab monotherapy in cohort B of patients with papillary tumours without carcinoma in situ. KEYNOTE-057 is a single-arm, phase 2 study in 54 sites (hospitals and cancer centres) in 14 countries. Cohort B eligible patients were aged 18 years and older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had BCG-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer with papillary tumours (high-grade Ta or any-grade T1) without carcinoma in situ. Transurethral resection of bladder tumour within 12 weeks of first pembrolizumab dose was required. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of 35 cycles. Primary endpoint was 12-month disease-free survival of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer or progressive disease as assessed by cystoscopy, cytology, and central pathology and radiology review. Activity was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had a baseline evaluation. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02625961, and is ongoing. Between April 12, 2016, and June 17, 2021, 132 patients (104 [79%] men and 28 [21%] women) who had received a median of ten (IQR 9-15) previous BCG instillations were enrolled into cohort B of the study. Patients received a median of 10 cycles (IQR 6-27) of pembrolizumab. At data cutoff date, Oct 20, 2022, median follow-up was 45·4 months (IQR 36·4-59·3) and five (4%) of 132 patients remained on treatment. The 12-month disease-free survival was 43·5% (95% CI 34·9-51·9). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 97 (73%) of 132 patients; 19 (14%) had a grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse event; the most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were colitis (in three [2%] patients) and diarrhoea (in two [2%]). 17 (13%) of 132 patients experienced serious treatment-related adverse events, of which colitis (three patients [2%]) was most common. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Pembrolizumab monotherapy showed antitumour activity and manageable toxicity in patients with BCG-unresponsive high-risk Ta or T1 bladder cancer without carcinoma in situ and could potentially be a suitable treatment option for patients who decline or are ineligible for radical cystectomy.

It has been used in the treatment of sleep disturbances since the early 1970s in several European countries including France, Italy, and Luxembourg. It is commonly used with children and adolescents on account of its favorable safety and tolerability profile and lack of abuse potential. Originally believed to act as an antihistamine and anticholinergic, niaprazine was later discovered to have low or no binding affinity for the H1 and mACh receptors (Ki = > 1 μM), and was instead found to act as a potent and selective 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist (Ki = 75 nM and 86 nM, respectively). It possesses low or no affinity for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, D2, and β-adrenergic, as well as at SERT and VMAT (Ki = all > 1 μM), but it does have some affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 730 nM).

757,"('Isavuconazonium (sulfate)', 'Isavuconazonium', 'Isavuconazonium ion', 'Isavuconazonium [usan]', 'Isavuconazonium (usan)')",Medical,"Isavuconazonium, sold under the brand name Cresemba, is a systemic antifungal medication of the triazole class which is used to treat invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. It is used as the sulfate. It is taken by mouth or given via injection into a vein. The most common side effects include abnormal liver tests, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, injection site reactions, headache, low blood potassium and skin rash. Isavuconazonium is a prodrug of isavuconazole. == Medical uses == Isavuconazonium is used to treat invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis in adults aged eighteen years old and older. It is available in a capsule for administration by mouth and as a powder for administration via infusion. == Contraindications == Isavuconazonium is contraindicated in people taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inducers, or moderate CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 inducers. It is contraindicated in people with familial short QT syndrome. == Side effects == Common adverse effects (occurring in between 1 and 10% of people) include low potassium, decreased appetite, delirium, headache, sleepiness, vein inflammation, difficulty breathing, acute respiratory failure, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, elevated results in liver function tests, rash, itchy skin, kidney failure, chest pain, and fatigue. There are several uncommon side effects as well. In preclinical studies, isavuconazonium caused birth defects in animals; it has not been tested in pregnant women. == Interactions == Isavuconazonium is converted into isavuconazole inside the body, and isavuconazole is a substrate for CYP3A4 or CYP3A5. Many other medications inhibit or induce those two enzymes, and isavuconazonium should not be administered with them. Inducers result in levels of isavuconazole that are too low and won't work, and inhibitors can cause high levels of isavuconazole which will in turn cause increased adverse events and toxicity. Likewise isavuconazonium can interfere with appropriate dosing of other drugs that are substrates for those enzymes. In addition, isavuconazole induces CYP2B6 and can decrease the amount of drugs that are metabolized by the enzyme. Isavuconazole inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, SLC22A2, and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases, each of which remove drugs from circulation; isavuconazonium will increase the amount of drugs that are affected by those proteins and may increase their toxicities. == Pharmacology == After oral or intravenous administration, isavuconazonium is rapidly hydrolysed by esterases in blood or the gastrointestinal tract to the active form, isavuconazole. Isavuconazole works by inhibition of lanosterol 14α-demethylase, the enzyme responsible for converting lanosterol to ergosterol by demethylation. The resulting depletion of ergosterol and buildup of lanosterol compromise the structure of the fungal cell membrane. Mammalian cells are resistant to demethylation inhibition by azoles, making the drug effects specific to fungi. == Chemistry == Isavuconazonium comprises an N-(3-acetoxypropyl)-N-methylamino-carboxymethyl group linked through an ester moiety to the triazole nitrogen in isavuconazole. In the aquatic media of the body, the isavuconazole molecule is transformed into monohydrate. == History == Isavuconazole and isavuconazonium were discovered in Japan by researchers at Roche's research center in Kamakura. Basilea Pharmaceutica, which had been spun out of Roche to develop antimicrobial assets, developed isavuconazonium through Phase II clinical trials. In February 2010, Basilea partnered with Astellas Pharma to complete Phase III trials, obtain regulatory approvals, and market the drug. In 2013 and 2014, the partners won orphan drug designation in the US for isavuconazonium for treating invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and invasive candidiasis. In 2014, Basilea and Astellas amended the agreement to give Astellas sole marketing authority in North America, and Basilea the rights to market in the rest of the world. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval in March 2015, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved it in October 2015.

In addition, internal medicine, critical care, nephrology and gastroenterology textbooks were evaluated on topics pertaining the assessment and management of acid-base disorders, including reference lists from journals or textbooks. Chloride is, after sodium, the most abundant electrolyte in serum, with a key role in the regulation of body fluids, electrolyte balance, the preservation of electrical neutrality, acid-base status and it is an essential component for the assessment of many pathological conditions. When assessing serum electrolytes, abnormal chloride levels alone usually signify a more serious underlying metabolic disorder, such as metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. Chloride is an important component of diagnostic tests in a wide array of clinical situations. In these cases, chloride can be tested in sweat, serum, urine and feces. Abnormalities in chloride channel expression and function in many organs can cause a range of disorders. Topical maternal application of benzalkonium chloride or benzethonium chloride or their presence as a preservative in pharmaceuticals would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. Household disinfecting sprays and wipes contribute to the benzalkonium chloride content of milk. The effects of long-term exposure of the infant to low levels in milk is not known. Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder characterized by psychotic symptoms that significantly impair social and occupational functioning. The traditional treatment approach has relied on antipsychotics that primarily target dopamine receptors. However, these medications often come with notable limitations and side effects. Recently, Cobenfy, a novel antipsychotic combining xanomeline and trospium chloride, received the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, marking a significant advancement in schizophrenia treatment. This first-in-class medication operates through a unique mechanism, activating cholinergic receptors to mitigate psychotic symptoms while minimizing the common adverse effects associated with dopamine-blocking agents. Clinical trials, particularly the EMERGENT-2 and EMERGENT-3 studies, demonstrated that Cobenfy substantially improved both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, achieving greater reductions in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score compared to placebo. Moreover, Cobenfy exhibited a favorable safety profile, with fewer incidences of weight gain and extrapyramidal symptoms. However, it is associated with side effects such as nausea, dyspepsia, and constipation. It also carries risks for specific patient populations, such as patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Overall, Cobenfy offers a promising alternative for individuals with schizophrenia, particularly those who are treatment-resistant or experience intolerable side effects from conventional therapies.

Aurora1 and Aurora2 play important but distinct roles in the G(2) and M phases of the cell cycle and are essential for proper chromosome segregation and cell division. Overexpression and amplification of Aurora2 have been reported in different tumor types, including breast, colon, pancreatic, ovarian, and gastric cancer. PF-03814735 is a novel, potent, orally bioavailable, reversible inhibitor of both Aurora1 and Aurora2 kinases that is currently in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. In intact cells, the inhibitory activity of PF-03814735 on the Aurora1 and Aurora2 kinases reduces levels of phospho-Aurora1, phosphohistone H3, and phospho-Aurora2. PF-03814735 produces a block in cytokinesis, resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation and the formation of polyploid multinucleated cells. Although PF-03814735 produces significant inhibition of several other protein kinases, the predominant biochemical effects in cellular assays are consistent with inhibition of Aurora kinases. Once-daily oral administration of PF-03814735 to mice bearing human xenograft tumors produces a reduction in phosphohistone H3 in tumors at doses that are tolerable and that result in significant inhibition of tumor growth. The combination of PF-03814735 and docetaxel in xenograft mouse tumor models shows additive tumor growth inhibition. These results support the clinical evaluation of PF-03814735 in cancer patients. Mol Cancer Ther; 9(4); 883-94. (c)2010 AACR. PF-03814735 is a novel, reversible inhibitor of Aurora kinases A and B that finished a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. To find predictive biomarkers of drug sensitivity, we screened a diverse panel of 87 cancer cell lines for growth inhibition upon PF-03814735 treatment. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and, to a lesser extent, colon cancer lines were very sensitive to PF-03814735. The status of the Myc gene family and retinoblastoma pathway members significantly correlated with the efficacy of PF-03814735. Whereas RB1 inactivation, intact CDKN2A/p16, and normal CCND1/Cyclin D1 status are hallmarks of SCLC, activation or amplification of any of the three Myc genes (MYC, MYCL1, and MYCN) clearly differentiated cell line sensitivity within the SCLC panel. By contrast, we found that expression of Aurora A and B were weak predictors of response. We observed a decrease in histone H3 phosphorylation and polyploidization of sensitive lines, consistent with the phenotype of Aurora B inhibition. In vivo experiments with two SCLC xenograft models confirmed the sensitivity of Myc gene-driven models to PF-03814735 and a possible schedule dependence of MYC/c-Myc-driven tumors. Altogether our results suggest that SCLC and other malignancies driven by the Myc family genes may be suitable indications for treatment by Aurora B kinase inhibitors. Thyroid cancer (TC) is a very common malignancy worldwide. Chief among the innovative molecular drug targets for TC are epigenetic modifications. Increased telomerase activity in cancer cells makes telomerase a novel target for epigenetic anticancer drug innovation.

761,"('Celecoxib', 'Sc 58635', 'Celebrex', 'Celebra', 'Onsenal')",Medical,"Celecoxib, sold under the brand name Celebrex among others, is a COX-2 inhibitor and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It is used to treat the pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, acute pain in adults, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, painful menstruation, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to decrease the risk of colorectal adenomas in people with familial adenomatous polyposis. It is taken by mouth. Benefits are typically seen within an hour. Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. Serious side effects may include heart attacks, strokes, gastrointestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, and anaphylaxis. Use is not recommended in people at high risk for heart disease. The risks are similar to other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Use in the later part of pregnancy or during breastfeeding is not recommended. Celecoxib was patented in 1993 and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 93rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Celecoxib is indicated for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, acute pain, musculoskeletal pain, painful menstruation, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and to reduce the number of colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis. It may be used in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who are older than two years of age and weigh more than 10 kg (22 lb). For postoperative pain, it is more or less equal to ibuprofen. For pain relief, it is similar to paracetamol (acetaminophen) at 3990 mg per day, which is the first line treatment for osteoarthritis. Evidence of effects is not clear as several studies done by the manufacturer have not been released for independent analysis. === Familial adenomatous polyposis === It has been used to reduce colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis, but it is not known if it decreases rates of cancer, so it is not a good choice for this reason. == Adverse effects == Cardiovascular events: NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of serious (and potentially fatal) adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Risk may be increased with duration of use or pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors or disease. Individual cardiovascular risk profiles should be evaluated before prescribing. New-onset hypertension or exacerbation of hypertension may occur (NSAIDs may impair response to thiazide or loop diuretics), and may contribute to cardiovascular events; monitor blood pressure and use with caution in patients with hypertension. Celecoxib may cause sodium and fluid retention, so its use in patients with edema or heart failure warrants caution. Long-term cardiovascular risk in children has not been evaluated. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events; alternative therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. The increased risk is about 37%. Gastrointestinal events: NSAIDs may increase the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bleeding, and perforation (may be fatal). These events may occur at any time during therapy and without warning. Use caution with a history of GI disease (bleeding or ulcers), concurrent therapy with aspirin, anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids, smoking, use of alcohol, and the elderly or debilitated patients. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce the risk of GI adverse events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. When used concomitantly with ≤325 mg of aspirin, a substantial increase in the risk of gastrointestinal complications (e.g., ulcer) occurs; concomitant gastroprotective therapy (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) is recommended. The increased risk is about 81%. Hematologic effects: Anemia may occur; monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in people on long-term treatment. Celecoxib does not usually affect prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or platelet counts; it does not inhibit platelet aggregation at approved doses. People with a prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding require special precautions. Moderate to severe liver impairment or GI toxicity can occur with or without warning symptoms in people treated with NSAIDs. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. === Allergy === Celecoxib contains a sulfonamide moiety and may cause allergic reactions in those allergic to other sulfonamide-containing drugs. This is in addition to the contraindication in people with severe allergies to other NSAIDs. However, it has a low (reportedly 4%) chance of inducing cutaneous reactions among persons who have a history of such reactions to aspirin or nonselective NSAIDs. NSAIDs may cause serious skin adverse events, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis; events may occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy. Use should be discontinued at the first sign of rash (or any other hypersensitivity). === Heart attack and stroke === A 2013 meta-analysis of hundreds of clinical trials found that coxibs (the class of drugs that includes celecoxib) increase the risk of major cardiovascular problems by about 37% over placebo. In 2016, a randomized trial provided strong evidence that treatment with celecoxib is not more likely to result in poor cardiovascular outcomes than treatment with naproxen or ibuprofen. As a result, in 2018 an FDA advisory panel concluded that celecoxib poses no greater risk for causing heart attacks and strokes than the commonly-used NSAIDs ibuprofen or naproxen and recommended that the FDA consider changing its advice to physicians regarding celecoxib's safety. The COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (Vioxx) was removed from the market in 2004 due to its risk. Like all NSAIDs on the US market, celecoxib carries an FDA-mandated ""black box warning"" for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk. In February 2007, the American Heart Association warned that with respect to ""patients with a prior history of or at high risk for cardiovascular disease... use of COX-2 inhibitors for pain relief should be limited to patients for whom there are no appropriate alternatives, and then, only in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration necessary."" In 2005, a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that cardiovascular effects of COX-2 inhibitors differ, depending on the drug. Other COX-2-selective inhibitors, such as rofecoxib, have significantly higher myocardial infarction rates than celecoxib. In April 2005, after an extensive review of data, the FDA concluded it was likely ""that there is a 'class effect' for increased CV risk for all NSAIDs"". In a 2006 meta-analysis of randomized control studies, the cerebrovascular events associated with COX-2 inhibitors were examined, but no significant risks were found when compared to nonselective NSAIDs or placebos. === Drug interactions === Celecoxib undergoes metabolism primarily by the enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, but it also interacts with CYP2D6, inhibiting its activity without being metabolized by it. The CYP2C9 gene exhibits considerable genetic variability, with common polymorphisms, such as rs1799853 and rs1057910, linked to reduced enzyme activity and altered pharmacokinetics of celecoxib. Additionally, the influence of CYP2D6 on celecoxib metabolism is inconsistent, with its effect varying depending on the individual’s CYP2C9 genetic profile. Caution must be exercised with concomitant use of 2C9 inhibitors, such as fluconazole, which can greatly elevate celecoxib serum levels. If used concomitantly with lithium, celecoxib increases lithium plasma levels. If used concomitantly with warfarin, celecoxib may result in an increased risk of bleeding complications. The risk of bleeding and gastric ulcers also increases further when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are used in combination with celecoxib. The drug may increase the risk of kidney failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, such as lisinopril, and diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide. == Mechanism of action == === Anti-inflammatory === A highly selective reversible inhibitor of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase, celecoxib inhibits the transformation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin precursors. Therefore, it has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Nonselective NSAIDs (such as aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. Inhibition of COX-1 (which celecoxib does not inhibit at therapeutic concentrations) inhibits the production of prostaglandins and the production of thromboxane A2, a platelet activator. COX-1 is traditionally defined as a constitutively expressed ""housekeeping"" enzyme and plays a role in the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa, kidney hemodynamics, and platelet thrombogenesis. COX-2, on the contrary, is extensively expressed in cells involved in inflammation and is upregulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters. Celecoxib is approximately 10-20 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1. It binds with its polar sulfonamide side chain to a hydrophilic side pocket region close to the active COX-2 binding site. In theory, this selectivity allows celecoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors to reduce inflammation (and pain) while minimizing gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions (e.g. stomach ulcers) that are common with nonselective NSAIDs. === Anti-cancer === For its use in reducing colon polyps, celecoxib affects genes and pathways involved in inflammation and malignant transformation in tumors, but not normal tissues. Celecoxib binds to Cadherin-11 (which may explain the reduction in cancer progression). == Structure-activity relationship == The Searle research group found the two appropriately substituted aromatic rings must reside on adjacent positions about the central ring for adequate COX-2 inhibition. Various modifications can be made to the 1,5-diarylpyrazole moiety to deduce the structure-activity relationship of celecoxib. A para-sulfamoylphenyl at position 1 of the pyrazole was found to have a higher potency for COX-2 selective inhibition than a para-methoxyphenyl (see structures 1 and 2, below). In addition, a 4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl or 4-sulfamoylphenyl is known to be necessary for COX-2 inhibition. For instance, replacing either of these entities with a –SO2NHCH3 substituent diminishes COX-2 inhibitory activity as noted with a very high inhibitory concentration-50 (see structures 3 – 5). At the 3-position of the pyrazole, a trifluoromethyl or difluoromethyl provides superior selectivity and potency compared to a fluoromethyl or methyl substitution (see structures 6 – 9). Celecoxib is compound 22; the 4-sulfamoylphenyl on the 1-pyrazol substituent is required for COX-2 inhibition and the 4-methyl on the 5-pyrazol system has low steric hindrance to maximising potency, while the 3-trifluoromethyl group provides superior selectivity and potency. To explain the selectivity of celecoxib, it is necessary to analyze the free energy of binding difference between the drug molecule and COX-1 compared to COX-2 enzymes. The structural modifications highlight the importance of binding to residue 523 in the side binding pocket of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which is an isoleucine in COX-1 and a valine in COX-2. This mutation appears to contribute to COX-2 selectivity by creating steric hindrance between the sulfonamide oxygen and the methyl group of Ile523 that effectively destabilizes the celecoxib-COX-1 complex. == History == It was initially marketed by Pfizer for arthritis. Celecoxib and other COX-2 selective inhibitors, valdecoxib, parecoxib, and mavacoxib, were discovered by a team at the Searle division of Monsanto led by John Talley. Two lawsuits arose over the discovery of celecoxib. Daniel L. Simmons of Brigham Young University (BYU) discovered the COX-2 enzyme in 1988, and in 1991, BYU entered into a collaboration with Monsanto to develop drugs to inhibit it. Monsanto's pharmaceutical division was later purchased by Pfizer, and in 2006, BYU sued Pfizer for breach of contract, claiming Pfizer did not properly pay contractual royalties back to BYU. A settlement was reached in April 2012, in which Pfizer agreed to pay $450 million. Other important discoveries in COX-2 were made at University of Rochester, which patented the discoveries. When the patent was issued, the university sued Searle (later Pfizer) in a case called, University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co., 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court ruled in favor of Searle in 2004, holding in essence that the university had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2, and therefore the patent was invalid. According to the National Academy of Sciences, Philip Needleman, who was vice president of Monsanto in 1989 and president of Searle in 1993 oversaw research into COX-2 that led to the development of the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (Celebrex). He became senior executive vice president and chief scientist of Pharmacia from 2000 to 2003. Celecoxib was discovered and developed by G. D. Searle & Company and was approved by the FDA on 31 December 1998. It was co-promoted by Monsanto Company (parent company of Searle) and Pfizer under the brand name Celebrex. Monsanto merged with Pharmacia, from which the Medical Research Division was acquired by Pfizer, giving Pfizer ownership of Celebrex. The drug was at the core of a major patent dispute that was resolved in Searle's favor (later Pfizer) in 2004. In University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co., 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the University of Rochester claimed that United States Pat. No. 6,048,850 (which claimed a method of inhibiting COX-2 in humans using a compound, without actually disclosing what that compound might be) covered drugs such as celecoxib. The court ruled in favor of Searle, holding in essence that the university had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2, and therefore the patent was invalid. After the withdrawal of rofecoxib from the market in September 2004, celecoxib enjoyed a robust increase in sales. However, the results of the APC trial in December of that year raised concerns that Celebrex might carry risks similar to those of rofecoxib, and Pfizer announced a moratorium on direct-to-consumer advertising of Celebrex soon afterward. Sales reached $2 billion in 2006. Before its availability in generic form, it was one of Pfizer's ""best-selling drugs, amounting to more than $2.5 billion in sales [by 2012], and was prescribed to 2.4 million"" people in 2011. By 2012, 33 million Americans had taken celecoxib. Pfizer resumed advertising Celebrex in magazines in 2006, and resumed television advertising in April 2007 with an unorthodox, 2+1⁄2-minute advertisement which extensively discussed the adverse effects of Celebrex in comparison with other anti-inflammatory drugs. The ad drew criticism from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which called the ad's comparisons misleading. Pfizer responded to Public Citizen's concerns with assurances that they are truthfully advertising the risk and benefits of Celebrex as set forth by the FDA. == Society and culture == === Fabricated efficacy studies === Pfizer and its partner, Pharmacia presented findings from their study that Celebrex was ""better in protecting the stomach from serious complications than other drugs."" This became Celebrex's main selling point. However, following federal investigations it was revealed that Pfizer and Pharmacia ""only presented the results from the first six months of a year-long study rather than the whole thing."" These partial results were then published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. In 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released the full results of the Pfizer and Pharmacia study which showed that they had withheld crucial data. By 2012, a federal judge unsealed ""thousands of pages of internal documents and depositions"" in a ""long-running securities fraud case against Pfizer."" In March 2009, Scott S. Reuben, former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Massachusetts, revealed that the data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as Vioxx) had been fabricated. The analgesic effects of the drugs had been exaggerated. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for Pfizer. Although from 2002 to 2007 Pfizer underwrote much of Dr. Reuben's research and ""many of his trials found that Celebrex and Lyrica, Pfizer drugs, were effective against postoperative pain,"" Pfizer was not aware of the fraudulent data. None of the retracted studies were submitted to either the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Union's regulatory agencies before the drug's approval. Although Pfizer issued a public statement declaring, ""It is very disappointing to learn about Dr. Scott Reuben's alleged actions. When we decided to support Dr. Reuben's research, he worked for a credible academic medical center and appeared to be a reputable investigator"", the documents unsealed in 2012, revealed that by February 2000, Pharmacia employees had devised a strategy to present the findings. === Brand names === Pfizer markets celecoxib under the brand name Celebrex, and it is available as oral capsules containing 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg of celecoxib. It is legally available in many jurisdictions as a generic under several brand names. In the US, celecoxib was covered by three patents, two of which expired on 30 May 2014, and one of which (US RE44048) was due to expire 2 December 2015. On 13 March 2014, that patent was found to be invalid for double patenting. Upon the patent expiry on 30 May 2014, the FDA approved the first versions of generic celecoxib. In the US, Celebrex is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == Research == === Psychiatry === On the theory that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of major mental disorders, celecoxib has been trialed for a number of psychiatric disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. ==== Bipolar disorder ==== A meta-analysis considering trials of celecoxib as an adjunctive treatment in bipolar disorder was inconclusive citing low evidence quality. === Familial adenomatous polyposis === It has been used to reduce colon and rectal polyps in people with familial adenomatous polyposis, but it is not known if it decreases rates of cancer, so it is not a good choice for this reason. === Cancer prevention === The use of celecoxib to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer has been investigated, but neither celecoxib nor any other drug is indicated for this use. Small-scale clinical trials in very high-risk people (belonging to FAP families) showed celecoxib can prevent polyp growth. Hence, large-scale randomized clinical trials were undertaken. Results show a 33 to 45% polyp recurrence reduction in people treated with celecoxib each day. However, serious cardiovascular events were significantly more frequent in the celecoxib-treated groups. Aspirin shows a similar (and possibly larger) protective effect, has demonstrated cardioprotective effects and is significantly cheaper, but no head-to-head clinical trials have compared the two drugs. === Cancer treatment === Different from cancer prevention, cancer treatment is focused on the therapy of tumors that have already formed and have established themselves inside the patient. Many studies are going on to determine whether celecoxib might be useful for this latter condition. However, during molecular studies in the laboratory, it became apparent that celecoxib could interact with other intracellular components besides its most famous target, COX-2. The discovery of these additional targets has generated much controversy, and the initial assumption that celecoxib reduces tumor growth primarily by the inhibition of COX-2 became contentious. Certainly, the inhibition of COX-2 is paramount for the anti-inflammatory and analgesic function of celecoxib. However, whether inhibition of COX-2 also plays a dominant role in this drug's anticancer effects is unclear. For example, a recent study with malignant tumor cells showed celecoxib could inhibit the growth of these cells in vitro, but COX-2 played no role in this outcome; even more strikingly, the anticancer effects of celecoxib were also obtained with the use of cancer cell types that do not even contain COX-2. Karen Seibert and colleagues have published research showing antiangiogenic and antitumor activity of celecoxib in animal models. Additional support for the idea that other targets besides COX-2 are important for celecoxib's anticancer effects has come from studies with chemically modified versions of celecoxib. Several dozen analogs of celecoxib were generated with small alterations in their chemical structures. Some of these analogs retained COX-2 inhibitory activity, whereas many others did not. However, when the ability of all these compounds to kill tumor cells in cell culture was investigated, the antitumor potency did not at all depend on whether or not the respective compound could inhibit COX-2, showing the inhibition of COX-2 was not required for the anticancer effects. One of these compounds, 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib, which entirely lacks the ability to inhibit COX-2, actually displayed stronger anticancer activity than celecoxib. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""COX-2 Selective (includes Bextra, Celebrex, and Vioxx) and Non-Selective Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)"".

763,"('Felodipine', 'Plendil', 'Flodil', 'Renedil', 'Feloday')",Medical,"Felodipine is a medication of the calcium channel blocker type that is used to treat high blood pressure. It was patented in 1978, and approved for medical use in 1988. == Medical uses == Felodipine is used to treat high blood pressure and stable angina. It should not be used for people who are pregnant, have acute heart failure, are having a heart attack, have an obstructed heart valve, or have obstructions that block bloodflow out of the heart. For people with liver failure the dose needs to be lowered, because felodipine is cleared by the liver. == Adverse effects == The only very common side effect, occurring in more than 1/10 people, is pain and swelling in the arms and legs. Common side effects, occurring in between 1% and 10% of people, include flushing, headache, heart palpitations, dizziness and fatigue. Felodipine can exacerbate gingivitis. == Interactions == Felodipine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, so substances that inhibit or activate CYP3A4 can strongly effect how much felodipine is present. CYP3A4 inhibitors, which increase the amount of felodipine available per dose, include cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, and grapefruit juice. CYP3A4 activators, which decrease the amount of felodipine available per dose, include phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates, efavirenz, nevirapine, and Saint John's wort. == Mechanism of action == Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker. Felodipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid. Different calcium channels are present in vascular tissue and cardiac tissue; an in vitro study on human vascular and cardiac tissues comparing how selective various calcium channel blockers are for vascular compared to cardiac tissue found the following vascular/cardiac tissue ratios: mibefradil 41, felodipine 12; nifedipine 7, amlodipine 5, and verapamil 0.2.: 172 == Chemistry == Felodipine is a member of the 1,4-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers.: 20–21 It is a racemic mixture, and is insoluble in water but is soluble in dichloromethane and ethanol.: 25 == History == The Swedish company Hässle, a division of Astra AB, discovered felodipine; it filed a patent application in 1979 claiming felodipine as an antihypertensive drug. Astra partnered this drug and others with Merck & Co. in the US under a 1982 agreement between the companies. The drug was approved by the FDA in 1991 after a three-and-a-half-year review; the drug entered a very crowded market to included the other calcium channel blockers nifedipine, verapamil, nicardipine, and isradipine. The FDA gave the drug a 1C rating, meaning that it found little difference between felodipine and the drugs already approved for the same use. In 1994 Astra AB and Merck changed their partnership to a joint venture called Astra Merck, and in 1998 Astra (by that time, AstraZeneca) bought out Merck's rights in the joint venture. The first generics became available in Sweden in 2003 and in the US in 2004.: 155 In April 2016, AstraZeneca announced that they were selling the right to market felodipine in China to China Medical System Holdings for $310 million; AZ would continue to manufacture the drug. == Society and culture == As of 2016, felodipine was marketed under many brand names worldwide: Auronal, Cardioplen, Catrazil, Dewei, Dilahex, Enfelo, Erding, Fedil, Fedisyn, Feldil, Felicipin, Felo, Felocard, Felocor, Feloday, Felodil, Felodin, Felodip, Felodipin, Felodipina, Felodipine, Felodipino, Felodistad, Felogard, Felohexal, Felop, Felopine, Felostad, Feloten, Felotens, Felpin, Flodicar, Flodil, Keliping, Keydipin, Lodistad, Modip, Munobal, Nirmadil, Parmid, Penedil, Perfudal, Phelop, Phenodical, Plendil, Plentopine, Polo, Presid, Preslow, Prevex, Renedil, Sistar, Splendil, Stapin, Topidil, Vascalpha, Versant, and XiaoDing. The combination of felodipine and candesartan was marketed as Atacand. The combination of felodipine and ramipril was marketed as Delmuno, Tazko, Triacor, Triapin, Triasyn, Tri-Plen, Unimax, and Unitens.

A first-in-human phase I study reported that ravoxertinib hydrochloride (RAH), a novel Erk1/2 inhibitor, has an acceptable safety profile and pharmacodynamic effects. Here, we showed that the level of Erk1/2 phosphorylation (p-Erk1/2) was significantly increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients who developed poor outcomes. In a rat SAH model that was produced by the intracranial endovascular perforation method, western blot observed that the level of p-Erk1/2 was also increased in the CSF and basal cortex, showing a similar trend with aSAH patients. Immunofluorescence and western blot indicated that RAH treatment (i.c.v injection, 30 min post-SAH) attenuates the SAH-induced increase of p-Erk1/2 at 24 h in rats. RAH treatment can improve experimental SAH-induced long-term sensorimotor and spatial learning deficits that are evaluated by the Morris water maze, rotarod test, foot-fault test, and forelimb placing test. Moreover, RAH treatment attenuates neurobehavioral deficits, the blood-brain barrier damage, and cerebral edema at 72 h after SAH in rats. Furthermore, RAH treatment decreases the SAH-elevated apoptosis-related factor active caspase-3 and the necroptosis-related factor RIPK1 expression at 72 h in rats. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that RAH attenuated neuronal apoptosis but not neuronal necroptosis in the basal cortex at 72 h after SAH in rats. Altogether, our results suggest that RAH improves long-term neurologic deficits through early inhibition of Erk1/2 in experimental SAH. Lymphangiectasia, an anomalous dilation of lymphatic vessels first described in the 17th century, is frequently associated with chylous effusion, respiratory failure, and high mortality in young patients, yet the underlying molecular pathogenesis and effective treatments remain elusive. Here, we identify an unexpected causal link between MAPK activation and defective development of the lymphatic basement membrane that drives lymphangiectasia. Human pathological tissue samples from patients diagnosed with lymphangiectasia revealed sustained MAPK activation within lymphatic endothelial cells. Endothelial KRASG12D-mediated sustained MAPK activation in newborn mice caused severe pulmonary and intercostal lymphangiectasia, accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, and complete lethality. Pathological activation of MAPK in murine vasculature inhibited the Nfatc1-dependent genetic program required for laminin interactions, collagen crosslinking, and anchoring fibril formation, driving defective development of the lymphatic basement membrane. Treatment with ravoxertinib, a pharmacological inhibitor of MAPK, reverses nuclear-to-cytoplasmic localization of Nfatc1, basement membrane development defects, lymphangiectasia, and chyle accumulation, ultimately improving survival of endothelial KRAS mutant neonatal mice. These results reveal defective lymphatic basement membrane assembly and composition as major causes of thoracic lymphangiectasia and provide a potential treatment.

It is a member of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and was approved by the US FDA in 1980. Like other members of the class, it is a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, preventing the formation of prostaglandins. Scientists led by Claude Winder from Parke-Davis invented meclofenamate sodium in 1964, along with fellow members of the class, mefenamic acid in 1961 and flufenamic acid in 1963.: 718 Patents on the drug expired in 1985: 295 and several generics were introduced in the US, but as of July 2015 only Mylan still sold it. It is not widely used in humans as it has a high rate (30-60%) rate of gastrointestinal side effects.: 310 == Adverse effects == In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == Use in horses == Meclofenamic acid is sold under the trade name ""Arquel"" for use in horses, and is administered as an oral granule form at a dose of 2.2 mg/kg/day. It has a relatively slow onset of action, taking 36–48 hours for full effect, and is most useful for treatment of chronic musculoskeletal disease. It has been found to be beneficial for the treatment of navicular syndrome, laminitis, and osteoarthritis, in some cases having a more profound effect than the commonly used NSAID phenylbutazone. However, due to cost, it is not routinely used in practice. Toxicity due to excessive dosage is similar to that of phenylbutazone, including depression, anorexia, weight loss, edema, diarrhea, oral ulceration, and decreased hematocrit. == References ==",Meclofenamate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4066597032069694e-05), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018164945766329765)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/meclofenamate-oral-route/description/drg-20516747?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=141, start_index=9, title='Meclofenamate (oral route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/meclofenamate-oral-route/description/drg-20516747?utm_source=openai')])"
766,"('Cetrorelix (acetate)',)",Medical," Cetrorelix, a potent third generation of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist, is a synthetic decapeptide used for treatment of infertility, prostatic hypertrophy and sexual hormone-dependent tumors. The approved drug of cetrorelix (Cetrotide, Asta Medica AG, Frankfurt, Germany.), was used for prevention of premature ovulation in patients undergoing a controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), followed by oocyte pick-up and assisted reproductive techniques, and has been shown safe and effective in controlled ovarian stimulation. Nevertheless, the study of aggregation products of cetrorelix was rarely reported. A simple liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for separation, identification and characterization of a new cetrorelix methylene dimer impurity in cetrorelix. The chromatographic separation was achieved on an XSelect Peptide CSH ™C BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 GnRH agonists - triptorelin acetate and cetrorelix acetate - in assisted reproduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 182 females who received in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF+ET) from March 2014 to July 2014 were involved, and their clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 91 patients received treatment with short-acting triptorelin (group A) and another 91 patients were treated with cetrorelix acetate (group B). Fasting blood was extracted from each patient on the day of administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) were detected using chemiluminescence method. The number of oocytes, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, and number of obtained embryos were recorded and compared. Pregnancy outcomes and adverse events were observed and compared. Expression level of FSH receptor (FSHR) in endometrial tissues was measured by qRT-PCR. RESULTS Serum level of E2 was significantly lower in group B than in group A (p<0.05). Indices, including the number of oocytes, fertilization rate and cleavage rate, number of obtained embryos, and pregnancy rate, were slightly better in group B than in group A, but no significant differences were found. The incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was significant higher in group A than in group B (p<0.05). FSHR expression level was significantly lower in group B than in group A. CONCLUSIONS The effect of cetrorelix acetate is superior to that of short-acting triptorelin in assisted reproduction. Our most important finding is that cetrorelix acetate reduced the incidence of OHSS. To compare the safety and efficacy of single-dose cetrorelix acetate (3 mg) and daily ganirelix acetate (0.25 mg) in the inhibition of premature LH surge in women undergoing cycle-programmed ovarian stimulation before Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). Prospective, open-label, randomized, comparative study. Sixteen ART centers in the United States. One hundred eighty-five infertile patients undergoing ART. Single injection of cetrorelix (3 mg SC) or daily dose of ganirelix (0.25 mg SC) was administered when the lead follicle was > or =14 mm. Daily cetrorelix (0.25 mg) was administered if the criteria for hCG administration were not met 4 days after receiving 3 mg of cetrorelix. Percentage of patients who did not have a premature LH surge, defined as LH <10 IU/L on the day of hCG administration. The IVF and embryo transfer (ET) outcomes were assessed. No patient in either treatment group had a premature LH surge. There were no statistically significant differences between treatments for any IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or ET outcomes, including pregnancy rate (PR). However, cetrorelix required significantly fewer injections than ganirelix. Similar safety profiles were observed. Cetrorelix and ganirelix effectively prevented LH surges in oral contraceptive (OC) pill-programmed, flexible protocols, with similar safety profiles and PRs; however, cetrorelix required significantly fewer injections, increasing patient convenience.",Cetrorelix (acetate),PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011491115583339706), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008629413321614265)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cetrorelix-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20062654?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=146, start_index=9, title='Cetrorelix (subcutaneous route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cetrorelix-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20062654?utm_source=openai')])"

769,"('Gemcitabine', 'Ly 188011', 'Dfdc', ""Cytidine, 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-"", 'Gemcitabine free base')",Medical,"Gemcitabine, sold under the brand name Gemzar, among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat cancers. It is used to treat testicular cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and bladder cancer. It is administered by intravenous infusion. It acts against neoplastic growth, and it inhibits the replication of Orthohepevirus A, the causative agent of Hepatitis E, through upregulation of interferon signaling. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, liver and kidney problems, nausea, fever, rash, shortness of breath, mouth sores, diarrhea, neuropathy, and hair loss. Use during pregnancy will likely result in fetal harm. Gemcitabine is in the nucleoside analog family of medication. It works by blocking the creation of new DNA, which results in cell death. Gemcitabine was patented in 1983 and was approved for medical use in 1995. Generic versions were introduced in Europe in 2009 and in the US in 2010. It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Gemcitabine treats various carcinomas. It is used as a first-line treatment alone for pancreatic cancer, and in combination with cisplatin for advanced or metastatic bladder cancer and advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. It is used as a second-line treatment in combination with carboplatin for ovarian cancer and in combination with paclitaxel for breast cancer that is metastatic or cannot be surgically removed. It is used off-label to treat cholangiocarcinoma and other biliary tract cancers. == Contraindications and interactions == Taking gemcitabine can also affect fertility in men and women, sex life, and menstruation. Women taking gemcitabine should not become pregnant, and pregnant and breastfeeding women should not take it. As of 2014, drug interactions had not been studied. == Adverse effects == Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that works by killing any cells that are dividing. Cancer cells divide rapidly and so are targeted at higher rates by gemcitabine, but many essential cells also divide rapidly, including cells in skin, the scalp, the stomach lining, and bone marrow, resulting in adverse effects.: 265 The gemcitabine label carries warnings that it can suppress bone marrow function and cause loss of white blood cells, loss of platelets, and loss of red blood cells, and that it should be used carefully in people with liver, kidney, or cardiovascular disorders. People taking it should not take live vaccines. The warning label also states it may cause posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, that it may cause capillary leak syndrome, that it may cause severe lung conditions like pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and adult respiratory distress syndrome, and that it may harm sperm. More than 10% of users develop adverse effects, including difficulty breathing, low white and red blood cells counts, low platelet counts, vomiting and nausea, elevated transaminases, rashes and itchy skin, hair loss, blood and protein in urine, flu-like symptoms, and edema. Common adverse effects (occurring in 1–10% of users) include fever, loss of appetite, headache, difficulty sleeping, tiredness, cough, runny nose, diarrhea, mouth and lip sores, sweating, back pain, and muscle pain. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but serious side effect that been associated with particular chemotherapy medications including gemcitabine. TTP is a blood disorder and can lead to microangipathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), neurologic abnormalities, fever, and renal disease. == Pharmacology == Gemcitabine is hydrophilic and must be transported into cells via molecular transporters for nucleosides (the most common transporters for gemcitabine are SLC29A1, SLC28A1, and SLC28A3). After entering the cell, gemcitabine is first modified by attaching a phosphate to it, and so it becomes gemcitabine monophosphate (dFdCMP). This is the rate-determining step that is catalyzed by the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (DCK). Two more phosphates are added by other enzymes. After the attachment of the three phosphates gemcitabine is finally pharmacologically active as gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP). After being thrice phosphorylated, gemcitabine can masquerade as deoxycytidine triphosphate and is incorporated into new DNA strands being synthesized as the cell replicates. When gemcitabine is incorporated into DNA it allows a native, or normal, nucleoside base to be added next to it. This leads to ""masked chain termination"" because gemcitabine is a ""faulty"" base, but due to its neighboring native nucleoside it eludes the cell's normal repair system (base-excision repair). Thus, incorporation of gemcitabine into the cell's DNA creates an irreparable error that leads to inhibition of further DNA synthesis, and thereby leading to cell death. The form of gemcitabine with two phosphates attached (dFdCDP) also has activity; it inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which is needed to create new DNA nucleotides. The lack of nucleotides drives the cell to uptake more of the components it needs to make nucleotides from outside the cell, which also increases uptake of gemcitabine. == Chemistry == Gemcitabine is a synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside prodrug—a nucleoside analog in which the hydrogen atoms on the 2' carbon of deoxycytidine are replaced by fluorine atoms. The synthesis described and pictured below is the original synthesis done in the Eli Lilly Company labs. Synthesis begins with enantiopure D-glyceraldehyde (R)-2 as the starting material which can made from D-mannitol in 2–7 steps. Then fluorine is introduced by a ""building block"" approach using ethyl bromodifluoroacetate. Then, Reformatsky reaction under standard conditions will yield a 3:1 anti/syn diastereomeric mixture, with one major product. Separation of the diastereomers is carried out via HPLC, thus yielding the anti-3 gemcitabine in a 65% yield. At least two other full synthesis methods have also been developed by different groups. == History == Gemcitabine was first synthesized in Larry Hertel's lab at Eli Lilly and Company during the early 1980s. It was intended as an antiviral drug, but preclinical testing showed that it killed leukemia cells in vitro. During the early 1990s gemcitabine was studied in clinical trials. The pancreatic cancer trials found that gemcitabine increased one-year survival rate significantly, and it was approved in the UK in 1995 and approved by the FDA in 1996 for pancreatic cancers. In 1998, gemcitabine received FDA approval for treating non-small cell lung cancer and in 2004, it was approved for metastatic breast cancer. European labels were harmonized by the EMA in 2008. By 2008, Lilly's worldwide sales of gemcitabine were about $1.7 billion; at that time its US patents were set to expire in 2013 and its European patents in 2009. The first generic launched in Europe in 2009, and patent challenges were mounted in the US which led to invalidation of a key Lilly patent on its method to make the drug. Generic companies started selling the drug in the US in 2010 when the patent on the chemical itself expired. Patent litigation in China made headlines there and was resolved in 2010. == Society and culture == As of 2017, gemcitabine was marketed under many brand names worldwide: Abine, Accogem, Acytabin, Antoril, axigem, Bendacitabin, Biogem, Boligem, Celzar, Citegin, Cytigem, Cytogem, Daplax, DBL, Demozar, Dercin, Emcitab, Enekamub, Eriogem, Fotinex, Gebina, Gemalata, Gembin, Gembine, Gembio, Gemcel, Gemcetin, Gemcibine, Gemcikal, Gemcipen, Gemcired, Gemcirena, Gemcit, Gemcitabin, Gemcitabina, Gemcitabine, Gemcitabinum, Gemcitan, Gemedac, Gemflor, Gemful, Gemita, Gemko, Gemliquid, Gemmis, Gemnil, Gempower, Gemsol, Gemstad, Gemstada, Gemtabine, Gemtavis, Gemtaz, Gemtero, Gemtra, Gemtro, Gemvic, Gemxit, Gemzar, Gentabim, Genuten, Genvir, Geroam, Gestredos, Getanosan, Getmisi, Gezt, Gitrabin, Gramagen, Haxanit, Jemta, Kalbezar, Medigem, Meditabine, Nabigem, Nallian, Oncogem, Oncoril, Pamigeno, Ribozar, Santabin, Sitagem, Symtabin, Yu Jie, Ze Fei, and Zefei. == Research == Because it is clinically valuable and is only useful when delivered intravenously, methods to reformulate it so that it can be given by mouth have been a subject of research. Research into pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics has been ongoing. As of 2014, it was not clear whether or not genetic tests could be useful in guiding dosing and which people respond best to gemcitabine. However, it appears that variation in the expression of proteins (SLC29A1, SLC29A2, SLC28A1, and SLC28A3) used for transport of gemcitabine into the cell lead to variations in its potency. Similarly, the genes that express proteins that lead to its inactivation (deoxycytidine deaminase, cytidine deaminase, and NT5C) and that express its other intracellular targets (RRM1, RRM2, and RRM2B) lead to variations in response to the drug. Research has also been ongoing to understand how mutations in pancreatic cancers themselves determine response to gemcitabine. It has been studied as a treatment for Kaposi sarcoma, a common cancer in people with AIDS which is uncommon in the developed world but not uncommon in the developing world. == References ==",Gemcitabine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.7417760065873154e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003466005437076092)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/gemcitabinehydrochloride?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=119, start_index=9, title='Gemcitabine Hydrochloride - NCI', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/gemcitabinehydrochloride?utm_source=openai')])"
770,"('Cerivastatin (sodium)', 'Cerivastatin', 'Baycol', 'Cerivastatin acid', 'Lipobay')",Medical,"Cerivastatin (INN, brand names: Baycol, Lipobay) is a synthetic member of the class of statins used to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease. It was marketed by the pharmaceutical company Bayer A.G. in the late 1990s, competing with Pfizer's highly successful atorvastatin (Lipitor). Cerivastatin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide in 2001, due to reports of fatal rhabdomyolysis. During postmarketing surveillance, 52 deaths were reported in patients using cerivastatin, mainly from rhabdomyolysis and its resultant kidney failure. Risks were higher in patients using fibrates, mainly gemfibrozil (Lopid), and in patients using the highest (0.8 mg/day) dose of cerivastatin. Bayer A.G. added a contraindication for the concomitant use of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil to the package 18 months after the drug interaction was found. The frequency of deadly cases of rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin was 16 to 80 times higher than with other statins. Another 385 nonfatal cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. This put the risk of this (rare) complication at 5-10 times that of the other statins. Cerivastatin also induced myopathy in a dose-dependent manner when administered as monotherapy, but that was revealed only after Bayer was sued and unpublished company documents were opened. == Structure and reactivity == Cerivastatin consists of a fluorophenyl linked to a pyridine. The pyridine has two isopropyl groups, one methoxy group and a dihydroxyheptanoic acid side chain. The dihydroxyheptanoic acid group is the functional part of the molecule. This part will bind to the HMG-CoA reductase making it unavailable for HMG-CoA. Cerivastatin is a pure synthetic drug, produced to create a more potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Cerivastatin was the most potent inhibitor with an inhibitory constant of 0.5 μg/L, which made it already effective at a low dose. It is taken up orally as tablets, where it is combined with sodium salt. The IUPAC name is then (+)-(3R,5S,6E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,6-diisopropyl-5-methoxymethylpyridin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid monosodium salt. Cerivastatin sodium (C22H33FNO3Na) is administered orally via a tablet. The molecular weight is 481.5 g/mol. It is odorless and it is soluble in water, methanol and ethanol. Under acidic circumstances, it undergoes cyclization to form pyridinolactone. == Mechanism of action == Five main classes of agents can be used to treat hyperlipidemia, a condition that comes with high cholesterol levels. Those are bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, probucol and HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors. Cerivastatin mainly acts by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA-reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme step in cholesterol biosynthesis. It occurs during the mevalonate pathway in the liver, where hydroxylmethylglutaryl is converted to mevalonate. Cerivastatin is a synthetic and enantiomerically pure inhibitor of the reductase, meaning it can fit into the enzyme's active site, and therefore compete with the substrate HMG-CoA, which is the native substrate for the reductase. Due to the competition, the rate of mevalonate production by the enzyme is reduced. This also means that the rates subsequent biosynthesis is reduced, since less starting material is available. Eventually, this will lead to lower cholesterol levels. The location of cholesterol biosynthesis and inhibition of HMG-CoA is of significance, since most circulating cholesterol originates from internal production, rather than the diet. If the liver cannot produce more cholesterol, the cholesterol levels in the blood will decrease. Also, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors cause secondary up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors, with increased LDL-cholesterol clearance and reduction of both total and LDL cholesterol in the serum. == Metabolism == Cerivastatin is metabolized via the hepatic pathway. In vitro studies with human liver cells showed that two metabolic pathways are equally important; demethylation of the benzylic methyl ether and hydroxylation at one methyl group of the 6-isopropyl substituent. Demethylation is catalysed by the enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, which generates a metabolite that is known as M-1 in the cerivastatin metabolite pathway. Hydroxylation is catalysed by CYP2C8, which generates the major active metabolite, M-23. M-1 and M-23 are, like cerivastatin, pharmacologically active, with comparable potencies. Combination of the latter leads to another minor metabolite, that is not detectable in plasma, which is also known as M-24. Following a 0.8 mg dose of cerivastatin, the mean steady state Cmax values for cerivastatin, M-1 and M-23 were 12.7, 0.55 and 1.4 μg/L, respectively. Hence, it can be concluded that the cholesterol-lowering effect is mostly due to the cerivastatin itself. == Efficacy, toxicity and side effects == === Efficacy and toxicity === The inhibitory activity of cerivastatin was compared to that of other statins, specifically lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. This comparison was made by determining the IC50 values of each compound. These values were 77 nM, 66 nM and 176 nM for these statins, respectively, while the value for cerivastatin was found to be 1.1 nM. Using Dixon plots, the inhibitory constant of cerivastatin was found to be 1.3 x 10-9 M, which is over 100 times lower than the inhibitory constant of lovastatin, known to be 150 x 10-9 M. To compare cerivastatin activity to that of other statins, its IC25 value was also determined for various types of human smooth muscle cells: cells from the left internal mammary artery (HSMC), cornea fibroblasts (HCF), myoblasts from striated muscle (HM) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The activity in these groups of muscle cells was compared to the activity of the statins listed above, as well as atorvastatin and fluvastatin. The pharmacological results from cerivastatin show that it is the most active HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor among reported statins. Due to its high enzyme affinity, it would seem to offer ultra-low dose therapy in the microgram range. However, due to its relatively severe adverse effects in comparison to other statins, its market use was discontinued. The strengths of the available cerivastatin medicine ranged from 0.2 - 0.8 mg, resulting in an actual dose of 1.9 - 13.1 μg/kg body weight for which rhabdomyolysis has been reported. Although the mechanism of the cerivastatin induced myopathy is not exactly known, the risk increases with statin dose. This risk also appears to increase among patients who received gemfibrozil or lovastatin concomitantly, and there is a known interaction between these drugs and cerivastatin. There are 31 cerivastatin-related deaths reported in the US and a further 21 deaths worldwide. There were also 385 cases of non-fatal rhabdomyolysis reported among the estimated 700.000 users in the USA. In 12 of the 31 reported deaths of cerivastatin-related rhabdomyolysis in the US the cerivastatin-gemfibrozil interaction was implicated, while in 7 of the 31 fatal cases in the US, cerivastatin was combined with lovastatin.

It is taken by mouth. The most common side effects include upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and decreased weight. Arimoclomol was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2024. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Arimoclomol, in combination with miglustat, is indicated for the treatment of neurological symptoms associated with Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC) in adults and children two years of age and older. == Side effects == The most common side effects of arimoclomol include upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and decreased weight. == Mechanism of action == Arimoclomol is believed to function by stimulating a normal cellular protein repair pathway through the activation of molecular chaperones. Since damaged proteins, called aggregates, are thought to play a role in many diseases, CytRx believes that arimoclomol could treat a broad range of diseases. Arimoclomol activates the heat shock response. It is believed to act at Hsp70. == History == Arimoclomol was discovered by Hungarian researchers, as a drug candidate to treat insulin resistance and diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. Later, the compound, along with other small molecules, was screened for further development by Hungarian firm Biorex, which was sold to CytRx Corporation, who developed it toward a different direction from 2003. Arimoclomol (INN; originally codenamed BRX-345, which is a citrate salt formulation of BRX-220) was an experimental drug developed by CytRx Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company based in Los Angeles, California. In 2011, the worldwide rights to arimoclomol were bought by Danish biotech company Orphazyme ApS. In September 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval of arimoclomol to Zevra Therapeutics. The FDA approved arimoclomol based on results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-month trial in participants 2 to 19 years of age who had a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of Niemann-Pick disease, type C. Fifty participants were randomized 2:1 to treatment with weight-adjusted arimoclomol (31 to 124 mg) or placebo orally three times per day. Among these 50 participants, 39 (78%) received miglustat as background treatment in the trial. Efficacy was demonstrated by the rescored 4-domain Niemann-Pick disease, type C Clinical Severity Scale (R4DNPCCSS) score in the participants who used miglustat as their background treatment. The R4DNPCCSS is a measure of Niemann-Pick disease, type C disease progression that looks at four items that participants with Niemann-Pick disease, type C, their caregivers and physicians have identified as most relevant including ambulation, speech, swallow and fine motor skills. Higher scores signify a greater severity of the disease. Compared to placebo, arimoclomol resulted in a slower disease progression as measured by the R4DNPCCSS score. == Society and culture == === Legal status === The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan drug designation to arimoclomol as a potential treatment for Niemann-Pick type C in 2014 and 2015 respectively.

It is an inhibitor and degrader of mutant phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) alpha. The PI3K-mediated signalling pathway has shown to play an important role in the development of tumours as dysregulation is commonly associated with tumour growth and resistance to antineoplastic agents and radiotherapy. The most common adverse reactions include decreased neutrophils, decreased hemoglobin, increased fasting glucose, decreased platelets, decreased lymphocytes, stomatitis, diarrhea, decreased calcium, fatigue, decreased potassium, increased creatinine, increased ALT, nausea, decreased sodium, decreased magnesium, rash, decreased appetite, COVID-19 infection, and headache. Inavolisib was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2024. == Medical uses == Inavolisib is indicated in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant for the treatment of adults with endocrine-resistant, PIK3CA-mutated, hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, as detected by an FDA-approved test, following recurrence on or after completing adjuvant endocrine therapy. == Side effects == The most common adverse reactions include decreased neutrophils, decreased hemoglobin, increased fasting glucose, decreased platelets, decreased lymphocytes, stomatitis, diarrhea, decreased calcium, fatigue, decreased potassium, increased creatinine, increased ALT, nausea, decreased sodium, decreased magnesium, rash, decreased appetite, COVID-19 infection, and headache. == History == Efficacy was evaluated in INAVO120 (NCT04191499), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in 325 participants with endocrine-resistant, PIK3CA-mutated HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed during or within twelve months of completing adjuvant endocrine therapy and who had not received prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Primary endocrine resistance was defined as relapse while on the first two years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) and secondary endocrine resistance was defined as relapse while on adjuvant ET after at least two years or relapse within twelve months of completing adjuvant ET. == Structure, reactivity, and synthesis == Inavolisib is a synthetic, organic, small compound (the full structure can be seen here). When binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (p110α), inavolisib’s carbonyl group can accept a hydrogen bond from the Tyr836 (conserved) in p110α. The difluoromethyl group can interact with the hydroxyl group presented on Ser774 (conserved) in p110α, which is 3.2Å nearer than of which on the equivalent residue Ser754 in p110δ. Additionally, the amide group can interact with Gln859 (non-conserved). This results in a very high selectivity regarding PI3Kα isoforms. Compared to similar PI3K inhibiting compounds, inavolisib has a higher thermodynamic aqueous solubility that proved advantageous in the formulation process and aiding greater consistency in predictions of absorption. Inavolisibcan be developed as a derivative of 1,3-oxazole or by means of stereo-controlled N-arylation of alpha-amino acids. == Metabolism and biotransformation == Inavolisib is orally administered, though there is little knowledge about its metabolism. However, absorption, metabolism, and excretion data of taselisib, a molecule with a related chemical scaffold, suggest moderately slow absorption into the systemic circulation, metabolism to play a minor role in drug clearance, and biliary excretion to be the main route of excretion. == Molecular mechanisms of action == Inavolisib is a selective PI3K-p110α (PIK3CA) inhibitor, which may offer antineoplastic functionality. Therefore, it may serve as a new addition to combination therapy with conventional cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy. Combining inavolisib with palbociclib and fulvestrant might improve treatment of breast cancer. Next to its inhibitory enzymatic ability, it is suggested that inavolisib binds to - and activates degradation of - mutated forms of p110α. Members of the PI3K family regulate cellular processes such as cell growth and proliferation, survival, remodelling, and intracellular transport of organelles. PI3K also plays an essential role for the immune system. The class I isoform PI3K alpha (PI3Kα) is often times expressed in solid tumours through gene amplification or activated mutations. Mutations in PI3Kα can often be found in cancer cells, especially HR+ breast cancer, which causes a disruption of the PI3K pathway. This leads to increased tumour growth and metastasis. One of the most common mutations can be found in PIK3CA, which plays a significant role in tumour cell proliferation. In preclinical studies, inavolisib has shown to specifically initiate the degradation of this p110α oncogene with the help of proteasomes. After binding to the mutant PI3Kα, inavolisib blocks phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3, thereby stopping downstream signalling. Consequently, biomarkers in the PI3K pathway are reduced, cell proliferation inhibited, and the rate of PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer apoptosis increased (in comparison to the wild type). The exact mechanism of action of inhibitors like inavolisib on mutated PI3Kα and the inhibitors' influence on mutant structures are still unknown. == Toxicity == Inavolisib is able to induce a cytotoxic response but this is directed towards tumour cells that contain the PI3K mutation, thereby inhibiting further tumour growth and leading to cell loss. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In October 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved inavolisib for the treatment of PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer based on the results from the INAVO120 trial. The drug application was granted priority review and breakthrough therapy designations by the FDA. === Names === Inavolisib is the international nonproprietary name. Inavolisib is sold under the brand name Itovebi. == Research == Due to inavolisib’s ability to inhibit the PI3K pathway through HER2-dependent degradation, it is undergoing clinical trials to potentially make use of it as an antineoplastic (anti-cancer) drug to treat breast cancer. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT04191499 for ""A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Inavolisib + Palbociclib + Fulvestrant vs Placebo + Palbociclib + Fulvestrant in Patients With PIK3CA-Mutant, Hormone Receptor-Positive, Her2-Negative, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer (INAVO120)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Inavolisib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.304672595229931e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005566716426983476)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-inavolisib-palbociclib-and-fulvestrant-endocrine-resistant-pik3ca-mutated-hr-positive?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=201, start_index=9, title='FDA approves inavolisib with palbociclib and fulvestrant for endocrine-resistant, PIK3CA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-inavolisib-palbociclib-and-fulvestrant-endocrine-resistant-pik3ca-mutated-hr-positive?utm_source=openai')])"

In mid-June 2016, Infinity announced results of Phase II clinical trial of duvelisib. In November 2016, Infinity exclusively licensed the worldwide rights to duvelisib to Verastem Oncology for little money compared to earlier deals; the deal included no upfront payment, a $6 million milestone for success in a Phase 3 trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a $22 million payment for an FDA approval, and royalties. Duvelisib received orphan drug designation in the United States for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) in 2019, the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma in 2013, and the treatment of follicular lymphoma in 2013. In September 2020, duvelisib was sold by Verastem to Secura Bio, Inc. for $70 million and additional payments based on milestones and royalties. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug manufacturer, Secura Bio, to submit the final 5-year survival results from the clinical trial, called DUO trial, a phase III, randomized, open-label trial. It was conducted in 319 participants with CLL or SLL who received a previous therapy that did not work or stopped working. These final results showed a possible increased risk of death with duvelisib compared to the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab. The rate of serious side effects, dose modifications, and deaths resulting from these side effects were also higher among participants who received duvelisib. The serious side effects included infections, diarrhea, inflammation of the intestine and lungs, skin reactions, and elevated liver enzyme levels in the blood. These safety findings were similar for other medicines in the same PI3 kinase inhibitor class. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In April 2018, Verastem filed a New Drug Application (NDA) for duvelisib for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and accelerated approval for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL). The FDA approved the application in September 2018. In April 2022, the FDA withdrew the approval of duvelisib for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma on request of its then owner, Secura Bio. Duvelisib is intended to be used in people who have received at least two prior systemic therapies, and carries a black box warning due to the risk of fatal/serious toxicities: infections, diarrhea or colitis, cutaneous reactions and pneumonitis.

777,"('Sparteine', 'Lupinidine', 'Spartein', 'Lupinidin', 'Sparteinum')",Medical,"Sparteine is a class 1a antiarrhythmic agent and sodium channel blocker. It is an alkaloid and can be extracted from scotch broom. It is the predominant alkaloid in Lupinus mutabilis, and is thought to chelate the bivalent metals calcium and magnesium. It is not FDA approved for human use as an antiarrhythmic agent, and it is not included in the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmic drugs. It is also used as a chiral ligand in organic chemistry, especially in syntheses involving organolithium reagents. == Biosynthesis == Sparteine is a lupin alkaloid containing a tetracyclic bis-quinolizidine ring system derived from three C5 chains of lysine, or more specifically, L-lysine. The first intermediate in the biosynthesis is cadaverine, the decarboxylation product of lysine catalyzed by the enzyme lysine decarboxylase (LDC). Three units of cadaverine are used to form the quinolizidine skeleton. The mechanism of formation has been studied enzymatically, as well as with tracer experiments, but the exact route of synthesis still remains unclear. Tracer studies using 13C-15N-doubly labeled cadaverine have shown three units of cadaverine are incorporated into sparteine and two of the C-N bonds from two of the cadaverine units remain intact. The observations have also been confirmed using 2H NMR labeling experiments. Enzymatic evidence then showed that the three molecules of cadaverine are transformed to the quinolizidine ring via enzyme bound intermediates, without the generation of any free intermediates. Originally, it was thought that conversion of cadaverine to the corresponding aldehyde, 5-aminopentanal, was catalyzed by the enzyme diamine oxidase. The aldehyde then spontaneously converts to the corresponding Schiff base, Δ1-piperideine. Coupling of two molecules occurs between the two tautomers of Δ1-piperideine in an aldol-type reaction. The imine is then hydrolyzed to the corresponding aldehyde/amine. The primary amine is then oxidized to an aldehyde followed by formation of the imine to yield the quinolizidine ring. === Via 17-oxosparteine synthase === More recent enzymatic evidence has indicated the presence of 17-oxosparteine synthase (OS), a transaminase enzyme. The deaminated cadaverine is not released from the enzyme, thus is can be assumed that the enzyme catalyzes the formation of the quinolizidine skeleton in a channeled fashion . 7-oxosparteine requires four units of pyruvate as the NH2 acceptors and produces four molecules of alanine.

The drug was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica (R14950) in 1968. == Medical uses == Flunarizine is effective in the prophylaxis of migraine, occlusive peripheral vascular disease, vertigo of central and peripheral origin, and as an add-on in the treatment of epilepsy where its effect is weak and not recommended. It has been shown to significantly reduce headache frequency and severity in both adults and children. == Contraindications == Flunarizine is contraindicated in patients with depression, in the acute phase of a stroke, and in patients with extrapyramidal symptoms or Parkinson's disease. It is also contraindicated in hypotension, heart failure and arrhythmia. == Side effects == Common side effects include drowsiness (20% of patients), weight gain (10%), as well as extrapyramidal effects and depression in elderly patients. == Interactions == The effects of other sedating drugs and alcohol, as well as antihypertensives, can be increased. No relevant pharmacokinetic interactions have been described. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Flunarizine is a selective calcium antagonist with moderate other actions including antihistamine, serotonin receptor blocking and dopamine D2 blocking activity. Compared to other calcium channel blockers such as dihydropyridine derivatives, verapamil and diltiazem, flunarizine has low affinity to voltage-dependent calcium channels. It has been theorised that it may act not by inhibiting calcium entry into cells, but rather by an intracellular mechanism such as antagonising calmodulin, a calcium binding protein. === Pharmacokinetics === Flunarizine is well absorbed (>80%) from the gut and reaches maximal blood plasma concentrations after two to four hours, with more than 99% of the substance bound to plasma proteins. It readily passes the blood–brain barrier. When given daily, a steady state is reached after five to eight weeks. Concentrations in the brain are about ten times higher than in the plasma. It is metabolised in the liver, mainly by the enzyme CYP2D6. At least 15 different metabolites are described, including (in animals) N-desalkyl and hydroxy derivatives and glucuronides. Less than 1% is excreted in unchanged form, and the main excretion path is via bile and faeces. Elimination half life varies widely between individuals and is about 5 to 15 hours after a single dose, and 18 to 19 days on average when given daily. == Chemistry == Flunarizine is a diphenylmethylpiperazine derivative related to the antihistamines hydroxyzine and cinnarizine (an older molecule also discovered by Janssen). == Research == Flunarizine may help to reduce the severity and duration of attacks of paralysis associated with the more serious form of alternating hemiplegia, as well as being effective in rapid onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP). Both these conditions arise from specific mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Flunarizine extended motor neuron survival in spinal cord, protected skeletal muscles from cell death and atrophy and extended survival by 40% in an animal model of spinal muscular atrophy. Flunarizine has also shown promise as an anti-prion medication. == References == Therapeutic Choices, sixth edition, Canadian Pharmacists Association, 2011.",Sibelium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5152843591058627e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000271879427600652)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
779,"('Indibulin', 'D 24851', '24851', 'Indibulin [usan:inn]', 'Indibulin (usan/inn)')",Medical," Indibulin, a synthetic inhibitor of tubulin assembly, has shown promising anticancer activity with a minimal neurotoxicity in preclinical animal studies and in Phase I clinical trials for cancer chemotherapy. Using time-lapse confocal microscopy, we show that indibulin dampens the dynamic instability of individual microtubules in live breast cancer cells. Indibulin treatment also perturbed the localization of end-binding proteins at the growing microtubule ends in MCF-7 cells. Indibulin reduced inter-kinetochoric tension, produced aberrant spindles, activated mitotic checkpoint proteins Mad2 and BubR1, and induced mitotic arrest in MCF-7 cells. Indibulin-treated MCF-7 cells underwent apoptosis-mediated cell death. Further, the combination of indibulin with an anticancer drug vinblastine was found to exert synergistic cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, indibulin displayed a stronger effect on the undifferentiated neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells than the differentiated neuronal cells. Unlike indibulin, vinblastine and colchicine produced similar depolymerizing effects on microtubules in both differentiated and undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells. The data indicated a possibility that indibulin may reduce chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients. Indibulin, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, produces minimal neurotoxicity in animals. It is also less cytotoxic toward differentiated neuronal cells than undifferentiated cells. We found that the levels of β-III tubulin, acetylated tubulin, and polyglutamylated tubulin were significantly increased in differentiated neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Since neuronal cells express β-tubulin isotypes differently from other cell types, we explored the binding of indibulin to different β-tubulin isotypes. Our molecular docking analysis suggested that indibulin binds to β-III tubulin with lower affinity than to other β-tubulin isotypes. We therefore studied the implications of different β-tubulin isotypes on the cytotoxic effects of indibulin, colchicine, and vinblastine in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Upon depletion of β-III tubulin in the differentiated cells, the toxicity of indibulin and colchicine significantly increased, while sensitivity to vinblastine was unaffected. Using biochemical, bioinformatics, and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, we have identified the binding site of indibulin on tubulin, which had not previously been established. Indibulin inhibited the binding of colchicine and C12 (a colchicine-site binder) to tubulin and also increased the dissociation constant of the interaction between tubulin and colchicine. Indibulin did not inhibit the binding of vinblastine or taxol to tubulin. Interestingly, indibulin antagonized colchicine treatment but synergized with vinblastine treatment in a combination study performed in MDA-MB-231 cells. The results indicate that indibulin is a colchicine-site binder and that the efficacy of colchicine-site binders is affected by the β-III tubulin levels in the cells. Microtubule inhibitors interfere with microtubule dynamics, causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These effects are responsible for the chemotherapeutic activities of members of the taxane and Vinca alkaloid families in oncology. Unfortunately, a major side effect of the taxanes and Vinca alkaloids is the development of peripheral neuropathies. Indibulin (N-[pyridin-4-yl]-[1-(4-chlorbenzyl)-indol-3-yl]-glyoxyl-amid; D-24851; ZIO-301), a novel synthetic small molecule microtubule inhibitor, destabilizes microtubules and has antitumor activity but does not exhibit neurotoxicity in preclinical animal studies. In the present study, it has been found that indibulin is able to discriminate between highly posttranslationally modified tubulin present in mature neuronal microtubules, and less-modified tubulin present in immature neuronal or nonneuronal microtubules. Vincristine and colchicine act on either tubulin equally well. The binding site of indibulin on mature neuronal microtubules seems to be inaccessible due to the posttranslational modifications, a theory that is supported by the observation that indibulin did not disrupt the integrity of highly modified microtubules present in neurites of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The specificity of indibulin for unmodified microtubules seems to be dependent on the pyridyl moiety of indibulin because derivatives that have the pyridyl moiety replaced are not able to discriminate between highly and less-modified tubulins. The observed broad antitumor activity of indibulin and the lack of central and peripheral nervous system toxicity in preclinical studies make it a promising candidate for development as a cancer treatment.

In vitro and clinical results were presented by Gilead in the summer of 2016. In 2016, bictegravir was in a Phase 3 trial as part of a single tablet regimen in combination with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and emtricitabine (FTC) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The combination drug bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Biktarvy) was approved for use in 2018 in Australia, the European Union and the United States and in 2019 in New Zealand and the United Kingdom; a generic version was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India in 2019. As of 2024, it is recommended as a first-line choice of antiretroviral therapy in several countries, including the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. == Medical use == Bictegravir is used a in fixed dose combination with tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. == Contraindication == Bictegravir should not be used with dofetilide and rifampin.

781,"('Chlorpheniramine (maleate)', 'Chlorphenamine maleate', 'Chlorpheniramine', 'Chlorphenamine', 'Teldrin')",Medical,"Chlorphenamine (CP, CPM), also known as chlorpheniramine, is an antihistamine used to treat the symptoms of allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is taken orally (by mouth). The medication takes effect within two hours and lasts for about 4–6 hours. It is a first-generation antihistamine and works by blocking the histamine H1 receptor. Common side effects include sleepiness, restlessness, and weakness. Other side effects may include dry mouth and wheeziness. Chlorpheniramine was patented in 1948 and came into medical use in 1949. It is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In 2022, it was the 291st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Combination products === Chlorphenamine is often combined with phenylpropanolamine to form an allergy medication with both antihistamine and decongestant properties, although phenylpropanolamine was removed from the U.S. market per studies concluding that it increased the risk of stroke in young women. Vernate was a trade name of one such product available in the U.S. prior to the FDA ban; it was manufactured by Tutag and was among the medications prescribed to Elvis Presley. In the drug Coricidin, chlorphenamine is combined with the cough suppressant dextromethorphan. In the drug Cêgripe, chlorphenamine is combined with the analgesic paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol). == Side effects == The adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, constipation, anxiety, nausea, blurred vision, restlessness, decreased coordination, dry mouth, shallow breathing, hallucinations, irritability, problems with memory or concentration, tinnitus and trouble urinating. Chlorphenamine produces less sedation than other first-generation antihistamines. A large study on people 65 years old or older linked the development of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia to the ""higher cumulative"" use of chlorphenamine and other first-generation antihistamines, due to their anticholinergic properties. Chlorphenamine is rated as a ""high burden"" anticholinergic by experts on a semi-subjective scale. This is inconsistent with the in vitro experiments showing low affinity to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Chlorphenamine acts primarily as a potent H1 antihistamine. It is specifically a potent inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor. The drug is also commonly described as possessing weak anticholinergic activity by acting as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The dextrorotatory stereoisomer, dexchlorpheniramine, has been reported to possess Kd values of 15 nM for the H1 receptor and 1,300 nM for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human brain tissue. The smaller the Kd value, the greater the binding affinity of the ligand for its target. In addition to acting as an inverse agonist at the H1 receptor, chlorphenamine has been found to act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Kd = 15.2 nM for the serotonin transporter). It has only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (Kd = 1,440 nM and 1,060 nM, respectively). A study found that dexchlorphenamine had Ki values for the human cloned H1 receptor of 2.67 to 4.81 nM while levchlorphenamine had Ki values of 211 to 361 nM for this receptor, indicating that dexchlorphenamine is the active enantiomer. Another study found that dexchlorphenamine had a Ki value of 20 to 30 μM for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor using rat brain tissue while levchlorphenamine had a Ki value of 40 to 50 μM for this receptor, indicating that both enantiomers have very low affinity for it. === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life of chlorphenamine has variously ranged between 13.9 and 43.4 hours in adults following a single dose in clinical studies. == Chemistry == Chlorphenamine is an alkylamine and is a part of a series of antihistamines including pheniramine (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives including fluorpheniramine, dexchlorphenamine (Polaramine), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral), deschlorpheniramine, and iodopheniramine. The halogenated alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit optical isomerism, and chlorphenamine in the indicated products is racemic chlorphenamine maleate, whereas dexchlorphenamine is the dextrorotary stereoisomer. === Synthesis === There are several patented methods for the synthesis of chlorphenamine. In one example, 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile is reacted with 2-chloropyridine in the presence of sodium amide to form 4-chlorophenyl(2-pyridyl)acetonitrile. Alkylating this with 2-dimethylaminoethylchloride in the presence of sodium amide gives γ-(4-chlorphenyl)-γ-cyano-N,N-dimethyl-2-pyridinepropanamine, the hydrolysis and decarboxylation of which lead to chlorphenamine. A second method boom starts from pyridine, which undergoes alkylation by 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile, giving 2-(4-chlorobenzyl)pyridine. Alkylating this with 2-dimethylaminoethylchloride in the presence of sodium amide gives chlorphenamine. == Society and culture == === Names === Chlorphenamine is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name while chlorpheniramine is the USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and former BANTooltip British Approved Name.

Enrofloxacin has demonstrated a significant post-antibiotic effect for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and is active in both stationary and growth phases of bacterial replication. Enrofloxacin is partially deethylated by CYP450 into the active metabolite ciprofloxacin, which is also a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.

It is an oral VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The most common side effects include fatigue (tiredness), hypertension (high blood pressure), diarrhea, decreased appetite, nausea, dysphonia (voice changes), hypothyroidism, cough, and stomatitis. Tivozanib was approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2017, and in the United States in March 2021. == Medical uses == In the United States, tivozanib is indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma following two or more prior systemic therapies. In the European Union, it is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma; and for the first line treatment of adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma and for adults who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma. == Contraindications == Tivozanib must not be combined with St. John's Wort, an inducer of the liver enzyme CYP3A4. It should not be taken during pregnancy as it is teratogenic, embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects in studies were hypertension (high blood pressure, in 48% of patients), dysphonia (hoarse voice, 27%), fatigue and diarrhea (both 26%). A hypertensive crisis occurred in 1% of patients. == Interactions == Administration of a single dose of tivozanib with rifampicin, a strong inducer of the enzyme CYP3A4, cuts the biological half-life and total exposure (area under the curve) of tivozanib in half, but has no relevant influence on highest concentrations in the blood. Combination with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, has no relevant effects. The clinical significance of these findings is not known. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === A quinoline urea derivative, tivozanib suppresses angiogenesis by being selectively inhibitory against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It is designed to inhibit all three VEGF receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === After tivozanib is taken by mouth, highest blood serum levels are reached after 2 to 24 hours. The total area under the curve is independent of food intake. When in the bloodstream, over 99% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. Although the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 and several UGTs are capable of metabolising the drug, over 90% circulate in unchanged form. The metabolites are demethylation, hydroxylation and N-oxidation products and glucuronides. The biological half-life is 4.5 to 5.1 days; 79% being excreted via the feces, mostly unchanged, and 12% via the urine, completely unchanged. == Chemistry == Tivozanib is used in form of the hydrochloride monohydrate, which is a white to light brown powder. It is practically insoluble in water and has low solubility in aqueous acids, ethanol and methanol. It is not hygroscopic and not optically active. == History == It was discovered at Kyowa Kirin and developed by Aveo Pharmaceuticals. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tivozanib based on evidence from one clinical trial of 350 adult participants with advanced kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma) that had been treated with two or more prior medicines and has come back or did not respond to treatment. The trial compared participants who were randomly assigned to receive either tivozanib or sorafenib. Both the participants and the health care providers knew which treatment was being given. The treatment continued until the disease progression or the side effects became too toxic. The trial compared the length of time participants were alive without progression between the two groups. The trial was conducted at 120 of sites in 12 of countries in North America and Europe. The number of participants representing efficacy findings may differ from the number of patients representing safety findings due to different pools of study participants analyzed for efficacy and safety. === Clinical trials === Phase III results on advanced renal cell carcinoma suggested a 30% or 3 months improvement in median progression-free survival compared to sorafenib but showed an inferior overall survival rate of the experimental arm versus the control arm. The Food and Drug Administration's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted in May 2013 13 to 1 against recommending approval of tivozanib for renal cell carcinoma. The committee felt the drug failed to show a favorable risk-benefit ratio and questioned the equipose of the trial design, which allowed control arm patients who used sorafenib to transition to tivozanib following progression disease but not those on the experimental arm using tivozanib to transition to sorafenib.

It is a selective antagonist of the orexin OX2 receptor (2-SORA). The medication is taken by mouth. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === Seltorexant has fast absorption with a time to peak levels of 0.3 to 1.5 hours and has a relatively short duration with an elimination half-life of only 2 to 3 hours. No residual effects of the medication were observed 4 hours after daytime administration. The pharmacokinetics of seltorexant are considered to be ideal for sleep induction. Seltorexant is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. === Mechanism of action === It is a small-molecule compound and is structurally related to other clinically used orexin receptor antagonists. Seltorexant shows over 100-fold greater binding affinity for the OX2 receptor over the OX1 receptor. This is in contrast to other orexin receptor antagonists like suvorexant, lemborexant, and daridorexant, which are all dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs). == Clinical trials == As of February 2022, seltorexant is in phase 3 clinical trials for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and phase 2 trials for treatment of insomnia. It was also under investigation for the treatment of sleep apnea, but no recent development has been reported for this indication. Seltorexant is under development by Minerva Neurosciences and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceuticals. Seltorexant is being explored at doses of 5 to 80 mg. In the early clinical trials conducted so far, seltorexant has been found to improve depression scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in people with MDD and to improve sleep onset, total sleep time, time awake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency in people with MDD and/or insomnia. Seltorexant is reported to be safe and well-tolerated. Side effects of seltorexant observed in clinical trials so far have included somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, headache, abdominal discomfort, and nightmares. == See also == Vornorexant – another investigational short-acting orexin receptor antagonist List of investigational antidepressants § Orexin receptor antagonists List of investigational sleep drugs § Orexin receptor antagonists == References == == External links == Seltorexant — AdisInsight",Seltorexant,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.842555426876061e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.446407547220588e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004368066438473761)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jjs-treatment-depression-succeeds-late-stage-study-2024-05-29/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=166, start_index=9, title=""J&J's depression treatment succeeds in late-stage study"", type='url_citation', url='https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jjs-treatment-depression-succeeds-late-stage-study-2024-05-29/?utm_source=openai')])"

Medicine has learned much from professions that have established programs in simulation for training, such as aviation, the military and space exploration. Increased demands on training hours, limited patient encounters, and a focus on patient safety have led to a new paradigm of education in healthcare that increasingly involves technology and innovative ways to provide a standardized curriculum. A robust body of literature is growing, seeking to answer the question of how best to use simulation in healthcare education. Building on the groundwork of the Best Evidence in Medical Education (BEME) Guide on the features of simulators that lead to effective learning, this current Guide provides practical guidance to aid educators in effectively using simulation for training. It is a selective review to describe best practices and illustrative case studies. This Guide is the second part of a two-part AMEE Guide on simulation in healthcare education. The first Guide focuses on building a simulation program, and discusses more operational topics such as types of simulators, simulation center structure and set-up, fidelity management, and scenario engineering, as well as faculty preparation. This Guide will focus on the educational principles that lead to effective learning, and include topics such as feedback and debriefing, deliberate practice, and curriculum integration - all central to simulation efficacy. The important subjects of mastery learning, range of difficulty, capturing clinical variation, and individualized learning are also examined. Finally, we discuss approaches to team training and suggest future directions. Each section follows a framework of background and definition, its importance to effective use of simulation, practical points with examples, and challenges generally encountered. Simulation-based healthcare education has great potential for use throughout the healthcare education continuum, from undergraduate to continuing education. It can also be used to train a variety of healthcare providers in different disciplines from novices to experts. This Guide aims to equip healthcare educators with the tools to use this learning modality to its full capability.

Among these molecules, there is (2 S)-N-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)- 3-(3-fluoro-4-chlorophenoxyl)2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propanamide, commonly known as S-23. This molecule appeared very recently on the doping market. As a result, very few data are available in the literature, and nothing has been published about long-term effects of S-23. The authors focused on the detection of S-23 and its metabolites in human urine, following a single oral administration of approx. 8 mg to a volunteer, using standard ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). To the best of the authors knowledge, this seems to be the first study ever achieved on S-23. In vitro experiment was performed, using human liver microsomes, in order to investigate the potential CYP- and UGT-dependent S-23 metabolites. Four metabolites were produced, which were identified as hydroxy-S-23 (C This paper describes the studies of the in vitro biotransformation of two selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), namely, RAD140 and S-23, and the in vivo metabolism of RAD140 in horses using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. in vitro metabolic studies of RAD140 and S-23 were performed using homogenised horse liver. The more prominent in vitro biotransformation pathways for RAD140 included hydrolysis, hydroxylation, glucuronidation and sulfation. Metabolic pathways for S-23 were similar to those for other arylpropionamide-based SARMs. The administration study of RAD140 was carried out using three retired thoroughbred geldings. RAD140 and the majority of the identified in vitro metabolites were detected in post-administration urine samples. For controlling the misuse of RAD140 in horses, RAD140 and its metabolite in sulfate form gave the longest detection time in hydrolysed urine and could be detected for up to 6 days post-administration. In plasma, RAD140 itself gave the longest detection time of up to 13 days. Apart from RAD140 glucuronide, the metabolites of RAD140 described herein have never been reported before. The transducing phages lambdadaroE and lambdadilv5, which carry the Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA operons rrnD and rrnX, respectively, have been mapped with the restriction endonucleases BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and Sma I. Using hybridization techniques, we have located the ribosomal RNA genes on these phage DNAs. The DNA sequence of the 437-base-pair 16 S-23 S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer in the two rRNA operons rrnD and rrnX has been determined. The nucleotides examined exhibit only one base pair change between rrnD and rrnX. Both spacer regions contain the genes for tRNA1Ile and tRNA1BAla; the gene sequences are identical with the previously deduced tRNA sequences and are clustered within the first 60% of the spacer DNA. The most striking feature of the 16 S-23 S intergenic region in these two operons is the disparity in G-C content between the tRNA gene sequences (60% G-C) and the remaining spacer DNA (37% G-C).

792,"('Proguanil', '(1e)-1-[amino-(4-chloroanilino)methylidene]-2-propan-2-ylguanidine')",Medical,"Proguanil, also known as chlorguanide and chloroguanide, is a medication used to treat and prevent malaria. It is often used together with chloroquine or atovaquone. When used with chloroquine the combination will treat mild chloroquine resistant malaria. It is taken by mouth. Side effects include diarrhea, constipation, skin rashes, hair loss, and itchiness. Because malaria tends to be more severe in pregnancy, the benefit typically outweighs the risk. If used during pregnancy it should be taken with folate. It is likely safe for use during breastfeeding. Proguanil is converted by the liver to its active metabolite, cycloguanil. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States and Canada it is only available in combination as atovaquone/proguanil. == History == When the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor started World War II in the Pacific, the US became very interested in antimalarial medications and funded a large joint US-UK program to find new non-toxic and easy to produce drugs of the type. It was joined by a team led by Frank Rose at the Medical Chemicals Section of Imperial Chemical Industries (later Pharmaceuticals Division, which ended up demerged into Zeneca) at Blackley, which earlier developed a way to manufacture mepacrine, an antimalarial made exclusively in Germany before the war. Rose and his colleague Frank Curd decided to concentrate on pyrimidines as relatively simple to synthetise, even though the Advisory Panel recommended against that because most antimalarials by then were either quinolines or acridines. Checking prospective 2,4-diaminopyridine derivatives with a basic side chain and a benzenoid moiety one after another, they noticed a geometric pattern in the effective analogs and wondered if they could reproduce their interesting biologic activity with molecules even simpler, without the pyrimidine ring, and tried biguanides (then called diguanides) with which Rose was familiar due to his earlier sulphonamide research to great effect. The drug was introduced by ICI in 1945. == Medical uses == Proguanil is used for the prevention and treatment of malaria in both adults and children, particularly in areas where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria has been reported. It is usually taken in combination with atovaquone, another antimalarial drug. It is also effective in the treatment of most other multi-drug resistant forms of P. falciparum; the success rate exceeds 93%. == Side effects == Proguanil is generally well tolerated, and most people do not experience side effects. However, common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headache, and fever. Taking proguanil with food may lessen these side effects. Proguanil should not be taken by people with severe renal impairment, pregnant women, or women who are breastfeeding children less than 5 kg. There have also been reports of increased levels of liver enzymes, which may remain high for up to 4 weeks after completion of treatment. == Mechanism == When used alone, proguanil functions as a prodrug. Its active metabolite, cycloguanil, is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Although both mammals and parasites produce DHFR, cycloguanil's inhibitory activity is specific for parasitic DHFR. This enzyme is a critical component of the folic acid cycle. Inhibition of DHFR prevents the parasite from recycling dihydrofolate back to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is required for DNA synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and methylation; thus, DHFR inhibition shuts down these processes. Proguanil displays synergism when used in combination with the antimalarial atovaquone. This mechanism of action differs from when proguanil was used as a singular agent. In this case, it is not thought to function as a DHFR inhibitor. The addition of proguanil has shown to reduce resistance to atovaquone and increase the ability of atovaquone to trigger a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. This is commonly referred to as ""collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential."" Proguanil lowers the effective concentration of atovaquone needed to increase permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. == References ==",Proguanil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.536697689327411e-06), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005609607324004173)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proguanil?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Proguanil', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proguanil?utm_source=openai')])"
