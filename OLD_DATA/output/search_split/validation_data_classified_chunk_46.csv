4557,"('Aminophenazone', 'Amidopyrine', 'Dipyrine', 'Pyramidon', 'Amidazophene')",Medical,"Aminophenazone (or aminopyrine, amidopyrine, Pyramidon) is a non-narcotic analgesic substance. It is a pyrazolone and a derivative of phenazone, which also has anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. While inexpensive and effective, especially in the treatment of rheumatism, the drug carries a serious risk of severe and sometimes fatal side-effects, including agranulocytosis. While its production and use have been banned in many countries, including France, Thailand, India and Japan, it is still sometimes used in the developing world. A breath test with 13C-labeled aminopyrine has been used as a non-invasive measure of cytochrome P-450 metabolic activity in liver-function tests. It is also used in measuring the total body water in the human body system. == History == Aminophenazone was first synthesized by Friedrich Stolz and Ludwig Knorr in the late nineteenth century, and sold as an anti-fever medicine known as Pyramidon by Hoechst AG from 1897 until its eventual replacement by the safer propyphenazone molecule. == Symptoms == Symptoms of exposure to this compound include: allergic reactions strong spasmolytic effect on smooth muscle of peripheral blood vessels irritability palsy copious sweating dilated pupils sharp drop then rise in body temperature dysuria dyspnea anxiety rectal tenesmus urinary frequency intermittent fever fatty infiltration of the liver heart muscle degeneration death due to circulatory failure following cardiovascular collapse Agranulocytosis often occurs. Ingestion may cause central nervous system stimulation, vomiting, convulsions, cyanosis, tinnitus, leukopenia, kidney damage and coma. Ingestion may also lead to nausea, mental disturbances, methemoglobinemia, chocolate-colored blood, dizziness, epigastric pain, difficulty in hearing, thready pulse and liver damage. Other symptoms reported via ingestion include hemolytic anemia, porphyria and severe gastrointestinal bleeding. Bone marrow depression also occurs. Rare eye effects include acute transient myopia. Chronic symptoms include: anorexia edema oliguria urticaria hypersensitivity aplastic anemia sore throat fever pharyngeal membrane jaundice enlargement of the liver and spleen exfoliative dermatitis gastric or duodenal erosion with perforation or bleeding adrenal necrosis thrombocytopenic purpura acute leukemia When heated to decomposition this compound emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides. == Metabolism == Amidopyrine is metabolized by demethylation and acetylation. Amidopirina metabolites are 4-aminoantipyrine, metilaminoantipirin, rubazonovaya and metilrubazonovaya acid. These acids have a reddish color. At high amidopirine doses, urine can have a reddish brown coloration, due to the presence in the urine of these acid markers. == In popular culture == Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, Spain was built as a center for specialized surgery, a panacea for the ills of the health system in Madrid. Locals hence nicknamed it el piramidón. == References ==",Pyramidon,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.7133641196996905e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000976919662207365), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38692495226860046)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007099286303855479), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminophenazone ', [])"
4558,"('Phenelzine', 'Phenethylhydrazine', 'Nardil', 'Fenelzyne', 'Fenelzyna')",Medical,"Phenelzine, sold under the brand name Nardil among others, is a non-selective and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) of the hydrazine family which is primarily used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic to treat depression and anxiety. Along with tranylcypromine and isocarboxazid, phenelzine is one of the few non-selective and irreversible MAOIs still in widespread clinical use. Synthesis of phenelzine was first described by Emil Votoček and Otakar Leminger in 1932. == Medical uses == Phenelzine is primarily used in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Patients with atypical depression respond particularly well to phenelzine. The medication is also useful in treatment-resistant depression, where patients do not respond favorably to first and second-line treatments for depression. In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, phenelzine is also effective in treating dysthymia, bipolar depression, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, bulimia nervosa, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). == Side effects == Common side effects of phenelzine may include dizziness, blurry vision, dry mouth, headache, lethargy, sedation, somnolence, insomnia, anorexia, weight gain or loss, small fiber peripheral neuropathy, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, urinary retention, mydriasis, muscle tremors, hyperthermia, sweating, hypertension or hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, paresthesia, hepatitis, and sexual dysfunction (consisting of loss of libido and anorgasmia). Rare side effects usually only seen in susceptible individuals may include hypomania or mania, psychosis, and acute liver failure, the last of which is usually only seen in people with pre-existing liver damage, old age, long-term effects of alcohol consumption, or viral infection. == Interactions == The MAOIs have certain dietary restrictions and drug interactions. A hypertensive crisis may result from the overconsumption of tyramine-containing foods, although it is a rare occurrence. Serotonin syndrome may result from an interaction with certain drugs which increase serotonin activity such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin releasing agents, and serotonin agonists. Phenelzine has also been linked to vitamin B6 deficiency. Transaminases such as GABA-transaminase have been shown to be dependent upon vitamin B6 and may be involved in a potentially related process, since the phenelzine metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH) is a GABA-transaminase inhibitor. Both phenelzine and vitamin B6 are rendered inactive upon these reactions occurring. The pyridoxine form of B6 is recommended for supplementation, since this form has been shown to reduce hydrazine toxicity from phenelzine and, in contrast, the pyridoxal form has been shown to increase the toxicity of hydrazines. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Phenelzine is a non-selective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It inhibits both of the respective isoforms of MAO, MAO-A and MAO-B, and does so almost equally, with a slight preference for the former. By inhibiting MAO, phenelzine prevents the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, melatonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, as well as the trace amine neuromodulators such as phenethylamine, tyramine, octopamine, and tryptamine. This leads to an increase in the extracellular concentrations of these neurochemicals and, therefore, an alteration in neurochemistry and neurotransmission. This action is thought to be the primary mediator in phenelzine's therapeutic benefits. Phenelzine and its metabolites also inhibit at least two other enzymes to a lesser extent, of which are alanine transaminase (ALA-T), and γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), the latter of which is not caused by phenelzine itself, but by a phenelzine metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH). By inhibiting ALA-T and GABA-T, phenelzine causes an increase in the alanine and GABA levels in the brain and body. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and is very important for the normal suppression of anxiety, stress, and depression. Phenelzine's action in increasing GABA concentrations may significantly contribute to its antidepressant, and especially, anxiolytic/antipanic properties, the latter of which have been considered superior to those of other antidepressants. As for ALA-T inhibition, though the consequences of disabling this enzyme are currently not well understood, there is some evidence to suggest that it is this action of the hydrazines (including phenelzine) which may be responsible for the occasional incidence of hepatitis and liver failure. Phenelzine has also been shown to metabolize to phenethylamine (PEA). PEA acts as a releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine, which occurs in a similar manner to amphetamine by being taken up into vesicles, displacing and causing the release of those monoamines, and reversing monoamine flux through their respective transporters (though with markedly shorter pharmacokinetics). Like many other antidepressants, phenelzine usually requires several weeks of treatment to achieve full therapeutic effects. The reason for this delay is not fully understood. Still, it is believed to be due to many factors, including achieving steady-state levels of MAO inhibition and the resulting adaptations in mean neurotransmitter levels, the possibility of necessary desensitization of autoreceptors which generally inhibit the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, and also the upregulation of enzymes such as serotonin N-acetyltransferase. Typically, a therapeutic response to MAOIs is associated with an inhibition of at least 80-85% of monoamine oxidase activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Phenelzine is administered orally in the form of phenelzine sulfate and is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The time to peak plasma concentration is 43 minutes, and the half-life is 11.6 hours. Unlike most other drugs, phenelzine irreversibly disables MAO. As a result, it does not necessarily need to be present in the blood at all times for its effects to be sustained. Because of this, upon phenelzine treatment being ceased, its effects typically do not wear off until the body replenishes its enzyme stores, a process which can take as long as 2–3 weeks. Phenelzine is metabolized primarily in the liver, and its metabolites are excreted in the urine. Oxidation is the primary routine of metabolism, and the major metabolites are phenylacetic acid and parahydroxyphenylacetic acid, recovered as about 73% of the excreted dose of phenelzine in the urine over 96 hours after single doses. Acetylation to N2-acetylphenelzine is a minor pathway. Phenelzine may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, inactivating these enzymes through the formation of a heme adduct. Two other minor metabolites of phenelzine, as mentioned above, include phenylethylidenehydrazine and phenethylamine. == Chemistry == Phenelzine, also known as 2-phenylethylhydrazine or phenylethylamine hydrazide, is a phenethylamine and hydrazine derivative. It is the hydrazide of β-phenethylamine and can also be referred to as N-aminophenethylamine. Close analogues of phenelzine include the amphetamine and hydrazine derivatives pheniprazine (α-methylphenelzine; the corresponding amphetamine analogue) and metfendrazine (α,N-dimethylphenelzine; the corresponding methamphetamine analogue), among others. == Research == Phenelzine showed promise in a phase II clinical trial from March 2020 in treating prostate cancer. Phenelzine has also been shown to have neuroprotective effects in animal models. == References ==",Fenelzyna,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9550132492440753e-05), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011828100541606545)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

4560,"('Aminoglutethimide', 'Cytadren', 'Orimeten', 'P-aminoglutethimide', 'Elipten')",Medical,"Aminoglutethimide (AG), sold under the brand names Elipten, Cytadren, and Orimeten among others, is a medication which has been used in the treatment of seizures, Cushing's syndrome, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, among other indications. It has also been used by bodybuilders, athletes, and other men for muscle-building and performance- and physique-enhancing purposes. AG is taken by mouth three or four times per day. Side effects of AG include lethargy, somnolence, dizziness, headache, appetite loss, skin rash, hypertension, liver damage, and adrenal insufficiency, among others. AG is both an anticonvulsant and a steroidogenesis inhibitor. In terms of the latter property, it inhibits enzymes such as cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1, P450scc) and aromatase (CYP19A1), thereby inhibiting the conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones and blocking the production of androgens, estrogens, and glucocorticoids, among other endogenous steroids. As such, AG is an aromatase inhibitor and adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor, including both an androgen synthesis inhibitor and a corticosteroid synthesis inhibitor. AG was introduced for medical use, as an anticonvulsant, in 1960. It was withdrawn in 1966 due to toxicity. Its steroidogenesis-inhibiting properties were discovered serendipitously and it was subsequently repurposed for use in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, breast cancer, and prostate cancer from 1969 and thereafter. However, although used in the past, it has mostly been superseded by newer agents with better efficacy and lower toxicity such as ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, and other aromatase inhibitors. It remains marketed only in a few countries. == Medical uses == AG is used as an anticonvulsant in the treatment of petit mal epilepsy and as a steroidogenesis inhibitor in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, postmenopausal breast cancer, and prostate cancer. It is also used to treat secondary hyperaldosteronism, edema, adrenocortical carcinoma, and ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) producing tumors. When used as a steroidogenesis inhibitor to treat breast cancer and prostate cancer, AG is given in combination with hydrocortisone, prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid to prevent adrenal insufficiency. AG is a second- or third-line choice in the treatment of hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer. While effective in the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, it is not effective in premenopausal women and is not an effective ovarian steroidogenesis inhibitor, probably because it is not a potent enough aromatase inhibitor. The medication is effective in the treatment of prostate cancer, but its effectiveness is low and inconsistent, likely due to its relatively weak steroidogenesis inhibition and poor pharmacokinetics. Nonetheless, AG was found to be non-significantly different in effectiveness from surgical adrenalectomy in terms of prostate cancer tumor regression. In any case, AG is not recommended as a first-line therapy in prostate cancer, but instead only as a second-line therapy. It has only rarely been used in the treatment of prostate cancer. AG is used for adrenal steroidogenesis inhibition by mouth at a dosage of 250 mg three times per day (750 mg/day total) for the first 3 weeks of therapy and then increased to 250 mg four times per day (1,000 mg/day total) thereafter. It can be used at a dosage of up to 500 mg four times per day (2,000 mg/day). It is used as an aromatase inhibitor to inhibit peripheral estrogen production by mouth at a dosage of 125 mg twice per day (250 mg/day total), without significant suppression of adrenal steroidogenesis at this dosage. Maximal aromatase inhibition is said to occur between dosages of 250 to 500 mg per day. The side effects of AG are less frequent and severe at this dosage. However, they are still less when AG is combined with hydrocortisone, and so AG is generally combined with a corticosteroid even at this lower dosage. AG should only be used under close medical supervision and with laboratory tests including thyroid function, baseline hematological, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. Ketoconazole can achieve similar decreases in steroid hormone levels as AG but is more effective in promoting tumor regression and is moderately less toxic in comparison. AG can still be a useful alternative in those who have failed or are unable to tolerate ketoconazole and other therapies however. === Available forms === AG is provided most commonly in the form of 250 mg tablets. == Non-medical uses == AG is used by bodybuilders, athletes, and other men to lower circulating levels of cortisol in the body and thereby prevent muscle loss. Cortisol is catabolic to protein in muscle and effective suppression of cortisol by AG at high doses can prevent muscle loss. It is usually used in combination with an anabolic steroid to avoid androgen deficiency. However, the usefulness of AG for such purposes has been questioned, with few users reportedly having positive comments about it, and the risks of AG are said to be high. In any case, AG is also used by bodybuilders and other men for its actions as an aromatase inhibitor in order to decrease estrogen levels. It is said to be useful for inhibiting the estrogenic side effects of certain anabolic steroids such as gynecomastia, increased water retention, and fat gain. == Contraindications == AG should not be used in people with known hypersensitivity to AG. It should not be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Other potential contraindications include chicken pox, shingles (herpes zoster), infection, kidney disease, liver disease, and hypothyroidism. == Side effects == AG has many side effects and is a relatively toxic medication, although its side effects are described as usually relatively mild. The side effects of AG include lethargy, fatigue, weakness, malaise, drowsiness, somnolence, depression, apathy, sleep disturbances, stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, joint aches and pains, fever, skin rash, hypotension or hypertension, high cholesterol levels, virilization, hypothyroidism, thyroid abnormalities, elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, weight gain, leg cramps, personality changes, blood dyscrasias, and adrenal insufficiency (e.g., hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, others). Lethargy is the most common side effect and has been found to occur in 31 to 70% of people treated with AG. It is the most common reason for discontinuation of AG. Skin rash and hypotension have both been observed in about 15% of people. At least one side effect will occur in 45 to 85% of people. Severe toxicity is seen in 10% of people, including circulatory collapse thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency. Hematological and bone marrow toxicity, including marked depression of white blood cell count, platelets, or both, occurs rarely, with an incidence of about 0.9%. It is usually seen within the first 7 weeks of treatment and resolves within 3 weeks following discontinuation. AG is discontinued in 5 to 10% of people due to intolerable side effects. The central nervous system side effects of AG are due to its nature as an anticonvulsant and relation to glutethimide. == Overdose == In the event of overdose of AG, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and respiratory depression may occur. Medical attention should be sought urgently. Treatment of AG overdose can include gastric lavage to decrease absorption and dialysis to enhance elimination. == Interactions == AG has an interaction with all corticosteroids. It enhances the metabolism of dexamethasone, so hydrocortisone should be used instead. If the person is taking warfarin, the dosage of warfarin may need to be increased. Alcohol potentiates the central nervous system side effects of AG. Dosages of theophylline, digitoxin, and medroxyprogesterone acetate may need to be increased. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === AG is a potent and non-selective steroidogenesis inhibitor, acting as a reversible and competitive inhibitor of multiple steroidogenic enzymes, including: Aromatase (CYP19A1) (600 nM). Inhibits the formation of the estrogens estradiol and estrone from testosterone and androstenedione, respectively. Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc; CYP11A1) (~20,000 nM). Inhibits the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone and consequently decreases the synthesis of all steroid hormones including the progestogens, androgens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids, as well as neurosteroids. 21-Hydroxylase (CYP21A2). Prevents the conversion of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone into 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol, respectively. 11β-Hydroxylase (CYP11B1). Prevents the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol into corticosterone and cortisol, respectively. Aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase; CYP11B2). Prevents the conversion of corticosterone into aldosterone. As such, AG is an estrogen synthesis inhibitor and adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor, including both an androgen synthesis inhibitor and a corticosteroid synthesis inhibitor. For these reasons, AG has functional antiestrogenic, antiandrogenic, antiglucocorticoid, and antimineralocorticoid actions. In terms of its actions as an adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor, it is described as a form of reversible ""medical adrenalectomy"" or ""chemical adrenalectomy"". While AG inhibits all of the enzymes listed above, inhibition of P450scc is primarily responsible for its inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis. In terms of adrenal androgens, AG has been shown to significantly suppress dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone levels in men. Although it is most potent in inhibiting aromatase among the enzymes it targets, AG is described nonetheless as a relatively weak aromatase inhibitor. In addition, it is described as a much more potent aromatase inhibitor than adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor. AG can inhibit aromatase by 74 to 92% and decrease circulating estradiol levels by 58 to 76% in men and postmenopausal women. AG is not an effective ovarian steroidogenesis inhibitor in premenopausal women. However, interference with ovarian steroidogenesis by AG may in any case result in hyperandrogenism and virilization in premenopausal women. === Pharmacokinetics === With oral administration, the absorption of AG is rapid and complete. It is well-distributed throughout the body. In terms of metabolism, a portion of AG is acetylated in the liver. The biological half-life of AG is 12.5 hours. It is excreted in urine 34 to 54% unchanged. == Chemistry == AG is a nonsteroidal compound, specifically a glutarimide, and is a derivative of glutethimide. It is also known by its chemical names 2-(4-aminophenyl)-2-ethylglutarimide and 2-(aminophenyl)-3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione. Aside from glutethimide, AG is structurally related to rogletimide (pyridoglutethimide) and thalidomide, as well as amphenone B, metyrapone, and mitotane. == History == AG was introduced for medical use, as an anticonvulsant, in 1960. In 1963, it was reported that AG had induced symptoms of Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency) in a young girl. Following additional reports, it was determined that AG acts as a steroidogenesis inhibitor. As such, the discovery of AG as a steroidogenesis inhibitor was serendipitous. The medication was withdrawn from the market in 1966 due to its adverse effects. The first report of AG in the treatment of breast cancer was published in 1969, and the first report of AG in the treatment of prostate cancer was published in 1974. The medication was one of the first adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors as well as the first aromatase inhibitor to be discovered and used clinically, and led to the development of other aromatase inhibitors. Along with testolactone, it is described as a ""first-generation"" aromatase inhibitor. AG has largely been superseded by medications with better effectiveness and tolerability and reduced toxicity, such as ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, and other aromatase inhibitors. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Aminoglutethimide is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while aminoglutéthimide is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and aminoglutetimide is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana. It is also known by its developmental code names Ba 16038, Ciba 16038, and ND-1966. === Brand names === AG has been marketed under brand names including Elipten, Cytandren, and Orimeten. It has also been marketed under other brand names such as Aminoblastin, Rodazol, and Mamomit, among numerous others. === Availability === AG appears to remain marketed only in a few countries, which include China, Egypt, and Lithuania. Previously, AG was available very widely throughout the world, including in more than two dozen countries and under numerous brand names. Among other places, it was marketed in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, other European countries, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, South America, Israel, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. == References ==",Elipten,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.48477507638745e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.061979155987501144)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglutethimide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=96, start_index=9, title='Aminoglutethimide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglutethimide?utm_source=openai')])"

Its effects may take up to four weeks but can also manifest as early as one to two weeks. It is often used in cases of depression complicated by anxiety or insomnia. The effectiveness of mirtazapine is comparable to other commonly prescribed antidepressants. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, increased appetite and weight gain. Serious side effects may include mania, low white blood cell count, and increased suicide among children. Withdrawal symptoms may occur with stopping. It is not recommended together with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, although evidence supporting the danger of this combination has been challenged. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe. How it works is not clear, but it may involve blocking certain adrenergic and serotonin receptors. Chemically, it is a tetracyclic antidepressant, and is closely related to mianserin. It also has strong antihistaminergic effects. Mirtazapine came into medical use in the United States in 1996. The patent expired in 2004, and generic versions are available. In 2022, it was the 105th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Mirtazapine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. === Depression === Mirtazapine is primarily used for major depressive disorder and other mood disorders. Onset of action appears faster than some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and similar to tricyclic antidepressants. In 2010, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended generic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first-line choices, as they are ""equally effective as other antidepressants and have a favourable risk–benefit ratio."" For mirtazapine, it found ""no difference between mirtazapine and other antidepressants on any efficacy measure, although in terms of achieving remission mirtazapine appears to have a statistical though not clinical advantage. In addition, mirtazapine has a statistical advantage over selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in terms of reducing symptoms of depression, but the difference is not clinically significant. However, there is strong evidence that patients taking mirtazapine are less likely to leave treatment early because of side effects, although this is not the case for patients reporting side effects or leaving treatment early for any reason."" A 2011 Cochrane review comparing mirtazapine to other antidepressants found that while it appeared to have a faster onset in people for whom it worked (measured at two weeks), its efficacy was about the same as other antidepressants after six weeks' use. A 2012 review focused on antidepressants and sleep found that mirtazapine reduced the time it took to fall asleep and improved the quality of sleep in many people with sleep disorders caused by depression, but that it could also disturb sleep in many people, especially at higher doses, causing restless leg syndrome in 8 to 28% of people and in rare cases causes REM sleep behavior disorder. This seemingly paradoxical dose–response curve of mirtazapine with respect to somnolence is owed to the exceptionally high affinity of the drug for the histamine H1, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors; exhibiting near exclusive occupation of these receptors at doses ≤15 mg. However, at higher doses, inverse agonism and constitutive activation of the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors begins to offset activity at H1 receptors leading to decreased somnolence and even a subjective sensation of ""activation"" in treated patients. A 2018 analysis of 21 antidepressants found them to be fairly similar overall. It found tentative evidence for mirtazapine being in the more effective group and middle in tolerability. After one week of usage, mirtazapine was found to have an earlier onset of action compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. === Other === There is also some evidence supporting its use in treating the following conditions, for which it is sometimes prescribed off-label: == Side or adverse effects == A 2011 Cochrane review found that, compared with other antidepressants, it is more likely to cause weight gain and sleepiness, but it is less likely to cause tremors than tricyclic antidepressants, and less likely to cause nausea and sexual dysfunction than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Very common (≥10% incidence) adverse effects include constipation, dry mouth, sleepiness, increased appetite (17%) and weight gain (>7% increase in <50% of children). Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include weakness, confusion, dizziness, fasciculations (muscle twitches), peripheral edema (swelling, usually of the lower limbs), and negative lab results like elevated transaminases, elevated serum triglycerides, and elevated total cholesterol. Mirtazapine is not considered to have a risk of many of the side effects often associated with other antidepressants like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and may improve certain ones when taken in conjunction with them. (Those adverse effects include decreased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, urinary retention, increased body temperature, excessive sweating, pupil dilation and sexual dysfunction.) In general, some antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can paradoxically exacerbate some peoples' depression or anxiety or cause suicidal ideation. Despite its sedating action, mirtazapine is also believed to be capable of this, so in the United States and certain other countries, it carries a black box label warning of these potential effects, especially for people under the age of 25. Mirtazapine may induce arthralgia (non-inflammatory joint pain). A case report published in 2000 noted an instance in which mirtazapine counteracted the action of clonidine, causing a dangerous rise in blood pressure. In a study comparing 32 antidepressants of all pharmacological classes, mirtazapine was one of the antidepressants most likely to cause nightmare disorder, sleepwalking, restless legs syndrome, night terrors and sleep paralysis. Mirtazapine has been associated with an increased risk of death compared to other antidepressants in several studies. However, it is more likely that the residual differences between people prescribed mirtazapine rather than a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor account for the difference in risk of mortality. == Withdrawal == Stopping Mirtazapine and other antidepressants may cause withdrawal symptoms. A gradual and slow reduction in dose is recommended to minimize such symptoms. Effects of sudden cessation of treatment with mirtazapine may include depression, anxiety, tinnitus, panic attacks, vertigo, restlessness, irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flu-like symptoms, allergy-like symptoms such as pruritus, headaches, and sometimes mania or hypomania. == Overdose == Mirtazapine is considered to be relatively safe in the event of an overdose, although it is considered slightly more toxic in overdose than most of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (except citalopram). Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine showed no significant cardiovascular adverse effects at 7 to 22 times the maximum recommended dose. Twelve reported fatalities have been attributed to mirtazapine overdose. The fatal toxicity index (deaths per million prescriptions) for mirtazapine is 3.1 (95% CI: 0.1 to 17.2). This is similar to that observed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. == Interactions == Concurrent use with inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4 can result in altered concentrations of mirtazapine, as these are the main enzymes responsible for its metabolism. As examples, fluoxetine and paroxetine, inhibitors of these enzymes, are known to modestly increase mirtazapine levels, while carbamazepine, an inducer, considerably decreases them. Liver impairment and moderate chronic kidney disease have been reported to decrease the oral clearance of mirtazapine by about 30%; severe kidney disease decreases it by 50%. Mirtazapine in combination with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or tricyclic antidepressant as an augmentation strategy is considered to be relatively safe and is often employed therapeutically but caution should be given when combined with fluvoxamine. There is a combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine, sometimes referred to as ""California rocket fuel"". Several case reports document serotonin syndrome induced by the combination of mirtazapine with other agents (olanzapine, quetiapine, tramadol and venlafaxine). Adding fluvoxamine to treatment with mirtazapine may cause a significant increase in mirtazapine concentration. This interaction may necessitate an adjustment of the mirtazapine dosage. According to information from the manufacturers, mirtazapine should not be started within two weeks of any monoamine oxidase inhibitor usage; likewise, monoamine oxidase inhibitors should not be administered within two weeks of discontinuing mirtazapine. The addition of mirtazapine to a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, while potentially having typical or idiosyncratic (unique to the individual) reactions not herein described, does not appear to cause serotonin syndrome. This is per the fact that the 5-HT2A receptor is the predominant serotonin receptor thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of serotonin syndrome (with the 5-HT1A receptor seeming to be protective). Mirtazapine is a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and cyproheptadine, a medication that shares this property, mediates recovery from serotonin syndrome and is an antidote against it. There is a possible interaction that results in a hypertensive crisis when mirtazapine is given to a patient who has already been on steady doses of clonidine. This involves a subtle consideration, when patients have been on chronic therapy with clonidine and suddenly stop the dosing, a rapid hypertensive rebound sometimes (20%) occurs from increased sympathetic outflow. Clonidine's blood pressure lowering effects are due to stimulation of presynaptic α2 autoreceptors in the CNS which suppress sympathetic outflow. Mirtazapine itself blocks these same α2 autoreceptors, so the effect of adding mirtazapine to a patient stabilized on clonidine may precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Mirtazapine has been used as a hallucinogen antidote to block the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Mirtazapine is sometimes described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), although the actual evidence in support of this label has been regarded as poor. It is a tetracyclic piperazine-azepine. Mirtazapine has antihistamine, α2-blocker, and antiserotonergic activity. It is specifically a potent antagonist or inverse agonist of the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and the histamine H1 receptor. Unlike many other antidepressants, it does not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, nor does it inhibit monoamine oxidase. Similarly, mirtazapine has weak or no activity as an anticholinergic or blocker of sodium or calcium channels, in contrast to most tricyclic antidepressants. In accordance, it has better tolerability and low toxicity in overdose. As an H1 receptor antagonist, mirtazapine is extremely potent, and is in fact one of the most potent H1 receptor inverse agonists among tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants and most antihistamines in general. Antagonism of the H1 receptor is by far the strongest activity of mirtazapine, with the drug acting as a selective H1 receptor antagonist at low concentrations. The (S)-(+) enantiomer of mirtazapine is responsible for antagonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, while the (R)-(–) enantiomer is responsible for antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor. Both enantiomers are involved in antagonism of the H1 and α2-adrenergic receptors, although the (S)-(+) enantiomer is the stronger antihistamine. Although not clinically relevant, mirtazapine has been found to act as a partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor at high concentrations (EC50 = 7.2 μM). ==== α2-Adrenergic receptor ==== Antagonism of the α2-adrenergic receptors, which function largely as inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, enhances adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, notably central 5-HT1A receptor mediated transmission in the dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus; hence, mirtazapine's classification as a NaSSA. Indirect α1 adrenoceptor-mediated enhancement of serotonin cell firing and direct blockade of inhibitory α2 heteroreceptors located on serotonin terminals are held responsible for the increase in extracellular serotonin. Because of this, mirtazapine has been said to be a functional ""indirect agonist"" of the 5-HT1A receptor. Increased activation of the central 5-HT1A receptor is thought to be a major mediator of efficacy of most antidepressant drugs. ==== 5-HT2 receptor ==== Antagonism of the 5-HT2 subfamily of receptors and inverse agonism of the 5-HT2C receptor appears to be in part responsible for mirtazapine's efficacy in the treatment of depressive states. Mirtazapine increases dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex. Accordingly, it was shown that by blocking the α2-adrenergic receptors and 5-HT2C receptors mirtazapine disinhibited dopamine and norepinephrine activity in these areas in rats. In addition, mirtazapine's antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors has beneficial effects on anxiety, sleep and appetite, as well as sexual function regarding the latter receptor. Mirtazapine has been shown to lower drug seeking behaviour (more specifically to methamphetamine) in various human and animal studies. It is also being investigated in substance abuse disorders to reduce withdrawal effects and improve remission rates. Mirtazapine significantly improves pre-existing symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome in affected individuals. Mirtazapine may be used as an inexpensive antiemetic alternative to Ondansetron. In conjunction with substance abuse counseling, mirtazapine has been investigated for the purpose of reducing methamphetamine use in dependent individuals with success. In contrast to mirtazapine, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and some tricyclic antidepressants acutely increase the general activity of the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors, leading to a number of negative changes and side effects, the most prominent of which include anorexia, insomnia, nausea, and diarrhea, among others. However, most of these adverse effects are temporary, since down regulation of 5-HT2A receptors eventually occurs following chronic SSRI treatment, and desensitization of 5-HT3 receptors often occurs within a week or less. This is precisely why SSRIs have a delayed antidepressant and anxiolytic effect, and occasionally, an acute anxiogenic effect before down regulation occurs. Mirtazapine, on the other hand, is an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, and antagonists at this receptor typically induce reverse tolerance. Thus, the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of mirtazapine occur more rapidly than with SSRIs. Furthermore, its reduced incidence of sexual dysfunction (such as loss of libido and anorgasmia) could be a product of negligible binding to the serotonin transporter and antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptors; however, Mirtazapine's high affinity towards and inverse agonism of the 5-HT2C receptors may greatly attenuate those pro-sexual factors (as evidenced by the pro-sexual effects of drugs like m-CPP and lorcaserin which agonize 5-HT2C receptors in a reasonably selective manner). As a result, it is often combined with these drugs to reduce their side-effect profile and to produce a stronger antidepressant effect. Mirtazapine does not have pro-serotonergic activity and thus does not cause serotonin syndrome. This is in accordance with the fact that it is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or monoamine oxidase inhibitor, nor a serotonin receptor agonist. There are no reports of serotonin syndrome in association with mirtazapine alone, and mirtazapine has not been found to cause serotonin syndrome in overdose. However, there are a handful of case reports of serotonin syndrome occurring with mirtazapine in combination with serotonergic drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, although such reports are very rare, and do not necessarily implicate mirtazapine as causative. ==== 5-HT3 receptor ==== (R)-(–)-mirtazapine is a potent 5-HT3 blocker. It may relieve chemotherapy-related and advanced cancer-related nausea. ==== H1 receptor ==== Mirtazapine is a very strong H1 receptor antagonist and, as a result, it can cause powerful sedative and hypnotic effects. A single 15 mg dose of mirtazapine to healthy volunteers has been found to result in over 80% occupancy of the H1 receptor and to induce intense sleepiness. After a short period of chronic treatment, however, the H1 receptor tends to sensitize and the antihistamine effects become more tolerable. Many patients may also dose at night to avoid the effects, and this appears to be an effective strategy for combating them. Blockade of the H1 receptor may improve pre-existing allergies, pruritus, nausea, and insomnia in affected individuals. It may also contribute to weight gain, however. In contrast to the H1 receptor, mirtazapine has only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, although anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, constipation, and mydriasis are still sometimes seen in clinical practice. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of mirtazapine is about 50%. It is found mostly bound to plasma proteins, about 85%. It is metabolized primarily in the liver by N-demethylation and hydroxylation via cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. The overall elimination half-life is 20–40 hours, and this is independent of dosage. It is conjugated in the kidney for excretion in the urine, where 75% of the drug is excreted, and about 15% is eliminated in feces.: 430 Desmethylmirtazapine is an active metabolite of mirtazapine which is believed to contribute about 3-10% to the drug's overall effects and has a half-life of about 25 hours. == Chemistry == Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine; mianserin was developed by the same team of organic chemists and mirtazapine differs from it via the addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings.: 429 It is a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The (S)-(+)-enantiomer is known as esmirtazapine. Analogues of mirtazapine include mianserin, setiptiline, and aptazapine. === Synthesis === A chemical synthesis of mirtazapine has been published. The first step of synthesis is a condensation reaction between the molecule 2-chloro 3-cyanopyridine and the molecule 1-methyl-3-phenylpiperazine. == History == Mirtazapine was first synthesized at Organon and published in 1989, was first approved for use in major depressive disorder in the Netherlands in 1994, and was introduced in the United States in 1996 under the brand name Remeron.: 429 == Society and culture == === Generic names === Mirtazapine is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese is mirtazapina and in German, Turkish and Swedish is mirtazapin. === Brand names === Mirtazapine is marketed under many brand names worldwide, including Adco-Mirteron, Afloyan, Amirel, Arintapin Smelt, Avanza, Axit, Azapin, Beron, Bilanz, Blumirtax, Calixta, Ciblex, Combar, Comenter, Depreram, Divaril, Esprital, Maz, Menelat, Mepirzapine, Merdaten, Meronin, Mi Er Ning, Milivin, Minelza, Minivane, Mirastad, Mirazep, Miro, Miron, Mirrador, Mirt, Mirta, Mirtabene, Mirtadepi, Mirtagamma, Mirtagen, Mirtalan, Mirtamor, Mirtamylan, Mirtan, Mirtaneo, Mirtanza, Mirtapax, Mirtapil, Mirtapine, Mirtaron, Mirtastad, Mirtax, Mirtaz, Mirtazap, Mirtazapin, Mirtazapina, Mirtazapine, Mirtazapinum, Mirtazelon, Mirtazon, Mirtazonal, Mirtel, Mirtimash, Mirtin, Mirtine, Mirtor, Mirzapine, Mirzaten, Mirzest, Mitaprex, Mitaxind, Mitocent, Mitrazin, Mizapin, Motofen, Mytra, Norset, Noxibel, Pharmataz, Promyrtil, Rapizapine, Ramure, Razapina, Redepra, Reflex, Remergil, Remergon, Remeron, Remirta, Rexer, Saxib, Sinmaron, Smilon, Tazepin, Tazimed, Tetrazic, Tifona, U-Mirtaron, U-zepine, Valdren, Vastat, Velorin, Yarocen, Zania, Zapex, Zapsy,Zestat, Zismirt, Zispin, Zuleptan, and Zulin. == Research == The use of mirtazapine has been explored in several additional conditions: Found ineffective for Sleep apnea/hypopnea Secondary symptoms of autistic spectrum conditions and other pervasive developmental disorders Antipsychotic-induced akathisia. Drug withdrawal, dependence and detoxification Negative, depressive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia (as an adjunct) A case report has been published in which mirtazapine reduced visual hallucinations in a patient with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). This is in alignment with recent findings that inverse agonists at the 5-HT2A receptors are efficacious in attenuating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease psychosis. As is supported by the common practice of prescribing low-dose quetiapine and clozapine for PDP at doses too low to antagonize the D2 receptor, but sufficiently high doses to inversely agonize the 5-HT2A receptors. Eight case reports have been reported in five papers on the use of mirtazapine in the treatment of hives as of 2017. Mirtazapine to alleviate severe breathlessness in patients with COPD or interstitial lung diseases (BETTER-B). Found ineffective and potentially harmful. == Veterinary use == Mirtazapine also has some veterinary use in cats and dogs. Mirtazapine is sometimes prescribed as an appetite stimulant for cats or dogs experiencing loss of appetite due to medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease. It is especially useful for treating combined poor appetite and nausea in cats and dogs. Mirtazapine is indicated for bodyweight gain in cats experiencing poor appetite and weight loss resulting from chronic medical conditions. There are two options for administration: tablets given orally, and an ointment applied topically to the inner surface of the ear. The most common side effects include signs of local irritation or inflammation at the site where the ointment is applied and behavioural changes (increased meowing, hyperactivity, disoriented state or inability to coordinate muscle movements, lack of energy/weakness, attention-seeking, and aggression). == References ==",Mirtazapine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1205610462639015e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000717025191988796)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Mirtazapine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine?utm_source=openai')])"
4562,"('Apresoline', 'Aiselazine', 'Hydralazine chloride', 'Dralzine', 'Hyperazin')",Medical,"Hydralazine, sold under the brand name Apresoline among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. This includes high blood pressure in pregnancy and very high blood pressure resulting in symptoms. It has been found to be particularly useful in heart failure, together with isosorbide dinitrate, for treatment of people of African descent. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Effects usually begin around 15 minutes and last up to six hours. Common side effects include headache and fast heart rate. It is not recommended in people with coronary artery disease or in those with rheumatic heart disease that affects the mitral valve. In those with kidney disease a low dose is recommended. Hydralazine is in the vasodilator family of medications, so it is believed to work by causing the dilation of blood vessels. Hydralazine was discovered while scientists at Ciba were looking for a treatment for malaria. It was patented in 1949. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 121st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical use == Hydralazine is not used as a primary drug for treating hypertension because it elicits a reflex sympathetic stimulation of the heart (the baroreceptor reflex). The sympathetic stimulation may increase heart rate and cardiac output, and in people with coronary artery disease may cause angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Hydralazine may also increase plasma renin concentration, resulting in fluid retention. To prevent these undesirable side effects, hydralazine is usually prescribed in combination with a beta blocker (e.g., propranolol) and a diuretic. Hydralazine is used to treat severe hypertension, but is not a first-line therapy for essential hypertension. Hydralazine is often used to treat hypertension in pregnancy, though, with either labetalol and/or methyldopa. Hydralazine is commonly used in combination with isosorbide dinitrate for the treatment of congestive heart failure in black populations. This preparation, isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine, was the first race-based prescription drug. It should not be used in people who have tachycardia, heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, lupus, a dissecting aortic aneurysm, or porphyria. == Adverse effects == Prolonged treatment may cause a syndrome similar to lupus, which can become fatal if the symptoms are not noticed and drug treatment stopped. Hydralazine is within the top three drugs that is known to induce systemic lupus and this adverse drug event is dose dependent yet significant. Very common (>10% frequency) side effects include headache, tachycardia, and palpitations. Common (1–10% frequency) side effects include flushing, hypotension, anginal symptoms, aching or swelling joints, muscle aches, positive tests for atrial natriuretic peptide, stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and swelling (sodium and water retention). == Interactions == It may potentiate the antihypertensive effects of: Drugs subject to a strong first-pass effect such as beta blockers may increase the bioavailability of hydralazine. The heart rate-accelerating effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) are increased by hydralazine, and coadministration may lead to toxicity. == Mechanism of action == Hydralazine is a direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant and acts as a vasodilator primarily in resistance arterioles, also known as the smooth muscle of the arterial bed. The molecular mechanism involves inhibition of inositol trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in arterial smooth muscle cells. By relaxing vascular smooth muscle, vasodilators act to decrease peripheral resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure and decreasing afterload. The exact mechanism of action of hydralazine is unknown, at least as of 1981. Metabolic products include the N-acetyl derivative, pyruvic acid hydrazone, and acetone hydrazone, each of which may also contribute to reducing blood pressure. == Chemistry == Hydralazine belongs to the hydrazinophthalazine class of drugs. == History == The antihypertensive activity of hydralazine was discovered by scientists at Ciba, who were trying to discover drugs to treat malaria; it was initially called C-5968 and 1-hydrazinophthalazine; Ciba's patent application was filed in 1945 and issued in 1949, and the first scientific publications of its blood pressure-lowering activities appeared in 1950. It was approved by the FDA in 1953. It was one of the first antihypertensive medications that could be taken by mouth. == Research == Hydralazine has also been studied as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome in its capacity as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. == References ==",Apresoline,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.847726889536716e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002768848498817533)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4563,"('Perfluorooctanesulfonamide', 'Perfluorooctane sulfonamide', 'Perfluoroctylsulfonamide', 'Heptadecafluorooctanesulphonamide', 'Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid amide')","Medical, Industrial","Perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) is a synthetic organofluorine compound. It is a fluorocarbon derivative and a perfluorinated compound, having an eight-carbon chain and a terminal sulfonamide functional group. PFOSA, a persistent organic pollutant, was an ingredient in 3M's former Scotchgard formulation from 1956 until 2003, and the compound was used to repel grease and water in food packaging along with other consumer applications. It breaks down to form perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride-based chemistry that was used to make sulfonamides like PFOSA was phased out by 3M in the United States (US) during 2000–2002 but it has grown in China by other producers. PFOSA can be synthesized from perfluorooctanesulfonyl halides by reaction with liquid ammonia or by a two step reaction via an azide followed by reduction with Zn and HCl. PFOSA is also a metabolic by-product of N-alkylated perfluorooctanesulfonamides. For example, N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoethanol (N-EtFOSE), which was primarily used on paper, and N-methyl perfluorooctanesulfonamidoethanol (N-MeFOSE), which was primarily used on carpets and textiles, both metabolize via acetates to PFOSA. In addition, PFOSA is thought to be the biologically active form of the insecticide Sulfluramid (N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamide) as it is an extremely potent uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation with an IC50 of about 1 micromolar (≈500 nanograms per milliliter or parts per billion). PFOSA was the most toxic perfluorinated compound in a study with PC12 cells. Concentrations ranged from 10 to 250 micromolar in the study (or 5000 to 125,000 parts per billion). Wildlife biomonitoring studies have found the highest level of PFOSA in the liver of common dolphin (Mediterranean Sea, Italy) with a concentration of 878 parts per billion; the liver of mink from Illinois, US, contained 590 parts per billion. In fish, the highest levels detected were in the liver of Norway Pike (91 parts per billion) and homogenates of slimy sculpin (150 parts per billion) from Lake Ontario. Differences in biotransformation across species could explain some of its presence. In humans, PFOSA has been detected in sub- to low-parts per billion levels; for example, in 1999–2000 US serum samples, the 95th percentile (or value where only 5% of the population was higher) was 1.4 parts per billion while in 2003–2004 the 95th percentile fell to 0.2 parts per billion.

4564,"('Fluoxetine', 'Prozac', 'Pulvules', 'Portal', 'Eufor')",Medical,"The European Union (EU) has undertaken a number of overseas missions and operations, drawing on civilian and military capabilities, in several countries across three continents (Europe, Africa and Asia), as part of its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The operation or mission in question will work in agreement and coordination with the EU delegations, until 2009 known as the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). == Classification == In the EU terminology, civilian CSDP interventions are called 'missions', regardless of whether they have an executive mandate such as EULEX Kosovo or a non-executive mandate (all others). Civilian missions include uniformed personnel such as Police and Gendarmerie, but not military personnel. Military interventions, however, can either have an executive mandate such as for example Operation Atalanta in which case they are referred to as 'operations' and are commanded at two-star level; or non-executive mandate (e.g. EUTM Somalia) in which case they are called 'missions' and are commanded at one-star level. == Deployment procedure == The decision to deploy – together with any subsequent management of – the mission or operation in question, will ultimately be taken by the EU member states in the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC). Military operations may be launched after four planning phases, through which the Operation Commander (Op. Cdr.), Military Staff (EUMS), Military Committee (EUMC), Political and Security Committee (PSC) and Council have different roles. == Command and control structure == The EU command and control (C2) structure is directed by political bodies composed of member states' representatives, and generally requires unanimous decisions.

Unless the MPCC is used as Operation Headquarters (OHQ), either a national OHQ offered by member states or the NATO Command Structure (NCS) would serve this purpose. In the latter instance, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (DSACEUR), rather than Dir MPCC, would serve as Operation Commander (OpCdr). 4 Unless the MPCC is used as Operation Headquarters (OHQ), the MFCdr would be known as a Force Commander (FCdr), and direct a Force Headquarters (FHQ) rather than a MFHQ. Whereas the MFHQ would act both on the operational and tactical level, the FHQ would act purely on the operational level. 5 The political strategic level is not part of the C2 structure per se, but represents the political bodies, with associated support facilities, that determine the missions' general direction.

Three types of 2,3,3a,7a-tetrahydro-3,6-methanobenzofuran-7(6H)-ones based on xanthone, 2-phenylchromene-4-one and benzophenone, were synthesized using a Claisen/Diels-Alder reaction cascade. All the reactions produced the targeted caged compound as well as its neo-isomer. The caged compounds based on xanthone and 2-phenylchromene-4-one were found to maintain the apoptosis inducing and cell growth inhibiting activity of GA, although with less potency. The caged compounds based on benzophenone were found to be inactive. Our study determined the minimum structure of GA for its apoptosis inducing activity, which could lead to the development of simple derivatives as potential anti-cancer drugs.

We investigated the metabolism of isoUDCA and a possible pharmacologic effect in five patients (51.4 +/- 5.8 years old; 3 females, 2 males) with PBC and persistent elevations of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) and alkaline phosphatase despite treatment with UDCA for more than one year. Serum samples were analyzed for bile acid metabolites and surrogate markers of cholestasis in 4-week intervals after 1 g/d UDCA, wash-out, 0.5 g/d isoUDCA, 0.75 g/d isoUDCA, 0.75 g/d UDCA, and two further periods with 1 g/d UDCA. Bile acids in urine were analyzed after wash-out, 0.5 and 0.75 g/d isoUDCA, and 0.75 and 1 g/d UDCA. During wash-out, AST, AP, and gamma-GT rose significantly (P < 0.05) but reversed to previous levels during the first isoUDCA period, with 0.5 g/d only. No further improvements were observed after increasing the dose of isoUDCA or switching back to UDCA. In serum, the relative amounts of isoUDCA and UDCA were 8.1 +/- 7.4% and 16.2 +/- 6.4% during 0.5 g/d isoUDCA, 6.2 +/- 2.5% and 45.0 +/- 4.1% during 0.75 g/d isoUDCA, and 0.5;-3% and 56.4;-60.0%, respectively, during UDCA. In urine, UDCA was the predominant bile acid both during isoUDCA and UDCA medications. The similar serum enrichment and urinary excretion of UDCA during administration of either isoUDCA or UDCA together with low concentrations of the intermediate of isomerization, 3-dehydro-UDCA, indicate a first-pass epimerization of isoUDCA to UDCA in the liver. Approximately 25% of serum isoUDCA and 10% of serum UDCA were conjugated with either glucuronic acid or N-acetylglucosamine, indicating hepatic formation and systemic secretion of glycosidic conjugates. In PBC patients, isoUDCA becomes isomerized to UDCA and has similar effects on surrogate markers of cholestasis. Thus, isoUDCA has pro-drug characteristics. The aim of this study was to examine the metabolism of isoursodeoxycholic acid (isoUDCA) in humans. IsoUDCA was synthesized of >99% purity and administered orally for 1 week, 3 x 250 mg/day, to six healthy male subjects. Bile acids were extracted from duodenal bile, serum, and 24-h urine samples collected before and at the end of the study period, separated into groups of conjugates, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. IsoUDCA was tolerated without any side effect. Liver function tests did not change. Bile acid concentrations (mean+/-SEM) increased from 11.9+/-1.87 to 15.3+/-1.37 mmol/l in bile (n.s.), and from 3.4+/-0.10 to 6.8+/-0.43 micromol/l in serum (p<0.05). Urinary excretion of bile acids increased from 5.3+/-0.29 to 82.2+/-7.84 micromol/24 h (p<0.01). All changes were due to significant increases of isoUDCA and UDCA in bile, serum and urine, and of 3-dehydro-UDCA, the 3-oxo intermediate of isomerization, in bile and in serum. The relative enrichments of isoUDCA, UDCA, and 3-dehydro-UDCA, were: in bile, 2.2%, 25.7%, and 0.7%; in serum, 24.7%, 23.5%, and 6.1%; and in urine, 83.7%, 2.0%, and 2.4%. Whereas 78% of serum isoUDCA was unconjugated, 93-94% of biliary and urinary isoUDCA was conjugated with N-acetylglucosamine. This study indicates good tolerance and significant intestinal absorption of orally administered isoUDCA. IsoUDCA is extensively isomerized, probably both by intestinal and hepatic enzymes to yield UDCA which became the major biliary compound. In vitro, using the human hepatoblastoma cell line Hep G2, isoUDCA was found to be cytoprotective towards ethanol-induced cell injuries. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is an essential clinical concern caused by liver transplantation, resection, trauma, and shock that must be addressed immediately. Although the mechanisms underlying HIRI are well-documented, effective prevention and treatment strategies are still lacking. Inflammation is a central mechanism of HIRI, with macrophages playing a crucial role in initiating and amplifying the inflammatory response. Numerous plant polysaccharides exhibit substantial anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective properties. However, the function of Lentinan (LNT) in HIRI has not been fully explored. Thus, this study aims to investigate the preventive potential of LNT in HIRI. Here, we reveal that oral administration of LNT considerably reduces hepatic inflammation and improves liver pathology in mice with HIRI by modulating gut microbiota. Specifically, LNT considerably increased microbiota-derived isoursodeoxycholic acid (IsoUDCA). Further experiments showed that IsoUDCA alleviates hepatic injury by suppressing macrophage inflammation. Mechanistically, IsoUDCA directly binds to and activates the neuron-derived clone 77 (Nur77) transcription factor, inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway in macrophages. Our findings shed light on the significant role of the LNT-microbiota-IsoUDCA-Nur77 axis in attenuating macrophage inflammation during HIRI, offering novel insights into potential therapeutic targets and avenues for preventing HIRI.",Isoursodeoxycholic acid,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.04746106266975403), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.07891634106636047), (' END', -0.0005723327049054205), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9385402993066236e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.01207188330590725), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.02325371652841568), ('ĠEND', -0.0028770267963409424), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009353553177788854)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -3.054500666621607e-06)])","('INFO; ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMST04010035?utm_source=openai), [foodb.ca](https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB022182?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=160, start_index=6, title='LIPID MAPS', type='url_citation', url='https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMST04010035?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=160, start_index=6, title='Showing Compound Isoursodeoxycholic acid (FDB022182) - FooDB', type='url_citation', url='https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB022182?utm_source=openai')])"

Several genes encoding these enzymes, known as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) have yet to be identified. It is also uncertain whether the products of E. lenta bile acid metabolism are further metabolized by other members of the gut microbiota. We characterized a novel human fecal isolate identified as E. lenta strain C592. The complete genome of E. lenta strain C592 was sequenced and comparative genomics with the type strain (DSM 2243) revealed high conservation, but some notable differences. E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3α, 3β, 7α, and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile acids. Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile acid and iso-bile acid metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to lithocholic acid (LCA). Further, Iso-chenodeoxycholic acid (iso-CDCA; 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid) was not metabolized by C. scindens. We then located a gene encoding a novel 12α-HSDH in E. lenta DSM 2243, also encoded by strain C592, and the recombinant purified enzyme was characterized and substrate-specificity determined. Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding an Rnf complex (rnfABCDEG), an energy conserving hydrogenase (echABCDEF) complex, as well as what appears to be a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our prediction that by changing the gas atmosphere from nitrogen to hydrogen, bile acid oxidation would be inhibited, was confirmed. These results suggest that E. lenta is an important bile acid metabolizing gut microbe and that the gas atmosphere may be an important and overlooked regulator of bile acid metabolism in the gut. We describe a detailed study of the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid administration on bile acid composition of the serum and bile of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze bile acids from 10 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis before and during ursodeoxycholic acid administration (500 mg/day, corresponding to approximately 8 mg/kg body wt), after group separation of the unconjugated and conjugated fractions by lipophilic anion exchange chromatography. These studies were directed at assessing whether the beneficial role of ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cirrhosis was the consequence of a shift in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the bile acid pool and whether the hypercholeresis might result from the cholehepatic circulation of unconjugated ursodeoxycholic acid in bile. In basal conditions, the unconjugated bile acids accounted for only 5.5% and 2.5%, respectively, of the total bile acids of serum and bile; cholic acid was the major component of the conjugated fraction of serum and bile (56.0% +/- 4.0%, mean +/- S.E.M.), and ursodeoxycholic acid was present in only trace amounts. The conjugated fraction contained many unusual bile acids (representing 16.5% +/- 1.3% of total) including C25 bile acids, iso-chenodeoxycholic acid and several oxo-bile acids. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration biochemical indices of liver function all improved, but the proportions of the unconjugated bile acids in serum and bile did not significantly change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Isochenodeoxycholic acid,PUBMED,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.2519674599170685), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -5.1928003813372925e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.09733330458402634), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018289610743522644)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.676292231422849e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS; ([lipidmaps.org](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMST04010034?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=12, title='LIPID MAPS', type='url_citation', url='https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMST04010034?utm_source=openai')])"

It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body. This essential vitamin participates in energy generation, synthesizing hormones, and maintaining optimal conditions for skin, hair, and nails. Supplemental vitamin B5 is employed to address and mitigate nutrient deficiencies. This activity discusses the mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, off-label applications, appropriate dosing strategies, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring procedures, and relevant interactions of vitamin B5. Participants gain insights and knowledge essential for managing cases involving nutritional deficiencies and related conditions.",Alloursodeoxycholic acid,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0008132012444548309)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.012525581754744053), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5769949555397034)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0788951888680458)])","('INFO; ', [])"

In the pH range ca. 8-12, each of these epoxides reacts by a spontaneous reaction. The spontaneous reaction of trans-anethole oxide (1) yields ca. 40% of (4-methoxyphenyl)acetone and 60% of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1, 2-propanediols (erythro:threo ratio ca. 3:1). The spontaneous reaction of cis-anethole oxide is more complicated. The yields of diol and ketone products vary with pH in the pH range 8-11, even though there is not a corresponding change in rate. These results are interpreted by a mechanism in which 2 undergoes isomerization in part to the more reactive trans-anethole oxide (1), which subsequently reacts by acid-catalyzed and/or spontaneous reactions, depending on the pH, to yield diol and ketone products. The buildup of the intermediate trans-anethole oxide in the spontaneous reaction of cis-anethole oxide was detected by (1)H NMR analysis of the reaction mixture. Other primary products of the spontaneous reaction of 2 are (4-methoxyphenyl)acetone (73%) and threo-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,2-propanediol (ca. 3%). The rates and products of the spontaneous reaction of 2 and its beta-deuterium-labeled derivative were determined, and the lack of significant kinetic and partitioning deuterium isotope effects indicates that the isomerization of 2 to ketone and to trans-anethole oxide must occur primarily by nonintersecting reaction pathways.",Cis-anethole,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -7.941850526549388e-06)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.011232946068048477), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009508379152975976)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anethole,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39844944/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35163914/ ', [])"

Several therapeutic strategies have been developed, such as targeted therapy, immuno-oncotherapy and combination therapy. However, the low survival rate indicates the urgent need for new NSCLC treatments. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is an endothelial cell-free tumor blood supply system of aggressive and metastatic tumor cells present during tumor neovascularization. VM is clinically responsible for tumor metastasis and resistance, and is correlated with poor prognosis in NSCLC, making it a potential therapeutic target. In the present study, A549 cells formed glycoprotein-rich lined tubular structures, and transcript levels of VM-related genes were markedly upregulated in VM-forming cells. Based on a drug repurposing strategy, it was demonstrated that doxazosin (an antihypertensive drug) displayed inhibitory activity on VM formation at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Doxazosin significantly reduced the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in the cell media during VM formation. Further experiments revealed that the protein expression levels of VEGF-A and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin), which contribute to tumor aggressiveness and VM formation, were downregulated following doxazosin treatment. Moreover, the downstream signaling Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2)/AKT/mTOR/MMP/Laminin-5γ2 network was inhibited in response to doxazosin treatment. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that doxazosin displayed anti-VM activity in an NSCLC cell model through the downregulation of VEGF-A and VE-cadherin levels, and the suppression of signaling pathways related to the receptor tyrosine kinase, EphA2, protein kinases, AKT and mTOR, and proteases, MMP-2 and MMP-9. These results support the add-on anti-VM effect of doxazosin as a potential agent against NSCLC. Alpha-blockers have been proven as an effective method for increasing the stone expulsion rate of distal ureteral stones. Limited studies have focused on doxazosin; its efficacy remained unclear. We performed this meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of doxazosin for patients diagnosed with distal ureteral stones less than 10mm. We systematically searched Ovid MEDLINE®, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed for articles comparing doxazosin and conventional care or tamsulosin for distal ureteral stones through October 2019. The outcome measures were stone expulsive rate (SER), stone expulsive time (SET), pain episodes, analgesics consumption, and adverse events. We included 12 studies involving 836 participants with distal ureteral stones less than 10mm in our review. The present meta-analysis showed doxazosin could significantly increase SER [RR=1.64,95%CI (1.32, 2.04), P  < 0.00001], shorten SET [WMD=-3.97,95% CI (-5.68, -2.27), P  < 0.00001] compared with conventional care. In the subgroup analyses, doxazosin showed no benefit in the children subgroup (<16 years old) [RR=1.63,95% CI (0.73,3.64), P  =0.23]. No statistically significant difference was observed regarding the effectiveness of doxazosin and tamsulosin in SER, SET, and safety. 9 in 286 participants reported doxazosin-related adverse events; most were mild to moderate. This meta-analysis may suggest that doxazosin is a safe and effective MET for distal ureteral stones less than 10mm. It is not demonstrated to have any significant difference with tamsulosin in SER, SET, and safety. However, it showed no benefits for patients<16 years old. In this study, the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of doxazosin enantiomers and their pharmacokinetic interaction were studied in rats. Enantiomer concentrations in plasma were measured using chiral high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection after oral or intravenous administration of (-)-(R)-doxazosin 3.0 mg/kg, (+)-(S)-doxazosin 3.0 mg/kg, and rac-doxazosin 6.0 mg/kg. AUC values of (+)-(S)-doxazosin were always larger than those of (-)-(R)-doxazosin, regardless of oral or intravenous administration. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) value of (-)-(R)-doxazosin after oral administration was significantly higher when given alone (110.5 ± 46.4 ng/mL) versus in racemate (53.2 ± 19.7 ng/mL), whereas the Cmax value of (+)-(S)-doxazosin did not change significantly. The area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax values for (+)-(S)-doxazosin after intravenous administration were significantly lower, and its Cl value significantly higher, when given alone versus in racemate. We speculate that (-)-(R)-doxazosin increases (+)-(S)-doxazosin exposure probably by inhibiting the elimination of (+)-(S)-doxazosin, and the enantiomers may be competitively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, doxazosin pharmacokinetics are substantially stereospecific and enantiomer-enantiomer interaction occurs after rac-administration.",(r)-doxazosin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.619311974034645e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012674640165641904), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029764996841549873)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019286326132714748), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([drugs.ncats.io](https://drugs.ncats.io/substance/F6HQ441M9W?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=6, title='DOXAZOSIN, (R)-', type='url_citation', url='https://drugs.ncats.io/substance/F6HQ441M9W?utm_source=openai')])"
4572,"('Doxazosin mesylate', 'Cardura', 'Carduran', 'Cardular', 'Cardura xl')",Medical,"Doxazosin, sold under the brand name Cardura among others, is a medication used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate), hypertension (high blood pressure), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For high blood pressure, it is a less preferred option. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, swelling, nausea, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Severe side effects may include low blood pressure with standing, an irregular heart beat, and priapism. It is a selective α1-adrenergic blocker in the quinazoline class of compounds. Doxazosin was patented in 1977 and came into medical use in 1988. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 180th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === High blood pressure === Doxazosin is usually added to other antihypertensive therapy such as calcium channel antagonists, diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers. Doxazosin is generally considered to be safe, well tolerated and effective as an add-on (adjunctive) antihypertensive drug. Like other alpha-1 receptor antagonists, it has a role in the peri-operative management of pheochromocytoma. === Benign prostatic hyperplasia === Doxazosin is considered to be effective in reducing urinary symptom scores and improving peak urinary flow in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The bladder neck is densely packed with alpha-1 receptors. === PTSD nightmares and flashbacks === Sympatholytic drugs, including prazosin and doxazosin, are used for nightmares and flashbacks in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Doxazosin is very well tolerated for this constellation of symptoms. Given its long half-life, doxazosin lasts much longer than prazosin. While prazosin is dosed up to 4 times daily, doxazosin is generally dosed only once daily (at night). Both are alpha-1 antagonists. Other sympatholytic drugs include clonidine and guanfacine, which are alpha-2 agonists; they are not in the same exact class as doxazosin and prazosin. == History == The Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study stopped its arm of the trial looking at alpha blockers, because doxazosin was less effective than a simple diuretic, and because patients on doxazosin had a 25% higher rate of cardiovascular disease and twice the rate of congestive heart failure as patients on diuretics. Pfizer, aware of the results before publication, launched a marketing campaign in early 2000, and sales were largely unaffected, despite the dangers highlighted by the study. The decision to stop the trial was controversial because the higher rate of heart failure (HF) in the doxazosin group could have been caused by misdiagnosis due to fluid retention from the medication, or because patients with existing HF stopped their diuretic treatment to switch to doxazosin. However, in the later ASCOT trial, where doxazosin was used as a third-line treatment, there was no increase in HF risk. == Society and culture == === Brand names === In the US, Cardura is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == Research == A 2021 study associated doxazosin with decelerated biological aging in humans and confirmed its causal role in longevity in C. elegans. == References ==",Cardular,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003883084573317319), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00250680698081851)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.575939416885376), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/cardular ', [])"

These processes are accompanied by formation of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. This paper reports data on the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on reduced glutathione (GSH) and on activity of some GSH-metabolising enzymes in the liver, erythrocytes and serum of rats intoxicated with methanol (3 g/kg b.w.) during 7 days after intoxication. Methanol administration, increasing concentration of the lipid peroxidation products, decreased the liver glutathione-peroxidase and glutathione reductase (GSSG-R) activities, GSH concentration and total antioxidant status (TAS). The use of NAC after methanol ingestion apparently diminished lipid peroxidation, elevated the GSH level in the liver and erythrocytes, and increased activity of GSH-related enzymes in the serum, erythrocytes and in the liver. These results suggest that NAC exerts its protective effect by acting as a precursor for glutathione, the main low molecular antioxidant and as a free radical scavenger. In the present study, we investigated the effects of lipoic acid (LA) in the brain oxidative stress caused by pilocarpine-induced seizures in adult rats. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group), lipoic acid (10 mg/kg, i.p., LA group), pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p., pilocarpine group), and the association of LA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) plus pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before the administration of LA (LA plus pilocarpine group). After the treatments, all groups were observed for 1 h. The enzyme activities [delta-aminolevulinic dehydratase (delta-ALA-D), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and Na+,K+-ATPase] as well as the glutathione-reduced (GSH) and ascorbic acid (AA) concentrations were measured using spectrophotometric methods, and the results were compared to values obtained from saline and pilocarpine-treated animals. Protective effects of LA were also evaluated on the same parameters. In pilocarpine group, no changes were observed in GPx and GR activities and AA content. Moreover, in the same group, decrease in GSH levels as well as a reduction in delta-ALA-D and Na+,K+-ATPase activities after seizures was observed. In turn, in LA plus pilocarpine group, the appearance of seizures was abolished, and the decreases in delta-ALA-D and Na+,K+-ATPase activities produced by seizures as well as increases in GSH levels and GPx activity were reversed, when compared to the pilocarpine seizing group.

4574,"('Glutathione', 'Glutathion', 'Isethion', 'Tathion', 'Glutathione reduced')","Endogenous, Medical","Glutathione (GSH, ) is an organic compound with the chemical formula HOCOCH(NH2)CH2CH2CONHCH(CH2SH)CONHCH2COOH. It is an antioxidant in plants, animals, fungi, and some bacteria and archaea. Glutathione is capable of preventing damage to important cellular components caused by sources such as reactive oxygen species, free radicals, peroxides, lipid peroxides, and heavy metals. It is a tripeptide with a gamma peptide linkage between the carboxyl group of the glutamate side chain and cysteine. The carboxyl group of the cysteine residue is attached by normal peptide linkage to glycine. == Biosynthesis and occurrence == Glutathione biosynthesis involves two adenosine triphosphate-dependent steps: First, γ-glutamylcysteine is synthesized from L-glutamate and L-cysteine. This conversion requires the enzyme glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCL, glutamate cysteine synthase). This reaction is the rate-limiting step in glutathione synthesis. Second, glycine is added to the C-terminal of γ-glutamylcysteine. This condensation is catalyzed by glutathione synthetase. While all animal cells are capable of synthesizing glutathione, glutathione synthesis in the liver has been shown to be essential. GCLC knockout mice die within a month of birth due to the absence of hepatic GSH synthesis. The unusual gamma amide linkage in glutathione protects it from hydrolysis by peptidases. === Occurrence === Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol (R−SH-containing compound) in animal cells, ranging from 0.5 to 10 mmol/L. It is present in the cytosol and the organelles. The concentration of glutathione in the cytoplasm is significantly higher (ranging from 0.5-10 mM) compared to extracellular fluids (2-20 μM), reaching levels up to 1000 times greater. In healthy cells and tissue, more than 90% of the total glutathione pool is in the reduced form (GSH), with the remainder in the disulfide form (GSSG). The cytosol holds 80-85% of cellular GSH and the mitochondria hold 10-15%. Human beings synthesize glutathione, but a few eukaryotes do not, including some members of Fabaceae, Entamoeba, and Giardia. The only known archaea that make glutathione are halobacteria. Some bacteria, such as ""Cyanobacteria"" and Pseudomonadota, can biosynthesize glutathione. Systemic availability of orally consumed glutathione is poor. It had low bioavailability because the tripeptide is the substrate of proteases (peptidases) of the alimentary canal, and due to the absence of a specific carrier of glutathione at the level of cell membrane. The administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a cysteine prodrug, helps replenish intracellular GSH levels. == Biochemical function == Glutathione exists in reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) states. The ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione within cells is a measure of cellular oxidative stress where increased GSSG-to-GSH ratio is indicative of greater oxidative stress. In the reduced state, the thiol group of cysteinyl residue is a source of one reducing equivalent. Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is thereby generated. The oxidized state is converted to the reduced state by NADPH. This conversion is catalyzed by glutathione reductase: NADPH + GSSG + H2O → 2 GSH + NADP+ + OH− == Roles == === Antioxidant === GSH protects cells by neutralising (reducing) reactive oxygen species. This conversion is illustrated by the reduction of peroxides: 2 GSH + R2O2 → GSSG + 2 ROH (R = H, alkyl) and with free radicals: GSH + R• → ⁠1/2⁠ GSSG + RH === Regulation === Aside from deactivating radicals and reactive oxidants, glutathione participates in thiol protection and redox regulation of cellular thiol proteins under oxidative stress by protein S-glutathionylation, a redox-regulated post-translational thiol modification. The general reaction involves formation of an unsymmetrical disulfide from the protectable protein (RSH) and GSH: RSH + GSH + [O] → GSSR + H2O Glutathione is also employed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal and formaldehyde, toxic metabolites produced under oxidative stress. This detoxification reaction is carried out by the glyoxalase system. Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5) catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-lactoylglutathione. Glyoxalase II (EC 3.1.2.6) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoylglutathione to glutathione and D-lactic acid. It maintains exogenous antioxidants such as vitamins C and E in their reduced (active) states. === Metabolism === Among the many metabolic processes in which it participates, glutathione is required for the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and prostaglandins. It plays a role in the storage of cysteine. Glutathione enhances the function of citrulline as part of the nitric oxide cycle. It is a cofactor and acts on glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione is used to produce S-sulfanylglutathione, which is part of hydrogen sulfide metabolism. === Conjugation === Glutathione facilitates metabolism of xenobiotics. Glutathione S-transferase enzymes catalyze its conjugation to lipophilic xenobiotics, facilitating their excretion or further metabolism. The conjugation process is illustrated by the metabolism of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is a reactive metabolite formed by the action of cytochrome P450 on paracetamol (acetaminophen). Glutathione conjugates to NAPQI, and the resulting ensemble is excreted. === In plants === In plants, glutathione is involved in stress management. It is a component of the glutathione-ascorbate cycle, a system that reduces poisonous hydrogen peroxide. It is the precursor of phytochelatins, glutathione oligomers that chelate heavy metals such as cadmium. Glutathione is required for efficient defence against plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Phytophthora brassicae. Adenylyl-sulfate reductase, an enzyme of the sulfur assimilation pathway, uses glutathione as an electron donor. Other enzymes using glutathione as a substrate are glutaredoxins. These small oxidoreductases are involved in flower development, salicylic acid, and plant defence signalling. == In degradation of drug delivery systems == Among various types of cancer, lung cancer, larynx cancer, mouth cancer, and breast cancer exhibit higher concentrations (10-40 mM) of GSH compared to healthy cells. Thus, drug delivery systems containing disulfide bonds, typically cross-linked micro-nanogels, stand out for their ability to degrade in the presence of high concentrations of glutathione (GSH). This degradation process releases the drug payload specifically into cancerous or tumorous tissue, leveraging the significant difference in redox potential between the oxidizing extracellular environment and the reducing intracellular cytosol. When internalized by endocytosis, nanogels encounter high concentrations of GSH inside the cancer cell. GSH, a potent reducing agent, donates electrons to disulfide bonds in the nanogels, initiating a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. This reaction breaks the disulfide bonds, converting them into two thiol groups, and facilitates targeted drug release where it is needed most. This reaction is called a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. R−S−S−R′+ 2GSH → R−SH + R′−SH + GSSG where R and R' are parts of the micro-nanogel structure, and GSSG is oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide). The breaking of disulfide bonds causes the nanogel to degrade into smaller fragments. This degradation process leads to the release of encapsulated drugs. The released drug molecules can then exert their therapeutic effects, such as inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. == Uses == === Winemaking === The content of glutathione in must, the first raw form of wine, determines the browning, or caramelizing effect, during the production of white wine by trapping the caffeoyltartaric acid quinones generated by enzymic oxidation as grape reaction product. Its concentration in wine can be determined by UPLC-MRM mass spectrometry. == See also == Reductive stress Glutathione synthetase deficiency Ophthalmic acid roGFP, a tool to measure the cellular glutathione redox potential Glutathione-ascorbate cycle Bacterial glutathione transferase Thioredoxin, a cysteine-containing small proteins with very similar functions as reducing agents Glutaredoxin, an antioxidant protein that uses reduced glutathione as a cofactor and is reduced nonenzymatically by it Bacillithiol Mycothiol γ-L-Glutamyl-L-cysteine == References ==",Tathion,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.03570302948355675), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.25200292468070984), (' FOOD', -0.06892438977956772), (',', -0.20165003836154938), (' INDUSTR', -0.8328273892402649), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.06543000787496567), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.7165990357170813e-05), ('OUS', -1.311301275563892e-06), (',', -0.20183779299259186), ('ĠFOOD', -0.13562853634357452), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.38714924454689026)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -9.615255839889869e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL; https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/tathion, https://synapse.inc/medicine/11730/, https://synapse.inc/medicine/11727/, https://synapse.inc/medicine/11728/ ', [])"

Areas covered: This review focuses on elucidation of differences in clinical pharmacokinetics between fexofenadine enantiomers. Expert opinion: Differences in pharmacokinetics between fexofenadine enantiomers were caused by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 2B1, with a minor contribution from P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In vitro studies using OATP2B1 cRNA showed that (R)-fexofenadine uptake into oocytes is greater than (S)-enantiomer uptake. P-gp inducers, carbamazepine, and inhibitors such as itraconazole and verapamil show greater effects on the pharmacokinetics of (S)-fexofenadine. Apple juice and grape fruit juice, OATP2B1 inhibitors, significantly decrease the exposure of both fexofenadine enantiomers, particularly the (S)-enantiomer, but do not change the t Drug-transporters play an important role in the disposition of clinical medicines. Although there are plural studies that have reported on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics related to cytochrome P450s, previous reports of the stereoselective pharmacokinetics related to drug-transporters including P-glycoprotein have been lacking. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic differences between fexofenadine enantiomers in humans and summarizes the previous reports that co-administration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors has altered the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine enantiomers. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that both itraconazole and verapamil are potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Therefore, by comparing the stereoselective pharmacokinetics of (R)- and (S)-fexofenadine with or without itraconazole and verapamil, the contribution of P-glycoprotein-mediated transport to fexofenadine stereoselective pharmacokinetics could be estimated. In our studies, the plasma concentrations of (R)-fexofenadine were greater than those of the corresponding (S)-enantiomer. Co-administration of itraconazole and/or verapamil significantly increased the AUC(0 - 24) of both enantiomers; their influence on the P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of (S)-fexofenadine was greater than that of the (R)-enantiomer. However, because t(max) and t(1/2) were constant in both studies, the fexofenadine stereoselective pharmacokinetics appears to be due to P-glycoprotein efflux activity in the small intestine, which suggests that P-glycoprotein probably possesses the chiral discriminatory abilities. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is responsible for the efflux of a broad variety of human and veterinary drugs. Canine P-gp polymorphisms alter drug disposition and toxicity, but their impact on the disposition of enantiomeric drugs is unknown. Using fexofenadine as a model compound, we developed and validated HPLC-fluorescence methods to determine the effect of P-gp on the disposition of fexofenadine and its enantiomers. A chiral CD-Ph column was used for the separation of (R) and (S)-fexofenadine. Determination of racemic fexofenadine was achieved on an XDB-CN column. Fexofenadine and its enantiomers were detected by fluorescence at the excitation wavelength of 220 nm and emission wavelength of 300 nm. These methods were used to measure concentrations of fexofenadine and its enantiomers in Collie plasma after oral administration. This study demonstrates that P-gp prefers to transport (S)-fexofenadine, and P-gp deficiency causes the increase in both (R)-fexofenadine and (S)-fexofenadine in plasma. Racemic fexofenadine, (R)-fexofenadine and (S)-fexofenadine were increased in ABCB1-1Δ Collies (118.7, 72.0 and 48.3 ng/ml) compared to wild-type Collies (25.0, 16.5 and 7.7 ng/ml) at 1 h postadministration. The results demonstrate that the stereoselectivity of P-gp plays a key role in the disposition of fexofenadine enantiomers. The information derived from this drug model will be used to determine whether additional safety or efficacy requirements are necessary for enantiomeric drugs that would be used in dogs or humans.",(r)-fexofenadine,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0017704778583720326), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860640689730644)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0206720617134124e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00950?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=9, title='Fexofenadine: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00950?utm_source=openai')])"
4576,"('Allegra', 'Telfast', 'Fexofenadine (hydrochloride)', 'Terfenadine carboxylate hydrochloride', 'Allegra allergy')",Medical,"Fexofenadine, sold under the brand name Allegra among others, is an antihistamine pharmaceutical drug used in the treatment of allergy symptoms, such as hay fever and urticaria. Therapeutically, fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1 blocker. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine because it is less able to pass the blood–brain barrier and cause sedation, compared to first-generation antihistamines. It was patented in 1979 and came into medical use in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Fexofenadine has been manufactured in generic form since 2011. In 2022, it was the 257th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Fexofenadine is used for relief from physical symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis and for treatment of hives, including chronic urticaria. It does not cure, but rather prevents the aggravation of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, and reduces the severity of the symptoms associated with those conditions, providing relief from repeated sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes or skin, and general body fatigue. In a 2018 review, fexofenadine, along with levocetirizine, desloratadine, and cetirizine, was cited to be a safe drug to use for individuals with inherited long QT syndrome. === Efficacy === For the treatment of allergic rhinitis, fexofenadine is similarly effective to cetirizine, but is associated with less drowsiness than cetirizine. Fexofenadine was also shown to inhibit histamine-induced wheal and flare to a significantly greater degree than loratadine or desloratadine, but was slightly less effective than levocetirizine. Fexofenadine at doses above 120 mg a day does not appear to provide additional efficacy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. == Side effects == The most common side effects include headache, back and muscle pain, miosis or pinpoint pupils, nausea, drowsiness, and menstrual cramps. Anxiety and insomnia have also been rarely reported. The most common side effects demonstrated during clinical trials were cough, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, and otitis media for children ages 6 to 11 and fatigue for children ages 6 months to 5 years. == Overdose == The safety profile of fexofenadine is quite favorable, as no cardiovascular or sedative effects have been shown to occur even when taking 10 times the recommended dose. Research on humans ranges from a single 800-mg dose, to a twice-daily, 690-mg dose for a month, with no clinically significant adverse effects, when compared to a placebo. No deaths occurred in testing on mice, at 5000 mg/kg body weight, which is 110 times the maximum recommended dose for an adult human. If an overdose were to occur, supportive measures are recommended. Theoretically, an overdose could present as dizziness, dry mouth, and/or drowsiness, consistent with an exaggeration of the usual side effects. Hemodialysis does not appear to be an effective means of removing fexofenadine from the blood. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Fexofenadine is a selective peripheral H1 receptor antagonist. Blockage prevents the activation of the H1 receptors by histamine, preventing the symptoms associated with allergies from occurring. Fexofenadine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so is less likely to cause drowsiness in comparison to other antihistamines that readily cross that barrier (i.e., first-generation antihistamines such as diphenhydramine). In general, fexofenadine takes about an hour to take effect, though this may be affected by the choice of dosage form and the presence of certain foods. Fexofenadine also exhibits no anticholinergic, antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, alpha 1-adrenergic, or beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking effects. === Pharmacokinetics === Absorption: After oral application, maximum plasma concentrations are reached after 2–3 hours. Fexofenadine should not be taken with a high-fat meal, as mean concentrations of fexofenadine in the bloodstream are seen to be reduced by 20–60% depending on the form of medication (tablet, ODT, or suspension). Distribution: Fexofenadine is 60–70% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. Metabolism: Fexofenadine is a substrate of CYP3A4, but only about 5% is metabolized by the liver, indicating that hepatic metabolism is relatively minor in clearance from the body. Elimination: Most of the substance is eliminated unchanged via the feces (80%) and urine (11–12%). == Interactions == Taking erythromycin or ketoconazole while taking fexofenadine does increase the plasma levels of fexofenadine, but this increase does not influence the QT interval. The reason for this effect is likely due to transport-related effects, specifically involving p-glycoprotein (p-gp). Both erythromycin and ketoconazole are inhibitors of p-gp, a transporter protein involved in preventing the intestinal absorption of fexofenadine. When p-gp is inhibited, fexofenadine may be better absorbed by the body, increasing its plasma concentration by more than intended. Fexofenadine is not to be taken with apple, orange, or grapefruit juice because they could decrease absorption of the drug. Therefore, it should be taken with water. Grapefruit juice can significantly reduce the plasma concentration of fexofenadine. Antacids containing aluminum or magnesium should not be taken within 15 minutes of fexofenadine, as they reduce its absorption by almost 50%. This is not thought to be due to a change in pH (in fact, absorption can actually increase under increasingly alkaline pH), but rather due to the formation of metal complexes with charged/polar moieties on fexofenadine. As suggested by Shehnaza et al (2014), various sites of the molecule are thought to be responsible for this interaction, including the piperidine nitrogen, the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, and both hydroxyl (-OH) groups. == History == The older antihistaminic agent terfenadine was found to metabolize into the related carboxylic acid, fexofenadine. Fexofenadine was found to retain all of the biological activity of its parent while giving fewer adverse reactions in patients, so terfenadine was replaced in the market by its metabolite. Fexofenadine was originally synthesized in 1993 by Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Sepracor, which then sold the development rights to Hoechst Marion Roussel (now part of Sanofi-Aventis), and was later approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996. Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) holds the patents to the intermediates and production of fexofenadine HCl, along with Roussel. Since that time, it has achieved blockbuster drug status with global sales of US$1.87B in 2004 (with $1.49B coming from the United States). AMRI received royalty payments from Aventis which enabled the growth of AMRI. In January 2011, the FDA approved over-the-counter sales of fexofenadine in the United States, and Sanofi Aventis' version became available in March 2011. In December 2020, the MHRA reclassified fexofenadine from prescription only to allow general sales in the United Kingdom. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Fexofenadine is marketed under many brand names worldwide. As of January 2017, it is marketed as a combination drug with pseudoephedrine under brand names including Alerfedine D, Allegra-D, Allergyna-D, Allevia, Altiva-D, Dellegra, Fexo Plus, Fexofed, Fixal Plus, Ridrinal D, Rinolast D, Telfast D, and Treathay. As of January 2017, it is marketed as a combination drug with montelukast under brand names including Fexokast, Histakind-M, Monten-FX, Montolife-FX, Montair-FX and Novamont-FX. == References ==",Telfast,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006267252028919756), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001984414178878069)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4577,"('Simvastatin', 'Zocor', 'Synvinolin', 'Sinvacor', 'Denan')",Medical,"Simvastatin, sold under the brand name Zocor among others, is a statin, a type of lipid-lowering medication. It is used along with exercise, diet, and weight loss to decrease elevated lipid levels. It is also used to decrease the risk of heart problems in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include constipation, headaches, and nausea. Serious side effects may include muscle breakdown, liver problems, and increased blood sugar levels. A lower dose may be needed in people with kidney problems. There is evidence of harm to the developing baby when taken during pregnancy and it should not be used by those who are breastfeeding. It is in the statin class of medications and works by decreasing the manufacture of cholesterol by the liver. Simvastatin is made from the fungus Aspergillus terreus. It was patented by Merck in 1980, and came into medical use in 1992. Simvastatin is available as a generic medication, and is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the nineteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 26 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == The primary uses of simvastatin are to treat dyslipidemia and to prevent atherosclerosis-related complications such as stroke and heart attacks in those who are at high risk. It is recommended to be used as an addition to a low-cholesterol diet. In heart protection studies, simvastatin showed the ability to lower LDL cholesterol by about 1·5 mmol/L, which resulted in substantial reductions in mortality rates. Simvastatin also reduced the numbers of other events like heart attacks, strokes, and revascularizations and MI significantly. The Heart Protection Study evaluated the effects of simvastatin in people with risk factors including existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or stroke, but having relatively low LDL cholesterol. In this trial, which lasted 5.4 years, overall mortality was reduced by 13% and cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 18%. People receiving simvastatin experienced 38% fewer nonfatal heart attacks and 25% fewer strokes. Statins in general have been proposed as beneficial in reducing the progression of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Multiple observational studies have been conducted to analyse the benefits of statin use in delaying the progression of AMD but have resulted in conflicting outcomes. Given the current available information, simvastatin should not be recommended solely for the treatment of AMD. == Contraindications == Simvastatin is contraindicated with pregnancy, breastfeeding, and liver disease. Pregnancy must be avoided while on simvastatin due to potentially severe birth defects. Patients cannot breastfeed while on simvastatin due to potentially disrupting the infant's lipid metabolism. High doses of simvastatin are also contraindicated with the widely used antihypertensive amlodipine. A lower dose is also recommended in people taking the calcium channel blockers, verapamil and diltiazem, as well as those taking amiodarone. == Adverse effects == Common side effects (>1% incidence) may include indigestion and eczema. There is evidence to suggest that rare side effects such as joint pain, memory loss, and muscle cramps are more likely to occur in patients who take higher doses of simvastatin. Cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscles and blockade of renal system), and myositis have been reported in patients receiving the drug chronically. Serious allergic reactions to simvastatin are rare. A type of DNA variant known as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may help predict individuals prone to developing myopathy when taking simvastatin; a study ultimately including 32,000 patients concluded the carriers of one or two risk alleles of a particular SNP, rs4149056, were at a five-fold or 16-fold increased risk, respectively. In 2012, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has released guidelines regarding the use of rs4149056 genotype in guiding dosing of simvastatin and updated the guideline in 2014. In March 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its guidance for statin users to address reports of memory loss, liver damage, increased blood sugar, development of type 2 diabetes, and muscle injury. The new guidance indicates: FDA has found that liver injury associated with statin use is rare but can occur. The reports about memory loss, forgetfulness, and confusion span all statin products and all age groups. The FDA says these experiences are rare, but that those affected often report feeling ""fuzzy"" or unfocused in their thinking. A small increased risk of raised blood sugar levels and the development of type 2 diabetes have been reported with the use of statins. A 2010 published meta-analysis found for every 255 patients taking a statin for 4 years, one additional case of diabetes would occur whilst preventing 5.4 major coronary events. Some drugs interact with statins in a way that increases the risk of muscle injury called myopathy, characterized by unexplained muscle weakness or pain. On 19 March 2010, the FDA issued another statement regarding simvastatin, saying it increases the risk of muscle injury (myopathy) when taken at high doses or at lower doses in combination with other drugs. The highest dose rate causes muscle damage in 610 of every 10,000 people in contrast to a lower dose, which causes muscle damage in eight of 10,000 people. The FDA warning, released again on 8 June 2011, suggested that high-dose ""simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking this dose for 12 months or more without evidence of muscle injury"" and that it ""should not be started in new patients, including patients already taking lower doses of the drug."" == Interactions == Simvastatin has important interactions with grapefruit juice and other drugs, including some that are commonly used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. These interactions are clinically important because increasing simvastatin serum levels above those normally provided by the maximum recommended dose increases the risk of muscle damage, including the otherwise rare and potentially fatal side effect of rhabdomyolysis. Consuming large amounts of grapefruit juice increases serum levels of simvastatin by up to three-fold, increasing the risk of side effects. The FDA recommends that people taking statins should avoid consuming more than a quart (946 ml) of grapefruit juice per day. Simvastatin also interacts with other drugs, including some used to treat cardiovascular problems. It should not be taken by people who are also taking the antifungal drugs fluconazole, itraconazole, or posaconazole; the antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, or telithromycin; HIV protease inhibitors; the antidepressant nefazodone; the cardiovascular drug gemfibrozil; the immunosuppressant ciclosporin, or the endometriosis drug danazol. Reduced maximum doses of simvastatin apply for patients taking certain other drugs, including the cardiovascular drugs verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, amlodipine, and ranolazine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === All statins act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase. HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, the metabolic pathway responsible for the endogenous production of cholesterol. Statins are more effective than other lipid-regulating drugs at lowering LDL-cholesterol concentration, but they are less effective than the fibrates in reducing triglyceride concentration. However, statins reduce cardiovascular disease events and total mortality irrespective of the initial cholesterol concentration. This is a major piece of evidence that statins work in another way than the lowering of cholesterol (called pleiotropic effects). Simvastatin is an effective serum lipid-lowering drug that can decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels by up to 50%. Simvastatin had been shown to interact with lipid-lowering transcription factor PPAR-alpha and that interaction might control the neurotrophic action of the drug. === Pharmacokinetics === The drug is in the form of an inactive lactone that is hydrolyzed after ingestion to produce the active β-hydroxyacid form. Simvastatin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 yielding products which are also active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. == History == The development of simvastatin was closely linked with lovastatin. Biochemist Jesse Huff and his colleagues at Merck began researching the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the early 1950s. In 1956, mevalonic acid was isolated from a yeast extract by Karl Folkers, Carl Hoffman, and others at Merck, while Huff and his associates confirmed that mevalonic acid was an intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis. In 1959, the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme (a major contributor of internal cholesterol production) was discovered by researchers at the Max Planck Institute. This discovery encouraged scientists worldwide to find an effective inhibitor of this enzyme. By 1976, Akira Endo had isolated the first inhibitor, mevastatin, from the fungus Penicillium citrinium while working at Daiichi Sankyo in Japan. In 1979, Hoffman and colleagues isolated lovastatin from a strain of the fungus Aspergillus terreus. While developing and researching lovastatin, Merck scientists synthetically derived a more potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor from a fermentation product of A. terreus, which was designated MK-733 (later to be named simvastatin). In 1994, publication of the results of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) provided the first unequivocal evidence that lowering LDL cholesterol via statin treatment reduces cardiovascular events and overall mortality. A total of 4,444 people with coronary heart disease and blood cholesterol levels from 5.5 to 8.0 mmol/L were randomized to simvastatin treatment or placebo and followed for an average of 5 years. Compared to the placebo group, those treated with simvastatin experienced a 30% decrease in overall mortality, a 42% reduction in coronary death, a 34% reduction in major coronary events, and a 37% reduction in revascularization procedures. == Society and culture == === Economics === Prior to losing US patent protection, simvastatin was Merck & Co.'s largest-selling drug. Under provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in the United States, health plans may cover the costs of simvastatin 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg for adults aged 40–75 years based on United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. Zocor had an original patent expiry date in December 2005, but was extended by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to expire in June 2006. === Brand names === Simvastatin was initially marketed by Merck & Co under the brand name Zocor but is available generically in most countries following the patent expiry. A combination of simvastatin along with ezetimibe is sold under the brand name Vytorin and is jointly marketed by Merck and Schering-Plough. Brand names include Zocor, Zocor Heart Pro, marketed by the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co., Simlup, Simvotin, Simcard (India), Denan (Germany), Liponorm, Sinvacor, Sivastin (Italy), Lipovas (Japan), Lodales (France), Zocord (Austria and Sweden), Zimstat, Simvahexal (Australia), Lipex (Australia and New Zealand), Simvastatin-Teva, Simvacor, Simvaxon, Simovil (Israel), available in Thailand under the brand Bestatin manufactured by Berlin Pharmaceutical Industry Co Ltd and others. == References ==",Denan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00024625606602057815), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011079693213105202)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.invivochem.com/product/V52947,https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.001.899,https://www.wikigenes.org/e/chem/e/5921.html ', [])"
4578,"('Caffeine', 'Guaranine', 'Thein', 'Methyltheobromine', 'Cafeina')","Food, Medical","Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class and is the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance globally. It is mainly used for its eugeroic (wakefulness promoting), ergogenic (physical performance-enhancing), or nootropic (cognitive-enhancing) properties. Caffeine acts by blocking binding of adenosine at a number of adenosine receptor types, inhibiting the centrally depressant effects of adenosine and enhancing the release of acetylcholine. Caffeine has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of adenosine, which allows it to bind and block its receptors. Caffeine also increases cyclic AMP levels through nonselective inhibition of phosphodiesterase, increases calcium release from intracellular stores, and antagonizes GABA receptors, although these mechanisms typically occur at concentrations beyond usual human consumption. Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline purine, a methylxanthine alkaloid, and is chemically related to the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is found in the seeds, fruits, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to Africa, East Asia and South America and helps to protect them against herbivores and from competition by preventing the germination of nearby seeds, as well as encouraging consumption by select animals such as honey bees. The best-known source of caffeine is the coffee bean, the seed of the Coffea plant. People may drink beverages containing caffeine to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve cognitive performance. To make these drinks, caffeine is extracted by steeping the plant product in water, a process called infusion. Caffeine-containing drinks, such as coffee, tea, and cola, are consumed globally in high volumes. In 2020, almost 10 million tonnes of coffee beans were consumed globally. Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike most other psychoactive substances, caffeine remains largely unregulated and legal in nearly all parts of the world. Caffeine is also an outlier as its use is seen as socially acceptable in most cultures with it even being encouraged. Caffeine has both positive and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Some people experience sleep disruption or anxiety if they consume caffeine, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit caffeine to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence – associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability – when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use). Caffeine is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as generally recognized as safe. Toxic doses, over 10 grams per day for an adult, are much higher than the typical dose of under 500 milligrams per day. The European Food Safety Authority reported that up to 400 mg of caffeine per day (around 5.7 mg/kg of body mass per day) does not raise safety concerns for non-pregnant adults, while intakes up to 200 mg per day for pregnant and lactating women do not raise safety concerns for the fetus or the breast-fed infants. A cup of coffee contains 80–175 mg of caffeine, depending on what ""bean"" (seed) is used, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared (e.g., drip, percolation, or espresso). Thus it requires roughly 50–100 ordinary cups of coffee to reach the toxic dose. However, pure powdered caffeine, which is available as a dietary supplement, can be lethal in tablespoon-sized amounts. == Uses == === Medical === Caffeine is used for both prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. It may improve weight gain during therapy and reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy as well as reduce language and cognitive delay. On the other hand, subtle long-term side effects are possible. Caffeine is used as a primary treatment for apnea of prematurity, but not prevention. It is also used for orthostatic hypotension treatment. Some people use caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee or tea to try to treat their asthma. Evidence to support this practice is poor. It appears that caffeine in low doses improves airway function in people with asthma, increasing forced expiratory volume (FEV1) by 5% to 18% for up to four hours. The addition of caffeine (100–130 mg) to commonly prescribed pain relievers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen modestly improves the proportion of people who achieve pain relief. Consumption of caffeine after abdominal surgery shortens the time to recovery of normal bowel function and shortens length of hospital stay. Caffeine was formerly used as a second-line treatment for ADHD. It is considered less effective than methylphenidate or amphetamine but more so than placebo for children with ADHD. Children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD are more likely to consume caffeine, perhaps as a form of self-medication. === Enhancing performance === ==== Cognitive performance ==== Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that may reduce fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. The desired effects arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the desired effects of a moderate dose usually subside after about three or four hours. Caffeine can delay or prevent sleep and improves task performance during sleep deprivation. Shift workers who use caffeine make fewer mistakes that could result from drowsiness. Caffeine in a dose dependent manner increases alertness in both fatigued and normal individuals. A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2014 found that concurrent caffeine and L-theanine use has synergistic psychoactive effects that promote alertness, attention, and task switching; these effects are most pronounced during the first hour post-dose. ==== Physical performance ==== Caffeine is a proven ergogenic aid in humans. Caffeine improves athletic performance in aerobic (especially endurance sports) and anaerobic conditions. Moderate doses of caffeine (around 5 mg/kg) can improve sprint performance, cycling and running time trial performance, endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of muscle fatigue and central fatigue), and cycling power output. Caffeine increases basal metabolic rate in adults. Caffeine ingestion prior to aerobic exercise increases fat oxidation, particularly in persons with low physical fitness. Caffeine improves muscular strength and power, and may enhance muscular endurance. Caffeine also enhances performance on anaerobic tests. Caffeine consumption before constant load exercise is associated with reduced perceived exertion. While this effect is not present during exercise-to-exhaustion exercise, performance is significantly enhanced. This is congruent with caffeine reducing perceived exertion, because exercise-to-exhaustion should end at the same point of fatigue. Caffeine also improves power output and reduces time to completion in aerobic time trials, an effect positively (but not exclusively) associated with longer duration exercise. === Specific populations === ==== Adults ==== For the general population of healthy adults, Health Canada advises a daily intake of no more than 400 mg. This limit was found to be safe by a 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology. ==== Children ==== In healthy children, moderate caffeine intake under 400 mg produces effects that are ""modest and typically innocuous"". As early as six months old, infants can metabolize caffeine at the same rate as that of adults. Higher doses of caffeine (>400 mg) can cause physiological, psychological and behavioral harm, particularly for children with psychiatric or cardiac conditions. There is no evidence that coffee stunts a child's growth. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that caffeine consumption, particularly in the case of energy and sports drinks, is not appropriate for children and adolescents and should be avoided. This recommendation is based on a clinical report released by American Academy of Pediatrics in 2011 with a review of 45 publications from 1994 to 2011 and includes inputs from various stakeholders (Pediatricians, Committee on nutrition, Canadian Pediatric Society, Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Sports Medicine & Fitness committee, National Federations of High School Associations). For children age 12 and under, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Based on average body weights of children, this translates to the following age-based intake limits: ==== Adolescents ==== Health Canada has not developed advice for adolescents because of insufficient data. However, they suggest that daily caffeine intake for this age group be no more than 2.5 mg/kg body weight. This is because the maximum adult caffeine dose may not be appropriate for light-weight adolescents or for younger adolescents who are still growing. The daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight would not cause adverse health effects in the majority of adolescent caffeine consumers. This is a conservative suggestion since older and heavier-weight adolescents may be able to consume adult doses of caffeine without experiencing adverse effects. ==== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ==== The metabolism of caffeine is reduced in pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, and the half-life of caffeine during pregnancy can be increased up to 15 hours (as compared to 2.5 to 4.5 hours in non-pregnant adults). Evidence regarding the effects of caffeine on pregnancy and for breastfeeding are inconclusive. There is limited primary and secondary advice for, or against, caffeine use during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus or newborn. The UK Food Standards Agency has recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, to less than 200 mg of caffeine a day – the equivalent of two cups of instant coffee, or one and a half to two cups of fresh coffee. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg per day in pregnant women. For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300 mg, or a little over two 8 oz (237 mL) cups of coffee. A 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology found evidence supporting that caffeine consumption up to 300 mg/day for pregnant women is generally not associated with adverse reproductive or developmental effect. There are conflicting reports in the scientific literature about caffeine use during pregnancy. A 2011 review found that caffeine during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations, miscarriage or growth retardation even when consumed in moderate to high amounts. Other reviews, however, concluded that there is some evidence that higher caffeine intake by pregnant women may be associated with a higher risk of giving birth to a low birth weight baby, and may be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss. A systematic review, analyzing the results of observational studies, suggests that women who consume large amounts of caffeine (greater than 300 mg/day) prior to becoming pregnant may have a higher risk of experiencing pregnancy loss. == Adverse effects == === Physiological === Caffeine in coffee and other caffeinated drinks can affect gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion. In postmenopausal women, high caffeine consumption can accelerate bone loss. Caffeine, alongside other factors such as stress and fatigue, can also increase the pressure in various muscles, including the eyelids. Acute ingestion of caffeine in large doses (at least 250–300 mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2–3 cups of coffee or 5–8 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine for a period of days or weeks. This increase is due to both a diuresis (increase in water excretion) and a natriuresis (increase in saline excretion); it is mediated via proximal tubular adenosine receptor blockade. The acute increase in urinary output may increase the risk of dehydration. However, chronic users of caffeine develop a tolerance to this effect and experience no increase in urinary output. === Psychological === Minor undesired symptoms from caffeine ingestion not sufficiently severe to warrant a psychiatric diagnosis are common and include mild anxiety, jitteriness, insomnia, increased sleep latency, and reduced coordination. Caffeine can have negative effects on anxiety disorders. According to a 2011 literature review, caffeine use may induce anxiety and panic disorders in people with Parkinson's disease. At high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety. For some people, discontinuing caffeine use can significantly reduce anxiety. In moderate doses, caffeine has been associated with reduced symptoms of depression and lower suicide risk. Two reviews indicate that increased consumption of coffee and caffeine may reduce the risk of depression. Some textbooks state that caffeine is a mild euphoriant, while others state that it is not a euphoriant. Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is a subclass of the DSM-5 diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. === Reinforcement disorders === ==== Addiction ==== Whether caffeine can result in an addictive disorder depends on how addiction is defined. Compulsive caffeine consumption under any circumstances has not been observed, and caffeine is therefore not generally considered addictive. Some diagnostic sources, such as the ICDM-9 and ICD-10, include a classification of caffeine addiction under a broader diagnostic model. Some state that certain users can become addicted and therefore unable to decrease use even though they know there are negative health effects. Caffeine does not appear to be a reinforcing stimulus, and some degree of aversion may actually occur, with people preferring placebo over caffeine in a study on drug abuse liability published in an NIDA research monograph. Some state that research does not provide support for an underlying biochemical mechanism for caffeine addiction. Other research states it can affect the reward system. ""Caffeine addiction"" was added to the ICDM-9 and ICD-10. However, its addition was contested with claims that this diagnostic model of caffeine addiction is not supported by evidence. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 does not include the diagnosis of a caffeine addiction but proposes criteria for the disorder for more study. ==== Dependence and withdrawal ==== Caffeine withdrawal can cause mild to clinically significant distress or impairment in daily functioning. The frequency at which this occurs is self-reported at 11%, but in lab tests only half of the people who report withdrawal actually experience it, casting doubt on many claims of dependence. and most cases of caffeine withdrawal were 13% in the moderate sense. Moderately physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms may occur upon abstinence, with greater than 100 mg caffeine per day, although these symptoms last no longer than a day. Some symptoms associated with psychological dependence may also occur during withdrawal. The diagnostic criteria for caffeine withdrawal require a previous prolonged daily use of caffeine. Following 24 hours of a marked reduction in consumption, a minimum of 3 of these signs or symptoms is required to meet withdrawal criteria: difficulty concentrating, depressed mood/irritability, flu-like symptoms, headache, and fatigue. Additionally, the signs and symptoms must disrupt important areas of functioning and are not associated with effects of another condition. The ICD-11 includes caffeine dependence as a distinct diagnostic category, which closely mirrors the DSM-5's proposed set of criteria for ""caffeine-use disorder"". Caffeine use disorder refers to dependence on caffeine characterized by failure to control caffeine consumption despite negative physiological consequences. The APA, which published the DSM-5, acknowledged that there was sufficient evidence in order to create a diagnostic model of caffeine dependence for the DSM-5, but they noted that the clinical significance of the disorder is unclear. Due to this inconclusive evidence on clinical significance, the DSM-5 classifies caffeine-use disorder as a ""condition for further study"". Tolerance to the effects of caffeine occurs for caffeine-induced elevations in blood pressure and the subjective feelings of nervousness though the effects are not drastic. Sensitization, the process whereby effects become more prominent with use, may occur for positive effects such as feelings of alertness and wellbeing. Tolerance varies for daily, regular caffeine users and high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200 mg/day spread throughout the day) have been shown to produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100 mg/day, such as a 6 oz (170 g) cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz (340 g) servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not. === Risk of other diseases === A neuroprotective effect of caffeine against Alzheimer's disease and dementia is possible but the evidence is inconclusive. Caffeine may lessen the severity of acute mountain sickness if taken a few hours prior to attaining a high altitude. One meta analysis has found that caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Regular caffeine consumption may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and may slow the progression of Parkinson's disease. Caffeine increases intraocular pressure in those with glaucoma but does not appear to affect normal individuals. The DSM-5 also includes other caffeine-induced disorders consisting of caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, caffeine-induced sleep disorder and unspecified caffeine-related disorders. The first two disorders are classified under ""Anxiety Disorder"" and ""Sleep-Wake Disorder"" because they share similar characteristics. Other disorders that present with significant distress and impairment of daily functioning that warrant clinical attention but do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed under any specific disorders are listed under ""Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorders"". === Energy crash === Caffeine is reputed to cause a fall in energy several hours after drinking, but this is not well researched. == Overdose == Consumption of 1–1.5 grams (1,000–1,500 mg) per day is associated with a condition known as caffeinism. Caffeinism usually combines caffeine dependency with a wide range of unpleasant symptoms including nervousness, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and palpitations after caffeine use. Caffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system overstimulation known as caffeine intoxication, a clinically significant temporary condition that develops during, or shortly after, the consumption of caffeine. This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500 mg at a time). According to the DSM-5, caffeine intoxication may be diagnosed if five (or more) of the following symptoms develop after recent consumption of caffeine: restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, rambling flow of thought and speech, tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility, and psychomotor agitation. According to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), cases of very high caffeine intake (e.g. > 5 g) may result in caffeine intoxication with symptoms including mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations or psychosis, and rhabdomyolysis. === Energy drinks === High caffeine consumption in energy drinks (at least one liter or 320 mg of caffeine) was associated with short-term cardiovascular side effects including hypertension, prolonged QT interval, and heart palpitations. These cardiovascular side effects were not seen with smaller amounts of caffeine consumption in energy drinks (less than 200 mg). === Severe intoxication === As of 2007 there is no known antidote or reversal agent for caffeine intoxication. Treatment of mild caffeine intoxication is directed toward symptom relief; severe intoxication may require peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration. Intralipid infusion therapy is indicated in cases of imminent risk of cardiac arrest in order to scavenge the free serum caffeine. === Lethal dose === Death from caffeine ingestion appears to be rare, and most commonly caused by an intentional overdose of medications. In 2016, 3702 caffeine-related exposures were reported to Poison Control Centers in the United States, of which 846 required treatment at a medical facility, and 16 had a major outcome; and several caffeine-related deaths are reported in case studies. The LD50 of caffeine in rats is 192 milligrams per kilogram of body mass. The fatal dose in humans is estimated to be 150–200 milligrams per kilogram, which is 10.5–14 grams for a typical 70 kg (150 lb) adult, equivalent to about 75–100 cups of coffee. There are cases where doses as low as 57 milligrams per kilogram have been fatal. A number of fatalities have been caused by overdoses of readily available powdered caffeine supplements, for which the estimated lethal amount is less than a tablespoon. The lethal dose is lower in individuals whose ability to metabolize caffeine is impaired due to genetics or chronic liver disease. A death was reported in 2013 of a man with liver cirrhosis who overdosed on caffeinated mints. == Interactions == Caffeine is a substrate for CYP1A2, and interacts with many substances through this and other mechanisms. === Alcohol === According to DSST, alcohol causes a decrease in performance on their standardized tests, and caffeine causes a significant improvement. When alcohol and caffeine are consumed jointly, the effects of the caffeine are changed, but the alcohol effects remain the same. For example, consuming additional caffeine does not reduce the effect of alcohol. However, the jitteriness and alertness given by caffeine is decreased when additional alcohol is consumed. Alcohol consumption alone reduces both inhibitory and activational aspects of behavioral control. Caffeine antagonizes the effect of alcohol on the activational aspect of behavioral control, but has no effect on the inhibitory behavioral control. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend avoidance of concomitant consumption of alcohol and caffeine, as taking them together may lead to increased alcohol consumption, with a higher risk of alcohol-associated injury. === Smoking === Smoking tobacco has been shown to increase caffeine clearance by 56% as a result of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons inducing the CYP1A2 enzyme. The CYP1A2 enzyme that is induced by smoking is responsible for the metabolism of caffeine; increased enzyme activity leads to increased caffeine clearance, and is associated with greater coffee consumption for regular smokers. === Birth control === Birth control pills can extend the half-life of caffeine by as much as 40%, requiring greater attention to caffeine consumption. === Medications === Caffeine sometimes increases the effectiveness of some medications, such as those for headaches. Caffeine was determined to increase the potency of some over-the-counter analgesic medications by 40%. The pharmacological effects of adenosine may be blunted in individuals taking large quantities of methylxanthines like caffeine. Some other examples of methylxanthines include the medications theophylline and aminophylline, which are prescribed to relieve symptoms of asthma or COPD. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === In the absence of caffeine and when a person is awake and alert, little adenosine is present in CNS neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time adenosine accumulates in the neuronal synapse, in turn binding to and activating adenosine receptors found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases drowsiness. When caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness. ==== Receptor and ion channel targets ==== Caffeine is an antagonist of adenosine A2A receptors, and knockout mouse studies have specifically implicated antagonism of the A2A receptor as responsible for the wakefulness-promoting effects of caffeine. Antagonism of A2A receptors in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) reduces inhibitory GABA neurotransmission to the tuberomammillary nucleus, a histaminergic projection nucleus that activation-dependently promotes arousal. This disinhibition of the tuberomammillary nucleus is the downstream mechanism by which caffeine produces wakefulness-promoting effects. Caffeine is an antagonist of all four adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), although with varying potencies. The affinity (KD) values of caffeine for the human adenosine receptors are 12 μM at A1, 2.4 μM at A2A, 13 μM at A2B, and 80 μM at A3. Antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine also stimulates the medullary vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, which increases respiratory rate, reduces heart rate, and constricts blood vessels. Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes neurotransmitter release (e.g., monoamines and acetylcholine), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects; adenosine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. Heart palpitations are caused by blockade of the A1 receptor. Because caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the blood–brain barrier that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a competitive antagonist. In addition to its activity at adenosine receptors, caffeine is an inositol trisphosphate receptor 1 antagonist and a voltage-independent activator of the ryanodine receptors (RYR1, RYR2, and RYR3). It is also a competitive antagonist of the ionotropic glycine receptor. ==== Effects on striatal dopamine ==== While caffeine does not directly bind to any dopamine receptors, it influences the binding activity of dopamine at its receptors in the striatum by binding to adenosine receptors that have formed GPCR heteromers with dopamine receptors, specifically the A1–D1 receptor heterodimer (this is a receptor complex with one adenosine A1 receptor and one dopamine D1 receptor) and the A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer (this is a receptor complex with two adenosine A2A receptors and two dopamine D2 receptors). The A2A–D2 receptor heterotetramer has been identified as a primary pharmacological target of caffeine, primarily because it mediates some of its psychostimulant effects and its pharmacodynamic interactions with dopaminergic psychostimulants. Caffeine also causes the release of dopamine in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens core (a substructure within the ventral striatum), but not the nucleus accumbens shell, by antagonizing A1 receptors in the axon terminal of dopamine neurons and A1–A2A heterodimers (a receptor complex composed of one adenosine A1 receptor and one adenosine A2A receptor) in the axon terminal of glutamate neurons. During chronic caffeine use, caffeine-induced dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens core is markedly reduced due to drug tolerance. ==== Enzyme targets ==== Caffeine, like other xanthines, also acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. As a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caffeine raises intracellular cyclic AMP, activates protein kinase A, inhibits TNF-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. Caffeine also affects the cholinergic system where it is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. === Pharmacokinetics === Caffeine from coffee or other beverages is absorbed by the small intestine within 45 minutes of ingestion and distributed throughout all bodily tissues. Peak blood concentration is reached within 1–2 hours. It is eliminated by first-order kinetics. Caffeine can also be absorbed rectally, evidenced by suppositories of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine (for the relief of migraine) and of chlorobutanol and caffeine (for the treatment of hyperemesis). However, rectal absorption is less efficient than oral: the maximum concentration (Cmax) and total amount absorbed (AUC) are both about 30% (i.e., 1/3.5) of the oral amounts. Caffeine's biological half-life – the time required for the body to eliminate one-half of a dose – varies widely among individuals according to factors such as pregnancy, other drugs, liver enzyme function level (needed for caffeine metabolism) and age. In healthy adults, caffeine's half-life is between 3 and 7 hours. The half-life is decreased by 30-50% in adult male smokers, approximately doubled in women taking oral contraceptives, and prolonged in the last trimester of pregnancy. In newborns the half-life can be 80 hours or more, dropping rapidly with age, possibly to less than the adult value by age 6 months. The antidepressant fluvoxamine (Luvox) reduces the clearance of caffeine by more than 90%, and increases its elimination half-life more than tenfold, from 4.9 hours to 56 hours. Caffeine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzyme system (particularly by the CYP1A2 isozyme) into three dimethylxanthines, each of which has its own effects on the body: Paraxanthine (84%): Increases lipolysis, leading to elevated glycerol and free fatty acid levels in blood plasma. Theobromine (12%): Dilates blood vessels and increases urine volume. Theobromine is also the principal alkaloid in the cocoa bean (chocolate). Theophylline (4%): Relaxes smooth muscles of the bronchi, and is used to treat asthma. The therapeutic dose of theophylline, however, is many times greater than the levels attained from caffeine metabolism. 1,3,7-Trimethyluric acid is a minor caffeine metabolite. 7-Methylxanthine is also a metabolite of caffeine. Each of the above metabolites is further metabolized and then excreted in the urine. Caffeine can accumulate in individuals with severe liver disease, increasing its half-life. A 2011 review found that increased caffeine intake was associated with a variation in two genes that increase the rate of caffeine catabolism. Subjects who had this mutation on both chromosomes consumed 40 mg more caffeine per day than others. This is presumably due to the need for a higher intake to achieve a comparable desired effect, not that the gene led to a disposition for greater incentive of habituation. == Chemistry == Pure anhydrous caffeine is a bitter-tasting, white, odorless powder with a melting point of 235–238 °C. Caffeine is moderately soluble in water at room temperature (2 g/100 mL), but quickly soluble in boiling water (66 g/100 mL). It is also moderately soluble in ethanol (1.5 g/100 mL). It is weakly basic (pKa of conjugate acid = ~0.6) requiring strong acid to protonate it. Caffeine does not contain any stereogenic centers and hence is classified as an achiral molecule. The xanthine core of caffeine contains two fused rings, a pyrimidinedione and imidazole. The pyrimidinedione in turn contains two amide functional groups that exist predominantly in a zwitterionic resonance the location from which the nitrogen atoms are double bonded to their adjacent amide carbons atoms. Hence all six of the atoms within the pyrimidinedione ring system are sp2 hybridized and planar. The imidazole ring also has a resonance. Therefore, the fused 5,6 ring core of caffeine contains a total of ten pi electrons and hence according to Hückel's rule is aromatic. === Synthesis === The biosynthesis of caffeine is an example of convergent evolution among different species. Caffeine may be synthesized in the lab starting with 1,3-dimethylurea and malonic acid. Production of synthesized caffeine largely takes place in pharmaceutical plants in China. Synthetic and natural caffeine are chemically identical and nearly indistinguishable. The primary distinction is that synthetic caffeine is manufactured from urea and chloroacetic acid, while natural caffeine is extracted from plant sources, a process known as decaffeination. Despite the different production methods, the final product and its effects on the body are identical. Research on synthetic caffeine supports that it has the same stimulating effects on the body as natural caffeine. And although many claim that natural caffeine is absorbed slower and therefore leads to a gentler caffeine crash, there is little scientific evidence supporting the notion. === Decaffeination === Germany, the birthplace of decaffeinated coffee, is home to several decaffeination plants, including the world's largest, Coffein Compagnie. Over half of the decaf coffee sold in the U.S. first travels from the tropics to Germany for caffeine removal before making its way to American consumers. Extraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce caffeine and decaffeinated coffee, can be performed using various solvents. Following are main methods: Water extraction: Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through activated charcoal, which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction: Supercritical carbon dioxide is an excellent nonpolar solvent for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: CO2 is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1 °C and pressures above 73 atm. Under these conditions, CO2 is in a ""supercritical"" state: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden CO2 is then sprayed with high-pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by charcoal adsorption (as above) or by distillation, recrystallization, or reverse osmosis. Extraction by organic solvents: Certain organic solvents such as ethyl acetate present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds. ""Decaffeinated"" coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases – some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10 mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85 mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee. === Detection in body fluids === Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10 mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36 mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15 mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse. === Analogs === Some analog substances have been created which mimic caffeine's properties with either function or structure or both. Of the latter group are the xanthines DMPX and 8-chlorotheophylline, which is an ingredient in dramamine. Members of a class of nitrogen substituted xanthines are often proposed as potential alternatives to caffeine. Many other xanthine analogues constituting the adenosine receptor antagonist class have also been elucidated. Some other caffeine analogs: Dipropylcyclopentylxanthine 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine 8-Phenyltheophylline === Precipitation of tannins === Caffeine, as do other alkaloids such as cinchonine, quinine or strychnine, precipitates polyphenols and tannins. This property can be used in a quantitation method. == Natural occurrence == Around thirty plant species are known to contain caffeine. Common sources are the ""beans"" (seeds) of the two cultivated coffee plants, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora (the quantity varies, but 1.3% is a typical value); and of the cocoa plant, Theobroma cacao; the leaves of the tea plant; and kola nuts. Other sources include the leaves of yaupon holly, South American holly yerba mate, and Amazonian holly guayusa; and seeds from Amazonian maple guarana berries. Temperate climates around the world have produced unrelated caffeine-containing plants. Caffeine in plants acts as a natural pesticide: it can paralyze and kill predator insects feeding on the plant. High caffeine levels are found in coffee seedlings when they are developing foliage and lack mechanical protection. In addition, high caffeine levels are found in the surrounding soil of coffee seedlings, which inhibits seed germination of nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving seedlings with the highest caffeine levels fewer competitors for existing resources for survival. Caffeine is stored in tea leaves in two places. Firstly, in the cell vacuoles where it is complexed with polyphenols. This caffeine probably is released into the mouth parts of insects, to discourage herbivory. Secondly, around the vascular bundles, where it probably inhibits pathogenic fungi from entering and colonizing the vascular bundles. Caffeine in nectar may improve the reproductive success of the pollen producing plants by enhancing the reward memory of pollinators such as honey bees. The differing perceptions in the effects of ingesting beverages made from various plants containing caffeine could be explained by the fact that these beverages also contain varying mixtures of other methylxanthine alkaloids, including the cardiac stimulants theophylline and theobromine, and polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine. == Products == Products containing caffeine include coffee, tea, soft drinks (""colas""), energy drinks, other beverages, chocolate, caffeine tablets, other oral products, and inhalation products. According to a 2020 study in the United States, coffee is the major source of caffeine intake in middle-aged adults, while soft drinks and tea are the major sources in adolescents. Energy drinks are more commonly consumed as a source of caffeine in adolescents as compared to adults. === Beverages === ==== Coffee ==== The world's primary source of caffeine is the coffee ""bean"" (the seed of the coffee plant), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of coffee bean and the method of preparation used; even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety espresso, to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of drip coffee. Arabica coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the robusta variety. In general, dark-roast coffee has slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces caffeine content of the bean by a small amount. ==== Tea ==== Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since less of the product is used as compared to an equivalent serving of coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, teas contain varying amounts of caffeine. Tea contains small amounts of theobromine and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese green tea, gyokuro, for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like lapsang souchong, which has minimal caffeine content. ==== Soft drinks and energy drinks ==== Caffeine is also a common ingredient of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce (350 mL) serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a primary ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient. ==== Other beverages ==== Maté is a drink popular in many parts of South America. Its preparation consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly yerba mate, pouring hot but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves. Guaraná is a soft drink originating in Brazil made from the seeds of the Guaraná fruit. The leaves of Ilex guayusa, the Ecuadorian holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a guayusa tea. The leaves of Ilex vomitoria, the yaupon holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a yaupon tea. Commercially prepared coffee-flavoured milk beverages are popular in Australia. Examples include Oak's Ice Coffee and Farmers Union Iced Coffee. The amount of caffeine in these beverages can vary widely. Caffeine concentrations can differ significantly from the manufacturer's claims. === Cacao solids === Cocoa solids (derived from cocoa bean) contain 230 mg caffeine per 100 g. The caffeine content varies between cocoa bean strains. Caffeine content mg/g (sorted by lowest caffeine content): Forastero (defatted): 1.3 mg/g Nacional (defatted): 2.4 mg/g Trinitario (defatted): 6.3/g Criollo (defatted): 11.3 mg/g ==== Chocolate ==== Caffeine per 100 g: Dark chocolate, 70-85% cacao solids: 80 mg Dark chocolate, 60-69% cacao solids: 86 mg Dark chocolate, 45- 59% cacao solids: 43 mg Milk chocolate: 20 mg The stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine. === Tablets === Tablets offer several advantages over coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages, including convenience, known dosage, and avoidance of concomitant intake of sugar, acids, and fluids. The use of caffeine in this form is said to improve mental alertness. These tablets are commonly used by students studying for their exams and by people who work or drive for long hours. === Other oral products === One U.S. company is marketing oral dissolvable caffeine strips. Another intake route is SpazzStick, a caffeinated lip balm. Alert Energy Caffeine Gum was introduced in the United States in 2013, but was voluntarily withdrawn after an announcement of an investigation by the FDA of the health effects of added caffeine in foods. === Inhalants === Similar to an e-cigarette, a caffeine inhaler may be used to deliver caffeine or a stimulant like guarana by vaping. In 2012, the FDA sent a warning letter to one of the companies marketing an inhaler, expressing concerns for the lack of safety information available about inhaled caffeine. === Combinations with other drugs === Some beverages combine alcohol with caffeine to create a caffeinated alcoholic drink. The stimulant effects of caffeine may mask the depressant effects of alcohol, potentially reducing the user's awareness of their level of intoxication. Such beverages have been the subject of bans due to safety concerns. In particular, the United States Food and Drug Administration has classified caffeine added to malt liquor beverages as an ""unsafe food additive"". Ya ba contains a combination of methamphetamine and caffeine. Painkillers such as propyphenazone/paracetamol/caffeine combine caffeine with an analgesic. == History == === Discovery and spread of use === According to Chinese legend, the Chinese emperor Shennong, reputed to have reigned in about 3000 BCE, inadvertently discovered tea when he noted that when certain leaves fell into boiling water, a fragrant and restorative drink resulted. Shennong is also mentioned in Lu Yu's Cha Jing, a famous early work on the subject of tea. The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee plant appears in the middle of the fifteenth century, in the Sufi monasteries of the Yemen in southern Arabia. From Mokha, coffee spread to Egypt and North Africa, and by the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia and Turkey. From the Middle East, coffee drinking spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, and coffee plants were transported by the Dutch to the East Indies and to the Americas. Kola nut use appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many West African cultures, in both private and social settings, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs. The earliest evidence of cocoa bean use comes from residue found in an ancient Mayan pot dated to 600 BCE. Also, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called xocolatl, often seasoned with vanilla, chile pepper, and achiote. Xocolatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, and cocoa beans were often used as currency. Xocolatl was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards, and became a popular beverage by 1700. The Spaniards also introduced the cacao tree into the West Indies and the Philippines. The leaves and stems of the yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) were used by Native Americans to brew a tea called asi or the ""black drink"". Archaeologists have found evidence of this use far into antiquity, possibly dating to Late Archaic times. === Chemical identification, isolation, and synthesis === In 1819, the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time; he called it ""Kaffebase"" (i.e., a base that exists in coffee). In 1821, caffeine was isolated both by the French chemist Pierre Jean Robiquet and by another pair of French chemists, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou, according to Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in his yearly journal. Furthermore, Berzelius stated that the French chemists had made their discoveries independently of any knowledge of Runge's or each other's work. However, Berzelius later acknowledged Runge's priority in the extraction of caffeine, stating: ""However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his Phytochemical Discoveries, 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name Caffeebase a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris."" Pelletier's article on caffeine was the first to use the term in print (in the French form Caféine from the French word for coffee: café). It corroborates Berzelius's account: Caffeine, noun (feminine). Crystallizable substance discovered in coffee in 1821 by Mr. Robiquet. During the same period – while they were searching for quinine in coffee because coffee is considered by several doctors to be a medicine that reduces fevers and because coffee belongs to the same family as the cinchona [quinine] tree – on their part, Messrs. Pelletier and Caventou obtained caffeine; but because their research had a different goal and because their research had not been finished, they left priority on this subject to Mr. Robiquet. We do not know why Mr. Robiquet has not published the analysis of coffee which he read to the Pharmacy Society. Its publication would have allowed us to make caffeine better known and give us accurate ideas of coffee's composition ... Robiquet was one of the first to isolate and describe the properties of pure caffeine, whereas Pelletier was the first to perform an elemental analysis. In 1827, M. Oudry isolated ""théine"" from tea, but in 1838 it was proved by Mulder and by Carl Jobst that theine was actually the same as caffeine. In 1895, German chemist Hermann Emil Fischer (1852–1919) first synthesized caffeine from its chemical components (i.e. a ""total synthesis""), and two years later, he also derived the structural formula of the compound. This was part of the work for which Fischer was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902. === Historic regulations === Because it was recognized that coffee contained some compound that acted as a stimulant, first coffee and later also caffeine has sometimes been subject to regulation. For example, in the 16th century Islamists in Mecca and in the Ottoman Empire made coffee illegal for some classes. Charles II of England tried to ban it in 1676, Frederick II of Prussia banned it in 1777, and coffee was banned in Sweden at various times between 1756 and 1823. In 1911, caffeine became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares, when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of Coca-Cola syrup in Chattanooga, Tennessee, alleging the caffeine in its drink was ""injurious to health"". Although the Supreme Court later ruled in favor of Coca-Cola in United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola, two bills were introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1912 to amend the Pure Food and Drug Act, adding caffeine to the list of ""habit-forming"" and ""deleterious"" substances, which must be listed on a product's label. == Society and culture == === Regulations === ==== United States ==== The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers safe beverages containing less than 0.02% caffeine; but caffeine powder, which is sold as a dietary supplement, is unregulated. It is a regulatory requirement that the label of most prepackaged foods must declare a list of ingredients, including food additives such as caffeine, in descending order of proportion. However, there is no regulatory provision for mandatory quantitative labeling of caffeine, (e.g., milligrams caffeine per stated serving size). There are a number of food ingredients that naturally contain caffeine. These ingredients must appear in food ingredient lists. However, as is the case for ""food additive caffeine"", there is no requirement to identify the quantitative amount of caffeine in composite foods containing ingredients that are natural sources of caffeine. While coffee or chocolate are broadly recognized as caffeine sources, some ingredients (e.g., guarana, yerba maté) are likely less recognized as caffeine sources. For these natural sources of caffeine, there is no regulatory provision requiring that a food label identify the presence of caffeine nor state the amount of caffeine present in the food. The FDA guidance was updated in 2018. === Consumption === Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000 tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance. The consumption of caffeine has remained stable between 1997 and 2015. Coffee, tea and soft drinks are the most common caffeine sources, with energy drinks contributing little to the total caffeine intake across all age groups. === Religions === The Seventh-day Adventist Church asked for its members to ""abstain from caffeinated drinks"", but has removed this from baptismal vows (while still recommending abstention as policy). Some from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: ""... the Church revelation spelling out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine. The Church's health guidelines prohibit alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and 'hot drinks' – taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee."" Gaudiya Vaishnavas generally also abstain from caffeine, because they believe it clouds the mind and overstimulates the senses. To be initiated under a guru, one must have had no caffeine, alcohol, nicotine or other drugs, for at least a year. Caffeinated beverages are widely consumed by Muslims. In the 16th century, some Muslim authorities made unsuccessful attempts to ban them as forbidden ""intoxicating beverages"" under Islamic dietary laws. == Other organisms == The bacteria Pseudomonas putida CBB5 can live on pure caffeine and can cleave caffeine into carbon dioxide and ammonia. Caffeine is toxic to birds and to dogs and cats, and has a pronounced adverse effect on mollusks, various insects, and spiders. This is at least partly due to a poor ability to metabolize the compound, causing higher levels for a given dose per unit weight. Caffeine has also been found to enhance the reward memory of honey bees. == Research == Caffeine has been used to double chromosomes in haploid wheat. == See also == Adderall Amphetamine Cocaine Health effects of coffee Health effects of tea List of chemical compounds in coffee Low caffeine coffee Methylliberine Nootropic Theobromine Theophylline Wakefulness-promoting agent == References == == Bibliography == == External links == GMD MS Spectrum Caffeine: ChemSub Online Caffeine at The Periodic Table of Videos (University of Nottingham)",Methyltheobromine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.3103491961956024), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.12722362577915192), ('OG', -1.2664456789934775e-06), ('ENO', -4.246537173457909e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -2.47495681833243e-05), (' FOOD', -0.00018089536752086133)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3563462197780609), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00728604756295681)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0001234428636962548)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/methyltheobromine,https://periodical.knowde.com/caffeine/,https://www.glpbio.com/sp/caffeine.html ', [])"
4579,"('Acetaminophen', 'Paracetamol', 'N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide', 'Tylenol', 'Panadol')",Medical,"Paracetamol, or acetaminophen, is a non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic agent used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain. It is a widely available over-the-counter drug sold under various brand names, including Tylenol and Panadol. Paracetamol relieves pain in both acute mild migraine and episodic tension headache. At a standard dose, paracetamol slightly reduces fever; it is inferior to ibuprofen in that respect, and the benefits of its use for fever are unclear, particularly in the context of fever of viral origins. The aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination also helps with both conditions where the pain is mild and is recommended as a first-line treatment for them. Paracetamol is effective for post-surgical pain, but it is inferior to ibuprofen. The paracetamol/ibuprofen combination provides further increase in potency and is superior to either drug alone. The pain relief paracetamol provides in osteoarthritis is small and clinically insignificant. The evidence in its favor for the use in low back pain, cancer pain, and neuropathic pain is insufficient. In the short term, paracetamol is safe and effective when used as directed. Short term adverse effects are uncommon and similar to ibuprofen, but paracetamol is typically safer than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for long-term use. Paracetamol is also often used in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Chronic consumption of paracetamol may result in a drop in hemoglobin level, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding, and abnormal liver function tests. The recommended maximum daily dose for an adult is three to four grams. Higher doses may lead to toxicity, including liver failure. Paracetamol poisoning is the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the Western world, and accounts for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Paracetamol was first made in 1878 by Harmon Northrop Morse or possibly in 1852 by Charles Frédéric Gerhardt. It is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever in both the United States and Europe. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Paracetamol is available as a generic medication, with brand names including Tylenol and Panadol among others. In 2022, it was the 114th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Fever === Paracetamol is used for reducing fever. However, there has been a lack of research on its antipyretic properties, particularly in adults, and thus its benefits are unclear. As a result, it has been described as over-prescribed for this application. In addition, low-quality clinical data indicates that when used for the common cold, paracetamol may relieve a stuffed or runny nose, but not other cold symptoms such as sore throat, malaise, sneezing, or cough. For people in critical care, paracetamol decreases body temperature by only 0.2–0.3 °C more than control interventions and has no effect on their mortality. It did not change the outcome in febrile patients with stroke. The results are contradictory for paracetamol use in sepsis: higher mortality, lower mortality, and no change in mortality were all reported. Paracetamol offered no benefit in the treatment of dengue fever and was accompanied by a higher rate of liver enzyme elevation: a sign of potential liver damage. Overall, there is no support for a routine administration of antipyretic drugs, including paracetamol, to hospitalized patients with fever and infection. The efficacy of paracetamol in children with fever is unclear. Paracetamol should not be used solely to reduce body temperature; however, it may be considered for children with fever who appear distressed. It does not prevent febrile seizures. It appears that 0.2 °C decrease of the body temperature in children after a standard dose of paracetamol is of questionable value, particularly in emergencies. Based on this, some physicians advocate using higher doses that may decrease the temperature by as much as 0.7 °C. Meta-analyses showed that paracetamol is less effective than ibuprofen in children (marginally less effective, according to another analysis), including children younger than 2 years old, with equivalent safety. Exacerbation of asthma occurs with similar frequency for both medications. Giving paracetamol and ibuprofen together at the same time to children under 5 is not recommended; however, doses may be alternated if required. === Pain === Paracetamol is used for the relief of mild to moderate pain such as headache, muscle aches, minor arthritis pain, toothache as well as pain caused by cold, flu, sprains, and dysmenorrhea. It is recommended, in particular, for acute mild to moderate pain, since the evidence for the treatment of chronic pain is insufficient. ==== Musculoskeletal pain ==== The benefits of paracetamol in musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis and backache, are uncertain. It appears to provide only small and not clinically important benefits in osteoarthritis. American College of Rheumatology and Arthritis Foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis notes that the effect size in clinical trials of paracetamol has been very small, which suggests that for most individuals it is ineffective. The guideline conditionally recommends paracetamol for short-term and episodic use to those who do not tolerate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For people taking it regularly, monitoring for liver toxicity is required. Essentially the same recommendation was issued by EULAR for hand osteoarthritis. Similarly, the ESCEO algorithm for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis recommends limiting the use of paracetamol to short-term rescue analgesia only. Paracetamol is ineffective for acute low back pain. No randomized clinical trials evaluated its use for chronic or radicular back pain, and the evidence in favor of paracetamol is lacking. ==== Headaches ==== Paracetamol is effective for acute migraine: 39 % of people experience pain relief at one hour compared with 20 % in the control group. The aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination also ""has strong evidence of effectiveness and can be used as a first-line treatment for migraine"". Paracetamol on its own only slightly alleviates episodic tension headache in those who have them frequently. However, the aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination is superior to both paracetamol alone and placebo and offers meaningful relief of tension headache: two hours after administering the medication, 29 % of those who took the combination were pain-free as compared with 21 % on paracetamol and 18 % on placebo. The German, Austrian, and Swiss headache societies and the German Society of Neurology recommend this combination as a ""highlighted"" one for self-medication of tension headache, with paracetamol/caffeine combination being a ""remedy of first choice"", and paracetamol a ""remedy of second choice"". ==== Dental and other post-surgical pain ==== Pain after a dental surgery provides a reliable model for the action of analgesics on other kinds of acute pain. For the relief of such pain, paracetamol is inferior to ibuprofen. Full therapeutic doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac are clearly more efficacious than the paracetamol/codeine combination which is frequently prescribed for dental pain. The combinations of paracetamol and NSAIDs ibuprofen or diclofenac are promising, possibly offering better pain control than either paracetamol or the NSAID alone. Additionally, the paracetamol/ibuprofen combination may be superior to paracetamol/codeine and ibuprofen/codeine combinations. A meta-analysis of general post-surgical pain, which included dental and other surgery, showed the paracetamol/codeine combination to be more effective than paracetamol alone: it provided significant pain relief to as much as 53 % of the participants, while the placebo helped only 7 %. ==== Other pain ==== Paracetamol fails to relieve procedural pain in newborn babies. For perineal pain postpartum paracetamol appears to be less effective than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The studies to support or refute the use of paracetamol for cancer pain and neuropathic pain are lacking. There is limited evidence in favor of the use of the intravenous form of paracetamol for acute pain control in the emergency department. The combination of paracetamol with caffeine is superior to paracetamol alone for the treatment of acute pain. === Patent ductus arteriosus === Paracetamol helps ductal closure in patent ductus arteriosus. It is as effective for this purpose as ibuprofen or indomethacin, but results in less frequent gastrointestinal bleeding than ibuprofen. Its use for extremely low birth weight and gestational age infants however requires further study. == Adverse effects == Gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea and abdominal pain are extremely uncommon, and their frequency is nothing like that of ibuprofen. Increase in risk-taking behavior is possible. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the drug may cause rare and possibly fatal skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, Rechallenge tests and an analysis of American but not French pharmacovigilance databases indicated a risk of these reactions. In clinical trials for osteoarthritis, the number of participants reporting adverse effects was similar for those on paracetamol and on placebo. However, the abnormal liver function tests (meaning there was some inflammation or damage to the liver) were almost four times more likely in those on paracetamol, although the clinical importance of this effect is uncertain. After 13 weeks of paracetamol therapy for knee pain, a drop in hemoglobin level indicating gastrointestinal bleeding was observed in 20 % of participants, this rate being similar to the ibuprofen group. Due to the absence of controlled studies, most of the information about the long-term safety of paracetamol comes from observational studies. These indicate a consistent pattern of increased mortality as well as cardiovascular (stroke, myocardial infarction), gastrointestinal (ulcers, bleeding) and renal adverse effects with increased dose of paracetamol. Use of paracetamol is associated with 1.9 times higher risk of peptic ulcer. Those who take it regularly at a higher dose (more than 2–3 g daily) are at much higher risk (3.6–3.7 times) of gastrointestinal bleeding and other bleeding events. Meta-analyses suggest that paracetamol may increase the risk of kidney impairment by 23 % and kidney cancer by 28 %. Paracetamol slightly but significantly increases blood pressure and heart rate. A 2022 double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study has provided evidence that daily, high-dose use (4 g per day) of paracetamol increases systolic BP. A review of available research has suggested that increase in systolic blood pressure and increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with chronic paracetamol use shows a degree of dose dependence. The association between paracetamol use and asthma in children has been a matter of controversy. However, the most recent research suggests that there is no association, and that the frequency of asthma exacerbations in children after paracetamol is the same as after another frequently used pain killer, ibuprofen. In recommended doses, the side effects of paracetamol are mild to non-existent. In contrast to aspirin, it is not a blood thinner (and thus may be used in patients where bleeding is a concern), and it does not cause gastric irritation. Compared to Ibuprofen—which can have adverse effects that include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain—paracetamol is well tolerated with fewer side effects. Prolonged daily use may cause kidney or liver damage. Paracetamol is metabolized by the liver and is hepatotoxic; side effects may be more likely in chronic alcoholics or patients with liver damage. Until 2010 paracetamol was believed safe in pregnancy however, in a study published in October 2010 it has been linked to infertility in the adult life of the unborn. Like NSAIDs and unlike opioid analgesics, paracetamol has not been found to cause euphoria or alter mood. One recent research study showed evidence that paracetamol can ease psychological pain, but more studies are needed to draw a stronger conclusion. Unlike aspirin, it is safe for children, as paracetamol is not associated with a risk of Reye syndrome in children with viral illnesses. Chronic users of paracetamol may have a higher risk of developing blood cancer. === Use in pregnancy === Paracetamol safety in pregnancy has been under increased scrutiny. There appears to be no link between paracetamol use in the first trimester and adverse pregnancy outcomes or birth defects. However, indications exist of a possible increase in the risk of asthma and developmental and reproductive disorders in the offspring of women with prolonged use of paracetamol during pregnancy. Paracetamol use by the mother during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma, but so are the maternal infections for which paracetamol may be used, and separating these influences is difficult. Paracetamol, in a small-scale meta-analysis was also associated with a 20–30 % increase in autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorder, with the association being lower in a meta-analysis where a larger demographic was used, but it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship and whether there was potential bias in the findings. There is also an argument that the large number, consistency, and robust designs of the studies provide strong evidence in favor of paracetamol causing the increased risk of these neurodevelopmental disorders. In animal experiments, paracetamol disrupts fetal testosterone production, and several epidemiological studies linked cryptorchidism with mother's paracetamol use for more than two weeks in the second trimester. On the other hand, several studies did not find any association. The consensus recommendation appears to be to avoid prolonged use of paracetamol in pregnancy and use it only when necessary, at the lowest effective dosage, and for the shortest time. In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester. == Overdose == Overdose of paracetamol is caused by taking more than the recommended maximum daily dose of paracetamol for healthy adults (three or four grams), and can cause potentially fatal liver damage. A single dose should not exceed 1000 mg, doses should be taken no sooner than four hours apart, and no more than four doses (4000 mg) in 24 hours. While a majority of adult overdoses are linked to suicide attempts, many cases are accidental, often due to the use of more than one paracetamol-containing product over an extended period. Paracetamol toxicity has become the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the United States by 2003, and as of 2005, paracetamol accounted for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. As of 2004, paracetamol overdose resulted in more calls to poison control centers in the U.S. than overdose of any other pharmacological substance. According to the FDA, in the United States, ""56,000 emergency room visits, 26,000 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths per year [were] related to acetaminophen-associated overdoses during the 1990s. Within these estimates, unintentional acetaminophen overdose accounted for nearly 25% of the emergency department visits, 10% of the hospitalizations, and 25% of the deaths."" Overdoses are frequently related to high-dose recreational use of prescription opioids, as these opioids are most often combined with paracetamol. The overdose risk may be heightened by frequent consumption of alcohol. Untreated paracetamol overdose results in a lengthy, painful illness. Signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity may initially be absent or non-specific symptoms. The first symptoms of overdose usually begin several hours after ingestion, with nausea, vomiting, sweating, and pain as acute liver failure starts. People who take overdoses of paracetamol do not fall asleep or lose consciousness, although most people who attempt suicide with paracetamol wrongly believe that they will be rendered unconscious by the drug. Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replenishing glutathione. Activated charcoal can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the person comes to the hospital soon after the overdose. While the antidote, acetylcysteine (also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC), acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent or at least decrease the possible damage to the liver; a liver transplant is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for people with risk factors, and one for those without), but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent, and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Toxicity of paracetamol is due to its quinone metabolite NAPQI and NAC also helps in neutralizing it. Kidney failure is also a possible side effect. == Interactions == Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide accelerate gastric emptying, shorten time (tmax) to paracetamol peak blood plasma concentration (Cmax), and increase Cmax. Medications slowing gastric emptying such as propantheline and morphine lengthen tmax and decrease Cmax. The interaction with morphine may result in patients failing to achieve the therapeutic concentration of paracetamol; the clinical significance of interactions with metoclopramide and propantheline is unclear. There have been suspicions that cytochrome inducers may enhance the toxic pathway of paracetamol metabolism to NAPQI (see Paracetamol#Pharmacokinetics). By and large, these suspicions have not been confirmed. Out of the inducers studied, the evidence of potentially increased liver toxicity in paracetamol overdose exists for phenobarbital, primidone, isoniazid, and possibly St John's wort. On the other hand, the anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid cuts the formation of NAPQI by 70%. Ranitidine increased paracetamol area under the curve (AUC) 1.6-fold. AUC increases are also observed with nizatidine and cisapride. The effect is explained by these drugs inhibiting glucuronidation of paracetamol. Paracetamol raises plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol by 22 % by inhibiting its sulfation. Paracetamol increases INR during warfarin therapy and should be limited to no more than 2 g per week. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Paracetamol appears to exert its effects through two mechanisms: the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) and actions of its metabolite N-arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404). Supporting the first mechanism, pharmacologically and in its side effects, paracetamol is close to classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that act by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes and especially similar to selective COX-2 inhibitors. Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by reducing the active form of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This occurs only when the concentration of arachidonic acid and peroxides is low. Under these conditions, COX-2 is the predominant form of cyclooxygenase, which explains the apparent COX-2 selectivity of paracetamol. Under the conditions of inflammation, the concentration of peroxides is high, which counteracts the reducing effect of paracetamol. Accordingly, the anti-inflammatory action of paracetamol is slight. The anti-inflammatory action of paracetamol (via COX inhibition) has also been found to primarily target the central nervous system and not peripheral areas of the body, explaining the lack of side effects associated with conventional NSAIDs such as gastric bleeding. The second mechanism centers on the paracetamol metabolite AM404. This metabolite has been detected in the brains of animals and cerebrospinal fluid of humans taking paracetamol. It is formed in the brain from another paracetamol metabolite 4-aminophenol by action of fatty acid amide hydrolase. AM404 is a weak agonist of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid transporter, and a potent activator of TRPV1 receptor. This and other research indicate that the endocannabinoid system and TRPV1 may play an important role in the analgesic effect of paracetamol. In 2018, Suemaru et al. found that, in mice, paracetamol exerts an anticonvulsant effect by activation of the TRPV1 receptors and a decrease in neuronal excitability by hyperpolarization of neurons. The exact mechanism of the anticonvulsant effect of paracetamol is not clear. According to Suemaru et al., acetaminophen and its active metabolite AM404 show a dose-dependent anticonvulsant activity against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice. === Pharmacokinetics === After being taken by mouth, paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine, while absorption from the stomach is negligible. Thus, the rate of absorption depends on stomach emptying. Food slows the stomach's emptying and absorption, but the total amount absorbed stays the same. In the same subjects, the peak plasma concentration of paracetamol was reached after 20 minutes when fasting versus 90 minutes when fed. High carbohydrate (but not high protein or high fat) food decreases paracetamol peak plasma concentration by four times. Even in the fasting state, the rate of absorption of paracetamol is variable and depends on the formulation, with maximum plasma concentration being reached after 20 minutes to 1.5 hours. Paracetamol's bioavailability is dose-dependent: it increases from 63 % for 500 mg dose to 89 % for 1000 mg dose. Its plasma terminal elimination half-life is 1.9–2.5 hours, and volume of distribution is roughly 50 L. Protein binding is negligible, except under the conditions of overdose, when it may reach 15–21 %. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 μg/mL (200 μmol/L). After 4 hours, the concentration is usually less than 10 μg/mL (66 μmol/L). Paracetamol is metabolized primarily in the liver, mainly by glucuronidation and sulfation, and the products are then eliminated in the urine (see the Scheme on the right). Only 2–5 % of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Glucuronidation by UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 accounts for 50–70 % of the drug metabolism. Additional 25–35 % of paracetamol is converted to sulfate by sulfation enzymes SULT1A1, SULT1A3, and SULT1E1. A minor metabolic pathway (5–15 %) of oxidation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly by CYP2E1, forms a toxic metabolite known as NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine). NAPQI is responsible for the liver toxicity of paracetamol. At usual doses of paracetamol, NAPQI is quickly detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. The non-toxic conjugate APAP-GSH is taken up in the bile and further degraded to mercapturic and cysteine conjugates that are excreted in the urine. In overdose, glutathione is depleted by a large amount of formed NAPQI, and NAPQI binds to mitochondria proteins of the liver cells causing oxidative stress and toxicity. Yet another minor but important direction of metabolism is deacetylation of 1–2 % of paracetamol to form p-aminophenol. p-Aminophenol is then converted in the brain by fatty acid amide hydrolase into AM404, a compound that may be partially responsible for the analgesic action of paracetamol. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === ==== Classical methods ==== The classical methods for the production of paracetamol involve the acetylation of 4-aminophenol with acetic anhydride as the last step. They differ in how 4-aminophenol is prepared. In one method, nitration of phenol with nitric acid affords 4-nitrophenol, which is reduced to 4-aminophenol by hydrogenation over Raney nickel. In another method, nitrobenzene is reduced electrolytically giving 4-aminophenol directly. Additionally, 4-nitrophenol can be selectively reduced by Tin(II) Chloride in absolute ethanol or ethyl acetate to produce a 91 % yield of 4-aminophenol. ==== Celanese synthesis ==== An alternative industrial synthesis developed at Celanese involves firstly direct acylation of phenol with acetic anhydride in the presence of hydrogen fluoride to a ketone, then the conversion of the ketone with hydroxylamine to a ketoxime, and finally the acid-catalyzed Beckmann rearrangement of the cetoxime to the para-acetylaminophenol product. === Reactions === 4-Aminophenol may be obtained by the amide hydrolysis of paracetamol. This reaction is also used to determine paracetamol in urine samples: After hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid, 4-aminophenol reacts in ammonia solution with a phenol derivate, e.g. salicylic acid, to form an indophenol dye under oxidization by air. == History == Acetanilide was the first aniline derivative serendipitously found to possess analgesic as well as antipyretic properties, and was quickly introduced into medical practice under the name of Antifebrin by Cahn & Hepp in 1886. But its unacceptable toxic effects—the most alarming being cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia, an increase of hemoglobin in its ferric [Fe3+] state, called methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen, and thus decreases overall carriage of oxygen to tissue—prompted the search for less toxic aniline derivatives. Some reports state that Cahn & Hepp or a French chemist called Charles Gerhardt first synthesized paracetamol in 1852. Harmon Northrop Morse synthesized paracetamol at Johns Hopkins University via the reduction of p-nitrophenol with tin in glacial acetic acid in 1877, but it was not until 1887 that clinical pharmacologist Joseph von Mering tried paracetamol on humans. In 1893, von Mering published a paper reporting on the clinical results of paracetamol with phenacetin, another aniline derivative. Von Mering claimed that, unlike phenacetin, paracetamol had a slight tendency to produce methemoglobinemia. Paracetamol was then quickly discarded in favor of phenacetin. The sales of phenacetin established Bayer as a leading pharmaceutical company. Von Mering's claims remained essentially unchallenged for half a century until two teams of researchers from the United States analyzed the metabolism of acetanilide and phenacetin. In 1947, David Lester and Leon Greenberg found strong evidence that paracetamol was a major metabolite of acetanilide in human blood, and in a subsequent study they reported that large doses of paracetamol given to albino rats did not cause methemoglobinemia. In 1948, Bernard Brodie, Julius Axelrod and Frederick Flinn confirmed that paracetamol was the major metabolite of acetanilide in humans, and established that it was just as efficacious an analgesic as its precursor. They also suggested that methemoglobinemia is produced in humans mainly by another metabolite, phenylhydroxylamine. A follow-up paper by Brodie and Axelrod in 1949 established that phenacetin was also metabolized to paracetamol. This led to a ""rediscovery"" of paracetamol. Paracetamol was first marketed in the United States in 1950 under the name Trigesic, a combination of paracetamol, aspirin, and caffeine. Reports in 1951 of three users stricken with the blood disease agranulocytosis led to its removal from the marketplace, and it took several years until it became clear that the disease was unconnected. The following year, 1952, paracetamol returned to the U.S. market as a prescription drug. In the United Kingdom, marketing of paracetamol began in 1956 by Sterling-Winthrop Co. as Panadol, available only by prescription, and promoted as preferable to aspirin since it was safe for children and people with ulcers. In 1963, paracetamol was added to the British Pharmacopoeia, and has gained popularity since then as an analgesic agent with few side-effects and little interaction with other pharmaceutical agents. Concerns about paracetamol's safety delayed its widespread acceptance until the 1970s, but in the 1980s paracetamol sales exceeded those of aspirin in many countries, including the United Kingdom. This was accompanied by the commercial demise of phenacetin, blamed as the cause of analgesic nephropathy and hematological toxicity. Available in the U.S. without a prescription since 1955 (1960, according to another source), paracetamol has become a common household drug. In 1988, Sterling Winthrop was acquired by Eastman Kodak which sold the over the counter drug rights to SmithKline Beecham in 1994. In June 2009, an FDA advisory committee recommended that new restrictions be placed on paracetamol use in the United States to help protect people from the potential toxic effects. The maximum single adult dosage would be decreased from 1000 mg to 650 mg, while combinations of paracetamol and other products would be prohibited. Committee members were particularly concerned by the fact that the then-present maximum dosages of paracetamol had been shown to produce alterations in liver function. In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of prescription combination products containing paracetamol to limit its amount to no more than 325 mg per tablet or capsule and began requiring manufacturers to update the labels of all prescription combination paracetamol products to warn of the potential risk of severe liver damage. Manufacturers had three years to limit the amount of paracetamol in their prescription drug products to 325 mg per dosage unit. In November 2011, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency revised UK dosing of liquid paracetamol for children. In September 2013, ""Use Only as Directed"", an episode of the radio program This American Life highlighted deaths from paracetamol overdose. This report was followed by two reports by ProPublica alleging that the ""FDA has long been aware of studies showing the risks of acetaminophen. So has the maker of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a division of Johnson & Johnson"" and ""McNeil, the maker of Tylenol, ... has repeatedly opposed safety warnings, dosage restrictions and other measures meant to safeguard users of the drug."" == Society and culture == === Naming === Paracetamol is the Australian Approved Name and British Approved Name as well as the international nonproprietary name used by the WHO and in many other countries; acetaminophen is the United States Adopted Name and Japanese Accepted Name and also the name generally used in Canada, Venezuela, Colombia, and Iran. Both paracetamol and acetaminophen are contractions of chemical names for the compound. The word ""paracetamol"" is a shortened form of para-acetylaminophenol, and was coined by Frederick Stearns & Co in 1956, while the word ""acetaminophen"" is a shortened form of N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), which was coined and first marketed by McNeil Laboratories in 1955. The initialism APAP is used by dispensing pharmacists in the United States. === Available forms === Paracetamol is available in oral, suppository, and intravenous forms. Intravenous paracetamol is sold under the brand name Ofirmev in the United States. In some formulations, paracetamol is combined with the opiate codeine, sometimes referred to as co-codamol (BAN) and Panadeine in Australia. In the U.S., this combination is available only by prescription. As of 1 February 2018, medications containing codeine also became prescription-only in Australia. Paracetamol is also combined with other opioids such as dihydrocodeine, referred to as co-dydramol (British Approved Name (BAN)), oxycodone or hydrocodone. Another very commonly used analgesic combination includes paracetamol in combination with propoxyphene napsylate. A combination of paracetamol, codeine, and the doxylamine succinate is also available. Paracetamol is sometimes combined with phenylephrine hydrochloride. Sometimes a third active ingredient, such as ascorbic acid, caffeine, chlorpheniramine maleate, or guaifenesin is added to this combination. == Research == Claims that paracetamol is an effective analgesic medication to treat symptoms of COVID-19 were found to be unsubstantiated. == Veterinary use == === Cats === Paracetamol is extremely toxic to cats, which lack the necessary UGT1A6 enzyme to detoxify it. Initial symptoms include vomiting, salivation, and discoloration of the tongue and gums. Unlike an overdose in humans, liver damage is rarely the cause of death; instead, methemoglobin formation and the production of Heinz bodies in red blood cells inhibit oxygen transport by the blood, causing asphyxiation (methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia). Treatment of the toxicosis with acetylcysteine is recommended. === Dogs === Paracetamol has been reported to be as effective as aspirin in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in dogs. A paracetamol–codeine product (brand name Pardale-V) licensed for use in dogs is available for purchase under supervision of a vet, pharmacist or other qualified person. It should be administered to dogs only on veterinary advice and with extreme caution. The main effect of toxicity in dogs is liver damage, and GI ulceration has been reported. Acetylcysteine treatment is efficacious in dogs when administered within two hours of paracetamol ingestion. === Snakes === Paracetamol is lethal to snakes and has been suggested as a chemical control program for the invasive brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) in Guam. Doses of 80 mg are inserted into dead mice that are scattered by helicopter as lethal bait to be consumed by the snakes. == Notes == == References == == External links ==",Panadol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.48477507638745e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023272700607776642)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/paracetamol.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=80, start_index=9, title='Paracetamol Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/paracetamol.html?utm_source=openai')])"

4581,"('Flurazepam', 'Dalmane', 'Flurazepamum', 'Flurazepam hcl', 'Insumin')",Medical,"Flurazepam (marketed under the brand names Dalmane and Dalmadorm) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. It produces a metabolite with a long half-life, which may stay in the bloodstream for days. Flurazepam was patented in 1968 and came into medical use the same year. Flurazepam, developed by Roche Pharmaceuticals, was one of the first benzodiazepine hypnotic medications to be marketed. == Medical uses == Flurazepam is officially indicated for mild to moderate insomnia and as such it is used for short-term treatment of patients with mild to moderate insomnia such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Flurazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep, though benzodiazepines with intermediate half-lives such as loprazolam, lormetazepam, and temazepam are also indicated for patients with difficulty maintaining sleep. Flurazepam was temporarily unavailable in the United States when its sole producer, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, discontinued making it in January 2019. In October 2019, the FDA informed pharmacies that they could expect to be resupplied by manufacturers in early to mid December 2019. As of this date, flurazepam is now again available in the United States. == Side effects == The most common adverse effects are dizziness, drowsiness, light-headedness, and ataxia. Flurazepam has abuse potential and should never be used with alcoholic beverages or any other substance that can cause drowsiness. Addictive and possibly fatal results may occur. Flurazepam users should only take this drug strictly as prescribed, and should only be taken directly before the user plans on sleeping a full night. Next day drowsiness is common and may increase during the initial phase of treatment as accumulation occurs until steady-state plasma levels are attained. A 2009 meta-analysis found a 44% higher rate of mild infections, such as pharyngitis or sinusitis, in people taking hypnotic drugs compared to those taking a placebo. In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. === Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal === A review paper found that long-term use of flurazepam is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, rebound insomnia and central nervous system (CNS) related adverse effects. Flurazepam is best used for a short time period and at the lowest possible dose to avoid complications associated with long-term use. Non-pharmacological treatment options however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality. Flurazepam and other benzodiazepines such as fosazepam, and nitrazepam lost some of their effect after seven days administration in psychogeriatric patients. Flurazepam shares cross tolerance with barbiturates and barbiturates can easily be substituted by flurazepam in those who are habituated to barbiturate sedative hypnotics. After discontinuation of flurazepam a rebound effect or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may occur about four days after discontinuation of medication. == Contraindications and special caution == Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. === Elderly === Flurazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including flurazepam, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy in elderly persons. Tolerability in elderly patients, however, is improved marginally in that benzodiazepines have moderately higher risks of falls, memory problems, and disinhibition (""paradoxical agitation"") when compared to non-benzodiazepine sedatives. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Chronic use of sedative-hypnotic drugs for the management of insomnia does not have an evidence base and has been discouraged due to concerns including potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of sedative hypnotics has been determined to be no better than placebo after 3 months of therapy and worse than placebo after 6 months of therapy. == Pharmacology == Flurazepam is a ""classical"" benzodiazepine; some other classical benzodiazepines include diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. Flurazepam generates an active metabolite, N-desalkylflurazepam, with a very long elimination half-life. Flurazepam could be therefore unsuitable as a sleeping medication for some individuals due to next-day sedation; however, this same effect may also provide next-day anxiety relief. Residual 'hangover' effects after nighttime administration of flurazepam, such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions, may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures. Flurazepam is lipophilic, is metabolized hepatically via oxidative pathways. The main pharmacological effect of flurazepam is to increase the effect of GABA at the GABAA receptor via binding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor causing an increase influx of chloride ions into the GABAA neuron. Flurazepam is contraindicated in pregnancy. It is recommended to withdraw flurazepam during breast feeding, as flurazepam is excreted in breast milk. == Misuse == Flurazepam is a drug with potential for misuse. Two types of drug misuse can occur, either recreational misuse where the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long term against medical advice. === Legal status === Flurazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. == See also == Long-term effects of benzodiazepines == References == == External links == Rx-List – Flurazepam Inchem – Flurazepam",Insumin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.5805805921554565), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02382064424455166)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([1mg.com](https://www.1mg.com/otc/insumin-capsule-otc238590?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Insumin Capsule: Buy strip of 10.0 capsules at best price in India | 1mg', type='url_citation', url='https://www.1mg.com/otc/insumin-capsule-otc238590?utm_source=openai')])"
4582,"('Meclomen', 'Sodium meclofenamate', 'Meclonax', 'Movens', 'Meclofenamic acid sodium salt')",Medical,"Meclofenamic acid (used as meclofenamate sodium, brand name Meclomen) is a drug used for joint, muscular pain, arthritis and dysmenorrhea. It is a member of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and was approved by the US FDA in 1980. Like other members of the class, it is a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, preventing the formation of prostaglandins. Scientists led by Claude Winder from Parke-Davis invented meclofenamate sodium in 1964, along with fellow members of the class, mefenamic acid in 1961 and flufenamic acid in 1963.: 718 Patents on the drug expired in 1985: 295 and several generics were introduced in the US, but as of July 2015 only Mylan still sold it. It is not widely used in humans as it has a high rate (30-60%) rate of gastrointestinal side effects.: 310 == Adverse effects == In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. == Use in horses == Meclofenamic acid is sold under the trade name ""Arquel"" for use in horses, and is administered as an oral granule form at a dose of 2.2 mg/kg/day. It has a relatively slow onset of action, taking 36–48 hours for full effect, and is most useful for treatment of chronic musculoskeletal disease. It has been found to be beneficial for the treatment of navicular syndrome, laminitis, and osteoarthritis, in some cases having a more profound effect than the commonly used NSAID phenylbutazone. However, due to cost, it is not routinely used in practice. Toxicity due to excessive dosage is similar to that of phenylbutazone, including depression, anorexia, weight loss, edema, diarrhea, oral ulceration, and decreased hematocrit. == References ==",Meclomen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.556489552167477e-06), ('ICAL', -6.437280717364047e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018160613253712654)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meclofenamic_acid,https://www.drugs.com/mtm/meclofenamate.html,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682287.html ', [])"

4584,"('Temazepam', 'Restoril', 'Hydroxydiazepam', 'Methyloxazepam', 'Levanxol')",Medical,"Temazepam, sold under the brand name Restoril among others, is a medication of the benzodiazepine class which is generally used to treat severe or debilitating insomnia. It is taken by mouth. Temazepam is rapidly absorbed, and significant hypnotic and anxiolytic effects begin in less than 30 minutes and can last for up to eight hours. Prescriptions for hypnotics such as temazepam have seen a dramatic decrease since 2010, while anxiolytics such as alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam have increased or remained stable. Temazepam and similar hypnotics, such as triazolam (Halcion) are generally reserved for severe and debilitating insomnia. They have largely been replaced by z-drugs (zopiclone, zolpidem) and atypical antidepressants (trazodone, mirtazapine) as first line treatment for insomnia. Common side effects include drowsiness, motor and cognitive impairment, lethargy, confusion, euphoria, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include hallucinations, hypotension, respiratory depression, abuse, anaphylaxis, and suicide. Use is generally not recommended together with alcohol or opioids. If the dose is rapidly decreased withdrawal may occur. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Temazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and hypnotic. It works by affecting GABA within the brain. Temazepam was patented in 1962 and came into medical use in 1969. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 208th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == In sleep laboratory studies, temazepam significantly decreased the number of nightly awakenings, but has the drawback of distorting the normal sleep pattern. It is officially indicated for severe insomnia and other severe or disabling sleep disorders. The prescribing guidelines in the UK limit the prescribing of hypnotics to two to four weeks due to concerns of tolerance and dependence. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended the use of temazepam in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia. It rated the recommendation as weak, the quality of evidence as moderate, and concluded that the potential benefits outweighed the potential harms. The guidelines found that temazepam at a dose of 15 mg reduces sleep latency by 37 minutes (95% CITooltip confidence interval 21 to 53 minutes), increases total sleep time by 99 minutes (95% CI 63 to 135 minutes), and provides a small improvement to sleep quality. The improvements in sleep latency and total sleep time were numerically much greater than any of the other included sleep medications, including eszopiclone, zopiclone, zolpidem, triazolam, estazolam, quazepam, flurazepam, trazodone, diphenhydramine, gabapentin, among others. The United States Air Force uses temazepam as one of the hypnotics approved as a ""no-go pill"" to help aviators and special-duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness. ""Ground tests"" are necessary prior to required authorization being issued to use the medication in an operational situation, and a 12-hour restriction is imposed on subsequent flight operation. The other hypnotics used as ""no-go pills"" are zaleplon and zolpidem, which have shorter mandatory recovery periods. == Contraindications == Use of temazepam should be avoided, when possible, in individuals with these conditions: Ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements) Severe hypoventilation Acute narrow-angle glaucoma Severe hepatic deficiencies (hepatitis and liver cirrhosis decrease elimination by a factor of two) Severe renal deficiencies (e.g. patients on dialysis) Sleep apnea Severe depression, particularly when accompanied by suicidal tendencies Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances Myasthenia gravis (autoimmune disorder causing muscle weakness) Hypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the benzodiazepine class === Special caution needed === Temazepam may cause harm to the fetus. The safety and effectiveness of temazepam has not been established in children. Benzodiazepines also require special caution if used in the elderly, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Temazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. The smallest possible effective dose should be used in elderly or very ill patients, as a risk of apnea and/or cardiac arrest exists. This risk is increased when temazepam is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress the central nervous system (CNS). === Misuse and dependence === Because benzodiazepines can be abused and lead to dependence, their use should be avoided in people in certain particularly high-risk groups. These groups include people with a history of alcohol or drug dependence, people significantly struggling with their mood or people with longstanding mental health difficulties. If temazepam must be prescribed to people in these groups, they should generally be monitored very closely for signs of misuse and development of dependence. == Adverse effects == In September 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class. === Common === Side effects are typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines, though temazepam has more pronounced CNS depressant effects, and include somnolence, sedation, dizziness, fatigue, ataxia, headache, lethargy, impairment of memory and learning, longer reaction time and impairment of motor functions (including coordination problems), slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, blurred vision (especially in higher doses or in those with low tolerance), and inattention. Euphoria was a reported side effect with its use, which is uncommon or not ever reported amongst benzodiazepines. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, temazepam had an incidence of euphoria of 1.5%, which is considered rare. Feelings of euphoria, pleasant sedation, and inner feelings of peace are reported by those who abuse drugs, particularly in those who use temazepam intravenously. It has the highest ratings reported among benzodiazepines by recreational drug users. Drug users tend have a higher preference for temazepam over other benzodiazepines. The three most common reasons for temazepam preference were due to speed of onset, that a it was 'strong' and that it gave a good 'high'. Anterograde amnesia is also common, and respiratory depression in higher doses has proven to be fatal, even when temazepam is taken alone. In medical literature from Australia, Ireland, the UK, Canada, and the United States, temazepam is the only benzodiazepine which has been fatal in overdoses without combination with other CNS depresssants. This unique feature is due to the toxicity of the drug, which numerous studies have ranked it as being most toxic. A 2009 meta-analysis found a 44% higher rate of mild infections, such as pharyngitis or sinusitis, in people taking Temazepam or other hypnotic drugs compared to those taking a placebo. === Less common === Hyperhydrosis, hypotension, burning eyes, increased appetite, changes in libido, hallucinations, faintness, nystagmus, vomiting, pruritus, gastrointestinal disturbances, nightmares, palpitation and paradoxical reactions including restlessness, aggression, violence, overstimulation and agitation have been reported, but are rare (less than 0.5%). Before taking temazepam, one should ensure that at least 8 hours are available to dedicate to sleep. Failing to do so can increase the side effects of the drug. Like all benzodiazepines, the use of this drug in combination with alcohol potentiates the side effects, and can lead to toxicity and death. Though rare, residual ""hangover"" effects after night-time administration of temazepam occasionally occur. These include sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions which may persist into the next day, impaired driving ability, and possible increased risks of falls and hip fractures, especially in the elderly. === Tolerance === Chronic or excessive use of temazepam may cause drug tolerance, which can develop rapidly, so this drug is not recommended for long-term use. In 1979, the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse stated that most hypnotics lose their sleep-inducing properties after about three to 14 days. In use longer than one to two weeks, tolerance will rapidly develop towards the ability of temazepam to maintain sleep, resulting in a loss of effectiveness. Some studies have observed tolerance to temazepam after as little as one week's use. Another study examined the short-term effects of the accumulation of temazepam over seven days in elderly inpatients, and found little tolerance developed during the accumulation of the drug. Other studies examined the use of temazepam over six days and saw no evidence of tolerance. A study in 11 young male subjects showed significant tolerance occurs to temazepam's thermoregulatory effects and sleep inducing properties after one week of use of 30-mg temazepam. Body temperature is well correlated with the sleep-inducing or insomnia-promoting properties of drugs. In one study, the drug sensitivity of people who had used temazepam for one to 20 years was no different from that of controls. An additional study, in which at least one of the authors is employed by multiple drug companies, examined the efficacy of temazepam treatment on chronic insomnia over three months, and saw no drug tolerance, with the authors even suggesting the drug might become more effective over time. Establishing continued efficacy beyond a few weeks can be complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between the return of the original insomnia complaint and withdrawal or rebound related insomnia. Sleep EEG studies on hypnotic benzodiazepines show tolerance tends to occur completely after one to four weeks with sleep EEG returning to pretreatment levels. The paper concluded that due to concerns about long-term use involving toxicity, tolerance and dependence, as well as to controversy over long-term efficacy, wise prescribers should restrict benzodiazepines to a few weeks and avoid continuing prescriptions for months or years. A review of the literature found the nonpharmacological treatment options were a more effective treatment option for insomnia due to their sustained improvements in sleep quality. === Physical dependence === Temazepam, like other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause physical dependence and addiction. Withdrawal from temazepam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which resembles symptoms during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur from standard dosages and after short-term use. Abrupt withdrawal from therapeutic doses of temazepam after long-term use may result in a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Gradual and careful reduction of the dosage, preferably with a long-acting benzodiazepine with long half-life active metabolites, such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam, are recommended to prevent severe withdrawal syndromes from developing. Other hypnotic benzodiazepines are not recommended. A study in rats found temazepam is cross tolerant with barbiturates and is able to effectively substitute for barbiturates and suppress barbiturate withdrawal signs. Rare cases are reported in the medical literature of psychotic states developing after abrupt withdrawal from benzodiazepines, even from therapeutic doses. Antipsychotics increase the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal effects with an increase in the intensity and severity of convulsions. Patients who were treated in the hospital with temazepam or nitrazepam have continued taking these after leaving the hospital. Hypnotic uses in the hospital were recommended to be limited to five nights' use only, to avoid the development of withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia. == Interactions == As with other benzodiazepines, temazepam produces additive CNS-depressant effects when coadministered with other medications which themselves produce CNS depression, such as barbiturates, alcohol, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, nonselective MAO inhibitors, phenothiazines and other antipsychotics, skeletal muscle relaxants, antihistamines, and anaesthetics. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline has been shown to reduce the sedative effects of temazepam and other benzodiazepines. Unlike many benzodiazepines, pharmacokinetic interactions involving the P450 system have not been observed with temazepam. Temazepam shows no significant interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, erythromycin). Oral contraceptives may decrease the effectiveness of temazepam and speed up its elimination half-life. == Overdose == Overdosage of temazepam results in increasing CNS effects, including: Somnolence (difficulty staying awake) Mental confusion Respiratory depression Hypotension Cyanosis Impaired motor functions Impaired or absent reflexes Impaired coordination Impaired balance Dizziness, sedation Coma Death Temazepam had the highest rate of drug intoxication, including overdose, among common benzodiazepines in cases with and without combination with alcohol in a 1985 study. Temazepam and nitrazepam were the two benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose-related deaths in an Australian study of drug deaths. Of the two, temazepam had higher number of deaths, and only temazepam was fatal as the lone drug in three cases, while all cases of nitrazepam deaths were due to mixes with other CNS depressants. Alcohol, heroin, and prescription opioids, with morphine being the opioid with the highest mortality rate. A 1993 British study found temazepam to have the highest number of deaths per million prescriptions among medications commonly prescribed in the 1980s (11.9, versus 5.9 for benzodiazepines overall, taken with or without alcohol). A 1995 Australian study of patients admitted to hospital after benzodiazepine overdose corroborated these results, and found temazepam overdose much more likely to lead to coma than other benzodiazepines (odds ratio 1.86). The authors noted several factors, such as differences in potency, receptor affinity, and rate of absorption between benzodiazepines, could explain this higher toxicity. Although benzodiazepines have a high therapeutic index, temazepam is one of the more dangerous of this class of drugs. The combination of alcohol and temazepam makes death by alcohol poisoning more likely. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The main pharmacological action of temazepam is to increase the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor. This causes sedation, motor impairment, ataxia, anxiolysis, anticonvulsant effects, muscle relaxation, and a reinforcing effect. As a medication before surgery, temazepam decreased cortisol in elderly patients. In rats, it triggered the release of vasopressin into paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and decreased the release of ACTH under stress. === Pharmacokinetics === Oral administration of 15 to 45 mg of temazepam in humans resulted in rapid absorption with significant blood levels achieved in fewer than 30 minutes and peak levels at two to three hours. In a single- and multiple-dose absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study, using tritium-labelled drug, temazepam was well absorbed and found to have minimal (8%) first-pass drug metabolism. No active metabolites were formed and the only significant metabolite present in blood was the O-conjugate. The unchanged drug was 96% bound to plasma proteins. The blood-level decline of the parent drug was biphasic, with the short half-life ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 hours and the terminal half-life from 3.5 to 18.4 hours (mean 8.8 hours), depending on the study population and method of determination. Temazepam has very good bioavailability, with almost 100% being absorbed following being taken by mouth. The drug is metabolized through conjugation and demethylation prior to excretion. Most of the drug is excreted in the urine, with about 20% appearing in the faeces. The major metabolite was the O-conjugate of temazepam (90%); the O-conjugate of N-desmethyl temazepam was a minor metabolite (7%). == Chemistry == Temazepam is a benzodiazepine. It is a white, crystalline substance, very slightly soluble in water, and sparingly soluble in alcohol. === Synthesis === Pharmacologically active metabolite of diazepam, q.v. N-oxides are prone to undergo the Polonovski rearrangement when treated with acetic anhydride, and this was illustrated by the synthesis of oxazepam. It is not surprising that the N-methyl analogue (1) also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam (2). Care must be exacted with the conditions, or the inactive rearrangement product (3) results. == History == Temazepam was synthesized in 1964, but it came into use in 1981 when its ability to counter insomnia was realized. By the late 1980s, temazepam was one of the most popular and widely prescribed hypnotics on the market and it became one of the most widely prescribed drugs. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Temazepam is a drug with a high potential for misuse. Benzodiazepines have been abused orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential; the more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the 'popularity' of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was 'strong' and that it gave a good 'high'. A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines. A 1985 study found that temazepam and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than a variety of other benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over all the rest of the benzodiazepines included in the study. ==== North America ==== In North America, temazepam misuse is not widespread. Other benzodiazepines are more commonly prescribed for insomnia. In the United States, temazepam is the fifth-most prescribed benzodiazepine, however there is a major drop off from the top four most prescribed (alprazolam, lorazepam, diazepam, and clonazepam in that order). Individuals abusing benzodiazepines obtain the drug by getting prescriptions from several doctors, forging prescriptions, or buying diverted pharmaceutical products on the illicit market. North America has never had a serious problem with temazepam misuse, but is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the illicit trade of temazepam. === Australia === Temazepam is a Schedule 4 drug and requires a prescription. The drug accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary in Victoria. Due to rife intravenous abuse, the Australian government decided to put it under a more restrictive schedule than it had been, and since March 2004 temazepam capsules have been withdrawn from the Australian market, leaving only 10 mg tablets available. Benzodiazepines are commonly detected by customs at different ports and airports, arriving by mail, also found occasionally in the baggage of air passengers, mostly small or medium quantities (up to 200–300 tablets) for personal use. From 2003 to 2006, customs detected about 500 illegal importations of benzodiazepines per year, most frequently diazepam. Quantities varied from single tablets to 2,000 tablets. ==== United Kingdom ==== In 1987, temazepam was the most widely abused legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom. The use of benzodiazepines by street-drug abusers was part of a polydrug abuse pattern, but many of those entering treatment facilities were declaring temazepam as their main drug of abuse. Temazepam was the most commonly used benzodiazepine in a study, published 1994, of injecting drug users in seven cities, and had been injected from preparations of capsules, tablets, and syrup. The increase in use of heroin, often mixed with other drugs, which most often included temazepam, diazepam, and alcohol, was a major factor in the increase in drug-related deaths in Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1990–1992. Temazepam use was particularly associated with violent or disorderly behaviours and contact with the police in a 1997 study of young single homeless people in Scotland. The BBC series Panorama featured an episode titled ""Temazepam Wars"", dealing with the epidemic of temazepam abuse and directly related crime in Paisley, Scotland. The trend was mocked in the 1995 Black Grape song ""Temazi Party"" (also called ""Tramazi Party""). === Medical research issues === The Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine published a paper expressing concerns about benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, the benzodiazepines and the Z-drugs used as hypnotics in humans. The paper cites a systematic review of the medical literature concerning insomnia medications and states almost all trials of sleep disorders and drugs are sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, while this is not the case in general medicine or psychiatry. It cites another study that ""found that the odds ratio for finding results favorable to industry in industry-sponsored trials was 3.6 times as high as in non–industry-sponsored studies"". Issues discussed regarding industry-sponsored studies include: comparison of a drug to a placebo, but not to an alternative treatment; unpublished studies with unfavorable outcomes; and trials organized around a placebo baseline followed by drug treatment, but not counterbalanced with parallel-placebo-controlled studies. Quoting a 1979 report that too little research into hypnotics was independent of the drug manufacturers, the authors conclude, ""the public desperately needs an equipoised assessment of hypnotic benefits and risks"" and the NIH and VA should provide leadership to that end. === Street terms === Street terms for temazepam include king kong pills (formerly referred to barbiturates, now more commonly refers to temazepam), jellies, jelly, Edinburgh eccies, tams, terms, mazzies, temazies, tammies, temmies, beans, eggs, green eggs, wobbly eggs, knockouts, hardball, norries, oranges (common term in Australia and New Zealand), rugby balls, ruggers, terminators, red and blue, no-gos, num nums, blackout, green devils, drunk pills, brainwash, mind erasers, neurotrashers, tem-tems (combined with buprenorphine), mommy's big helper, vitamin T, big T, TZ, the mazepam, resties (North America) and others. === Legal status === In Austria, temazepam is listed in UN71 Schedule III under the Psychotropic Substances Decree of 1997. The drug is considered to have a high potential for abuse and addiction, but has accepted medical use for the treatment of severe insomnia. In Australia, temazepam is a Schedule 4 - Prescription Only medicine. It is primarily used for the treatment of insomnia, and is also seen as pre-anaesthetic medication. In Canada, temazepam is a Schedule IV controlled substance requiring a registered doctor's prescription. In Denmark, temazepam is listed as a Class D substance under the Executive Order 698 of 1993 on Euphoric Substances which means it has a high potential for abuse, but is used for medical and scientific purposes. In Finland, temazepam is more tightly controlled than other benzodiazepines. The temazepam product Normison was pulled out of shelves and banned because the liquid inside gelatin capsules had caused a large increase in intravenous temazepam use. The other temazepam product, Tenox, was not affected and remains as prescription medicine. Temazepam intravenous use has not decreased to the level before Normison came to the market. In France, temazepam is listed as a psychotropic substance as are other similar drugs. It is prescribed with a nonrenewable prescription (a new doctor visit every time), available only in 7 or 14-pill packaging for one or two weeks. One brand was withdrawn from the market in 2013 due to rampant abuse. In Hong Kong, temazepam is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Temazepam can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined HKD$10,000. The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000-fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000-fine and/or seven years of jail time. In Ireland, temazepam is a Schedule 3 controlled substance with strict restrictions. In the Netherlands, temazepam is available for prescription as 10- or 20-mg tablets and capsules. Formulations of temazepam containing less than 20 mg are included in List 2 of the Opium Law, while formulations containing 20 mg or more of the drug (along with the gel-capsules) are a List 1 substance of the Opium Law, thus subject to more stringent regulation. Besides being used for insomnia, it is also occasionally used as a preanesthetic medication. In Norway, temazepam is not available as a prescription drug. It is regulated as a Class A substance under Norway's Narcotics Act. In Portugal, temazepam is a Schedule IV controlled drug under Decree-Law 15/93. In Slovenia, it is regulated as a Group II (Schedule 2) controlled substance under the Production and Trade in Illicit Drugs Act. In South Africa, temazepam is a Schedule 5 drug, requiring a special prescription, and is restricted to 10– to 30-mg doses. In Sweden, temazepam is classed as a ""narcotic"" drug listed as both a List II (Schedule II) which denotes it is a drug with limited medicinal use and a high risk of addiction, and is also listed as a List V (Schedule V) substance which denotes the drug is prohibited in Sweden under the Narcotics Drugs Act (1968). Temazepam is banned in Sweden and possession and distribution of even small amounts is punishable by a prison sentence and a fine. Temazepam found in Sweden is usually trafficked from Finland In Switzerland, temazepam is a Class B controlled substance, like all other benzodiazepines. This means it is a prescription-only drug. In the United Kingdom, temazepam is a Class C controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Schedule 3 under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001). If prescribed privately (not on the NHS), temazepam is available only by a special controlled drug prescription form (FP10PCD) and pharmacies are obligated to follow special procedures for storage and dispensing. In the United States, Temazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the international Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and is only available by prescription. === Brand names === Temazepam is available in English-speaking countries under the brand names Euhypnos, Normison, Norkotral, Nortem, Remestan, Restoril, Temaze, and Temtabs. In Hungary the drug is sold as Signopam. == References == == External links == Temazepam | Inchem",Levanxol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019693158101290464), ('ICAL', -3.128163257315464e-07)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0070048230700194836), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029932420700788498)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB9185627.htm,https://www.drugfuture.com/chemdata/Temazepam.html ', [])"
4585,"('Melphalan', 'Alkeran', 'Melfalan', 'Pam', 'Phenylalanine mustard')",Medical,"Melphalan, sold under the brand name Alkeran among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat multiple myeloma; malignant lymphoma; lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia; childhood neuroblastoma; ovarian cancer; mammary adenocarcinoma; and uveal melanoma. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include nausea and bone marrow suppression. Other severe side effects may include anaphylaxis and the development of other cancers. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the fetus. Melphalan belongs to the class of nitrogen mustard alkylating agents. It works by interfering with the creation of DNA and RNA. Melphalan was approved for medical use in the United States in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == In the European Union, melphalan is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma; malignant lymphoma (Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma); acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia; childhood neuroblastoma; ovarian cancer; and mammary adenocarcinoma. In the United States, melphalan is used as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation in people with multiple myeloma. In the European Union, it is indicated, in combination with other cytotoxic medicinal products, as reduced intensity conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in malignant haematological diseases in adults. In August 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved melphalan (Hepzato) as a liver-directed treatment for adults with uveal melanoma with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. == Side effects == Common side effects include: Nausea Bone marrow suppression, including Decreased white blood cell count causing increased risk of infection Decreased platelet count causing increased risk of bleeding Less common side effects include: Severe allergic reactions Pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of lung tissue) including fatal outcomes (usually only with prolonged use) Hair loss Interstitial pneumonitis Rash Itching Irreversible bone marrow failure due to melphalan not being withdrawn early enough Cardiac arrest == Mechanism of action == Melphalan chemically alters the DNA nucleotide guanine through alkylation, and causes linkages between strands of DNA. This chemical alteration inhibits DNA synthesis and RNA synthesis, functions necessary for cells to survive. These changes cause cytotoxicity in both dividing and non-dividing tumor cells. == Synthesis == 4-Nitro-L-phenylalanine (1) was converted to its phthalimide by heating with phthalic anhydride, and this was converted to its ethyl ester (2). Catalytic hydrogenation produced the corresponding aniline. Heating in acid with oxirane, followed by treatment with phosphorus oxychloride provided the bischloride, and removal of the protecting groups by heating in hydrochloric acid gave melphalan (3). == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 17 September 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for melphalan. The applicant for this medicinal product is Adienne S.r.l. S.U.

4586,"('Verapamil hydrochloride', 'Verapamil hcl', 'Manidon', 'Cordilox', 'Calcan hydrochloride')",Medical,"Verapamil, sold under various trade names, is a calcium channel blocker medication used for the treatment of high blood pressure, angina (chest pain from not enough blood flow to the heart), and supraventricular tachycardia. It may also be used for the prevention of migraines and cluster headaches. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, low blood pressure, nausea, and constipation. Other side effects include allergic reactions and muscle pains. It is not recommended in people with a slow heart rate or heart failure. It is believed to cause problems for the fetus if used during pregnancy. It is in the non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker family of medications. Verapamil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Verapamil is available as a generic medication. Long acting formulations exist. In 2022, it was the 188th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Verapamil is used for controlling ventricular rate in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and migraine headache prevention. Verapamil is also used for the treatment of angina (chronic stable, vasospastic or Prinzmetal variant), unstable angina (crescendo, preinfarction), and for the prevention of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Verapamil is a class-IV antiarrhythmic and more effective than digoxin in controlling ventricular rate. Verapamil is not listed as a first line antihypertensive agent by the guidelines provided by JAMA in JNC-8. However, it may be used to treat hypertension if patient has co-morbid atrial fibrillation or other types of arrhythmia. Verapamil is used intra-arterially to treat cerebral vasospasm. It is also used to treat cluster headaches. Tentative evidence supports the use of verapamil topically to treat plantar fibromatosis. Use of verapamil in people with recent onset of type 1 diabetes may improve pancreatic beta cell function. In a 2023 meta-analysis involving data from two randomized controlled trials (113 patients with recent onset type-1 diabetes), it was demonstrated that the use of verapamil over one year was associated with significantly higher C-peptide area under the curve levels. Higher C-peptide levels means better pancreatic insulin production and beta cell function. Verapamil has been reported to be effective in both short-term and long-term treatment of mania and hypomania. Addition of magnesium oxide to the verapamil treatment protocol enhances the antimanic effect. == Contraindications == Use of verapamil is generally avoided in people with severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), cardiogenic shock, and hypersensitivity to verapamil. It is also contraindicated in people with atrial flutter or fibrillation and an existing accessory tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. == Side effects == The most common side effect of verapamil is constipation (7.3%). While the definite mechanism by which verapamil causes constipation has not been studied, studies have been conducted to rule out mechanisms of actions that might yield this adverse effect. A 1992 study found that verapamil causes a delay in colonic transit but does not affect upper gastrointestinal transit. Other side effects include dizziness (3.3%), nausea (2.7%), low blood pressure (2.5%), and headache 2.2%. Other side effects seen in less than 2% of the population include: edema, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, diarrhea, fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, shortness of breath, low heart rate, atrioventricular block, rash and flushing. Along with other calcium channel blockers, verapamil is known to induce gingival enlargement. === Overdose === Acute overdose is often manifested by nausea, weakness, slow heart rate, dizziness, low blood pressure, and abnormal heart rhythms. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of verapamil and norverapamil, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Blood or plasma verapamil concentrations are usually in a range of 50–500 μg/L in persons on therapy with the drug, but may rise to 1–4 mg/L in acute overdose patients and are often at levels of 5–10 mg/L in fatal poisonings. == Mechanism of action == Verapamil's mechanism in all cases is to block voltage-dependent calcium channels. In cardiac pharmacology, calcium channel blockers are considered class-IV antiarrhythmic agents. Since calcium channels are especially concentrated in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, these agents can be used to decrease impulse conduction through the AV node, thus protecting the ventricles from atrial tachyarrhythmias. Specific conditions that fall under the definition of atrial tachyarrhythmias are atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and so on. Verapamil is also a Kv voltage gated potassium channel blocker. Calcium channels are also present in the smooth muscle lining blood vessels. By relaxing the tone of this smooth muscle, calcium channel blockers dilate the blood vessels. This has led to their use in treating high blood pressure and angina pectoris. The pain of angina is caused by a deficit in oxygen supply to the heart. Calcium channel blockers like verapamil dilate the coronary blood vessels, which increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. They also cause dilatation of systemic peripheral vessels as well, causing a reduction in the workload of the heart. Thereby reducing myocardial oxygen consumption. === Cluster headaches === Preventive therapy with verapamil is believed to work because it has an effect on the circadian rhythm and on CGRPs, as CGRP-release is controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels. == Pharmacokinetic details == More than 90% of verapamil is absorbed when given orally, but due to high first-pass metabolism, bioavailability is much lower (10–35%). It is 90% bound to plasma proteins and has a volume of distribution of 3–5 L/kg. It takes 1 to 2 hours to reach peak plasma concentration after oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver to at least 12 inactive metabolites (though one metabolite, norverapamil, retains 20% of the vasodilatory activity of the parent drug). As its metabolites, 70% is excreted in the urine and 16% in feces; 3–4% is excreted unchanged in urine. This is a nonlinear dependence between plasma concentration and dosage. Onset of action is 1 to 2 hours after oral dosage, and 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous bolus dosage. Biphasic or triphasic following IV administration; terminal elimination half-life is 2–8 hours. Plasma half-life of 2–8 or 4.5–12 hours after single oral dose or multiple oral doses, respectively. It is not cleared by hemodialysis. It is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued while verapamil is administered. == Veterinary use == Intra-abdominal adhesions are common in rabbits following surgery. Verapamil can be given postoperatively in rabbits which have suffered trauma to abdominal organs to prevent formation of these adhesions. Such effect was not documented in another study with ponies. == Uses in cell biology == Verapamil inhibits the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family of proteins found in stem cells and has been used to study cancer stem cells (CSC) within head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Verapamil is also used in cell biology as an inhibitor of drug efflux pump proteins such as P-glycoprotein and other ABC transporter proteins. This is useful, as many tumor cell lines overexpress drug efflux pumps, limiting the effectiveness of cytotoxic drugs or fluorescent tags. It is also used in fluorescent cell sorting for DNA content, as it blocks efflux of a variety of DNA-binding fluorophores such as Hoechst 33342. Radioactively labelled verapamil and positron emission tomography can be used with to measure P-glycoprotein function. == References ==",Cordilox,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00019167017308063805), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005852655158378184)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0024756586644798517)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/cordilox?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='CORDILOX - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/cordilox?utm_source=openai')])"
4587,"('Labetalol hydrochloride', 'Labetalol hcl', 'Amipress', 'Presdate', 'Labetalol (hydrochloride)')",Medical,"Labetalol is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and in long term management of angina. This includes essential hypertension, hypertensive emergencies, and hypertension of pregnancy. In essential hypertension it is generally less preferred than a number of other blood pressure medications. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include low blood pressure with standing, dizziness, feeling tired, and nausea. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, liver problems, heart failure, and bronchospasm. Use appears safe in the latter part of pregnancy and it is not expected to cause problems during breastfeeding. It works by blocking the activation of β- and α-adrenergic receptors. Labetalol was patented in 1966 and came into medical use in 1977. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 215th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Labetalol is effective in the management of hypertensive emergencies, postoperative hypertension, pheochromocytoma-associated hypertension, and rebound hypertension from beta blocker withdrawal. It has a particular indication in the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension which is commonly associated with pre-eclampsia. It is also used as an alternative in the treatment of severe hypertension. Labetalol is useful in the treatment of acute cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. in overdose) caused by sympathomimetics like amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine. Other beta blockers are also used. However, the controversial yet possible phenomenon of ""unopposed α-stimulation"" with administration of selective beta blockers to block non-selective sympathomimetics potentially makes dual alpha-1 and beta blockers like labetalol and carvedilol more favorable for such purposes. The rate of unopposed α-stimulation with selective beta blockers has been reported to be 0.4%, whereas no cases of unopposed α-stimulation have been reported with dual alpha and beta blockers like labetalol. === Special populations === Pregnancy: studies in lab animals showed no harm to the baby. However, a comparable well-controlled study has not been performed in pregnant women. Nursing: breast milk has been shown to contain small amounts of labetalol (0.004% original dose). Prescribers should be cautious in the use of labetalol for nursing mothers. Pediatric: no studies have established safety or usefulness in this population. Geriatric: the elderly are more likely to experience dizziness when taking labetalol. Labetalol should be dosed with caution in the elderly and counseled on this side effect. == Side effects == === Common === Neurologic: headache (2%), dizziness (11%) Gastrointestinal: nausea (6%), dyspepsia (3%) Cholinergic: nasal congestion (3%), ejaculation failure (2%) Respiratory: dyspnea (2%) Other: fatigue (5%), vertigo (2%), orthostatic hypotension Low blood pressure with standing is more severe and more common with IV formulation (58% vs 1%) and is often the reason larger doses of the oral formulation cannot be used. === Rare === Fever Muscle cramps Dry eyes Heart block Hyperkalemia Hepatotoxicity Drug eruption similar to lichen planus Hypersensitivity – which may result in a lethal respiratory distress == Contraindications == Labetalol is contraindicated in people with overt cardiac failure, greater-than-first-degree heart block, severe bradycardia, cardiogenic shock, severe hypotension, anyone with a history of obstructive airway disease including asthma, and those with hypersensitivity to the drug. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Labetalol is a beta blocker, or an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a non-selective antagonist of the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. Labetalol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. It is also an antagonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, and hence is additionally an alpha blocker. The antagonism of the adrenergic receptors by labetalol is competitive against other catecholamines and its actions on the receptors are potent and reversible. Labetalol acts by blocking α- and β-adrenergic receptors, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular resistance without significant alteration of heart rate or cardiac output. Labetalol is about equipotent in blocking β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. The amount of α to β blockade depends on whether labetalol is administered orally or intravenously (IV). Orally, the ratio of α to β blockade is 1:3. Intravenously, α to β blockade ratio is 1:7. Thus, the labetalol can be thought to be a beta blocker with some α-blocking effects. By comparison, labetalol is a weaker β-adrenergic receptor blocker than propranolol, and has a weaker affinity for α-adrenergic receptors compared to phentolamine. Labetalol's dual α- and β-adrenergic antagonism has different physiological effects in short- and long-term situations. In short-term, acute situations, labetalol decreases blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance with little effect on stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output. During long-term use, labetalol can reduce heart rate during exercise while maintaining cardiac output by an increase in stroke volume. Labetalol possesses significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). In particular, it is a partial agonist at β2-adrenergic receptors located in the vascular smooth muscle. Labetalol relaxes vascular smooth muscle by a combination of this partial β2-adrenergic receptor agonism and through α1-adrenergic receptor blockade. Overall, this vasodilatory effect can decrease blood pressure. It was originally reported to lack ISA, but a slight degree of activity was subsequently characterized. Similar to local anesthetics and sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmics, labetalol also has membrane stabilizing activity. By decreasing sodium entry, labetalol decreases action potential firing and thus has local anesthetic activity. ==== Physiological action ==== The physiological effects of labetalol when administered acutely (intravenously) are not predictable solely by their receptor blocking effect, i.e. blocking β1-adrenergic receptors should decrease heart rate, but labetalol does not. When labetalol is given in acute situations, it decreases the peripheral vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure while having little effect on the heart rate, cardiac output and stroke volume, despite its α1-, β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor blocking mechanism. These effects are mainly seen when the person is in the upright position. Long term labetalol use also has different effects from other beta blockers. Other beta blockers, such as propranolol, persistently reduce cardiac output during exercise. The peripheral vascular resistance decreases when labetalol is first administered. Continuous labetalol use further decreases peripheral vascular resistance. However, during exercise, cardiac output remains the same due to a compensatory mechanism that increases stroke volume. Thus, labetalol is able to reduce heart rate during exercise while maintaining cardiac output by the increase in stroke volume. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Distribution ==== Labetalol is often classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier and blood–placenta barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. Paradoxically however, labetalol actually shows high lipophilicity. In any case, labetalol, in animals including rats, rabbits, and dogs, was found to cross into the brain in negligible amounts, probably for reasons other than low lipophilicity. On the other hand, the drug has been shown to cross the blood–placenta barrier in humans. == Chemistry == The minimum requirement for adrenergic agents is a primary or secondary amine separated from a substituted benzene ring by one or two carbons. This configuration results in strong agonist activity. As the size of the substituent attached to the amine becomes greater, particularly with respect to a t-butyl group, then the molecule typically is found to have receptor affinity without intrinsic activity, and is, therefore, an antagonist. Labetalol, with its 1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl substituted amine, is greater in size relative to a t-butyl group and therefore acts predominantly as an antagonist. The overall structure of labetalol is very polar. This was created by substituting the isopropyl group in the standard beta blocker structure with an aralkyl group, including a carboxamide group on the meta position, and by adding a hydroxyl group on the para position. Labetalol has two chiral carbons and consequently exists as four stereoisomers. Two of these isomers, the (S,S)- and (R,S)- forms are inactive. The third, the (S,R)-isomer, is a powerful α1-adrenergic receptor blocker. The fourth isomer, the (R,R)-isomer which is also known as dilevalol, is a mixed non-selective β-adrenergic receptor blocker and selective α1 blocker. Labetalol is typically given as a racemic mixture to achieve both α- and β-adrenergic receptor blocking activity. It is chemically designated in International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature as 2-hydroxy-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[(1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)amino]ethyl]benzamide monohydrochloride. The experimental log P of labetalol is 2.7 to 3.1 and its predicted log P ranges from 1.73 to 3.1. Hence, it has relatively high lipophilicity. == History == Labetalol was the first drug created that combined both α- and β-adrenergic receptor blocking properties. It was created to potentially fix the compensatory reflex issue that occurred when blocking a single receptor subtype, i.e. vasoconstriction after blocking β-adrenergic receptors or tachycardia after blocking α-adrenergic receptors. Because the reflex from blocking the single receptor subtypes acted to prevent the lowering of blood pressure, it was postulated that weak blocking of both α- and β-adrenergic receptors could work together to decrease blood pressure. == References ==",Presdate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0005534547381103039), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00046075694262981415)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.1472419600977446e-06)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/presdate,https://precioustrustpharma.com.ng/presdate-tablet/,https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/presdate ', [])"
4588,"('Isotretinoin', 'Accutane', 'Roaccutane', 'Neovitamin a acid', 'Claravis')","Endogenous, Medical","Isotretinoin, also known as 13-cis-retinoic acid and sold under the brand name Accutane among others, is a medication used to treat skin diseases like harlequin-type ichthyosis, and lamellar ichthyosis, and severe cystic acne or moderate acne that is unresponsive to antibiotics. Isotretinoin is used off-label to treat basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, although clinical evidence suggests it is not effective in this setting. It is a retinoid, meaning it is related to vitamin A, and is found in small quantities naturally in the body. Its isomer, tretinoin, is also an acne drug. The most common adverse effects are dry lips (cheilitis), dry and fragile skin (xeroderma), dry eyes and an increased susceptibility to sunburn. Uncommon and rare side effects include muscle aches and pains (myalgias), and headaches. Some of those side effects can persist long after the discontinuation of the use of the drug. Isotretinoin may cause liver failure, therefore the patient's blood levels should be regularly tested. It is known to cause birth defects due to in-utero exposure because of the molecule's close resemblance to retinoic acid, a natural vitamin A derivative that controls normal embryonic development. It is associated with psychiatric side effects, most commonly depression but also, more rarely, psychosis and unusual behaviors. Other rare side effects include hyperostosis and premature epiphyseal closure, which have been reported to be persistent. Isotretinoin was patented in 1969 and approved for medical use in 1982. In 2021, it was the 264th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Isotretinoin is used primarily for persistent cystic acne. Many dermatologists also support its use for treatment of lesser degrees of acne that prove resistant to other treatments, or that produce scarring or psychological distress. Isotretinoin is not indicated for the treatment of prepubertal acne and is not recommended in children less than 12 years of age. It is also somewhat effective for hidradenitis suppurativa and some cases of severe rosacea. It can also be used to help treat harlequin ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis and is used in xeroderma pigmentosum cases to relieve keratoses. Isotretinoin has been used to treat the extremely rare condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. It is also used for the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma in Japan, but data for its efficacy is not conclusive and it has not been approved in other countries. Isotretinoin therapy has furthermore proven effective against genital warts in experimental use but is rarely used for this indication as there are more effective treatments. Isotretinoin may represent an efficacious and safe alternative systemic form of therapy for recalcitrant condylomata acuminata (RCA) of the cervix. In most countries, this therapy is currently unapproved and only used if other therapies fail. === Prescribing restrictions === Isotretinoin is a teratogen; there is about a 20–35% risk for congenital defects in infants exposed to the drug in utero, and about 30–60% of children exposed to isotretinoin prenatally have been reported to show neurocognitive impairment. Because of this risk, there are strict controls prescribing isotretinoin to women who have potential to become (or be) pregnant while taking isotretinoin and many are strongly advised to terminate their pregnancies because of the 20-60% risk. Isotretinoin is also not recommended for use by breastfeeding women. In the United States, since March 2006, the dispensing of isotretinoin is run through the iPLEDGE program, under the direction of the Food and Drug Administration. Prescribers, pharmacists, and all people to whom the drug is prescribed need to register on the site and log information into it. Women with child-bearing potential must commit to using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for the duration of isotretinoin therapy and for a month immediately preceding and a month immediately following therapy. Additionally, they must have two negative pregnancy tests 30 days apart and have negative pregnancy tests before each prescription is written. In most countries, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by dermatologists or specialist physicians; some countries also allow limited prescriptions by general practitioners and family doctors. In the United Kingdom and Australia, isotretinoin may be prescribed only by or under the supervision of a consultant dermatologist. Because severe cystic acne has the potential to cause permanent scarring over a short period, restrictions on its more immediate availability have proved contentious. In New Zealand, isotretinoin can be prescribed by any doctor but subsidized only when prescribed by a vocationally-registered general practitioner, dermatologist or nurse practitioner. == Adverse effects == Increasingly higher dosages will result in higher toxicity, resembling vitamin A toxicity. Adverse effects include: === Possible permanent effects === The effects of isotretinoin may be permanent. This has been proposed to be due to induction of apoptosis in sebaceous glands, meibomian glands, neuroblastoma cells, hypothalamic cells, hippocampus cells, Dalton's lymphoma ascites cells, B16F-10 melanoma cells, neuronal crest cells, stem cells and others, that it changes epigenetics and shortens telomeres. Isotretinoin may stop long bone growth in young people who are still growing. Premature epiphyseal closure can occur in people receiving recommended doses of Accutane. Isotretinoin is known to cause meibomian gland dysfunction which causes persistent keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). Problems with the meibomian and salivary glands are likely due to the non-selective apoptosis of the cells of the exocrine glands. Decreased night vision has been reported to persist in some people after discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy, although most cases of decreased night vision appear to resolve after discontinuing the medication. === Sexual === Isotretinoin is also associated with permanent sexual side effects, namely erectile dysfunction and reduced libido. In October 2017, the UK MHRA issued a Drug Safety Update to physicians in response to reports of these problems. This was in response to an EU review, published in August 2017, which states that a plausible physiological explanation of these side effects ""may be a reduction in plasma testosterone"". The review also stated that ""the product information should be updated to include ‘sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction and decreased libido’ as an undesirable effect with an unknown frequency"". There have also been reports of spermatogenesis disorders, such as oligospermia. 27 cases of sexual dysfunction report either negative dechallenge or positive dechallenge. === Skin === The most common side effects are mucocutaneous: dry lips, skin, and nose. Other common mucocutaneous side effects are inflammation and chapping of the lips (cheilitis), redness of the skin (erythema), rashes, peeling, eczema (dermatitis), itching (pruritus) and nose bleeds (epistaxis). Absence of dryness of the lips is considered an indication of non-compliance with treatment (not taking the drug as advised), as it occurs in almost all people who take it. Regular use of lip balm and moisturizer is recommended throughout treatment to reduce these problems. The dose may need to be decreased to reduce the severity of these side effects. The skin becomes more fragile—especially to frictional forces—and may not heal as quickly as normal. Wound healing is delayed. For this reason, elective surgery, waxing of hair, tattooing, tattoo removal, piercings, dermabrasion, exfoliation, etc., are not recommended. Treatment of acne scars is generally deferred until 12 months after completion of a course of isotretinoin. === Teratogenicity === Isotretinoin is a teratogen highly likely to cause birth defects if taken by women during pregnancy or even a short time before conception. A few of the more common birth defects this drug can cause are hearing and visual impairment, missing or malformed earlobes, facial dysmorphism, and abnormalities in brain function. Isotretinoin is classified as FDA Pregnancy Category X and ADEC Category X, and use is contraindicated in pregnancy. In the EU, isotretinoin (oral) is contraindicated in pregnancy and must not be taken by women able to have children unless the conditions of a pregnancy prevention program are met. The manufacturer recommends pregnancy be ruled out two weeks before commencement of isotretinoin, and women should use two simultaneous forms of effective contraception at least one month before commencement, during, and for at least one month following isotretinoin therapy. In the US, around 2000 women became pregnant while taking the drug between 1982 and 2000, with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage. About 160 babies with birth defects were born. After the FDA put the more strict iPLEDGE program in place for the companies marketing the drug in the US, in 2011, 155 pregnancies occurred (0.12%) among 129,544 women of childbearing potential taking isotretinoin. People taking isotretinoin are not permitted to donate blood during and for at least one month after discontinuation of therapy due to its teratogenicity. === Psychological effects === Rare psychological side effects may include depression, worsening of pre-existing depression, aggressive tendencies, irritable mood, and anxiety. Very rare effects include abnormal behaviour, psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. In a total of 5577 adverse reactions reported to the UK's MHRA up to 31 March 2017, the plurality (1207, or 22%) concerned psychiatric effects. There were 85 reports of suicidal ideation, 56 of suicide and 43 of suicide attempts. Isotretinoin decreases the brain metabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex by an average of 21%, a brain area known to mediate symptoms of depression. The association between isotretinoin use and psychopathology has been controversial. Beginning in 1983, isolated case reports emerged suggesting mood change, particularly depression, occurring during or soon after isotretinoin use. Several studies have been conducted since then of the drug's effect on depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and other psychological effects. ==== Depression and suicidality ==== Isotretinoin is the only non-psychiatric drug on the FDA's top 10 list of drugs associated with depression and is also within the top 10 for suicide attempts. A black box warning for suicide, depression, and psychosis has been present on isotretinoin's packaging in the United States since 2005. In March 2018, European Medicines Agency issued a warning on a possible risk of neuropsychiatric disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and mood changes) following the use of oral retinoids, including isotretinoin, though the limitations of the available data did not allow them to establish whether this risk was due to the use of retinoids. A Swedish retrospective cohort study with 5756 patients showed a significantly increased risk of attempted suicides from 6 months after the treatment to around 2 years after the treatment. In 2012, a systematic review covering all articles in the literature related to isotretinoin, depression, and suicide, as well as articles related to class effect, dose-response, and biological plausibility found that the literature reviewed was consistent with an association of isotretinoin administration and depression and with suicide in a subgroup of vulnerable individuals. Following this systematic review, in a 2014 review a group of Australian dermatologists and psychiatrists collaborated on a set of recommendations for safe prescribing of isotretinoin. However, whether isotretinoin use is causally associated with mental illness remains controversial. Evidence for depression being causally associated with isotretinoin use includes 41 reports of positive challenge/dechallenge/rechallenge with isotretinoin, involving administering isotretinoin, withdrawing the drug, and then re-administering it. The majority of these cases had no psychiatric history. There is also a temporal relationship between the development of depression and initiation of isotretinoin treatment, with most cases developing after 1–2 months of treatment. Further, higher doses of isotretinoin increase the risk of developing depression, with 25% of people showing depression on a dose of 3 mg/kg/day as compared with 3–4% at normal doses. Studies have uncovered several biological processes which may credibly explain the affective changes induced by isotretinoin. ==== Psychosis ==== Isotretinoin has also been linked to psychosis. Many of the side effects of isotretinoin mimic hypervitaminosis A, which has been associated with psychotic symptoms. The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia and psychosis suggests that an increase in dopaminergic stimulation or sensitivity in the limbic system causes psychotic symptoms. It has been suggested that dysregulation of retinoid receptors by retinoids such as isotretinoin may cause schizophrenia. The evidence for this is threefold: transcriptional activation of the dopamine D2 receptor – in addition to serotonin and glutamate receptors – is regulated by retinoic acid; schizophrenia and the retinoid cascade have been linked to the same gene loci; and retinoid dysfunction causes congenital anomalies identical to those observed in people with schizophrenia. Further, the expression of dopamine receptors has indeed been shown to be regulated by retinoic acid. === Musculoskeletal === Isotretinoin has a number of muscoloskeletal effects. Myalgia (muscular pain) and arthralgia (joint pain) are common side effects. Retinoids, such as high dose etretinate, are well known to cause bone changes, the most common type of which is hyperostotic changes (excessive bone growth), especially in growing children and adolescents. While excessive bone growth has been raised as a possible side effect of isotretinoin, a 2006 review found little evidence for this. Other problems include premature epiphyseal closure and calcification of tendons and ligaments. The bones of the spine and feet are most commonly affected. Risk factors for skeletal effects include older age, greater dosage, and longer course of treatment. Most bone changes cause no symptoms and may only be noticed using X-ray imaging. === Gastrointestinal === Isotretinoin may cause non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The drug is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)—ulcerative colitis, but not Crohn's disease. There are also reports of people developing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and worsening of existing IBS. === Eyes === Isotretinoin and other retinoids are well known to affect the eyes. Dry eyes are very common during treatment and is caused by isotretinoin's apoptotic effect on the meibomian glands. Some people develop contact lens intolerance as a result. In some people, these changes are long-lasting or irreversible and represent Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Other common effects on the eyes include inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), red eye caused by conjunctivitis and irritation of the eye. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision (which may be permanent), colour blindness, development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea (keratitis), swelling of the optic disk (papilloedema, associated with IIH), photophobia and other visual disturbances. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Isotretinoin's exact mechanism of action is unknown, but several studies have shown that isotretinoin induces apoptosis (programmatic cell death) in various cells in the body. Cell death may be instigated in the meibomian glands, hypothalamic cells, hippocampus cells and—important for treatment of acne—in sebaceous gland cells. Isotretinoin has a low affinity for retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), but may be converted intracellularly to metabolites that act as agonists of RAR and RXR nuclear receptors. One study suggests the drug amplifies production of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in the skin, which has been shown to reduce sebum production by inducing apoptosis in sebaceous gland cells, while exhibiting an antimicrobial effect on Cutibacterium acnes. The drug decreases the size and sebum output of the sebaceous glands. Isotretinoin is the only available acne drug that affects all four major pathogenic processes in acne, which distinguishes it from alternative treatments (such as antibiotics) and accounts for its efficacy in severe, nodulocystic cases. The effect of isotretinoin on sebum production can be temporary, or remission of the disease can be ""complete and prolonged."" Isotretinoin has been speculated to down-regulate the enzyme telomerase and hTERT, inhibiting ""cellular immortalization and tumorigenesis."" In a 2007 study, isotretinoin was proven to inhibit the action of the metalloprotease MMP-9 (gelatinase) in sebum without any influence in the action of TIMP1 and TIMP2 (the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases). It is already known that metalloproteases play an important role in the pathogenesis of acne. ==== CNS activities ==== A possible biological basis for the case reports of depression involves decreased metabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of the frontal lobe. It has also been found that decreased OFC metabolism was correlated with headaches. People reporting headache as a side effect often report comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially depression; a statistically significant relationship between headache and depression has been established. It is suggested that people sensitive to isotretinoin-induced CNS effects may also be susceptible to other psychiatric side effects such as depression. Studies in mice and rats have found that retinoids, including isotretinoin, bind to dopaminergic receptors in the central nervous system. Isotretinoin may affect dopaminergic neurotransmission by disrupting the structure of dopamine receptors and decreasing dopaminergic activity. The dopaminergic system is implicated in numerous psychological disorders, including depression. Isotretinoin is also thought to affect the serotonergic system – it increases expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the pre-synaptic neuron, which inhibit serotonin secretion. Isotretinoin also, directly and indirectly, increases the translation of the serotonin transporter protein (SERT), leading to increased reuptake and consequently reduced synaptic availability of serotonin. Inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis may also play a role in the development of isotretinoin-induced depression. A further effect of isotretinoin on the brain involves retinoic acid function in the hypothalamus, the hormone regulatory centre of the brain and part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, a key part of the body's stress response. Other brain regions regulated by retinoic acid and potentially disrupted by isotretinoin include the frontal cortex and the striatum. === Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics === Oral isotretinoin is best absorbed when taken with a high-fat meal because it has a high level of lipophilicity. The efficacy of isotretinoin doubles when taken after a high-fat meal compared to when taken without food. Due to isotretinoin's molecular relationship to vitamin A, it should not be taken with vitamin A supplements due to the danger of toxicity through cumulative overdosing. Accutane also negatively interacts with tetracycline, another class of acne drug, and with micro-dosed ('mini-pill') progesterone preparations, norethisterone/ethinylestradiol ('OrthoNovum 7/7/7'), St. John's Wort, phenytoin, and systemic corticosteroids. Isotretinoin is primarily (99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. Three metabolites of isotretinoin are detectable in human plasma after oral administration: 4-oxo-isotretinoin, retinoid acid (tretinoin), and 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-tretinoin). Isotretinoin also oxidizes, irreversibly, to 4-oxo-isotretinoin—which forms its geometric isomer 4-oxo-tretinoin. After an orally administered 80 mg dose of liquid suspension 14C-isotretinoin, 14C-activity in blood declines with a half-life of 90 hours. The metabolites of isotretinoin and its conjugates are then excreted in the subject's urine and faeces in relatively equal amounts. After a single, 80 mg oral dose of Isotretinoin to 74 healthy adult subjects under fed conditions, the mean ±SD elimination half-life (t1/2) of isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin were 21.0 ± 8.2 hours and 24.0 ± 5.3 hours, respectively. After both single and multiple doses, the observed accumulation ratios of isotretinoin ranged from 0.90 to 5.43 in people with cystic acne. == History == The compound 13-cis retinoic acid was first studied in the 1960s at Roche Laboratories in Switzerland by Werner Bollag as a treatment for skin cancer. Experiments completed in 1971 showed that the compound was likely to be ineffective for cancer but that it could be useful to treat acne. However, they also showed that the compound was likely to cause birth defects, so in light of the events around thalidomide, Roche abandoned the product. In 1979, an article was published reporting the drug's effectiveness as a treatment of cystic and conglobate acne on fourteen patients, thirteen of which experienced complete clearing of their disease. In clinical trials, subjects were carefully screened to avoid including women who were or might become pregnant. Roche's New Drug Application for isotretinoin for the treatment of acne included data showing that the drug caused birth defects in rabbits. The FDA approved the application in 1982. Scientists involved in the clinical trials published articles warning of birth defects at the same time the drug was launched in the US, but isotretinoin was taken up quickly and widely, both among dermatologists and general practitioners. Cases of birth defects showed up in the first year, leading the FDA to begin publishing case reports and to Roche sending warning letters to doctors and placing warning stickers on drug bottles, and including stronger warnings on the label. Lawsuits against Roche started to be filed. In 1983 the FDA's advisory committee was convened and recommended stronger measures, which the FDA took and were at that time unprecedented: warning blood banks not to accept blood from people taking the drug and adding a warning to the label advising women to start taking contraceptives a month before starting the drug. However, the use of the drug continued to grow, as did the number of babies born with birth defects. In 1985 the label was updated to include a boxed warning. In early 1988 the FDA called for another advisory committee, and FDA employees prepared an internal memo estimating that around 1,000 babies had been born with birth defects due to isotretinoin, that up to around 1,000 miscarriages had been caused, and that between 5,000 and 7,000 women had had abortions due to isotretinoin. The memo was leaked to The New York Times a few days before the meeting, leading to a storm of media attention. In the committee meeting, dermatologists and Roche each argued to keep the drug on the market but to increase education efforts; pediatricians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) argued to withdraw the drug from the market. The committee recommended restricting physicians who could prescribe the drug and requiring a second opinion before it could be prescribed. The FDA, believing it did not have authority under the law to restrict who had the right to prescribe the drug, kept the drug on the market but took further unprecedented measures: it required Roche to make warnings yet more visible and graphic, provide doctors with informed consent forms to be used when prescribing the drug, and to conduct follow up studies to test whether the measures were reducing exposure of pregnant women to the drug. Roche implemented those measures, and offered to pay for contraception counseling and pregnancy testing for women prescribed the drug; the program was called the ""Pregnancy Prevention Program"". A CDC report published in 2000, showed problems with the Pregnancy Prevention Program and showed that the increase in prescriptions was from off-label use, and prompted Roche to revamp its program, renaming it the ""Targeted Pregnancy Prevention Program"" and adding label changes like requirements for two pregnancy tests, two kinds of contraception, and for doctors to provide pharmacists with prescriptions directly; providing additional educational materials, and providing free pregnancy tests. The FDA had another advisory meeting in late 2000 that again debated how to prevent pregnant women from being exposed to the drug; dermatologists testified about the remarkable efficacy of the drug, the psychological impact of acne, and demanded autonomy to prescribe the drug; others argued that the drug be withdrawn or much stricter measures be taken. In 2001 the FDA announced a new regulatory scheme called SMART (the System to Manage Accutane Related Teratogenicity) that required Roche to provide defined training materials to doctors, and for doctors to sign and return a letter to Roche acknowledging that they had reviewed the training materials, for Roche to then send stickers to doctors, which doctors would have to place on prescriptions they give people after they have confirmed a negative pregnancy test; prescriptions could only be written for 30 days and could not be renewed, thus requiring a new pregnancy test for each prescription. In February 2002, Roche's patents for isotretinoin expired, and there are now many other companies selling cheaper generic versions of the drug. On 29 June 2009, Roche Pharmaceuticals, the original creator and distributor of isotretinoin, officially discontinued both the manufacture and distribution of their Accutane brand in the United States due to what the company described as business reasons related to low market share (below 5%), coupled with the high cost of defending personal injury lawsuits brought by some people who took the drug. Roche USA continues to defend Accutane and claims to have treated over 13 million people since its introduction in 1982. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. apparently will continue to manufacture and distribute Roaccutane outside of the United States. Among others, actor James Marshall sued Roche over allegedly Accutane-related disease that resulted in the removal of his colon. The jury, however, decided that James Marshall had a pre-existing bowel disease. Several trials over inflammatory bowel disease claims have been held in the United States, with many of them resulting in multimillion-dollar judgments against the makers of isotretinoin. == Society and culture == === Brands === As of 2017, isotretinoin was marketed under many brand names worldwide: A-Cnotren, Absorica, Accuran, Accutane, Accutin, Acne Free, Acnecutan, Acnegen, Acnemin, Acneone, Acneral, Acnestar, Acnetane, Acnetin A, Acnetrait, Acnetrex, Acnogen, Acnotin, Acnotren, Acretin, Actaven, Acugen, Acutret, Acutrex, Ai Si Jie, Aisoskin, Aknal, Aknefug Iso, Aknenormin, Aknesil, Aknetrent, Amnesteem, Atlacne, Atretin, Axotret, Casius, Ciscutan, Claravis, Contracné, Curacne, Curacné, Curakne, Curatane, Cuticilin, Decutan, Dercutane, Effederm, Epuris, Eudyna, Farmacne, Flexresan, Flitrion, I-Ret, Inerta, Inflader, Inotrin, Isac, Isdiben, Isoacne, Isobest, Isocural, Isoderm, Isoface, IsoGalen, Isogeril, Isolve, Isoprotil, Isoriac, Isosupra, Isosupra Lidose, Isotane, Isotina, Isotinon, Isotren, Isotret, Isotretinoin, Isotretinoina, Isotretinoína, Isotretinoine, Isotretinoïne, Isotrétinoïne, Isotretinoinum, Isotrex, Isotrin, Isotroin, Izotek, Izotziaja, Lisacne, Locatret, Mayesta, Medinac, Myorisan, Neotrex, Netlook, Nimegen, Noitron, Noroseptan, Novacne, Oralne, Oraret, Oratane, Piplex, Policano, Procuta, Reducar, Retacnyl, Retin A, Roaccutan, Roaccutane, Roacnetan, Roacta, Roacutan, Rocne, Rocta, Sotret, Stiefotrex, Tai Er Si, Teweisi, Tretin, Tretinac, Tretinex, Tretiva, Tufacne, Zenatane, Zerocutan, Zonatian ME, and Zoretanin.

To assess its effects, this agent was used as a laundry and paint additive and as a treatment for burlap rug backing; after recommended applications of Impregon, coded replicate materials were inoculated with mixed suspensions of fungus particles. No difference was evident in fungus growth points on fabric swatches washed in tap water with and without Impregon. However, growth on both of these was significantly greater than on samples laundered in tap water using only a commercial soap or liquid detergent. Fungus soiling of burlap was not clearly diminished by prescribed applications of Impregon solution 3 mo previously. Similarly, the addition of this agent to paint did not suppress fungus growth on Masonite plaques to which it had been applied.

4590,"('Hydroxybutyrate', 'Sodium oxybate', 'G-hydroxybutyric acid', 'Gamma hydroxy butyrate', 'Butyric acid, hydroxy-, ion(1-)')","Endogenous, Medical","γ-Hydroxybutyric acid, also known as gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, GHB, or 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and a depressant drug. It is a precursor to GABA, glutamate, and glycine in certain brain areas. It acts on the GHB receptor and is a weak agonist at the GABAB receptor. GHB has been used in the medical setting as a general anesthetic and as treatment for cataplexy, narcolepsy, and alcoholism. The substance is also used illicitly for various reasons, including as a performance-enhancing drug, date rape drug, and as a recreational drug. It is commonly used in the form of a salt, such as sodium γ-hydroxybutyrate (NaGHB, sodium oxybate, or Xyrem) or potassium γ-hydroxybutyrate (KGHB, potassium oxybate). GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation, and is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, beef, and small citrus fruits. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood. == Medical use == GHB is used for medical purposes in the treatment of narcolepsy and, more rarely, alcohol dependence, although there remains uncertainty about its efficacy relative to other pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence. The authors of a 2010 Cochrane review concluded that ""GHB appears better than NTX and disulfiram in maintaining abstinence and preventing craving in the medium term (3 to 12 months)"". It is sometimes used off-label for the treatment of fibromyalgia. GHB is the active ingredient of the prescription medication sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Sodium oxybate is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy. GHB has been shown to reliably increase slow-wave sleep and decrease the tendency for REM sleep in modified multiple sleep latency tests. The FDA-approved labeling for sodium oxybate suggests no evidence GHB has teratogenic, carcinogenic or hepatotoxic properties. Its favorable safety profile relative to ethanol may explain why GHB continues to be investigated as a candidate for alcohol substitution. == Recreational use == GHB is a central nervous system depressant used as an intoxicant. It has many street names. Its effects have been described as comparable with ethanol (alcohol) and MDMA use, such as euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced libido and empathogenic states. A review comparing ethanol to GHB concluded that the dangers of the two drugs were similar. At higher doses, GHB may induce nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, agitation, visual disturbances, depressed breathing, amnesia, unconsciousness, and death. One potential cause of death from GHB consumption is polydrug toxicity. Co-administration with other CNS depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines can result in an additive effect (potentiation), as they all bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid (or ""GABA"") receptor sites. The effects of GHB can last from 1.5 to 4 hours, or longer if large doses have been consumed. Consuming GHB with alcohol can cause respiratory arrest and vomiting in combination with unarousable sleep, which can lead to death. Recreational doses of 1–2 g generally provide a feeling of euphoria, and larger doses create deleterious effects such as reduced motor function and drowsiness. The sodium salt of GHB has a salty taste. Other salt forms such as calcium GHB and magnesium GHB have also been reported, but the sodium salt is by far the most common. Some prodrugs, such as γ-butyrolactone (GBL), convert to GHB in the stomach and bloodstream. Other prodrugs exist, such as 1,4-butanediol (1,4-B). GBL and 1,4-B are normally found as pure liquids, but they can be mixed with other more harmful solvents when intended for industrial use (e.g. as paint stripper or varnish thinner). GHB can be manufactured with little knowledge of chemistry, as it involves the mixing of its two precursors, GBL and an alkali hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, to form the GHB salt. Due to the ease of manufacture and the availability of its precursors, it is not usually produced in illicit laboratories like other synthetic drugs, but in private homes by low-level producers. GHB is colourless and odourless. === Party use === GHB has been used as a club drug, apparently starting in the 1990s, as small doses of GHB can act as a euphoriant and are believed to be aphrodisiac. Slang terms for GHB include liquid ecstasy, lollipops, liquid X or liquid E due to its tendency to produce euphoria and sociability and its use in the dance party scene. === Sports and athletics === Some athletes have been know to use GHB, or its analogs, due to marketing claims the drug as an anabolic agent. However, no such evidence exists to suggest links between the use of GHB and muscle development or performance improvement. == Usage as a date-rape drug == GHB became known to the general public as a date-rape drug by the late 1990s. GHB is colourless and odorless and has been described as ""very easy to add to drinks"". When consumed, the victim will quickly feel groggy and sleepy and may become unconscious. Upon recovery they may have an impaired ability to recall events that have occurred during the period of intoxication. In these situations evidence and the identification of the perpetrator of the rape is often difficult. It is also difficult to establish how often GHB is used to facilitate rape as it is difficult to detect in a urine sample after a day, and many victims may only recall the rape some time after its occurrence; however, a 2006 study suggested that there was ""no evidence to suggest widespread date rape drug use"" in the UK, and that less than 2% of cases involved GHB, while 17% involved cocaine, and a survey in the Netherlands published in 2010 found that the proportion of drug-related rapes where GHB was used appeared to be greatly overestimated by the media. More recently, a study in Western Australia reviewed the pre-hospital context given in medical records around emergency department presentations with analytical confirmation of GHB exposure. This study found that most cases reported daily dosing and subsequent accidental overdose rather than their presentation being associated with date-rape. There have been several high-profile cases of GHB as a date-rape drug that received national attention in the United States. In early 1999, a 15-year-old girl, Samantha Reid of Rockwood, Michigan, died from GHB poisoning. Reid's death inspired the legislation titled the ""Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition Act of 2000"". This is the law that made GHB a Schedule 1 controlled substance. In the United Kingdom, British serial killer Stephen Port administered GHB to his victims by adding it to drinks given to them, raping them, and murdering four of them in his flat in Barking, East London. GHB can be detected in hair. Hair testing can be a useful tool in court cases or for the victim's own information. Most over-the-counter urine test kits test only for date-rape drugs that are benzodiazepines, which GHB is not. To detect GHB in urine, the sample must be taken within four hours of GHB ingestion, and cannot be tested at home. == Adverse effects == === Combination with alcohol === In humans, GHB has been shown to reduce the elimination rate (thus increasing the elimination time) of alcohol. This may explain the respiratory arrest that has been reported after ingestion of both drugs. A review of the details of 194 deaths attributed to or related to GHB over a ten-year period found that most were from respiratory depression caused by interaction with alcohol or other drugs. === Deaths === One publication has investigated 226 deaths attributed to GHB. Of the 226 deaths included, 213 had a cardiorespiratory arrest and 13 had fatal accidents. Seventy-one of these deaths (34%) had no co-intoxicants. Postmortem blood GHB was 18–4400 mg/L (median=347) in deaths negative for co-intoxicants. One report has suggested that sodium oxybate overdose might be fatal, based on deaths of three patients who had been prescribed the drug. However, for two of the three cases, post-mortem GHB concentrations were 141 and 110 mg/L, which is within the expected range of concentrations for GHB after death, and the third case was a patient with a history of intentional drug overdose. The toxicity of GHB has been an issue in criminal trials, as in the death of Felicia Tang, where the defense argued that death was due to GHB, not murder. GHB is produced in the body in very small amounts, and blood levels may climb after death to levels in the range of 30–50 mg/L. Levels higher than this are found in GHB deaths. Levels lower than this may be due to GHB or to postmortem endogenous elevations. === Neurotoxicity === In multiple studies, GHB has been found to impair spatial memory, working memory, learning and memory in rats with chronic ad­min­is­tra­tion. These effects are associated with decreased NMDA receptor expression in the cerebral cortex and possibly other areas as well. In addition, the neu­ro­tox­icity appears to be caused by oxidative stress. === Addiction === Addiction occurs when repeated drug use disrupts the normal balance of brain circuits that control rewards, memory and cognition, ultimately leading to compulsive drug taking. Rats forced to consume massive doses of GHB will intermittently prefer GHB solution to water. === Withdrawal === GHB has also been associated with a withdrawal syndrome of insomnia, anxiety, and tremor that usually resolves within three to twenty-one days. The withdrawal syndrome can be severe producing acute delirium and may require hospitalization in an intensive care unit for management. Management of GHB dependence involves considering the person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of GHB. The mainstay of treatment for severe withdrawal is supportive care and benzodiazepines for control of acute delirium, but larger doses are often required compared to acute delirium of other causes (e.g. > 100 mg/d of diazepam). Baclofen has been suggested as an alternative or adjunct to benzodiazepines based on anecdotal evidence and some animal data. However, there is less experience with the use of baclofen for GHB withdrawal, and additional research in humans is needed. Baclofen was first suggested as an adjunct because benzodiazepines do not affect GABAB receptors and therefore have no cross-tolerance with GHB while baclofen, which works via GABAB receptors, is cross-tolerant with GHB and may be more effective in alleviating withdrawal effects of GHB. GHB withdrawal is not widely discussed in textbooks and some psychiatrists, general practitioners, and even hospital emergency physicians may not be familiar with this withdrawal syndrome. == Overdose == Overdose of GHB can sometimes be difficult to treat because of its multiple effects on the body. GHB tends to cause rapid unconsciousness at doses above 3500 mg, with single doses over 7000 mg often causing life-threatening respiratory depression, and higher doses still inducing bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Other side-effects include convulsions (especially when combined with stimulants), and nausea/vomiting (especially when combined with alcohol). The greatest life threat due to GHB overdose (with or without other substances) is respiratory arrest. Other relatively common causes of death due to GHB ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional asphyxia, and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while driving under the influence of GHB). The risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. People are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. It is important to keep the victim awake and moving; the victim must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting. Frequently the victim will be in a good mood but this does not mean the victim is not in danger. GHB overdose is a medical emergency and immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed. Convulsions from GHB can be treated with the benzodiazepines diazepam or lorazepam. Even though these benzodiazepines are also CNS depressants, they primarily modulate GABAA receptors whereas GHB is primarily a GABAB receptor agonist, and so do not worsen CNS depression as much as might be expected. Because of the faster and more complete absorption of GBL relative to GHB, its dose-response curve is steeper, and overdoses of GBL tend to be more dangerous and problematic than overdoses involving only GHB or 1,4-B. Any GHB/GBL overdose is a medical emergency and should be cared for by appropriately trained personnel. A newer synthetic drug, SCH-50911, which acts as a selective GABAB antagonist, quickly reverses GHB overdose in mice. However, this treatment has yet to be tried in humans, and it is unlikely that it will be researched for this purpose in humans due to the illegal nature of clinical trials of GHB and the lack of medical indemnity coverage inherent in using an untested treatment for a life-threatening overdose. === Detection of use === GHB may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, to provide evidence in an impaired driving, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma GHB concentrations are usually in a range of 50–250 mg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically (during general anesthesia), 30–100 mg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, 50–500 mg/L in acutely intoxicated patients and 100–1000 mg/L in victims of fatal overdosage. Urine is often the preferred specimen for routine drug abuse monitoring purposes. Both γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4-butanediol are converted to GHB in the body. In January 2016, it was announced scientists had developed a way to detect GHB, among other things, in saliva. == Endogenous production == Cells produce GHB by reduction of succinic semialdehyde via succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSR). This enzyme appears to be induced by cAMP levels, meaning substances that elevate cAMP, such as forskolin and vinpocetine, may increase GHB synthesis and release. Conversely, endogeneous GHB production in those taking valproic acid will be inhibited via inhibition of the conversion from succinic acid semialdehyde to GHB. People with the disorder known as succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as γ-hydroxybutyric aciduria, have elevated levels of GHB in their urine, blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The precise function of GHB in the body is not clear. It is known, however, that the brain expresses a large number of receptors that are activated by GHB. These receptors are excitatory, however, and therefore not responsible for the sedative effects of GHB; they have been shown to elevate the principal excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. The benzamide antipsychotics—amisulpride, nemonapride, etc.—have been shown to bind to these GHB-activated receptors in vivo. Other antipsychotics were tested and were not found to have an affinity for this receptor. GHB is a precursor to GABA, glutamate, and glycine in certain brain areas. In spite of its demonstrated neurotoxicity, (see relevant section, above), GHB has neuroprotective properties, and has been found to protect cells from hypoxia. == Natural fermentation by-product == GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation and so is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, in particular fruit wines. The amount found in wine is pharmacologically insignificant and not sufficient to produce psychoactive effects. == Pharmacology == GHB has at least two distinct binding sites in the central nervous system. GHB acts as an agonist at the inhibitory GHB receptor and as a weak agonist at the inhibitory GABAB receptor. GHB is a naturally occurring substance that acts in a similar fashion to some neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain. GHB is probably synthesized from GABA in GABAergic neurons, and released when the neurons fire. GHB has been found to activate oxytocinergic neurons in the supraoptic nucleus. If taken orally, GABA itself does not effectively cross the blood–brain barrier. GHB induces the accumulation of either a derivative of tryptophan or tryptophan itself in the extracellular space, possibly by increasing tryptophan transport across the blood–brain barrier. The blood content of certain neutral amino-acids, including tryptophan, is also increased by peripheral GHB administration. GHB-induced stimulation of tissue serotonin turnover may be due to an increase in tryptophan transport to the brain and in its uptake by serotonergic cells. As the serotonergic system may be involved in the regulation of sleep, mood, and anxiety, the stimulation of this system by high doses of GHB may be involved in certain neuropharmacological events induced by GHB administration. However, at therapeutic doses, GHB reaches much higher concentrations in the brain and activates GABAB receptors, which are primarily responsible for its sedative effects. GHB's sedative effects are blocked by GABAB antagonists. The role of the GHB receptor in the behavioural effects induced by GHB is more complex. GHB receptors are densely expressed in many areas of the brain, including the cortex and hippocampus, and these are the receptors that GHB displays the highest affinity for. There has been somewhat limited research into the GHB receptor; however, there is evidence that activation of the GHB receptor in some brain areas results in the release of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter. Drugs that selectively activate the GHB receptor cause absence seizures in high doses, as do GHB and GABAB agonists. Activation of both the GHB receptor and GABAB is responsible for the addictive profile of GHB. GHB's effect on dopamine release is biphasic. Low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the GHB receptor. Higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via GABAB receptors as do other GABAB agonists such as baclofen and phenibut. After an initial phase of inhibition, dopamine release is then increased via the GHB receptor. Both the inhibition and increase of dopamine release by GHB are inhibited by opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone. Dynorphin may play a role in the inhibition of dopamine release via kappa opioid receptors. This explains the paradoxical mix of sedative and stimulatory properties of GHB, as well as the so-called ""rebound"" effect, experienced by individuals using GHB as a sleeping agent, wherein they awake suddenly after several hours of GHB-induced deep sleep. That is to say that, over time, the concentration of GHB in the system decreases below the threshold for significant GABAB receptor activation and activates predominantly the GHB receptor, leading to wakefulness. Recently, analogs of GHB, such as 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid (UMB68) have been synthesised and tested on animals, in order to gain a better understanding of GHB's mode of action. Analogues of GHB such as 3-methyl-GHB, 4-methyl-GHB, and 4-phenyl-GHB have been shown to produce similar effects to GHB in some animal studies, but these compounds are even less well researched than GHB itself. Of these analogues, only 4-methyl-GHB (γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, GHV) and a prodrug form γ-valerolactone (GVL) have been reported as drugs of abuse in humans, and on the available evidence seem to be less potent but more toxic than GHB, with a particular tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. Other prodrug ester forms of GHB have also rarely been encountered by law enforcement, including 1,4-butanediol diacetate (BDDA/DABD), methyl-4-acetoxybutanoate (MAB), and ethyl-4-acetoxybutanoate (EAB), but these are, in general, covered by analogue laws in jurisdictions where GHB is illegal, and little is known about them beyond their delayed onset and longer duration of action. The intermediate compound γ-hydroxybutyraldehyde (GHBAL) is also a prodrug for GHB; however, as with all aliphatic aldehydes this compound is caustic and is strong-smelling and foul-tasting; actual use of this compound as an intoxicant is likely to be unpleasant and result in severe nausea and vomiting. Only a minor portion (1–5%) of the administered GHB dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Studies have shown that the maximum concentration of GHB in urine appears within 1 hour and rapidly declines thereafter. The vast majority (95–98%) undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver. GHB is broken down through a series of enzymatic pathways. The primary route involves conversion to succinic semialdehyde (SSA) by either GHB dehydrogenase (ADH) or GHB transhydrogenase. SSA is further oxidized by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) to succinic acid, which enters the Krebs cycle and is ultimately converted into carbon dioxide and water. Both of the metabolic breakdown pathways shown for GHB can run in either direction, depending on the concentrations of the substances involved, so the body can make its own GHB either from GABA or from succinic semialdehyde. Under normal physiological conditions, the concentration of GHB in the body is rather low, and the pathways would run in the reverse direction to what is shown here to produce endogenous GHB. However, when GHB is consumed for recreational or health promotion purposes, its concentration in the body is much higher than normal, which changes the enzyme kinetics so that these pathways operate to metabolise GHB rather than producing it. == History == Alexander Zaytsev worked on this chemical family and published work on it in 1874. The first extended research into GHB and its use in humans was conducted in the early 1960s by Henri Laborit to use in studying the neurotransmitter GABA.: 11–12 It was studied in a range of uses including obstetric surgery and during childbirth and as an anxiolytic; there were anecdotal reports of it having antidepressant and aphrodisiac effects as well.: 27 It was also studied as an intravenous anesthetic agent and was marketed for that purpose starting in 1964 in Europe but it was not widely adopted as it caused seizures; as of 2006 that use was still authorized in France and Italy but not widely used.: 27–28 It was also studied to treat alcohol addiction; while the evidence for this use is weak;: 28–29 however, sodium oxybate is marketed for this use in Italy. GHB and sodium oxybate were also studied for use in narcolepsy from the 1960s onwards.: 28 In May 1990 GHB was introduced as a dietary supplement and was marketed to body builders, for help with weight control and as a sleep aid, and as a ""replacement"" for l-tryptophan, which was removed from the market in November 1989 when batches contaminated with trace impurities were found to cause eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome, although eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome is also tied to tryptophan overload. In 2001 tryptophan supplement sales were allowed to resume, and in 2005 the FDA ban on tryptophan supplement importation was lifted. By November 1989 57 cases of illness caused by the GHB supplements had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with people having taken up to three teaspoons of GHB; there were no deaths but nine people needed care in an intensive care unit. The FDA issued a warning in November 1990 that sale of GHB was illegal. GHB continued to be manufactured and sold illegally and it and analogs were adopted as a club drug and came to be used as a date rape drug, and the DEA made seizures and the FDA reissued warnings several times throughout the 1990s. At the same time, research on the use of GHB in the form of sodium oxybate had formalized, as a company called Orphan Medical had filed an investigational new drug application and was running clinical trials with the intention of gaining regulatory approval for use to treat narcolepsy.: 18–25, 28 : 10 A popular children's toy, Bindeez (also known as Aqua Dots, in the United States), produced by Melbourne company Moose, was banned in Australia in early November 2007 when it was discovered that 1,4-butanediol (1,4-B), which is metabolized into GHB, had been substituted for the non-toxic plasticiser 1,5-pentanediol in the bead manufacturing process. Three young children were hospitalized as a result of ingesting a large number of the beads, and the toy was recalled. == Legal status == In the United States, GHB was placed on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in March 2000. However, used in sodium oxybate under an IND or NDA from the US FDA, it is considered a Schedule III substance but with Schedule I trafficking penalties, one of several drugs that are listed in multiple schedules. On 20 March 2001, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs placed GHB in Schedule IV of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In the UK GHB was made a class C drug in June 2003. In October 2013 the ACMD recommended upgrading it from schedule IV to schedule II in line with UN recommendations. Their report concluded that the minimal use of Xyrem in the UK meant that prescribers would be minimally inconvenienced by the rescheduling. This advice was followed and GHB was moved to schedule 2 on 7 January 2015. In April 2022 GHB was changed from class C to class B. In Hong Kong, GHB is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. It can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined HK$10,000. The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a HK$150,000 fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a HK$100,000 fine or five years of jail time. In Canada, GHB has been a Schedule I controlled substance since 6 November 2012 (the same schedule that contains heroin and cocaine). Prior to that date, it was a Schedule III controlled substance (the same schedule that contains amphetamines and LSD). In New Zealand and Australia, GHB, 1,4-B, and GBL are all Class B illegal drugs, along with any possible esters, ethers, and aldehydes. GABA itself is also listed as an illegal drug in these jurisdictions, which seems unusual given its failure to cross the blood–brain barrier, but there was a perception among legislators that all known analogues should be covered as far as this was possible. Attempts to circumvent the illegal status of GHB have led to the sale of derivatives such as 4-methyl-GHB (γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, GHV) and its prodrug form γ-valerolactone (GVL), but these are also covered under the law by virtue of their being ""substantially similar"" to GHB or GBL, so importation, sale, possession and use of these compounds is also considered to be illegal. In Chile, GHB is a controlled drug under the law Ley de substancias psicotrópicas y estupefacientes (psychotropic substances and narcotics). In Norway and in Switzerland, GHB is considered a narcotic and is only available by prescription under the trade name Xyrem (Union Chimique Belge S.A.). Sodium oxybate is also used therapeutically in Italy under the brand name Alcover for treatment of alcohol withdrawal and dependence. == See also == Beta-Hydroxybutyric acid γ-Hydroxyvaleric acid (GHV) γ-Valerolactone (GVL) β-Hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid (HMB) == References == == External links == Gamma-hydroxybutyrate MS Spectrum EMCDDA Report on the risk assessment of GHB in the framework of the joint action on new synthetic drugs Erowid GHB Vault (also contains information about addiction and dangers) InfoFacts – Rohypnol and GHB (National Institute on Drug Abuse)",Gamma hydroxy butyrate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.07901041209697723), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.0036226429510861635), ('OG', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ENO', -5.860340752406046e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -7.588793960167095e-05), (' FOOD', -6.265633419388905e-05)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.012340971268713474), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -4.0531076592742465e-06), ('ĠEND', -0.0082694748416543), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -3.814689989667386e-06), (',', -0.00043132537393830717), ('ĠFOOD', -0.008748182095587254), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5759734511375427)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.25193047523498535), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -0.0001584850688232109), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%93-Hydroxybutyric_acid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=123, start_index=27, title='Γ-Hydroxybutyric acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%93-Hydroxybutyric_acid?utm_source=openai')])"
4591,"('Cyclopentolate hcl', 'Cyplegin', 'Cyclogyl', 'Mydrilate', 'Cyclopentolate (hydrochloride)')",Medical,"Cyclopentolate is a muscarinic antagonist. It is commonly used as an eye drop during pediatric eye examinations to dilate the eye (mydriatic) and prevent the eye from focusing/accommodating (cycloplegic). Cyclopentolate or atropine can also be administered to reverse muscarinic and central nervous system effects of indirect cholinomimetic (anti-AChase) administration. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. After instillation of cyclopentolate, pupil dilation (mydriasis) typically lasts up to 24 hours, while paralysis of the ciliary muscle (cycloplegia) typically lasts 6-24 hours. During this time, patients may be more light sensitive than normal and may notice close objects blurred (and possibly distant objects blurred, depending on the patient's visual system). Cyclopentolate is often chosen as a milder, shorter-lasting, cycloplegic alternative to atropine, another cycloplegic agent which lasts much longer. Tropicamide is an even shorter-lasting cycloplegic than cyclopentolate, but is less reliable for finding latent hyperopia. Cyclopentolate drops act rapidly to dilate the pupil. The side and adverse effects of cyclopentolate are similar to the side and adverse effects of other anticholinergic medications. Because of that, extra caution should be taken when prescribing cyclopentolate to patients who are already taking other anticholinergic drugs. A possible ocular (eye-related) side effect is increase in pressure inside the eye, which is of particular concern when there is a predisposition toward or a presence of glaucoma. Other ocular side effects can include burning sensations, discomfort with bright light (photophobia), blurred vision, irritation, inflammation of the eye mucous membranes (conjunctivitis), inflammation of the cornea of the eye (keratitis), and other issues. Nonocular (not eye-related) side and adverse effects can include neuropsychiatric symptoms. like subtle concentration and memory problems, subtle decision-making problems, drowsiness, and more pronounced disorientation to time and place, confusion, disturbances of speech and movement, hyperactivity, restlessness, and seizures. Temporary psychosis can develop that includes hallucinations, particularly when higher doses are used in children or older adults on other anticholinergic medications. Patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type can experience worsening of their dementia symptoms. Additional side and adverse effects can include skin flushing, skin rashes, gastrointestinal problems, increased heart beat (tachycardia), increased body temperature (hyperpyrexia), blood vessel dilation, urinary retention, dry mouth and reduced sweating, and reduced bronchial secretions. Severe poisoning with cyclopentolate may result in coma, paralysis of breathing, and death. Cyclopentolate derivatives can be used as an antidote for organophosphate poisoning. Lethality of cyclopentolate has been studied in rodents. The LD50 (the dose at which 50% of animals die from the drug) is approximately 4000 mg/kg in rats and 960 mg/kg in mice. Readily recognizable symptoms of overdose include tachycardia, dizziness, dry mouth, behavioral disturbances, uncoordination, and drowsiness. Cycloplegia is necessary in cases of suspected latent hyperopia (or ""over-focusing"") so that an ophthalmologist or optometrist can accurately measure how much a person has to flex their focusing muscle (accommodation) in order to see in the distance and up-close. Correction of latent hyperopia in children can often prevent, or sometimes correct, unwanted eye turns (strabismus), some forms of refractive amblyopia, and may alleviate eye strain or frontal headaches caused by prolonged near-work. Cycloplegia is also helpful in relieving accommodative spasm. == History == Cyclopentolate was first synthesized in 1952 as a chemical analogue of atropine. It was one of several derivatives of an analogue to tropic acid which were tested for pharmacological action ""in a search for new and better antispasmodic agents.""

The results indicated that the commercially supplied MES consisted almost entirely of one diastereoisomeric pair, which was in agreement with previous findings reported by Eap et al. The synthesised sample of MES was analysed by NMR in two stages: 1) as the initial product isolated as the free base from the direct synthesis, and 2) as the free base isolated from the crystallised besylate salt of the synthetic product. The NMR results show that the initial synthetic product consisted of two equal pairs of diastereoisomers. The diastereoisomeric pairs were further separated by the addition of the chiral shift reagent (R)-(-)-N-(3,5 dinitrobenzoyl)-alpha-benzylamine to reveal equal quantities of all four enantiomers, clearly observed at the methyl sulfoxide proton peak of the NMR scan. The sample obtained from the crystallisation of MES besylate, however, indicated a significant difference, with a diastereoisomeric ratio of 75:25.

Dragomir, a nationalist against the anti-corruption policies of the country and a former Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) member, stated that EU membership was affecting Romanian national sovereignty and that Brussels was ""robbing from us"". This statement has been proven to be false, as Romania then received more money than it gave to the EU. He said this after Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission, criticized the justice reforms that were then taking place in Romania. Dragomir published a list of 10 reasons why the country should leave the EU. Some political parties in Romania advocate the proposal as well. An example is Noua Dreaptă, a far-right party, opposes Romanian presence in the EU and NATO. However, some pro-EU politicians like Corina Crețu, a former European Commissioner for Regional Policy, criticized the idea, calling it a ""luxury"" and listing several moments in which the EU has helped the country. Victor Negrescu, the then Romanian Minister Delegate for European Affairs, said the idea is not taken into account at political level in the country and that it has only been created to ""stir controversy"". He instead advocated for the integration of Romania in European politics. In December 2020, the Eurosceptic party Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), which has been described as far-right, entered the Romanian Parliament for the first time and became the 4th largest party in the country, although it is unclear whether it supports leaving the EU or not. In 2021, the senator Diana Iovanovici Șoșoacă, a former AUR member then affiliated with the Romanian Nationhood Party (PNR), expressed her support for a Romanian withdrawal from the EU. Furthermore, some examples of non-politicians supporting this include Romanian actor Mihai Mălaimare, who expressed his support for the withdrawal of Romania from the EU in 2022; and Romanian actor and director Dan Puric, who has affirmed that the EU will fall, that it has a neo-Marxist ideology, that it is opposed to Christianity and that it has the objective of harming Romania. In March 2025, then Romanian presidential candidate Călin Georgescu proposed that a referendum be held about Romania's continued EU and NATO membership. == Public opinion == Euroscepticism is generally not very popular among Romanians. According to a poll from 2015, 65.6% of Romanians thought that joining the EU had been beneficial for their country. This represented a very notable change compared to a 2013 poll; only 35% saw the EU as beneficial. Furthermore, 58% agreed with the adoption of the euro in 2015 compared to 35% in 2013. Later, in a poll conducted in 2022, 71.1% of respondents said they would not vote to leave the EU compared with 25.2% who would, which again represented an increase of support to the EU among Romanians. == See also == == References == == External links == The dictionary definition of Roexit at Wiktionary",Roxit,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -8.761498611420393e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015670888824388385)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -7.941850526549388e-06)])","('MEDICAL;https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/roxit,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/roxit,https://www.invivochem.com/roxatidine-acetate-hcl.html ', [])"

It is used for a number of diseases including rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, skin diseases such as dermatitis and psoriasis, allergic conditions such as asthma and angioedema, preterm labor to speed the development of the baby's lungs, Crohn's disease, cancers such as leukemia, and along with fludrocortisone for adrenocortical insufficiency, among others. It can be taken by mouth, injected into a muscle, or applied to the skin, typically in cream, lotion, or liquid forms. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, muscle weakness, severe allergic reactions, and psychosis. Long-term use may cause adrenal insufficiency. Stopping the medication suddenly following long-term use may be dangerous. The cream commonly results in increased hair growth and skin irritation. Betamethasone belongs to the glucocorticoid class of medication. It is a stereoisomer of dexamethasone, the two compounds differing only in the spatial configuration of the methyl group at position 16 (see steroid nomenclature). Betamethasone was patented in 1958, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1961. The cream and ointment are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 263rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that is available as a pill, by injection, and as an ointment, cream, lotion, gel, or aerosol (spray) for the skin, and a foam for the scalp. When given by injection, anti-inflammatory effects begin in around two hours and last for seven days. It is used as a topical cream to relieve skin irritation, such as itching and flaking from eczema. It is used as a treatment for local psoriasis, as betamethasone dipropionate and salicylic acid, or as the combination calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate. Betamethasone sodium phosphate is used orally and via injection with the same indications as other steroids. Many betamethasone-based pharmaceuticals include the steroid as the valerate ester. In a randomized controlled trial betamethasone was shown to reduce some of the ataxia (poor coordination) symptoms associated with ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) by 28-31%. Betamethasone is also used to stimulate fetal maturation of the lungs and cerebral blood vessels. A cream with 0.05% betamethasone appears effective in treating phimosis in boys, and often averts the need for circumcision. Longer-term research is needed on this treatment method. This approach has replaced circumcision as the preferred treatment method for some physicians in the British National Health Service. == Side effects == Euphoria Depression Adrenal suppression Hypertension Groupings of fine blood vessels becoming prominent under the skin, petechiae Excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) Ecchymoses Betamethasone crosses the placenta. When injected into the epidural space or the spine, it may cause serious side effects like loss of vision, stroke, and paralysis. == Pharmacology == == Forms == Betamethasone is available in a number of compound forms: betamethasone dipropionate (branded as Diprosone, Diprolene, Celestamine, Procort (in Pakistan), and others), betamethasone sodium phosphate (branded as Bentelan in Italy) and betamethasone valerate (branded as Audavate, Betnovate, Celestone, Fucibet, and others). In the United States and Canada, betamethasone is mixed with clotrimazole and sold as Lotrisone and Lotriderm. It is also available in combination with salicylic acid (branded as Diprosalic) for using in psoriatic skin conditions. In some countries, it is also sold mixed with both clotrimazole and gentamicin to add an antibacterial agent to the mix.

Emphasis has been placed on the stability problems which could arise upon dilution of proprietary preparations by the use of model systems. Betamethasone-17-valerate has been shown to decompose to betamethasone-21-valerate and betamethasone alcohol. Quantitation of the decomposition was by direct densitometry on thin layer chromatographic plates. The decomposition was found to be an apparent first order process and to depend on the diluent used and its concentration. Attempts were also made to relate the rate of decomposition to the pH of the base used, and to stabilize the products. Simultaneous diffusion and metabolism of betamethasone 17-valerate was studied using betamethasone 17-valerate, betamethasone 21-valerate, and betamethasone as permeants. These corticosteroids were suspended in silicone adhesive and applied to an artificial living skin equivalent (LSE) for 72 h. When betamethasone was applied, no metabolites were detected in the receptor medium. Conversely, with betamethasone 21-valerate application, only betamethasone but no betamethasone 21-valerate was detected in the receptor medium indicating the metabolism of the latter by skin esterases. When tested with the theory for simultaneous diffusion and metabolism, the result is consistent with the enzyme rate constant in the LSE homogenate measured in a previous study. When betamethasone 17-valerate was applied to the LSE, more than half of the total amount of corticosteroids detected in the receptor medium was unchanged, consistent with the previously reported chemical (as opposed to enzymatic) degradation half-life of about 8 h. This result also indicated that very little metabolism of betamethasone 17-valerate occurred in the skin. The metabolism of betamethasone 17-valerate was estimated using an artificial living skin equivalent (LSE). Betamethasone 17-valerate, betamethasone 21-valerate and betamethasone were measured by a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. Betamethasone 17-valerate was added to the culture medium with or without LSE homogenate. Degradation profiles (%) of betamethasone 17-valerate remaining in the culture medium with skin homogenate did not differ from those without homogenate.

4598,"('Nicotine', '(s)-nicotine', '(s)-3-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)pyridine', 'Habitrol', 'Nicoderm')",Medical,"Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medically approved way to treat people with tobacco use disorder by taking nicotine through means other than tobacco. It is used to help with quitting smoking or stopping chewing tobacco. It increases the chance of quitting tobacco smoking by about 55%. Often it is used along with other behavioral techniques. NRT has also been used to treat ulcerative colitis. Types of NRT include the adhesive patch, chewing gum, lozenges, nose spray, and inhaler. The use of multiple types of NRT at a time may increase effectiveness. Common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the gum include nausea, hiccups, and irritation of the mouth. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning and continued addiction. They do not appear to increase the risk of heart attacks. There are possible harms to the baby if used during pregnancy. Nicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings caused by nicotine addiction. They were first approved for use in 1984, in the United States. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. They are available as generic medications. == Medical uses == Nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of gum, patches, nasal spray, inhaler and lozenges all improve the ability of people trying to quit tobacco products. Nicotine replacement therapy is as effective as medications, such as bupropion, in helping people quit smoking for at least six months. All forms of nicotine replacement therapy, including nicotine gum, patches, nasal spray, inhalers, and lozenges, have similar success rates in terms of helping people stop smoking. However, the likelihood that someone will stick to a certain treatment varies, with compliance being the highest with nicotine patches, followed by nicotine gum, inhalers, and nasal sprays. Using a few different nicotine replacement methods in combination may improve success rates in stopping tobacco use. Additionally, using nicotine replacement with counseling has been proven to improve tobacco abstinence rates. These other strategies include: creating a plan to quit and utilizing quit programs, a quit phone line, or app that provides tips and inspiration to help quit. Using nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking should be considered for people who are severely dependent on nicotine. People who are severely dependent include those who smoke: more than one pack per day, within five minutes of awakening, while ill, when they wake up in the middle of the night, to ease withdrawal signs and symptoms. Nicotine replacement products are most beneficial for heavy smokers who smoke more than 15 cigarettes per day. There are not enough studies to show whether NRT helps those who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day. === Effectiveness === Evaluation of NRT in real-world studies produces more modest outcomes than efficacy studies conducted by industry-funded trials. The National Health Service (NHS) in England has a smoking cessation service based on pharmacotherapy in combination with counseling support. An Action on Smoking and Health (UK) (ASH) report claims that the average cost per life-year gained for every smoker successfully treated by these services is less than £1,000 (below the NICE guidelines of £20,000 per QALY (quality-adjusted life year). However, the investment in NHS stop smoking services is relatively low. A comparison with treatment costs for illicit drug users shows that £585 million is committed for 350,000 problem drug users compared to £56 million for 9 million users of tobacco. This is £6.20 for each smoker, compared to £1,670 per illegal drug user. The claims for high efficacy and cost-effectiveness of NRT have not been substantiated in real-world effectiveness studies. Pierce and Gilpin (2002) stated their conclusion as follows: ""Since becoming available over the counter, NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation"" (p. 1260). Efficacy studies, which are conducted using randomized controlled trials, do not transfer very well to real-world effectiveness. Bauld, Bell, McCullough, Richardson and Greaves (2009) reviewed 20 studies on the effectiveness of intensive NHS treatments for smoking cessation published between 1990 and 2007. Quit rates showed a dramatic decrease between 4-weeks and one year. A quit rate of 53% at four weeks fell to only 15% at one year. Younger smokers, females, pregnant smokers and more deprived smokers had lower quit rates than other groups. The efficacy for each of the formulations alone (lozenges, nasal spray, gum, and transdermal patch) to aid in smoking cessation is equal. Efficacy increases 15% to 36% with combining treatments such as gum and lozenges. Higher doses increase the chance of stopping smoking for a period of six months and more. For patches, the most efficient doses were 25 mg worn over 16 hours or 21 mg worn over 24 hours. The evidence suggests that 4 mg nicotine gum leads to higher quit rates compared with 2 mg in heavy smokers. == Toxicity == N-Nitrosonornicotine, a strong carcinogen present in unburned tobacco and cigarette smoke, has been found in the urine of some users of oral NRT products. Nicotine patches is an alternative. == Side effects == Some side effects are caused by the nicotine, and are common to NRT products. Other common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the gum include nausea, hiccups, and irritation of the mouth. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. To minimize local skin reactions from the patch, the application site should be moved daily. The nicotine patch can also cause strange dreams if worn while asleep. Nasal sprays commonly cause nasal irritation, watering eyes, and coughing. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning, which includes symptoms like visual disturbances, hyper-salivation, nausea, and vomiting; and continued addiction to nicotine products. Avoiding smoking and other products with nicotine are recommended since it may lead to nicotine overdose. Although overdose is rare, it can be problematic, especially in children and pets. The symptoms of nicotine overdose include headache, pale skin and mouth, belly pain, weakness, diarrhea, tremors or seizures, agitation, confusion, restlessness, high or low blood pressure, fast or irregular heartbeat, fast breathing, and cold sweats. Limited evidence exists regarding long-term NRT use. == Safety == === Pregnancy === Nicotine is not safe to use in any amount during pregnancy. Nicotine crosses the placenta and is found in the breast milk of mothers who smoke as well as mothers who inhale passive smoke. There are possible harms to the baby if NRT is used during pregnancy. Thus, pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding should also consult a physician before initiating NRT. The gum, lozenge, and nasal spray are pregnancy category C. The transdermal patch is pregnancy category D. The transdermal patch is considered less safe for the fetus because it delivers continuous nicotine exposure, as opposed to the gum or lozenge, which delivers intermittent and thus lower nicotine exposure. Strong evidence suggests that nicotine cannot be regarded as a safe substance of cigarette use. Nicotine itself could be at least partly responsible for many of the adverse after birth health results related to cigarette use while the mother was pregnant. There is evidence that nicotine negatively affects fetal brain development and pregnancy outcomes. There is also risk of stillbirth and pre-term birth. Nicotine use will probably harm fetal neurological development. Risks to the child later in life from nicotine exposure during pregnancy include type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, neurobehavioral defects, respiratory dysfunction, and infertility. Nicotine exposure during pregnancy can result in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disabilities in the child. It also puts the child at increased risk for nicotine addiction in the future. Pregnant women should consider behavioral therapy before NRT is considered. === Youth === In people under the age of eighteen, a physician is often consulted before starting NRT. The evidence suggests that exposure to nicotine between the ages of 10 and 25 years causes lasting harm to the brain and cognitive ability. Evidence is unclear whether adolescents gain benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy or smoking cessation over the long-term as of 2017. Most tobacco users are under-eighteens when they start, and almost no-one over the age of 25 starts using. === Cardiovascular conditions === While there is no evidence that NRT can increase the risk of heart attacks, individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or recent heart attacks should consult a physician before initiating NRT. Smoking is known to cause cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Cigarette smoking is the cause of 20% of all cardiovascular deaths in the United States, which is the leading cause of mortality. === Other conditions === Nicotine replacement therapies should be used cautiously in individuals with the following conditions: severe reactive airway diseases (for nasal spray), chronic nasal disorders such as sinusitis, polyps, rhinitis, or allergy (for nasal spray), diabetes (insulin-dependent), gastrointestinal diseases such as esophagitis, active gastric or peptic ulcer disease, liver problems, hyperthyroidism,pheochromocytoma, phenylketonuria (for lozenges), renal problems, and skin conditions such as psoriasis or dermatitis (for the transdermal patch). == Mechanism of action == Nicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings due to nicotine addiction. Smoking cigarettes releases high doses of nicotine to the brain in a matter of seconds as opposed to low doses released over a period of minutes to hours by the various forms of nicotine replacement therapy. Nicotine from NRT does not reach as high a concentration in the blood as does nicotine from smoke inhalation due to different absorption methods. NRT relies on systemic venous absorption, whereas nicotine from cigarettes reaches the arterial system. Nicotine replacement products vary in the time it takes for the nicotine to enter the body and the total time nicotine stays in the body. The more quickly a dose of nicotine is delivered and absorbed, the higher the addiction risk. It is possible to become dependent on some NRTs. Nicotine patches are applied to the skin and continuously administer a stable dose of nicotine slowly over 16–24 hours. Nicotine gum, nicotine sprays, nicotine toothpicks, nicotine sublingual tablets, and nicotine lozenges administer nicotine orally with quicker nicotine uptake into the body but lasting a shorter amount of time. Nicotine inhalers are metered-dose inhalers that administer nicotine through the lungs and mucous membranes of the throat quickly, lasting for a short amount of time. For example, blood nicotine levels are the highest 5–10 minutes after using the nicotine nasal spray, 20 minutes after using a nicotine inhaler or chewing nicotine gum, and 2–4 hours after using a nicotine patch. == Society and culture == NRT products were first approved for use in the United States in 1984. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.. They are available as generic medication. === Formulations === The nicotine patch is a once-daily, longer-acting form of NRT. An advantage of the nicotine patch is its simple compliance; it does not require active use throughout the day. The gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, oral inhaler, oral spray, and nasal spray are acutely dosed products, providing the user with the benefit and ability of self-titrating based on cravings. Brand names include Commit Lozenge, Nicoderm, Nicogum, Nicorette, Nicotex, Nicotinell, and Thrive. NRT products contain similar pharmaceutical grade nicotine as is used in e-cigarettes. === Medicines === In 2015, the United States Public Health Service listed seven agents for the stopping of tobacco, which included five nicotine replacement treatments (nicotine patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays) and two oral medications (bupropion and varenicline). Other NRT options are available, including nicotine mouth sprays and sublingual tablets. === Dosing === The dose of nicotine replacement therapy products is generally based on if the user is considered a heavy, average, or light smoker. A cigarette delivers an average of 1 mg to 3 mg of the nicotine contained in it. NRT products typically aim to parallel this, but the amount of nicotine absorbed by the user is less than the original dose. Nicotine nasal sprays are formulated in doses of lowest strength, available in 0.5 mg and 1 mg strengths. Nicotine lozenges deliver doses as low as 1 mg up to 4 mg. It is not chewed as the gum would be, and dissolves in approximately 30 minutes. This formulation may be preferred by those individuals who do not find gum chewing to be acceptable. Nicotine gum is available in doses of 2 mg and 4 mg. Using 4 mg nicotine gum versus 2 mg gum increases the likelihood of successful smoking cessation. When using the gum, acidic beverages like soda, coffee, or beer should be avoided fifteen minutes prior and during use because they can impede proper absorption of nicotine. Nicotine inhalers come in 10 mg and 15 mg cartridge strengths and typically deliver around 4 mg in one dose. The inhaler may be preferred in individuals who want to satisfy the hand-to-mouth ritual that smoking provides. Transdermal patches deliver between 5 mg and 52.5 mg of nicotine, which results in plasma levels similar to that of heavy smokers. Combining nicotine patch treatment with a faster nicotine-delivery means, like nicotine gum or spray, improves the likelihood of successful treatment. === Not approved as NRTs === Some smokeless consumer products available can function as alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS) but they have not received FDA approval as smoking-cessation therapy aids that are safe and effective. Snus and nasal snuff also allow for nicotine administration outside of tobacco smoking. Nicotine pouches are described as similar to or a tobacco-free variant of snus. They are pre-portioned and are held in the user's lip or cheek allowing for sublingual or buccal delivery of flavors and high doses of nicotine. The small pouches are not like chewing tobacco, as the user does not need to spit since the contents of the pouches stay inside during use. Swedish pouches have been available on the American consumer market since at least 2016 but their popularity and controversy surged in 2019 and 2020. In the US and UK concerns have been raised that nicotine pouches are seemingly too similar to banned snus products, is aimed at teenagers, further complicating the youth vaping trend, falling into the hands of adolescents easily, and are discrete enough to easily pass for regular gums or lozenges. Nicotine infused toothpicks are another product that has been available in the United States since at least 2013. They can have a total nicotine delivery that is comparable to that of nicotine gum. Nicotine toothpicks generally are infused with food-grade flavorings and 1–3 mg of nicotine, which is similar to that of other oral-delivery nicotine products and some cigarettes. In spite of these similarities, as of 2018 they have been a subject of controversy. Online retailers have been under scrutiny for allowing their products to be too easily purchased by youth. Various news outlets and school districts have expressed the concern that these products have a high appeal to minors wanting to experiment with nicotine due to; the multitude of sweet flavors offered, ease & speed of use, seeming innocuous, and having a discreet nature. In 2015, NRT sales fell for the first time since 2008 while sales for e-cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) continued to increase at a substantial rate. The evidence is that UK smokers are trying to quit with e-cigarettes rather than NRT methods. E-cigarettes are often, although not always, designed to look and feel like cigarettes. They have been marketed as less harmful alternatives to cigarettes, but very few are as yet approved as NRTs in any jurisdiction. Some electronic cigarettes have coarsely adjustable nicotine levels. Some healthcare groups have hesitated to recommend e-cigarettes for quitting smoking, because of limited evidence of effectiveness and safety. However, more recent review show the opposite, possibly because of newer types of e‐cigarettes have better nicotine delivery than older one. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a list of additional tobacco products they are seeking to regulate, including electronic cigarettes. Most approved NRT products have been approved for over 20 years, however the FDA has also approved nicotine inhalers as a form of NRT. Future approaches of NRT could include nicotine preloading, a true pulmonary inhaler, and nicotine vaccines. Nicotine preloading, otherwise known as pre-cessation or pre-quitting NRT, has found that using the patch for a few weeks before the quit date produces significantly higher quit rates than if it was started on the quit day. The true pulmonary inhaler would deliver nicotine to the lungs in a manner that more resembles cigarette smoking, which would provide better relief of background cravings as well as acute cravings. Nicotine vaccines are under investigation as a method to treat tobacco dependence through priming the body to mount an immune response against nicotine. == References == == External links == ""Nicotine"".

4599,"('Nicotine', 'Nikotin', '(r,s)-nicotine', 'Black leaf', 'Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-')",Medical,"Black spot leaf disease is a physiological plant disorder that affects some grape varieties such as Concord. It is essentially a potassium deficiency that causes the leaves on a vine to turn purple and eventually black as chlorophyll is lost. For vine growers this lack of chlorophyll inhibits the vine's ability to transmit sugar to the grape, leaving the resulting grapes with a low brix count that may be less than ideal for wine making. == Causes == Black leaf, also known as black spot disease can be caused by different types of fungi and bacteria. Most common being Asterina, Asterinella, Diplotheca, Glomerella, Gnomonia, Schizothyrium, Placosphaeria, and Stigmea. Black leaf can affect many different plant species in a wet, damp climate. It may appear as black spots on leaves, stems, and flowers. == Prevention and Treatment == Treating black leaf disease can be achieved in many ways. Some include removing each affected leaf of any yellow or black color. If the infection has spread throughout a larger area, it may be best to remove the affected limb of the plant to reduce further spread. Fungicides may be used as treatment. There are a number of remedies used to prevent the spread of black leaf disease, including mixtures of baking soda, soap, vegetable oil, and water. == References == == External links == Photosynthesis and Chlorophyll Fluorescence in Blackleaf-Affected Concord Leaves - American Society for Enology and Viticulture Blackleaf in Grapes Archived 2012-03-18 at the Wayback Machine on www.extension.org Black Spot Plant Disease Deal with Black Spot Leaf Disease",Black leaf,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.05251125991344452), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002295004203915596)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/B/Black%20Leaf.html,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cotinus-coggygria-leaf,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Solanum-nigrum-leaf,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Combretum-micranthum-leaf,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Rhus-typhina-leaf ', [])"
4600,"('Bupropion hydrochloride', 'Bupropion hcl', 'Wellbutrin', 'Amfebutamone hydrochloride', 'Zyban')",Medical,"Bupropion, formerly called amfebutamone, and sold under the brand name Wellbutrin among others, is an atypical antidepressant that is indicated in the treatment of major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and to support smoking cessation. It is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of ""incomplete response"" to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction, it is not associated with weight gain and sleepiness, and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue. Bupropion, particularly the immediate-release formulation, carries a higher risk of seizure than many other antidepressants, hence caution is recommended in patients with a history of seizure disorder. The medication is taken by mouth. Common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. Raised blood pressure is notable. Rare but serious side effects include seizures, liver toxicity, psychosis, and risk of overdose. Bupropion use during pregnancy may be associated with increased likelihood of congenital heart defects. Bupropion acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and a nicotinic receptor antagonist. However, its effects on dopamine are weak and clinical significance is contentious. Chemically, bupropion is an aminoketone that belongs to the class of substituted cathinones and more generally that of substituted amphetamines and substituted phenethylamines. Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta, who worked at Burroughs Wellcome, in 1969. It was first approved for medical use in the United States in 1985. Bupropion was originally called by the generic name amfebutamone, before being renamed in 2000. In 2022, it was the 21st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 25 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination dextromethorphan/bupropion to serve as a rapid-acting antidepressant in patients with major depressive disorder. == Medical uses == === Depression === The evidence overall supports the effectiveness of bupropion over placebo for the treatment of depression. Some peer-reviewed studies suggest the quality of evidence is low. Some meta-analyses report that bupropion has an at-most small effect size for depression. One meta-analysis reported a large effect size. However, there were methodological limitations with this meta-analysis, including using a subset of only five trials for the effect size calculation, substantial variability in effect sizes between the selected trials—which led the authors to state that their findings in this area should be interpreted with ""extreme caution""—and general lack of inclusion of unpublished trials in the meta-analysis. Unpublished trials are more likely to be negative in findings, and other meta-analyses have included unpublished trials. Evidence suggests that the effectiveness of bupropion for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants. Over the autumn and winter months, bupropion prevents the development of depression in those who have recurring seasonal affective disorder: 15% of participants on bupropion experienced a major depressive episode vs. 27% of those on placebo. Bupropion also improves depression in bipolar disorder, with the efficacy and risk of an affective switch being similar to other antidepressants. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction, and the occurrence of sexual side effects is not different from placebo. Bupropion treatment is not associated with weight gain; on the contrary, the majority of studies observed significant weight loss in bupropion-treated participants. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness that may be produced by other antidepressants. Bupropion is more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue in depressed patients. Bupropion is effective in the treatment of anxious depression and, contrary to common belief, does not exacerbate anxiety in this context. The effectiveness of bupropion for anxious depression is equivalent to that of SSRIs in the case of depression with low or moderate anxiety, whereas SSRIs show a modest effectiveness advantage in terms of response rates for depression with high anxiety. The addition of bupropion to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people do not respond to the SSRI, and it is supported by clinical trials; however, it appears to be inferior to the addition of atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole. === Smoking cessation === Prescribed as an aid for smoking cessation, bupropion reduces the severity of craving for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms such as depressed mood, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and increased appetite. Initially, bupropion slows the weight gain that often occurs in the first weeks after quitting smoking. With time, however, this effect becomes negligible. The bupropion treatment course lasts for seven to twelve weeks, with the patient halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. After the course, the effectiveness of bupropion for maintaining abstinence from smoking declines over time, from 37% of tobacco abstinence at 3 months to 20% at one year. It is unclear whether extending bupropion treatment helps to prevent relapse of smoking. Overall, six months after the therapy, bupropion increases the likelihood of quitting smoking by approximately 1.6-fold as compared to placebo. In this respect, bupropion is as effective as nicotine replacement therapy but inferior to varenicline. Combining bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy does not improve the quitting rate. In children and adolescents, the use of bupropion for smoking cessation does not appear to offer any significant benefits. The evidence for its use to aid smoking cessation in pregnant women is insufficient. === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === In the United States, the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not an approved indication of bupropion, and it is not mentioned in the 2019 guideline on ADHD treatment from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Systematic reviews of bupropion for the treatment of ADHD in both adults and children note that bupropion may be effective for ADHD but warn that this conclusion has to be interpreted with caution, because clinical trials were of low quality due to small sizes and risk of bias. Similarly to atomoxetine, bupropion has a delayed onset of action for ADHD, and several weeks of treatment are required for therapeutic effects. This is in contrast to stimulants, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate, which have an immediate onset of effect in the condition. === Sexual dysfunction === Bupropion is less likely than other antidepressants to cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies indicate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction including sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI antidepressants. There have also been small studies suggesting that bupropion or a bupropion/trazodone combination may improve some measures of sexual function in women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) and are not depressed. According to an expert consensus recommendation from the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, bupropion can be considered as an off-label treatment for HSDD despite limited safety and efficacy data. Likewise, a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of bupropion for sexual desire disorder in women reported that although data were limited, bupropion appeared to be dose-dependently effective for the condition. === Weight loss === Bupropion, when used for treating long-term weight gain over six to twelve months, results in an average weight loss of 2.7 kilograms (6.0 lb) over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other weight-loss medications such as sibutramine or orlistat. The combination drug naltrexone/bupropion has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity. === Other uses === Bupropion is not effective in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but it is showing promise in reducing drug use in treating amphetamine-type stimulant use and cravings. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. The drug may be useful in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and narcolepsy. Bupropion has been used to treat disorders of diminished motivation, like apathy, abulia, and akinetic mutism. Accordingly, the drug has been found to increase effort expenditure and improve motivational deficits in animal models. However, only limited benefits of bupropion in the treatment of apathy have been observed in clinical trials in various conditions. Bupropion has been used in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). === Available forms === Bupropion is available as an oral tablet in several different formulations. It is mainly formulated as the hydrochloride salt but also as the hydrobromide salt. In addition to single-drug formulations, bupropion is formulated in combinations including naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) for obesity and dextromethorphan/bupropion (Auvelity) for depression. == Contraindications == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescription label advises that bupropion should not be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents, and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation. == Side effects == The common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. Bupropion has the highest incidence of insomnia of all second-generation antidepressants, apart from desvenlafaxine. It is also associated with about 20% increased risk of headache. Bupropion raises blood pressure in some people. One study showed an average rise of 6 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure in 10% of patients. The prescribing information notes that hypertension, sometimes severe, is observed in some people taking bupropion, both with and without pre-existing hypertension. The safety of bupropion in people with cardiovascular conditions and its general cardiovascular safety profile remains unclear due to the lack of data. Seizure is a rare but serious adverse effect of bupropion. It is strongly dose-dependent: for the immediate release preparation, the seizure incidence is 0.4% at the dose 300–450 mg per day; the incidence climbs almost ten-fold for the higher than recommended dose of 600 mg. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07–0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally 0–0.5% at the recommended doses. Cases of liver toxicity leading to death or liver transplantation have been reported for bupropion. It is considered to be one of several antidepressants with a greater risk of hepatotoxicity. The prescribing information warns about bupropion triggering an angle-closure glaucoma attack. On the other hand, bupropion may decrease the risk of development of open angle glaucoma. Bupropion use by mothers in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a 23% increase in the odds of congenital heart defects in their children. Bupropion has rarely been associated with instances of Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Bupropion has not been associated with QT prolongation at therapeutic doses but has been associated with QT prolongation in overdose. === Psychiatric === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in people younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo. Bupropion prescribed for smoking cessation results in a 25% increase in the risk of psychiatric side effects, in particular, anxiety (about 40% increase) and insomnia (about 80% increase). The evidence is insufficient to determine whether bupropion is associated with suicides or suicidal behavior. In rare cases, bupropion-induced psychosis may develop. It is associated with higher doses of bupropion; many cases described are at higher than recommended doses. Concurrent antipsychotic medication appears to be protective. In most cases the psychotic symptoms are eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. Although studies are lacking, a handful of case reports suggest that abrupt discontinuation of bupropion may cause antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. == Overdose == Bupropion is considered moderately dangerous in overdose. According to an analysis of US National Poison Data System, adjusted for the number of prescriptions, bupropion and venlafaxine are the two new-generation antidepressants (i.e., non-tricyclic antidepressants) that result in the highest mortality and morbidity. For significant overdoses, seizures have been reported in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, having had multiple uncontrolled seizures and myocardial infarction. == Interactions == Since bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the enzyme CYP2B6, drug interactions with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes such medications as paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine (active metabolite of fluoxetine), diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected result is an increase of bupropion and a decrease in hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, and phenobarbital. Indeed, carbamazepine decreases exposure to bupropion by 90% and increases exposure to hydroxybupropion by 94%. Ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and efavirenz have been shown to decrease levels of bupropion and/or its metabolites. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel, both potent CYP2B6 inhibitors, have been found to considerably increase bupropion levels as well as decrease levels of its metabolite hydroxybupropion. Bupropion and its metabolites are inhibitors of CYP2D6, with hydroxybupropion responsible for most of the inhibition. Additionally, bupropion and its metabolites may decrease the expression of CYP2D6 in the liver. The end effect is a significant slowing of the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. For instance, bupropion has been found to increase area-under-the-curve of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, by 5-fold. Bupropion has also been found to increase levels of atomoxetine by 5.1-fold, while decreasing the exposure to its main metabolite by 1.5-fold. As another example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300 mg/day bupropion. When people on bupropion are given MDMA, about 30% increase of exposure to both drugs is observed, with enhanced mood but decreased heart rate effects of MDMA. Interactions with other CYP2D6 substrates, such as metoprolol, imipramine, nortriptyline, venlafaxine, and nebivolol have also been reported. However, in a notable exception, bupropion does not seem to affect the concentrations of CYP2D6 substrates fluoxetine and paroxetine. Bupropion prevents norepinephrine and dopamine release induced by methamphetamine and has been found to reduce the subjective and sympathomimetic effects of methamphetamine in humans. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold, and therefore can potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids. The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance. Caution should be observed when combining bupropion with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it may result in hypertensive crisis. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of bupropion in the treatment of depression and for other indications is unclear. However, it is thought to be related to the fact that bupropion is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and negative allosteric modulator of several nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Bupropion does not act as a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent. Pharmacological actions of bupropion, to a substantial degree, are due to its active metabolites hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion, and erythro-hydrobupropion that are present in the blood plasma at comparable or much higher levels. In fact, bupropion could accurately be conceptualized as a prodrug of these metabolites. Overall action of these metabolites, and particularly one enantiomer S,S-hydroxybupropion, is also characterized by inhibition of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake and nicotinic inhibition (see the chart on the right). Bupropion has no meaningful direct activity at a variety of receptors, including α- and β-adrenergic, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The occupancy of dopamine transporter (DAT) by bupropion (300 mg/day) and its metabolites in the human brain as measured by several positron emission tomography (PET) studies is approximately 20%, with a mean occupancy range of about 14 to 26%. For comparison, the NDRI methylphenidate at therapeutic doses is thought to occupy greater than 50% of DAT sites. In accordance with its low DAT occupancy, no measurable dopamine release in the human brain was detected with bupropion (one 150 mg dose) in a PET study. Bupropion has also been shown to increase striatal VMAT2, though it is unknown if this effect is more pronounced than other DRIs. These findings raise questions about the role of dopamine reuptake inhibition in the pharmacology of bupropion, and suggest that other actions may be responsible for its therapeutic effects. No data are available on occupancy of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) by bupropion and its metabolites. However, due to the increased exposure of hydroxybupropion over bupropion itself, which has higher affinity for the NET than the DAT, bupropion's overall pharmacological profile in humans may end up making it effectively more of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor than a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Accordingly, the clinical effects of bupropion are more consistent with noradrenergic activity than with dopaminergic actions. Bupropion has been claimed to be a sigma σ1 receptor agonist. Its antidepressant-like effects in rodents depend on σ1 receptor activation. They are enhanced and inhibited by σ1 receptor agonists and antagonists, respectively. However, no data on the binding or functional effects of bupropion at the human sigma receptors seem to be available. In any case, bupropion has been reported to bind to rodent σ1 receptors with IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 580 to 2,100 nM. In contrast to many other phenethylamines and amphetamines, bupropion is not an agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). Bupropion has been found to have a mixture of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory activity through modulation of the immune system. One such mechanism underlying these effects may be reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The catecholaminergic actions of bupropion may be involved in its immunomodulatory effects. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral administration, bupropion is rapidly and completely absorbed reaching the peak blood plasma concentration after 1.5 hours (tmax). Sustained-release (SR) and extended-release (XL) formulations have been designed to slow down absorption resulting in tmax of 3 hours and 5 hours, respectively. Absolute bioavailability of bupropion is unknown but is presumed to be low, at 5–20%, due to the first-pass metabolism. As for the relative bioavailability of the formulations, XL formulation has lower bioavailability (68%) compared to SR formulation and immediate release bupropion. Bupropion is metabolized in the body by a variety of pathways. The oxidative pathways are by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2B6 leading to R,R- and S,S-hydroxybupropion and, to a lesser degree, CYP2C19 leading to 4'-hydroxybupropion. The reductive pathways are by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in the liver and AKR7A2/AKR7A3 in the intestine leading to threo-hydrobupropion and by yet unknown enzyme leading to erythro-hydrobupropion. The metabolism of bupropion is highly variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest the same amount of the drug may differ by as much as 5.5 times (with a half-life of 12–30 hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7.5 times (with a half-life of 15–25 hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The metabolism of bupropion also seems to follow biphasic pharmacokinetics: the redistribution alpha phase with half-life of about 1 hour precedes the metabolism beta phase of about 12-30 hours. This might explain why abuse is unfeasible due to a short ""high"", as well as support the use of extended-release formulas to maintain a consistent concentration of bupropion. The metabolism of bupropion is highly species-dependent. As an example, oral bupropion results in hydroxybupropion levels that are 16-fold higher than those of bupropion itself in humans, whereas in rats, oral bupropion results in levels of bupropion that are 3.4-fold higher than those of hydroxybupropion. The species-dependent metabolism of bupropion is thought to be involved in species differences in its pharmacodynamic effects. For example, bupropion produces psychostimulant-like and reinforcing effects in rodents, whereas oral bupropion at therapeutic doses seems to have much less or no potential for such effects in humans. == Chemistry == Bupropion is an aminoketone that belongs to the class of substituted cathinones and the more general class of substituted phenethylamines. It is also known structurally as 3-chloro-N-tert-butyl-β-keto-α-methylphenethylamine, 3-chloro-N-tert-butyl-β-ketoamphetamine, or 3-chloro-N-tert-butylcathinone. The clinically used bupropion is racemic, which is a mixture of two enantiomers: S-bupropion and R-bupropion. Although the optical isomers on bupropion can be separated, they rapidly racemize under physiological conditions. Bupropion is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C13H18ClNO and a molecular weight of 239.74 g/mol. It is a highly lipophilic compound, with an experimental log P of 3.6. Pharmaceutically, bupropion is used mainly as the hydrochloride salt but also to a lesser extent as the hydrobromide salt. A number of analogues of bupropion exist, such as hydroxybupropion, radafaxine, and manifaxine, among others. These compounds are norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) similarly to bupropion. The analogues of bupropion with the N-tert-butyl group removed or replaced with an N-methyl group, 3-chlorocathinone (3-CC) and 3-chloromethcathinone (3-CMC; clophedrone), respectively, are potent serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agents (SNDRAs). They have been encountered as cathinone designer and recreational drugs. The analogue of bupropion with the N-tert-butyl group replaced with an N-cyclopropyl group is 3-chloro-N-cyclopropylcathinone (3Cl-CpC; PAL-433, RTI-6037-39). It is a hybrid serotonin releasing agent (SRA) and serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI) and was being investigated for potential treatment of cocaine dependence. There have been reported cases of false-positive urine amphetamine tests in persons taking bupropion. === Synthesis === It is synthesized in two chemical steps starting from 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position adjacent to the ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield. == History == Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the US patent for it was granted in 1974. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of seizures at the originally recommended dosage (400–600 mg/day) caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and bupropion was re-introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose of 450 mg/day. In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a sustained-release formulation of alcohol-resistant bupropion called Wellbutrin SR, a tablet intended to be taken twice a day (as compared with three times a day for immediate-release Wellbutrin). In 2003, the FDA approved another sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, a hard-shelled tablet intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada. In 1997, bupropion was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder. In October 2007, two providers of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements, ConsumerLab.com and The People's Pharmacy, released the results of comparative tests of different brands of bupropion. The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that ""one of a few generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, sold as Budeprion XL 300 mg, didn't perform the same as the brand-name pill in the lab."" The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that Budeprion XL is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL. On 3 October 2012, however, the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that ""Budeprion XL 300 mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300 mg."" The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. As of October 2013 the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent. In April 2008, the FDA approved a formulation of bupropion as a hydrobromide salt instead of a hydrochloride salt, to be sold under the name Aplenzin by Sanofi-Aventis. It is an extended-release tablet intended for once-daily use. It was approved on the basis of bioequivalence with Wellbutrin XL. In 2009, the FDA issued a health advisory warning that the prescription of bupropion for smoking cessation has been associated with reports of unusual behavior changes, agitation, and hostility. Some people, according to the advisory, have become depressed or have had their depression worsen, have had thoughts about suicide or dying, or have attempted suicide. This advisory was based on a review of anti-smoking products that identified 75 reports of ""suicidal adverse events"" for bupropion over ten years. Based on the results of follow-up trials this warning was removed in 2016. In 2012, the US Justice Department announced that GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for promoting the unapproved use of Wellbutrin for weight loss and sexual dysfunction. In 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended suspending a number of nationally approved medicines due to misrepresentation of bioequivalence study data by Micro Therapeutic Research Labs in India. The products recommended for suspension included several 300 mg modified-release bupropion tablets. Following EMA's call for an industry-wide review of medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines, GlaxoSmithKline paused batch release and distribution of bupropion 150 mg tablets in November 2022. In July 2023, EMA raised the acceptable daily intake of nitrosamine impurities, leading GlaxoSmithKline to announce that distribution of bupropion 150 mg tablets would resume ""across the EU and Europe"" by the end of 2023. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Recreational use of bupropion is uncommon. While bupropion demonstrates some potential for recreational use, this potential is less than that of other commonly used stimulants, being limited by features of its pharmacology. Case reports describe the recreational use of bupropion as producing a ""high"" similar to cocaine or amphetamine usage but with less intensity. There have been some anecdotal and case-study reports of bupropion abuse, but the bulk of evidence indicates that the subjective effects of bupropion when taken orally are markedly different from those of addictive stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamine. However, bupropion, by non-conventional routes of administration like injection or insufflation, has been reported to be used recreationally in the United States and Canada, notably in prisons. === Legal status === In Russia bupropion is banned as a narcotic drug, due to it being a derivative of methcathinone. In Australia, France, and the UK, smoking cessation is the only licensed use of bupropion, and no generics are marketed. === Brand names === Brand names include Wellbutrin, Aplenzin, Budeprion, Buproban, buprapan, Forfivo, Voxra, Zyban, Bupron, Bupisure, Bupep, Smoquite, Elontril, Oribion and Buxon. == Research == Bupropion has been studied limitedly in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. == See also == List of antidepressants == References ==",Zyban,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.748303323751315e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003190429415553808)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/zyban.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=74, start_index=9, title='Zyban: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/zyban.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4601,"('Bupropion', 'Amfebutamone', 'Amfebutamon', 'Wellbutrin', 'Amfebutamonum')",Medical,"Bupropion, formerly called amfebutamone, and sold under the brand name Wellbutrin among others, is an atypical antidepressant that is indicated in the treatment of major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and to support smoking cessation. It is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of ""incomplete response"" to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction, it is not associated with weight gain and sleepiness, and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue. Bupropion, particularly the immediate-release formulation, carries a higher risk of seizure than many other antidepressants, hence caution is recommended in patients with a history of seizure disorder. The medication is taken by mouth. Common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. Raised blood pressure is notable. Rare but serious side effects include seizures, liver toxicity, psychosis, and risk of overdose. Bupropion use during pregnancy may be associated with increased likelihood of congenital heart defects. Bupropion acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and a nicotinic receptor antagonist. However, its effects on dopamine are weak and clinical significance is contentious. Chemically, bupropion is an aminoketone that belongs to the class of substituted cathinones and more generally that of substituted amphetamines and substituted phenethylamines. Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta, who worked at Burroughs Wellcome, in 1969. It was first approved for medical use in the United States in 1985. Bupropion was originally called by the generic name amfebutamone, before being renamed in 2000. In 2022, it was the 21st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 25 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination dextromethorphan/bupropion to serve as a rapid-acting antidepressant in patients with major depressive disorder. == Medical uses == === Depression === The evidence overall supports the effectiveness of bupropion over placebo for the treatment of depression. Some peer-reviewed studies suggest the quality of evidence is low. Some meta-analyses report that bupropion has an at-most small effect size for depression. One meta-analysis reported a large effect size. However, there were methodological limitations with this meta-analysis, including using a subset of only five trials for the effect size calculation, substantial variability in effect sizes between the selected trials—which led the authors to state that their findings in this area should be interpreted with ""extreme caution""—and general lack of inclusion of unpublished trials in the meta-analysis. Unpublished trials are more likely to be negative in findings, and other meta-analyses have included unpublished trials. Evidence suggests that the effectiveness of bupropion for depression is similar to that of other antidepressants. Over the autumn and winter months, bupropion prevents the development of depression in those who have recurring seasonal affective disorder: 15% of participants on bupropion experienced a major depressive episode vs. 27% of those on placebo. Bupropion also improves depression in bipolar disorder, with the efficacy and risk of an affective switch being similar to other antidepressants. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction, and the occurrence of sexual side effects is not different from placebo. Bupropion treatment is not associated with weight gain; on the contrary, the majority of studies observed significant weight loss in bupropion-treated participants. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness that may be produced by other antidepressants. Bupropion is more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue in depressed patients. Bupropion is effective in the treatment of anxious depression and, contrary to common belief, does not exacerbate anxiety in this context. The effectiveness of bupropion for anxious depression is equivalent to that of SSRIs in the case of depression with low or moderate anxiety, whereas SSRIs show a modest effectiveness advantage in terms of response rates for depression with high anxiety. The addition of bupropion to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people do not respond to the SSRI, and it is supported by clinical trials; however, it appears to be inferior to the addition of atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole. === Smoking cessation === Prescribed as an aid for smoking cessation, bupropion reduces the severity of craving for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms such as depressed mood, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and increased appetite. Initially, bupropion slows the weight gain that often occurs in the first weeks after quitting smoking. With time, however, this effect becomes negligible. The bupropion treatment course lasts for seven to twelve weeks, with the patient halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. After the course, the effectiveness of bupropion for maintaining abstinence from smoking declines over time, from 37% of tobacco abstinence at 3 months to 20% at one year. It is unclear whether extending bupropion treatment helps to prevent relapse of smoking. Overall, six months after the therapy, bupropion increases the likelihood of quitting smoking by approximately 1.6-fold as compared to placebo. In this respect, bupropion is as effective as nicotine replacement therapy but inferior to varenicline. Combining bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy does not improve the quitting rate. In children and adolescents, the use of bupropion for smoking cessation does not appear to offer any significant benefits. The evidence for its use to aid smoking cessation in pregnant women is insufficient. === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === In the United States, the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not an approved indication of bupropion, and it is not mentioned in the 2019 guideline on ADHD treatment from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Systematic reviews of bupropion for the treatment of ADHD in both adults and children note that bupropion may be effective for ADHD but warn that this conclusion has to be interpreted with caution, because clinical trials were of low quality due to small sizes and risk of bias. Similarly to atomoxetine, bupropion has a delayed onset of action for ADHD, and several weeks of treatment are required for therapeutic effects. This is in contrast to stimulants, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate, which have an immediate onset of effect in the condition. === Sexual dysfunction === Bupropion is less likely than other antidepressants to cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies indicate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction including sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI antidepressants. There have also been small studies suggesting that bupropion or a bupropion/trazodone combination may improve some measures of sexual function in women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) and are not depressed. According to an expert consensus recommendation from the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, bupropion can be considered as an off-label treatment for HSDD despite limited safety and efficacy data. Likewise, a 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of bupropion for sexual desire disorder in women reported that although data were limited, bupropion appeared to be dose-dependently effective for the condition. === Weight loss === Bupropion, when used for treating long-term weight gain over six to twelve months, results in an average weight loss of 2.7 kilograms (6.0 lb) over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other weight-loss medications such as sibutramine or orlistat. The combination drug naltrexone/bupropion has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity. === Other uses === Bupropion is not effective in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but it is showing promise in reducing drug use in treating amphetamine-type stimulant use and cravings. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. The drug may be useful in the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and narcolepsy. Bupropion has been used to treat disorders of diminished motivation, like apathy, abulia, and akinetic mutism. Accordingly, the drug has been found to increase effort expenditure and improve motivational deficits in animal models. However, only limited benefits of bupropion in the treatment of apathy have been observed in clinical trials in various conditions. Bupropion has been used in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). === Available forms === Bupropion is available as an oral tablet in several different formulations. It is mainly formulated as the hydrochloride salt but also as the hydrobromide salt. In addition to single-drug formulations, bupropion is formulated in combinations including naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave) for obesity and dextromethorphan/bupropion (Auvelity) for depression. == Contraindications == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescription label advises that bupropion should not be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents, and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation. == Side effects == The common adverse effects of bupropion with the greatest difference from placebo are dry mouth, nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, and excessive sweating. Bupropion has the highest incidence of insomnia of all second-generation antidepressants, apart from desvenlafaxine. It is also associated with about 20% increased risk of headache. Bupropion raises blood pressure in some people. One study showed an average rise of 6 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure in 10% of patients. The prescribing information notes that hypertension, sometimes severe, is observed in some people taking bupropion, both with and without pre-existing hypertension. The safety of bupropion in people with cardiovascular conditions and its general cardiovascular safety profile remains unclear due to the lack of data. Seizure is a rare but serious adverse effect of bupropion. It is strongly dose-dependent: for the immediate release preparation, the seizure incidence is 0.4% at the dose 300–450 mg per day; the incidence climbs almost ten-fold for the higher than recommended dose of 600 mg. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07–0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally 0–0.5% at the recommended doses. Cases of liver toxicity leading to death or liver transplantation have been reported for bupropion. It is considered to be one of several antidepressants with a greater risk of hepatotoxicity. The prescribing information warns about bupropion triggering an angle-closure glaucoma attack. On the other hand, bupropion may decrease the risk of development of open angle glaucoma. Bupropion use by mothers in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a 23% increase in the odds of congenital heart defects in their children. Bupropion has rarely been associated with instances of Stevens–Johnson syndrome. Bupropion has not been associated with QT prolongation at therapeutic doses but has been associated with QT prolongation in overdose. === Psychiatric === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in people younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo. Bupropion prescribed for smoking cessation results in a 25% increase in the risk of psychiatric side effects, in particular, anxiety (about 40% increase) and insomnia (about 80% increase). The evidence is insufficient to determine whether bupropion is associated with suicides or suicidal behavior. In rare cases, bupropion-induced psychosis may develop. It is associated with higher doses of bupropion; many cases described are at higher than recommended doses. Concurrent antipsychotic medication appears to be protective. In most cases the psychotic symptoms are eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. Although studies are lacking, a handful of case reports suggest that abrupt discontinuation of bupropion may cause antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. == Overdose == Bupropion is considered moderately dangerous in overdose. According to an analysis of US National Poison Data System, adjusted for the number of prescriptions, bupropion and venlafaxine are the two new-generation antidepressants (i.e., non-tricyclic antidepressants) that result in the highest mortality and morbidity. For significant overdoses, seizures have been reported in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, having had multiple uncontrolled seizures and myocardial infarction. == Interactions == Since bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the enzyme CYP2B6, drug interactions with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes such medications as paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine (active metabolite of fluoxetine), diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected result is an increase of bupropion and a decrease in hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, and phenobarbital. Indeed, carbamazepine decreases exposure to bupropion by 90% and increases exposure to hydroxybupropion by 94%. Ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and efavirenz have been shown to decrease levels of bupropion and/or its metabolites. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel, both potent CYP2B6 inhibitors, have been found to considerably increase bupropion levels as well as decrease levels of its metabolite hydroxybupropion. Bupropion and its metabolites are inhibitors of CYP2D6, with hydroxybupropion responsible for most of the inhibition. Additionally, bupropion and its metabolites may decrease the expression of CYP2D6 in the liver. The end effect is a significant slowing of the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. For instance, bupropion has been found to increase area-under-the-curve of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, by 5-fold. Bupropion has also been found to increase levels of atomoxetine by 5.1-fold, while decreasing the exposure to its main metabolite by 1.5-fold. As another example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300 mg/day bupropion. When people on bupropion are given MDMA, about 30% increase of exposure to both drugs is observed, with enhanced mood but decreased heart rate effects of MDMA. Interactions with other CYP2D6 substrates, such as metoprolol, imipramine, nortriptyline, venlafaxine, and nebivolol have also been reported. However, in a notable exception, bupropion does not seem to affect the concentrations of CYP2D6 substrates fluoxetine and paroxetine. Bupropion prevents norepinephrine and dopamine release induced by methamphetamine and has been found to reduce the subjective and sympathomimetic effects of methamphetamine in humans. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold, and therefore can potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids. The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance. Caution should be observed when combining bupropion with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it may result in hypertensive crisis. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of bupropion in the treatment of depression and for other indications is unclear. However, it is thought to be related to the fact that bupropion is a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and negative allosteric modulator of several nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Bupropion does not act as a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent. Pharmacological actions of bupropion, to a substantial degree, are due to its active metabolites hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion, and erythro-hydrobupropion that are present in the blood plasma at comparable or much higher levels. In fact, bupropion could accurately be conceptualized as a prodrug of these metabolites. Overall action of these metabolites, and particularly one enantiomer S,S-hydroxybupropion, is also characterized by inhibition of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake and nicotinic inhibition (see the chart on the right). Bupropion has no meaningful direct activity at a variety of receptors, including α- and β-adrenergic, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The occupancy of dopamine transporter (DAT) by bupropion (300 mg/day) and its metabolites in the human brain as measured by several positron emission tomography (PET) studies is approximately 20%, with a mean occupancy range of about 14 to 26%. For comparison, the NDRI methylphenidate at therapeutic doses is thought to occupy greater than 50% of DAT sites. In accordance with its low DAT occupancy, no measurable dopamine release in the human brain was detected with bupropion (one 150 mg dose) in a PET study. Bupropion has also been shown to increase striatal VMAT2, though it is unknown if this effect is more pronounced than other DRIs. These findings raise questions about the role of dopamine reuptake inhibition in the pharmacology of bupropion, and suggest that other actions may be responsible for its therapeutic effects. No data are available on occupancy of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) by bupropion and its metabolites. However, due to the increased exposure of hydroxybupropion over bupropion itself, which has higher affinity for the NET than the DAT, bupropion's overall pharmacological profile in humans may end up making it effectively more of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor than a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Accordingly, the clinical effects of bupropion are more consistent with noradrenergic activity than with dopaminergic actions. Bupropion has been claimed to be a sigma σ1 receptor agonist. Its antidepressant-like effects in rodents depend on σ1 receptor activation. They are enhanced and inhibited by σ1 receptor agonists and antagonists, respectively. However, no data on the binding or functional effects of bupropion at the human sigma receptors seem to be available. In any case, bupropion has been reported to bind to rodent σ1 receptors with IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 580 to 2,100 nM. In contrast to many other phenethylamines and amphetamines, bupropion is not an agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). Bupropion has been found to have a mixture of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory activity through modulation of the immune system. One such mechanism underlying these effects may be reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The catecholaminergic actions of bupropion may be involved in its immunomodulatory effects. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral administration, bupropion is rapidly and completely absorbed reaching the peak blood plasma concentration after 1.5 hours (tmax). Sustained-release (SR) and extended-release (XL) formulations have been designed to slow down absorption resulting in tmax of 3 hours and 5 hours, respectively. Absolute bioavailability of bupropion is unknown but is presumed to be low, at 5–20%, due to the first-pass metabolism. As for the relative bioavailability of the formulations, XL formulation has lower bioavailability (68%) compared to SR formulation and immediate release bupropion. Bupropion is metabolized in the body by a variety of pathways. The oxidative pathways are by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2B6 leading to R,R- and S,S-hydroxybupropion and, to a lesser degree, CYP2C19 leading to 4'-hydroxybupropion. The reductive pathways are by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 in the liver and AKR7A2/AKR7A3 in the intestine leading to threo-hydrobupropion and by yet unknown enzyme leading to erythro-hydrobupropion. The metabolism of bupropion is highly variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest the same amount of the drug may differ by as much as 5.5 times (with a half-life of 12–30 hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7.5 times (with a half-life of 15–25 hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The metabolism of bupropion also seems to follow biphasic pharmacokinetics: the redistribution alpha phase with half-life of about 1 hour precedes the metabolism beta phase of about 12-30 hours. This might explain why abuse is unfeasible due to a short ""high"", as well as support the use of extended-release formulas to maintain a consistent concentration of bupropion. The metabolism of bupropion is highly species-dependent. As an example, oral bupropion results in hydroxybupropion levels that are 16-fold higher than those of bupropion itself in humans, whereas in rats, oral bupropion results in levels of bupropion that are 3.4-fold higher than those of hydroxybupropion. The species-dependent metabolism of bupropion is thought to be involved in species differences in its pharmacodynamic effects. For example, bupropion produces psychostimulant-like and reinforcing effects in rodents, whereas oral bupropion at therapeutic doses seems to have much less or no potential for such effects in humans. == Chemistry == Bupropion is an aminoketone that belongs to the class of substituted cathinones and the more general class of substituted phenethylamines. It is also known structurally as 3-chloro-N-tert-butyl-β-keto-α-methylphenethylamine, 3-chloro-N-tert-butyl-β-ketoamphetamine, or 3-chloro-N-tert-butylcathinone. The clinically used bupropion is racemic, which is a mixture of two enantiomers: S-bupropion and R-bupropion. Although the optical isomers on bupropion can be separated, they rapidly racemize under physiological conditions. Bupropion is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C13H18ClNO and a molecular weight of 239.74 g/mol. It is a highly lipophilic compound, with an experimental log P of 3.6. Pharmaceutically, bupropion is used mainly as the hydrochloride salt but also to a lesser extent as the hydrobromide salt. A number of analogues of bupropion exist, such as hydroxybupropion, radafaxine, and manifaxine, among others. These compounds are norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) similarly to bupropion. The analogues of bupropion with the N-tert-butyl group removed or replaced with an N-methyl group, 3-chlorocathinone (3-CC) and 3-chloromethcathinone (3-CMC; clophedrone), respectively, are potent serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agents (SNDRAs). They have been encountered as cathinone designer and recreational drugs. The analogue of bupropion with the N-tert-butyl group replaced with an N-cyclopropyl group is 3-chloro-N-cyclopropylcathinone (3Cl-CpC; PAL-433, RTI-6037-39). It is a hybrid serotonin releasing agent (SRA) and serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI) and was being investigated for potential treatment of cocaine dependence. There have been reported cases of false-positive urine amphetamine tests in persons taking bupropion. === Synthesis === It is synthesized in two chemical steps starting from 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position adjacent to the ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield. == History == Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1969, and the US patent for it was granted in 1974. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985, and marketed under the name Wellbutrin. However, a significant incidence of seizures at the originally recommended dosage (400–600 mg/day) caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986. Subsequently, the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose-dependent, and bupropion was re-introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose of 450 mg/day. In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a sustained-release formulation of alcohol-resistant bupropion called Wellbutrin SR, a tablet intended to be taken twice a day (as compared with three times a day for immediate-release Wellbutrin). In 2003, the FDA approved another sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, a hard-shelled tablet intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada. In 1997, bupropion was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder. In October 2007, two providers of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements, ConsumerLab.com and The People's Pharmacy, released the results of comparative tests of different brands of bupropion. The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that ""one of a few generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, sold as Budeprion XL 300 mg, didn't perform the same as the brand-name pill in the lab."" The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that Budeprion XL is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL. On 3 October 2012, however, the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that ""Budeprion XL 300 mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300 mg."" The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. As of October 2013 the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent. In April 2008, the FDA approved a formulation of bupropion as a hydrobromide salt instead of a hydrochloride salt, to be sold under the name Aplenzin by Sanofi-Aventis. It is an extended-release tablet intended for once-daily use. It was approved on the basis of bioequivalence with Wellbutrin XL. In 2009, the FDA issued a health advisory warning that the prescription of bupropion for smoking cessation has been associated with reports of unusual behavior changes, agitation, and hostility. Some people, according to the advisory, have become depressed or have had their depression worsen, have had thoughts about suicide or dying, or have attempted suicide. This advisory was based on a review of anti-smoking products that identified 75 reports of ""suicidal adverse events"" for bupropion over ten years. Based on the results of follow-up trials this warning was removed in 2016. In 2012, the US Justice Department announced that GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for promoting the unapproved use of Wellbutrin for weight loss and sexual dysfunction. In 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended suspending a number of nationally approved medicines due to misrepresentation of bioequivalence study data by Micro Therapeutic Research Labs in India. The products recommended for suspension included several 300 mg modified-release bupropion tablets. Following EMA's call for an industry-wide review of medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines, GlaxoSmithKline paused batch release and distribution of bupropion 150 mg tablets in November 2022. In July 2023, EMA raised the acceptable daily intake of nitrosamine impurities, leading GlaxoSmithKline to announce that distribution of bupropion 150 mg tablets would resume ""across the EU and Europe"" by the end of 2023. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Recreational use of bupropion is uncommon. While bupropion demonstrates some potential for recreational use, this potential is less than that of other commonly used stimulants, being limited by features of its pharmacology. Case reports describe the recreational use of bupropion as producing a ""high"" similar to cocaine or amphetamine usage but with less intensity. There have been some anecdotal and case-study reports of bupropion abuse, but the bulk of evidence indicates that the subjective effects of bupropion when taken orally are markedly different from those of addictive stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamine. However, bupropion, by non-conventional routes of administration like injection or insufflation, has been reported to be used recreationally in the United States and Canada, notably in prisons. === Legal status === In Russia bupropion is banned as a narcotic drug, due to it being a derivative of methcathinone. In Australia, France, and the UK, smoking cessation is the only licensed use of bupropion, and no generics are marketed. === Brand names === Brand names include Wellbutrin, Aplenzin, Budeprion, Buproban, buprapan, Forfivo, Voxra, Zyban, Bupron, Bupisure, Bupep, Smoquite, Elontril, Oribion and Buxon. == Research == Bupropion has been studied limitedly in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. == See also == List of antidepressants == References ==",Wellbutrin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.680836794548668e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006740451790392399)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/wellbutrin.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Wellbutrin Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/wellbutrin.html?utm_source=openai')])"
4602,"('Mesatone', 'Phenylephrine', 'R,s-phenylephrine', '(+-)-neosynephrine', '(+-)-phenylephrine')",Medical,"Phenylephrine, sold under the brand names Neosynephrine and Sudafed PE among others, is a medication used as a decongestant for uncomplicated nasal congestion in the form of a nasal spray or oral tablet, to dilate the pupil, to increase blood pressure given intravenously in cases of low blood pressure, and to relieve hemorrhoids as a suppository. It can also be applied to the skin. Common side effects when taken by mouth or injected include nausea, vomiting, headache, and anxiety. Use on hemorrhoids is generally well tolerated. Severe side effects may include a slow heart rate, intestinal ischemia, chest pain, kidney failure, and tissue death at the site of injection. It is unclear whether its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is safe. Phenylephrine is a selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist with minimal to no β-adrenergic receptor agonist activity or induction of norepinephrine release. It causes constriction of both arteries and veins. Phenylephrine was patented in 1933 and came into medical use in 1938. It is available as a generic medication. Unlike pseudoephedrine, abuse of phenylephrine is very uncommon. Its effectiveness as an oral nasal decongestant has been questioned. In 2023, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel concluded that the drug was ineffective as a nasal decongestant when taken orally, performing no better than placebo. In November 2024, the FDA proposed to remove oral phenylephrine as an active ingredient that can be used in over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug products for the temporary relief of nasal congestion. == Medical uses == === Decongestant === Phenylephrine is used as an alternative to pseudoephedrine as a decongestant, whose availability has been restricted in some countries due to a potential for use in the illicit synthesis of methamphetamine. Its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been questioned, with several independent studies finding that it provided no more relief to sinus congestion than a placebo. A 2007 meta-analysis concluded that the evidence for its effectiveness is insufficient, though another meta-analysis published shortly thereafter by researchers from GlaxoSmithKline found the standard 10-mg dose to be more effective than a placebo; however, the fact that GSK markets many products containing phenylephrine has raised some speculation regarding selective publishing and other controversial techniques. A 2007 study by Wyeth Consumer Healthcare notes that 7 studies available in 1976 support the efficacy of phenylephrine at a 10 mg dosage. The Food and Drug Administration withdrew the indication ""for the temporary relief of nasal congestion associated with sinusitis"" in 2007. Two studies published in 2009, examined the effects of phenylephrine on symptoms of allergic rhinitis by exposing people to pollen in a controlled, indoor environment. Neither study was able to distinguish between the effects of phenylephrine or a placebo. Pseudoephedrine and loratadine–montelukast therapy were found to be significantly more effective than both phenylephrine and placebo. Pseudoephedrine was previously much more commonly available in the United States. However, provisions of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 placed restrictions on the sale in the United States of pseudoephedrine products to prevent the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine. Since 2004, phenylephrine has been increasingly marketed as a substitute for pseudoephedrine; some manufacturers have changed the active ingredients of products to avoid restrictions on sales. Phenylephrine has been off-patent for some time, and many generic brands are available. In September 2023, an independent advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unanimously agreed that there is insufficient evidence showing that ""orally administered phenylephrine is effective as a nasal decongestant"". The committee also unanimously believes that this does not need further study. The FDA responded to the committee, stating it would take its advice under advisement. In November 2024, the FDA proposed to remove oral phenylephrine as an active ingredient that can be used in over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug products for the temporary relief of nasal congestion. === Hemorrhoids === Hemorrhoids are caused by swollen veins in the rectal area. Phenylephrine can be used topically to prevent symptoms of hemorrhoids. Phenylephrine causes the constriction of vascular smooth muscle and is often used in the treatment of hemorrhoids to narrow the swollen veins and relieve the attendant pain. However, veins contain less vascular smooth muscle in their walls than arteries. Products for treatment may also include substances that will form a protective barrier over the inflamed area, resulting in less pain when feces are passed. Phenylephrine hydrochloride at 0.25% is used as a vasoconstrictor in suppository formulations for hemorrhoid treatment. === Pupil dilation === Phenylephrine is used as an eye drop to dilate the pupil to facilitate visualization of the retina. It is often used in combination with tropicamide as a synergist when tropicamide alone is not sufficient. Narrow-angle glaucoma is a contraindication to phenylephrine use. As a mydriatic, it is available in 2.5% and 10% eye drops. Phenylephrine eye drops are applied to the eye after a topical anesthetic is applied. === Intraocular bleeding === Phenylephrine has been used as an intracameral injection into the anterior chamber of the eye to arrest intraocular bleeding occurring during cataract and glaucoma surgery. === Low blood pressure === Phenylephrine is commonly used as a vasopressor to increase the blood pressure in unstable patients with hypotension (low blood pressure), especially resulting from septic shock. Such use is common in surgery and anesthesia or critical-care practices; it is especially useful in counteracting the hypotensive effect of epidural and spinal anesthesia, as well as the vasodilating effect of bacterial toxins and the inflammatory response in sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Because of its vasoconstrictive effect, phenylephrine can cause severe necrosis if it infiltrates the surrounding tissues. Because of this, it should be given through a central line if at all possible. Damage may be prevented or mitigated by infiltrating the tissue with the alpha-blocker phentolamine by subcutaneous injection. In clinical studies, phenylephrine, administered intravenously, increases blood pressure, decreases cardiac output, increases cerebral blood flow, and decreases cerebral tissue oxygen saturation. The decreases in cardiac output, increases in cerebral blood flow, and decreases in cerebral tissue oxygen saturation with phenylephrine are all related to the degree of blood pressure increase. The decrease in cardiac output is primarily due to a decrease in heart rate and a modest decrease in stroke volume. The decrease in heart rate is due to activation of the arterial baroreflex, which regulates heart rate in response to changes in blood pressure. Because of the decrease in cardiac output, phenylephrine is a negative inotropic agent. Its effects on cardiac output and cerebral oxygenation are unfavorable, and on account of this, the use of phenylephrine in the treatment of intraoperative hypotension is now being recommended against and moved away from in favor of other agents without these adverse effects like ephedrine and dopamine. When taken orally, phenylephrine has a threshold dose of about 50 mg to affect the cardiovascular system, a dose at which the drug decreases heart rate and slightly increases arterial blood pressure. Additionally, an over-the-counter dose of 60 mg produces a slight increase in heart rate with no detectable changes in blood pressure. However, other literature reports that doses over 15 mg affect the cardiovascular system, including increases in blood pressure and decreases in heart rate. Higher doses, like 150 mg, more robustly affect the cardiovascular system. === Other uses === Phenylephrine has been used in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It has been found to improve vascular resistance, enhance circulatory support, and improve symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in people with the condition. It has been described as particularly effective in people with neuropathic POTS. However, phenylephrine has not been specifically approved for the treatment of POTS and data on this use are limited. This is also the case with other medications used in the treatment of POTS. Phenylephrine has been used in the treatment of priapism. === Available forms === Phenylephrine is available in the form of oral tablets and syrups for use as a nasal decongestant, as an intravenous solution to treat hypotension, as an ophthalmic solution, spray, or eye drop to cause pupil dilation, and as a cocoa butter suppository, among other forms. It was also previously available as a metered aerosol for inhalation, but this formulation was discontinued. Phenylephrine is available both alone and in combination with other drugs. These other drugs include antihistamines like chlorpheniramine, doxylamine, promethazine, and mepyramine (pyrilamine); analgesics like paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, ketorolac, and codeine; cough suppressants like dextromethorphan; expectorants like guiafenesin; anticholinergics like cyclopentolate and tropicamide; and β-adrenergic receptor agonists like isoprenaline (isoproterenol). It is used in combination with antihistamines and analgesics in cough and cold preparations, with anticholinergics in ophthalmic formulations, and with β-adrenergic receptor agonists in inhalational forms. Intravenous phenylephrine is always formulated by itself. == Contraindications == Phenylephrine is contraindicated in people with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and heart disease due to its vasoconstrictor effects. Relative contraindications include people with Raynaud's syndrome due to vasoconstriction, those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) due to inhibition of the metabolism of phenylephrine, and people with prostate problems due to potential exacerbation of urinary retention. == Side effects == Phenylephrine taken orally at indicated doses is usually well-tolerated. It may cause side effects such as headache, reflex bradycardia, excitability, restlessness, and cardiac arrhythmias. At higher than indicated doses, phenylephrine can increase blood pressure and decrease heart rate. A 45 mg dose of phenylephrine can increase systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg. Possible side effects of intravenous phenylephrine are dose-dependent and may include bradycardia and reactive hypertension. === Heart === The primary side effect of phenylephrine is high blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are typically advised to avoid products containing it. Because this medication is a sympathomimetic amine without β-adrenergic receptor agonist activity, it does not increase contractility force and output of the cardiac muscle. It may increase blood pressure resulting in a slow heart rate through stimulation of vascular (likely carotid) baroreceptors. A common side effect during IV administration is reflex bradycardia. The low concentration eye drops do not cause blood pressure changes and the changes with the higher dose drops do not last long. The cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine may be potentiated in people with hypertension. Hypertensive crisis with phenylephrine eye drops has been reported in people with hypertension. In people with underlying cardiovascular disease, phenylephrine has been found to increase blood pressure and cause associated impairment in myocardial perfusion. Other reported side effects of phenylephrine have included increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction resulting in worsened orthostatic tolerance, atrial fibrillation following coronary artery bypass surgery, decreased cerebral oxygenation, bradycardia in people with spinal cord injury, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, and microvascular occlusion syndrome. Rarely, stroke has been reported with phenylephrine, including in the oral, topical, and intravenous forms. Due to the increased risk of side effects in people with hypertension, phenylephrine is not suggested for use in this population. === Others === Prostatic hyperplasia can also be worsened by use, and chronic use can lead to rebound hyperemia. People with a history of anxiety or panic disorders, or on anticonvulsant medication for epilepsy should not take this substance. The drug interaction might produce seizures. Some patients have been shown to have an upset stomach, severe abdominal cramping, and vomiting issues connected to taking this drug. Phenylephrine is pregnancy category C. Due to the lack of studies done in animals and in humans, it is not known whether there is harm to the fetus. Phenylephrine should only be given to pregnant women who have a clear need. Extended use may cause rhinitis medicamentosa, a condition of rebound nasal congestion. == Interactions == Phenylephrine is susceptible to metabolism by monoamine oxidase. Because of this, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can inhibit the metabolism of phenylephrine and increase exposure to the medication. Whereas a 45 mg oral dose of phenylephrine alone increases systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg, use of this dose in people on MAOIs increases systolic blood pressure by more than 60 mmHg. Phenylephrine can interact with other adrenergic drugs, such as beta blockers like propranolol, α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists like chlorpromazine, α2-adrenergic receptor agonists like clonidine, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors like atomoxetine and amitriptyline, and MAOIs (which increase norepinephrine levels). It can also interact with corticosteroids like prednisone, which sensitize the vasculature to sympathomimetics and augment their vasoconstrictive effects, and with ergot alkaloids, which also have vasoconstrictor effects and can have additive or synergistic effects with phenylephrine. In addition, combination of phenylephrine with other sympathomimetic drugs can increase pressor effects and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Other drugs that may decrease the effects of phenylephrine may include calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and benzodiazepines. Patients taking these medications may need a higher dose of phenylephrine to achieve a comparable increase in blood pressure. Concomitant use of phenylephrine with the preceding agents may necessitate dose adjustments. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) has been found to increase exposure to oral phenylephrine. It more than doubles phenylephrine's bioavailability, reduces its absorption half-time by 50%, increases phenylephrine levels by approximately 2-fold, and increases peak phenylephrine levels by 4-fold, with substantial interindividual variability. Phenylephrine is widely formulated with acetaminophen in combination products. The combination may increase the cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine. The mechanism of the interaction between phenylephrine and acetaminophen is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be due to saturation of sulfation pathways by acetaminophen that also participate in phenylephrine metabolism. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Phenylephrine is a selective agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, one of the biological targets of the catecholamine hormones and neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is a full agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor in most assessed tissues. The drug has weak, minimal, or no agonist activity at the α2-adrenergic receptor or the β-adrenergic receptors. At the β-adrenergic receptors, it is a partial agonist. Phenylephrine also has relatively little or no activity as a norepinephrine releasing agent. As such, it has little activity as an indirectly acting sympathomimetic and non-selective activator of adrenergic receptors. This is in contrast to related sympathomimetics like pseudoephedrine. However, more recent research suggests that phenylephrine may actually be more potent as a norepinephrine releasing agent than has previously been thought. This might help to explain certain unexpected pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. Because of its α1-adrenergic receptor agonism, phenylephrine is a directly acting sympathomimetic vasoconstrictor and produces both venous and arterial vasoconstriction. The term sympathomimetic means that it mimics the actions of epinephrine or norepinephrine. Phenylephrine works as a nasal decongestant by causing local vasoconstriction in the nose. Whereas the related sympathomimetic decongestant pseudoephedrine causes both vasoconstriction and increase of mucociliary clearance through its non-specific adrenergic activity, phenylephrine's selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonism causes vasoconstriction alone, resulting in a difference in their methods of action. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Phenylephrine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally. However, its absorption is incomplete and erratic. Because of extensive first-pass metabolism, phenylephrine has an oral bioavailability of only about 38% relative to intravenous administration. However, another source has stated that the bioavailability of phenylephrine is poorly documented and may actually be as low as 0.003%. The time to peak concentrations is 1.0 to 1.3 hours. ==== Distribution ==== The steady-state volume of distribution of phenylephrine is 340 L. Phenylephrine does not cross the blood–brain barrier and hence is a peripherally selective drug with no central nervous system activity. Its lack of blood-brain barrier permeability is related to its hydroxyl groups and high hydrophilicity. The lack of central permeation with phenylephrine is in contrast to certain other related decongestant and sympathomimetic agents like pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. ==== Metabolism ==== Phenylephrine is metabolized in the intestines and liver prior to reaching the systemic circulation when taken orally. It is extensively metabolized during first-pass metabolism due to susceptibility to monoamine oxidases, similarly to epinephrine. Phenylephrine is metabolized via oxidative deamination by both MAO-A and MAO-B. In contrast to epinephrine and norepinephrine, phenylephrine is not a catecholamine, and is not metabolized by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT). Besides monoamine oxidase, phenylephrine is also metabolized by sulfation and glucuronidation conjugation. Non-oral routes of phenylephrine, like intranasal, ophthalmic, and parenteral, do not undergo first-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract. The major metabolite of phenylephrine is meta-hydroxymandelic acid, which is inactive. Lesser metabolites of phenylephrine include sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, which are also inactive. Unlike phenylephrine, related sympathomimetics with a methyl group at the α carbon (i.e., amphetamines), like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, methoxamine, and methoxyphenamine, are resistant to degradation by monoamine oxidase. ==== Elimination ==== Phenylephrine is primarily excreted in urine. It is recovered 86% in urine. The drug is excreted in urine 3 to 16% unchanged, 57% as meta-hydroxymandelic acid, and 8% as sulfate conjugates. Glucuronide conjugates constitute a smaller portion of phenylephrine. Phenylephrine has a relatively short elimination half-life of 2.0 to 3.0 hours regardless of route of administration. Its lack of metabolism by COMT is said to be responsible for its much longer duration of action than related agents like norepinephrine. == Chemistry == Phenylephrine is a substituted phenethylamine and can also be referred to structurally as (R)-β,3-dihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine. It is closely structurally related to epinephrine (adrenaline; 3,4,β-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine), differing from it only in the absence of one hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring. It is a chiral compound and is used as the enantiopure (R)-stereoisomer. The racemic form has not been formally named or used. Phenylephrine is the N-methylated derivative of norfenefrine (3,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine). The racemic N-ethyl analogue is etilefrine (ethylphenephrine). Synephrine (p-synephrine, oxedrine; 4,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a positional isomer of phenylephrine. In contrast to epinephrine and norepinephrine (noradrenaline; 3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine), phenylephrine is not a catecholamine since it does not have two hydroxyl groups on its phenyl ring. Besides the catecholamines, the chemical structure of phenylephrine somewhat resembles that of amphetamine (α-methylphenethylamine). However, phenylephrine does not have a methyl group at the α carbon and hence is not an amphetamine itself. Phenylephrine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C9H13NO2 and a molecular weight of 167.205 g/mol. It is a highly hydrophilic compound, with an experimental log P of -0.3. Phenylephrine is used medically almost always as the hydrochloride salt. However, the free base form and the tannate salt have also been used pharmaceutically to a much lesser extent. Pivenfrine is the 3-pivalate ester of phenylephrine and has much greater lipophilicity in comparison. == History == Phenylephrine was first patented in 1927 and was first introduced for medical use in 1938. == Society and culture == === Names === Phenylephrine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANMTooltip British Approved Name in the case of the hydrochloride salt are phenylephrine hydrochloride. Synonyms of phenylephrine include phenephrine, fenefrine, L-m-synephrine, metaoxedrine, neo-oxedrine, mesatonum, neosynephrine, and m-sympatol. Brand names of phenylephrine include Neosynephrine or Neo-Synephrine and Sudafed PE, among numerous others. === Availability === Phenylephrine is available worldwide as a prescription drug in many different formulations. == References ==",Phenylephrine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.005352093372494e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0067205592058598995)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylephrine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Phenylephrine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylephrine?utm_source=openai')])"

Talampicillin hydrochloride showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as seen in amoxicillin and ampicillin. The antibacterial activities of talampicillin hydrochloride, amoxicillin and ampicillin were quite similar. In experimental murine infection with Staphylococcus aureus, protective effect of talampicillin hydrochloride was superior to ampicillin. For Escherichia coli infection, protective effect of talampicillin hydrochloride was similar to that of amoxicillin, while ampicillin was less active than both talampicillin hydrochloride and amoxicillin. The absorption and excretion of 250 mg equivalent doses of talampicillin hydrochloride, amoxicillin and ampicillin were compared in nine fasting healthy volunteers after oral administration of these antibiotics in randomized triple crossover study. In order to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters, plasma levels were analyzed using an one-compartment open model, as well as area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) and urinary excretion. Maximum plasma levels calculated were 2.8 times higher for talampicillin hydrochloride and 1.45 times higher for amoxicillin than for ampicillin. AUC was greater for talampicillin hydrochloride than for amoxicillin and lowest for ampicillin. Urinary excretion of talampicillin hydrochloride as penicillin determined in biological assay was comparable to that of amoxicillin and 1.55 times higher than that of ampicillin. Penicillins can be metabolized to penicilloic acids in the body. After taking into account the penicilloic acid contents in urine, total excretion in urine was 61% for talampicillin hydrochloride, 67% for amoxicillin and 42% for ampicillin during 6 hours after dosing.

Oxamate has a molecular formula of C2H2NO3− and is an isosteric form of pyruvate. Salts and esters of oxamic acid are known collectively as oxamates. Oxamate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Oxamate is a possible pyruvate analog that has the ability to halt lactate production by inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase, effectively stopping the conversation process of pyruvate to lactate. Oxamate, as a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor, plus phenformin, an anti-diabetic agent, has been tested in conjunction with one another and it was shown that this combination has potential anti-cancer properties. Phenformin when administered by itself has a high incidence of lactic acidosis. Due to the inherent ability of oxamate to prevent the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, oxamate can be used to counterbalance the side effects of phenformin. Oxamate also plays inhibiting roles with oxaloacetate, an important intermediate for the citric acid cycle.

The dextrorotatory stereoisomer, dexchlorpheniramine, has been reported to possess Kd values of 15 nM for the H1 receptor and 1,300 nM for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human brain tissue. The smaller the Kd value, the greater the binding affinity of the ligand for its target. In addition to acting as an inverse agonist at the H1 receptor, chlorphenamine has been found to act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (Kd = 15.2 nM for the serotonin transporter). It has only weak affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (Kd = 1,440 nM and 1,060 nM, respectively). A study found that dexchlorphenamine had Ki values for the human cloned H1 receptor of 2.67 to 4.81 nM while levchlorphenamine had Ki values of 211 to 361 nM for this receptor, indicating that dexchlorphenamine is the active enantiomer. Another study found that dexchlorphenamine had a Ki value of 20 to 30 μM for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor using rat brain tissue while levchlorphenamine had a Ki value of 40 to 50 μM for this receptor, indicating that both enantiomers have very low affinity for it. === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life of chlorphenamine has variously ranged between 13.9 and 43.4 hours in adults following a single dose in clinical studies. == Chemistry == Chlorphenamine is an alkylamine and is a part of a series of antihistamines including pheniramine (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives including fluorpheniramine, dexchlorphenamine (Polaramine), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral), deschlorpheniramine, and iodopheniramine.

It is usually used by mouth, but is also available as an injectable. Side effects of etilefrine include nausea, tremors, and palpitations, among others. Etilefrine is an agonist of the α- and β-adrenergic receptors. It is a substituted phenethylamine and is related to epinephrine, phenylephrine, and norfenefrine. Etilefrine was first described and introduced for medical use by 1949. == Medical uses == Etilefrine is used to treat orthostatic hypotension and as a nasal decongestant. It has also been used off-label to treat priapism. == Side effects == Side effects of etilefrine include nausea, tremors, and palpitations, among others. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Etilefrine is an agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor. It is a vasoconstrictor and antihypotensive agent. It has also been described as a β1-adrenergic receptor agonist with some agonistic actions at the α- and β2-adrenergic receptors. Intravenous infusion of this compound increases cardiac output, stroke volume, venous return, and blood pressure in humans and animals, suggesting stimulation of both α- and β-adrenergic receptors. However, in vitro studies indicate that etilefrine has a much higher affinity for β1 (cardiac) than for β2 adrenoreceptors. Intravenous etilefrine increases the pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, central venous pressure, and mean arterial pressure of healthy individuals. Peripheral vascular resistance falls during the infusion of 1 to 8 mg etilefrine but begins to rise at higher dosage. Marked falls in pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and peripheral blood flow, accompanied by rises in mean arterial pressure, occur when etilefrine is infused after administration of intravenous propranolol 2.5 mg. These findings indicate that etilefrine has both β1- and α1-adrenergic receptor actions in humans. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Etilefrine is rapidly absorbed with oral administration. The oral bioavailability of etilefrine is approximately 50%. Peak concentrations of etilefrine occur after 30 minutes. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of etilefrine is 23%. About 8.5% is bound to albumin. Etilefrine is a peripherally selective drug. ==== Metabolism ==== Etilefrine is metabolized by conjugation, for instance glucuronidation, in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. There appears to be significant first-pass metabolism. About 3% is metabolized into hydroxymandelic acid. ==== Elimination ==== The elimination of etilefrine is dependent on route of administration. Regardless of route, about 80% is excreted in urine within 24 hours. With oral administration, 7% is eliminated unchanged in urine and 73% as conjugates. Conversely, with intravenous administration, 28% is eliminated unchanged in urine and 44% as conjugates. == Chemistry == Etilefrine, also known as 3,β-dihydroxy-N-ethylphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine derivative. It is an analogue of epinephrine (3,4,β-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine), of phenylephrine ((R)-β,3-dihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine), of metaterol (3,β-dihydroxy-N-isopropylphenethylamine), and of norfenefrine (3,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine), as well as of metaraminol ((1R,2S)-3,β-dihydroxy-α-methylphenethylamine). Etilefrine pivalate (K-30052) is the 3-pivalyl ester of etilefrine.

4609,"('Xyl', 'Xylopyranose', 'Xylopyranoside', 'Xylose', 'Wood sugar')","Food, Medical","Xylose (cf. Ancient Greek: ξύλον, xylon, ""wood"") is a sugar first isolated from wood, and named for it. Xylose is classified as a monosaccharide of the aldopentose type, which means that it contains five carbon atoms and includes an aldehyde functional group. It is derived from hemicellulose, one of the main constituents of biomass. Like most sugars, it can adopt several structures depending on conditions. With its free aldehyde group, it is a reducing sugar. == Structure == The acyclic form of xylose has chemical formula HOCH2(CH(OH))3CHO. The cyclic hemiacetal isomers are more prevalent in solution and are of two types: the pyranoses, which feature six-membered C5O rings, and the furanoses, which feature five-membered C4O rings (with a pendant CH2OH group). Each of these rings is subject to further isomerism, depending on the relative orientation of the anomeric hydroxy group. The dextrorotary form, d-xylose, is the one that usually occurs endogenously in living things. A levorotary form, l-xylose, can be synthesized. == Occurrence == Xylose is the main building block for the hemicellulose xylan, which comprises about 30% of some plants (birch for example), far less in others (spruce and pine have about 9% xylan). Xylose is otherwise pervasive, being found in the embryos of most edible plants. It was first isolated from wood by Finnish scientist, Koch, in 1881, but first became commercially viable, with a price close to sucrose, in 1930. Xylose is also the first saccharide added to the serine or threonine in the proteoglycan type O-glycosylation, and, so, it is the first saccharide in biosynthetic pathways of most anionic polysaccharides such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Xylose is also found in some species of Chrysolinina beetles, including Chrysolina coerulans. They have cardiac glycosides (including xylose) in their defensive glands. == Applications == === Chemicals === The acid-catalysed degradation of hemicellulose gives furfural, a precursor to synthetic polymers and to tetrahydrofuran. === Human consumption === Xylose is metabolised by humans, although it is not a major human nutrient and is largely excreted by the kidneys. Humans can obtain xylose only from their diet. An oxidoreductase pathway is present in eukaryotic microorganisms. Humans have enzymes called protein xylosyltransferases (XYLT1, XYLT2) which transfer xylose from UDP to a serine in the core protein of proteoglycans. Xylose contains 2.4 calories per gram (lower than glucose or sucrose, approx. 4 calories per gram). === Animal medicine === In animal medicine, xylose is used to test for malabsorption by administration in water to the patient after fasting. If xylose is detected in blood and/or urine within the next few hours, it has been absorbed by the intestines. High xylose intake on the order of approximately 100 g/kg of animal body weight is relatively well tolerated in pigs, and in a similar manner to results from human studies, a portion of the xylose intake is passed out in urine undigested. === Derivatives === Reduction of xylose by catalytic hydrogenation produces the sugar substitute xylitol. == See also == Saccharophagus degradans Xylonic acid Xylose metabolism == References ==",Wood sugar,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.050399329513311386), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.003178544342517853), (' INDUSTR', -0.16700273752212524), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.10028312355279922), (' MED', -0.008110486902296543), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.012682733125984669), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.005262807011604309), ('ĠINDU', -0.5656341910362244), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.3869244456291199), ('ĠMED', -0.1015172004699707), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12704774737358093)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://www.nutrientsreview.com/carbs/monosaccharides-xylose.html,https://glommentechnology.no/2021/03/11/what-we-do/,https://cxcosmetics.com.au/blog/post/xilitol-wood-sugar-extract ', [])"
4610,"('Rib', 'Ribopyranose', 'Ribopyranoside', 'Ribose', 'Ribopyranose (7ci,8ci,9ci)')","Food, Medical","Ribose is a simple sugar and carbohydrate with molecular formula C5H10O5 and the linear-form composition H−(C=O)−(CHOH)4−H. The naturally occurring form, d-ribose, is a component of the ribonucleotides from which RNA is built, and so this compound is necessary for coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. It has a structural analog, deoxyribose, which is a similarly essential component of DNA. l-ribose is an unnatural sugar that was first prepared by Emil Fischer and Oscar Piloty in 1891. It was not until 1909 that Phoebus Levene and Walter Jacobs recognised that d-ribose was a natural product, the enantiomer of Fischer and Piloty's product, and an essential component of nucleic acids. Fischer chose the name ""ribose"" as it is a partial rearrangement of the name of another sugar, arabinose, of which ribose is an epimer at the 2' carbon; both names also relate to gum arabic, from which arabinose was first isolated and from which they prepared l-ribose. Like most sugars, ribose exists as a mixture of cyclic forms in equilibrium with its linear form, and these readily interconvert especially in aqueous solution. The name ""ribose"" is used in biochemistry and biology to refer to all of these forms, though more specific names for each are used when required. In its linear form, ribose can be recognised as the pentose sugar with all of its hydroxyl functional groups on the same side in its Fischer projection. d-Ribose has these hydroxyl groups on the right hand side and is associated with the systematic name (2R,3R,4R)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxypentanal, whilst l-ribose has its hydroxyl groups appear on the left hand side in a Fischer projection. Cyclisation of ribose occurs via hemiacetal formation due to attack on the aldehyde by the C4' hydroxyl group to produce a furanose form or by the C5' hydroxyl group to produce a pyranose form. In each case, there are two possible geometric outcomes, named as α- and β- and known as anomers, depending on the stereochemistry at the hemiacetal carbon atom (the ""anomeric carbon""). At room temperature, about 76% of d-ribose is present in pyranose forms: 228 (α:β = 1:2) and 24% in the furanose forms: 228 (α:β = 1:3), with only about 0.1% of the linear form present. The ribonucleosides adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, and uridine are all derivatives of β-d-ribofuranose. Metabolically important species that include phosphorylated ribose include ADP, ATP, coenzyme A,: 228–229 and NADH. cAMP and cGMP serve as secondary messengers in some signaling pathways and are also ribose derivatives. The ribose moiety appears in some pharmaceutical agents, including the antibiotics neomycin and paromomycin. == Synthesis and sources == Ribose as its 5-phosphate ester is typically produced from glucose by the pentose phosphate pathway. In at least some archaea, alternative pathways have been identified. Ribose can be synthesized chemically, but commercial production relies on fermentation of glucose. Using genetically modified strains of B. subtilis, 90 g/liter of ribose can be produced from 200 g of glucose. The conversion entails the intermediacy of gluconate and ribulose. Ribose has been detected in meteorites. == Structure == Ribose is an aldopentose (a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms that, in its open chain form, has an aldehyde functional group at one end). In the conventional numbering scheme for monosaccharides, the carbon atoms are numbered from C1' (in the aldehyde group) to C5'. The deoxyribose derivative found in DNA differs from ribose by having a hydrogen atom in place of the hydroxyl group at C2'. This hydroxyl group performs a function in RNA splicing. The ""d-"" in the name d-ribose refers to the stereochemistry of the chiral carbon atom farthest away from the aldehyde group (C4'). In d-ribose, as in all d-sugars, this carbon atom has the same configuration as in d-glyceraldehyde. Relative abundance of forms of ribose in solution: β-d-ribopyranose (59%), α-d-ribopyranose (20%), β-d-ribofuranose (13%), α-d-ribofuranose (7%) and open chain (0.1%). For ribose residues in nucleosides and nucleotide, the torsion angles for the rotation encompassing the bonds influence the configuration of the respective nucleoside and nucleotide. The secondary structure of a nucleic acid is determined by the rotation of its 7 torsion angles. Having a large amount of torsion angles allows for greater flexibility. In closed ring riboses, the observed flexibility mentioned above is not observed because the ring cycle imposes a limit on the number of torsion angles possible in the structure. Conformers of closed form riboses differ in regards to how the lone oxygen in the molecule is positioned respective to the nitrogenous base (also known as a nucleobase or just a base) attached to the ribose. If a carbon is facing towards the base, then the ribose is labeled as endo. If a carbon is facing away from the base, then the ribose is labeled as exo. If there is an oxygen molecule attached to the 2' carbon of a closed cycle ribose, then the exo confirmation is more stable because it decreases the interactions of the oxygen with the base. The difference itself is quite small, but when looking at an entire chain of RNA the slight difference amounts to a sizable impact. Some pucker configurations of ribose A ribose molecule is typically represented as a planar molecule on paper. Despite this, it is typically non-planar in nature. Even between hydrogen atoms, the many constituents on a ribose molecule cause steric hindrance and strain between them. To relieve this crowding and ring strain, the ring puckers, i.e. becomes non-planar. This puckering is achieved by displacing an atom from the plane, relieving the strain and yielding a more stable conformation. Puckering, otherwise known as the sugar ring conformation (specifically ribose sugar), can be described by the amplitude of pucker as well as the pseudorotation angle. The pseudo-rotation angle can be described as either ""north (N)"" or ""south (S)"" range. While both ranges are found in double helices, the north range is commonly associated with RNA and the A form of DNA. In contrast, the south range is associated with B form DNA. Z-DNA contains sugars in both the north and south ranges. When only a single atom is displaced, it is referred to as an ""envelope"" pucker. When two atoms are displaced, it is referred to as a ""twist"" pucker, in reference to the zigzag orientation. In an ""endo"" pucker, the major displacement of atoms is on the β-face, the same side as the C4'-C5' bond and the base. In an ""exo"" pucker, the major displacement of atoms is on the α-face, on the opposite side of the ring. The major forms of ribose are the 3'-endo pucker (commonly adopted by RNA and A-form DNA) and 2'-endo pucker (commonly adopted by B-form DNA). These ring puckers are developed from changes in ring torsion angles; there are infinite combinations of angles so therefore, there is an infinite number of transposable pucker conformations, each separated by disparate activation energies. == Functions == ATP is derived from ribose; it contains one ribose, three phosphate groups, and an adenine base. ATP is created during cellular respiration from adenosine diphosphate (ATP with one less phosphate group). === Signaling pathways === Ribose is a building block in secondary signaling molecules such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which is derived from ATP. One specific case in which cAMP is used is in cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. In cAMP signaling pathways, either a stimulative or inhibitory hormone receptor is activated by a signal molecule. These receptors are linked to a stimulative or inhibitory regulative G-protein. When a stimulative G-protein is activated, adenylyl cyclase catalyzes ATP into cAMP by using Mg2+ or Mn2+. cAMP, a secondary messenger, then goes on to activate protein kinase A, which is an enzyme that regulates cell metabolism. Protein kinase A regulates metabolic enzymes by phosphorylation which causes a change in the cell depending on the original signal molecule. The opposite occurs when an inhibitory G-protein is activated; the G-protein inhibits adenylyl cyclase and ATP is not converted to cAMP. === Metabolism === Ribose is referred to as the ""molecular currency"" because of its involvement in intracellular energy transfers. For example, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) all contain the d-ribofuranose moiety. They can each be derived from d-ribose after it is converted to d-ribose 5-phosphate by the enzyme ribokinase. NAD, FAD, and NADP act as electron acceptors in biochemical redox reactions in major metabolic pathways including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, fermentation, and the electron transport chain. === Nucleotide biosynthesis === Nucleotides are synthesized through salvage or de novo synthesis. Nucleotide salvage uses pieces of previously made nucleotides and re-synthesizes them for future use. In de novo, amino acids, carbon dioxide, folate derivatives, and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) are used to synthesize nucleotides. Both de novo and salvage require PRPP which is synthesized from ATP and ribose 5-phosphate by an enzyme called PRPP synthetase. == Modifications == === Modifications in nature === Ribokinase catalyzes the conversion of d-ribose to d-ribose 5-phosphate. Once converted, d-ribose-5-phosphate is available for the manufacturing of the amino acids tryptophan and histidine, or for use in the pentose phosphate pathway. The absorption of d-ribose is 88–100% in the small intestines (up to 200 mg/kg·h). One important modification occurs at the C2' position of the ribose molecule. By adding an O-alkyl group, the nuclear resistance of the RNA is increased because of additional stabilizing forces. These forces are stabilizing because of the increase of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and an increase in the glycosidic bond stability. The resulting increase of resistance leads to increases in the half-life of siRNA and the potential therapeutic potential in cells and animals. The methylation of ribose at particular sites is correlated with a decrease in immune stimulation. === Synthetic modifications === Along with phosphorylation, ribofuranose molecules can exchange their oxygen with selenium and sulfur to produce similar sugars that only vary at the 4' position. These derivatives are more lipophilic than the original molecule. Increased lipophilicity makes these species more suitable for use in techniques such as PCR, RNA aptamer post-modification, antisense technology, and for phasing X-ray crystallographic data. Similar to the 2' modifications in nature, a synthetic modification of ribose includes the addition of fluorine at the 2' position. This fluorinated ribose acts similar to the methylated ribose because it is capable of suppressing immune stimulation depending on the location of the ribose in the DNA strand. The big difference between methylation and fluorination, is the latter only occurs through synthetic modifications. The addition of fluorine leads to an increase in the stabilization of the glycosidic bond and an increase of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. == Medical uses == d-ribose has been suggested for use in management of congestive heart failure (as well as other forms of heart disease) and for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) in an open-label non-blinded, non-randomized, and non-crossover subjective study. Supplemental d-ribose can bypass part of the pentose phosphate pathway, an energy-producing pathway, to produce d-ribose-5-phosphate. The enzyme glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) is often in short supply in cells, but more so in diseased tissue, such as in myocardial cells in patients with cardiac disease. The supply of d-ribose in the mitochondria is directly correlated with ATP production; decreased d-ribose supply reduces the amount of ATP being produced. Studies suggest that supplementing d-ribose following tissue ischemia (e.g. myocardial ischemia) increases myocardial ATP production, and therefore mitochondrial function. Essentially, administering supplemental d-ribose bypasses an enzymatic step in the pentose phosphate pathway by providing an alternate source of 5-phospho-d-ribose 1-pyrophosphate for ATP production. Supplemental d-ribose enhances recovery of ATP levels while also reducing cellular injury in humans and other animals. One study suggested that the use of supplemental d-ribose reduces the instance of angina in men with diagnosed coronary artery disease. d-Ribose has been used to treat many pathological conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and myocardial dysfunction. It is also used to reduce symptoms of cramping, pain, stiffness, etc. after exercise and to improve athletic performance. == References ==",Ribose,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.0896136537194252), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0005533903022296727), (' FOOD', -0.22546343505382538), (',', -0.00862119346857071), (' MED', -0.012751073576509953), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.018408291041851044), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -8.22540732769994e-06), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.014257941395044327), ('ĠFOOD', -0.2085963785648346), (',', -0.10027948021888733), ('ĠMED', -0.03047695942223072), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002495034597814083)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.003178782993927598), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -3.547789674485102e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://inci.guide/carbohydrates/ribose,https://cosmetics.specialchem.com/inci-ingredients/ribose,https://findanyanswer.com/what-foods-contain-ribose ', [])"
4611,"('Pentopyranose', 'Pentopyranoside', 'Pentose', 'Oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol', 'Holzzucker; losan;alpha-xylose')","Food, Medical","In chemistry, a pentose is a monosaccharide (simple sugar) with five carbon atoms. The chemical formula of many pentoses is C5H10O5, and their molecular weight is 150.13 g/mol. Pentoses are very important in biochemistry. Ribose is a constituent of RNA, and the related molecule, deoxyribose, is a constituent of DNA. Phosphorylated pentoses are important products of the pentose phosphate pathway, most importantly ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), which is used in the synthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids. Like some other monosaccharides, pentoses exist in two forms, open-chain (linear) or closed-chain (cyclic), that easily convert into each other in water solutions. The linear form of a pentose, which usually exists only in solutions, has an open-chain backbone of five carbons. Four of these carbons have one hydroxyl functional group (–OH) each, connected by a single bond, and one has an oxygen atom connected by a double bond (=O), forming a carbonyl group (C=O). The remaining bonds of the carbon atoms are satisfied by six hydrogen atoms. Thus the structure of the linear form is H–(CHOH)x–C(=O)–(CHOH)4-x–H, where x is 0, 1, or 2. The term ""pentose"" sometimes is assumed to include deoxypentoses, such as deoxyribose: compounds with general formula C5H10O5-y that can be described as derived from pentoses by replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with hydrogen atoms. == Classification == The aldopentoses are a subclass of the pentoses which, in the linear form, have the carbonyl at carbon 1, forming an aldehyde derivative with structure H–C(=O)–(CHOH)4–H. The most important example is ribose. The ketopentoses instead have the carbonyl at positions 2 or 3, forming a ketone derivative with structure H–CHOH–C(=O)–(CHOH)3–H (2-ketopentose) or H–(CHOH)2–C(=O)–(CHOH)2–H (3-ketopentose). The latter is not known to occur in nature and are difficult to synthesize. In the open form, there are eight aldopentoses and four 2-ketopentoses, stereoisomers that differ in the spatial position of the hydroxyl groups. These forms occur in pairs of optical isomers, generally labelled ""D"" or ""L"" by conventional rules (independently of their optical activity). === Aldopentoses === The aldopentoses have three chiral centers; therefore, eight (23) different stereoisomers are possible. Ribose is a constituent of RNA, and the related molecule, deoxyribose, is a constituent of DNA. Phosphorylated pentoses are important products of the pentose phosphate pathway, most importantly ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), which is used in the synthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids, and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P), which is used in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids. === Ketopentoses === The 2-ketopentoses have two chiral centers; therefore, four (22) different stereoisomers are possible. The 3-ketopentoses are rare. == Cyclic forms == The closed or cyclic form of a pentose forms when the carbonyl group reacts with a hydroxyl in another carbon, turning the carbonyl into a hydroxyl and creating an ether bridge –O– between the two carbons. This intramolecular reaction yields a cyclic molecule, with a ring consisting of one oxygen atom and usually four carbon atoms; the cyclic compounds are then called furanoses, for having the same rings as the cyclic ether tetrahydrofuran. The ring closure converts the carbonyl carbon into a chiral center, which may adopt either of two configurations, depending on the position of the new hydroxyl. Therefore, each linear form can produce two distinct closed forms, identified by prefixes ""α"" and ""β"". == Deoxypentoses == The one deoxypentose has two total stereoisomers. == Properties == In the cell, pentoses have a higher metabolic stability than hexoses. A polymer composed of pentose sugars is called a pentosan. === Tests for pentoses === The most important tests for pentoses rely on converting the pentose to furfural, which then reacts with a chromophore. In Tollens’ test for pentoses (not to be confused with Tollens' silver-mirror test for reducing sugars), the furfural ring reacts with phloroglucinol to produce a colored compound; in the aniline acetate test with aniline acetate; and in Bial's test, with orcinol. In each of these tests, pentoses react much more strongly and quickly than hexoses. == References ==",Pentose,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.06950449198484421), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -0.0010330495424568653), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.16023823618888855), (' FOOD', -1.8624639324116288e-06)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.5443128347396851), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.611976353568025e-05), ('OUS', -1.311301275563892e-06), (',', -0.16034048795700073), ('ĠFOOD', -0.001359610934741795), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023356670513749123)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.5376482009887695), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -0.0015023599844425917)])","('INFO; ', [])"
4612,"('Proguanil hydrochloride', 'Paludrine hydrochloride', '(1e)-1-[amino-(4-chloroanilino)methylidene]-2-propan-2-ylguanidine;hydrochloride', 'Chloroquanil')",Medical,"Proguanil, also known as chlorguanide and chloroguanide, is a medication used to treat and prevent malaria. It is often used together with chloroquine or atovaquone. When used with chloroquine the combination will treat mild chloroquine resistant malaria. It is taken by mouth. Side effects include diarrhea, constipation, skin rashes, hair loss, and itchiness. Because malaria tends to be more severe in pregnancy, the benefit typically outweighs the risk. If used during pregnancy it should be taken with folate. It is likely safe for use during breastfeeding. Proguanil is converted by the liver to its active metabolite, cycloguanil. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States and Canada it is only available in combination as atovaquone/proguanil. == History == When the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor started World War II in the Pacific, the US became very interested in antimalarial medications and funded a large joint US-UK program to find new non-toxic and easy to produce drugs of the type. It was joined by a team led by Frank Rose at the Medical Chemicals Section of Imperial Chemical Industries (later Pharmaceuticals Division, which ended up demerged into Zeneca) at Blackley, which earlier developed a way to manufacture mepacrine, an antimalarial made exclusively in Germany before the war. Rose and his colleague Frank Curd decided to concentrate on pyrimidines as relatively simple to synthetise, even though the Advisory Panel recommended against that because most antimalarials by then were either quinolines or acridines. Checking prospective 2,4-diaminopyridine derivatives with a basic side chain and a benzenoid moiety one after another, they noticed a geometric pattern in the effective analogs and wondered if they could reproduce their interesting biologic activity with molecules even simpler, without the pyrimidine ring, and tried biguanides (then called diguanides) with which Rose was familiar due to his earlier sulphonamide research to great effect. The drug was introduced by ICI in 1945. == Medical uses == Proguanil is used for the prevention and treatment of malaria in both adults and children, particularly in areas where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria has been reported. It is usually taken in combination with atovaquone, another antimalarial drug. It is also effective in the treatment of most other multi-drug resistant forms of P. falciparum; the success rate exceeds 93%. == Side effects == Proguanil is generally well tolerated, and most people do not experience side effects. However, common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, headache, and fever. Taking proguanil with food may lessen these side effects. Proguanil should not be taken by people with severe renal impairment, pregnant women, or women who are breastfeeding children less than 5 kg. There have also been reports of increased levels of liver enzymes, which may remain high for up to 4 weeks after completion of treatment. == Mechanism == When used alone, proguanil functions as a prodrug. Its active metabolite, cycloguanil, is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Although both mammals and parasites produce DHFR, cycloguanil's inhibitory activity is specific for parasitic DHFR. This enzyme is a critical component of the folic acid cycle. Inhibition of DHFR prevents the parasite from recycling dihydrofolate back to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is required for DNA synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and methylation; thus, DHFR inhibition shuts down these processes. Proguanil displays synergism when used in combination with the antimalarial atovaquone. This mechanism of action differs from when proguanil was used as a singular agent. In this case, it is not thought to function as a DHFR inhibitor. The addition of proguanil has shown to reduce resistance to atovaquone and increase the ability of atovaquone to trigger a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. This is commonly referred to as ""collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential."" Proguanil lowers the effective concentration of atovaquone needed to increase permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. == References ==",Proguanil hydrochloride,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.34461570775602e-06), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009198724874295294)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/atovaquone-and-proguanil-oral-route/description/drg-20061484?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=152, start_index=9, title='Atovaquone and proguanil (oral route) - Mayo Clinic', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/atovaquone-and-proguanil-oral-route/description/drg-20061484?utm_source=openai')])"

ANIMALS 6 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES Horses received detomidine hydrochloride (20 μg/kg, IV), followed 10 minutes later by MK-467 hydrochloride (150 μg/kg; DET-MK), hyoscine butylbromide (0.2 mg/kg; DET-HYO), or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (DET-S), IV, in a Latin square design. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, arterial and venous blood pressures, and cardiac output were measured; blood gases and arterial plasma drug concentrations were analyzed; selected cardiopulmonary variables were calculated; and sedation and gastrointestinal borborygmi were scored at predetermined time points. Differences among treatments or within treatments over time were analyzed statistically. RESULTS With DET-MK, detomidine-induced hypertension and bradycardia were reversed shortly after MK-467 injection. Marked tachycardia and hypertension were observed with DET-HYO. Mean heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure differed significantly among all treatments from 15 to 35 and 15 to 40 minutes after detomidine injection, respectively. Cardiac output was greater with DET-MK and DET-HYO than with DET-S 15 minutes after detomidine injection, but left ventricular workload was significantly higher with DET-HYO. Borborygmus score, reduced with all treatments, was most rapidly restored with DET-MK. Sedation scores and pharmacokinetic parameters of detomidine did not differ between DET-S and DET-MK. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE MK-467 reversed or attenuated cardiovascular and gastrointestinal effects of detomidine without notable adverse effects or alterations in detomidine-induced sedation in horses. Further research is needed to determine whether these advantages are found in clinical patients and to assess whether the drug influences analgesic effects of detomidine. To study and compare the efficacy and side effects of drotaverine hydrochloride and hyoscine-N-butylbromide in the augmentation of labor. A prospective randomized trial of 150 women in active labor included 50 women given drotaverine (group 1), 50 women given hyoscine-N-butylbromide (group 2), and 50 women given no medication (group 3). Duration of labor, rate of cervical dilation, mode of delivery, side effects, and neonatal outcome were compared among the groups. The mean duration of the active phase of labor was 4.48+/-2.26 h, 3.9+/-2.42 h, and 3.6+/-2.07 h in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The mean rate of cervical dilation was 2.6 cm/h, 2.4 cm/h, and 2.5 cm/h, respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. There was no difference in the duration of the second and third stages of labor. No adverse maternal or fetal outcomes were noted. Drotaverine hydrochloride and hyoscine-N-butylbromide do not have a role in augmentation of labor. The aim of this study was to determine the compatibility and stability of morphine hydrochloride and hyoscine-N-butyl bromide combined in solution at three different concentrations and stored in polypropylene syringes at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C over a period of 15 days. The doses assayed were 20, 60 and 120 mg/day for morphine hydrochloride and 40, 60 and 80 mg/day for hyoscine-N-butyl bromide. These dose ranges were chosen according to daily practice. At both temperatures, all mixtures can be considered as physically compatible since no evidence of incompatibility-that is precipitation, turbidity, colour change or opacity and gas production-were observed. After 15 days of storage, the percentages of hyoscine-N-butyl bromide remaining in the drug mixtures tested ranged between 96.07% and 92.23%.

4614,"('Scopolamine hydrobromide', 'Scopolamine hbr', 'Scopos', 'Hyoscine hydrobromide', 'Scopolamine (hydrobromide)')",Medical,"Scopolamine, also known as hyoscine, or Devil's Breath, is a natural or synthetically produced tropane alkaloid and anticholinergic drug that is used as a medication to treat motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting. It is also sometimes used before surgery to decrease saliva. When used by injection, effects begin after about 20 minutes and last for up to 8 hours. It may also be used orally and as a transdermal patch since it has been long known to have transdermal bioavailability. Scopolamine is in the antimuscarinic family of drugs and works by blocking some of the effects of acetylcholine within the nervous system. Scopolamine was first written about in 1881 and started to be used for anesthesia around 1900. Scopolamine is also the main active component produced by certain plants of the nightshade family, which historically have been used as psychoactive drugs, known as deliriants, due to their antimuscarinic-induced hallucinogenic effects in higher doses. In these contexts, its mind-altering effects have been utilized for recreational and occult purposes. The name ""scopolamine"" is derived from one type of nightshade known as Scopolia, while the name ""hyoscine"" is derived from another type known as Hyoscyamus niger, or black henbane. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Scopolamine has a number of formal uses in modern medicine where it is used in its isolated form and in low doses to treat: Postoperative nausea and vomiting Motion sickness, including sea sickness, leading to its use by scuba divers (where it is often applied as a transdermal patch behind the ear) Gastrointestinal spasms Renal or biliary spasms Aid in gastrointestinal radiology and endoscopy Irritable bowel syndrome Clozapine-induced drooling Bowel colic Eye inflammation It is sometimes used as a premedication, especially to reduce respiratory tract secretions in surgery, most commonly by injection. Common side effects include sleepiness, blurred vision, dilated pupils, and dry mouth. It is not recommended in people with angle-closure glaucoma or bowel obstruction. Whether its use during pregnancy is safe remains unclear, and use during breastfeeding is still cautioned by health professionals and manufacturers of the drug. === Breastfeeding === Scopolamine enters breast milk by secretion. Although no human studies exist to document the safety of scopolamine while nursing, the manufacturer recommends that caution be taken if scopolamine is administered to a breastfeeding woman. == Adverse effects == Adverse effect incidence: Uncommon (0.1–1% incidence) adverse effects include: Dry mouth Anhidrosis (reduced ability to sweat to cool off) Tachycardia (usually occurs at higher doses and is succeeded by bradycardia) Bradycardia Urticaria (hives) Pruritus (itching) Rare (<0.1% incidence) adverse effects include: Constipation Urinary retention Hallucinations Agitation Confusion Restlessness Seizures Unknown frequency adverse effects include: Anaphylactic shock or reactions Dyspnea (shortness of breath) Rash Erythema Other hypersensitivity reactions Blurred vision Mydriasis (dilated pupils) Drowsiness Dizziness Somnolence == Overdose == Physostigmine, a cholinergic drug that readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, has been used as an antidote to treat the central nervous system depression symptoms of a scopolamine overdose. Other than this supportive treatment, gastric lavage and induced emesis (vomiting) are usually recommended as treatments for oral overdoses. The symptoms of overdose include: Tachycardia Arrhythmia Blurred vision Photophobia Urinary retention Drowsiness or paradoxical reaction, which can present with hallucinations Cheyne–Stokes respiration Dry mouth Skin reddening Inhibition of gastrointestinal motility == Route of administration == Scopolamine can be taken by mouth, subcutaneously, in the eye, and intravenously, as well as via a transdermal patch. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The pharmacological effects of scopolamine are mediated through the drug's competitive antagonism of the peripheral and central muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Scopolamine acts as a nonspecific muscarinic antagonist at all four (M1, M2, M3, and M4) receptor sites. In doses higher than intended for medicinal use, the hallucinogenic alteration of consciousness, as well as the deliriousness in particular, are tied to the compound's activity at the M1 muscarinic receptor. M1 receptors are located primarily in the central nervous system and are involved in perception, attention, and cognitive functioning. Delirium is only associated with the antagonism of postsynaptic M1 receptors and currently other receptor subtypes have not been implicated. Peripheral muscarinic receptors are part of the autonomic nervous system. M2 receptors are located in the brain and heart, M3 receptors are in salivary glands and M4 receptors are in the brain and lungs. Due to the drug's inhibition of various signal transduction pathways, the decrease in acetylcholine signaling is what leads to many of the cognitive deficits, mental impairments, and delirium associated with psychoactive doses. Medicinal effects appear to mostly be tied to activation of the peripheral receptors and only from marginal decreases in acetylcholine signaling. Although often broadly referred to as simply being 'anticholinergic', antimuscarinic would be more specific and accurate terminology to use for scopolamine, as, for example, it is not known to block nicotinic receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Scopolamine undergoes first-pass metabolism and about 2.6% is excreted unchanged in urine. It has a bioavailability of 20-40%, reaches peak plasma concentration in about 45 minutes, and in healthy subjects has an average half-life of 5 hours (observed range 2 - 10 hours). Scopolamine is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, and Grapefruit juice decreases metabolism of scopolamine, consequently increasing plasma concentration. == Chemistry == === Biosynthesis in plants === Scopolamine is among the secondary metabolites of plants from Solanaceae (nightshade) family of plants, such as henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), jimson weed (Datura), angel's trumpets (Brugmansia), deadly nightshade (Belladonna), mandrake (Mandragora officinarum), and corkwood (Duboisia). The biosynthesis of scopolamine begins with the decarboxylation of L-ornithine to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase. Putrescine is methylated to N-methylputrescine by putrescine N-methyltransferase. A putrescine oxidase that specifically recognizes methylated putrescine catalyzes the deamination of this compound to 4-methylaminobutanal, which then undergoes a spontaneous ring formation to N-methyl-pyrrolium cation. In the next step, the pyrrolium cation condenses with acetoacetic acid yielding hygrine. No enzymatic activity could be demonstrated to catalyze this reaction. Hygrine further rearranges to tropinone. Subsequently, tropinone reductase I converts tropinone to tropine, which condenses with phenylalanine-derived phenyllactate to littorine. A cytochrome P450 classified as Cyp80F1 oxidizes and rearranges littorine to hyoscyamine aldehyde. In the final step, hyoscyamine undergoes epoxidation catalyzed by 6beta-hydroxyhyoscyamine epoxidase yielding scopolamine. == History == Plants naturally containing scopolamine such as Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade), Brugmansia (angels trumpet), Datura (Jimson weed), Hyoscyamus niger, Mandragora officinarum, Scopolia carniolica, Latua and Duboisia myoporoides have been known about and used for various purposes in both the New and Old Worlds since ancient times. Being one of the earlier alkaloids isolated from plant sources, scopolamine has been in use in its purified forms, such as various salts, including hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, and sulfate, since its official isolation by the German scientist Albert Ladenburg in 1880, and as various preparations from its plant-based form since antiquity and perhaps prehistoric times. In 1899, Dr. Schneiderlin recommended the use of scopolamine and morphine for surgical anaesthesia, and it started to be used sporadically for that purpose. The use of this combination in obstetric anesthesiology (childbirth) was first proposed by Richard von Steinbuchel in 1902 and was picked up and further developed by Carl Gauss in Freiburg, Germany, starting in 1903. The method, which was based on a drug synergy between both scopolamine and morphine came to be known as Dämmerschlaf (""twilight sleep"") or the ""Freiburg method"". It spread rather slowly, and different clinics experimented with different dosages and ingredients. In 1915, the Canadian Medical Association Journal reported, ""the method [was] really still in a state of development"". It remained widely used in the US until the 1960s, when growing chemophobia and a desire for more natural childbirth led to its abandonment. == Society and culture == === Names === Hyoscine hydrobromide is the international nonproprietary name, and scopolamine hydrobromide is the United States Adopted Name. Other names include levo-duboisine, devil's breath, and burundanga. === Australian bush medicine === A bush medicine developed by Aboriginal peoples of the eastern states of Australia from the soft corkwood tree (Duboisia myoporoides) was used by the Allies in World War II to stop soldiers from getting seasick when they sailed across the English Channel on their way to France during the Invasion of Normandy. Later, the same substance was found to be usable in the production of scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which are used in eye surgery, and a multimillion-dollar industry was built in Queensland based on this substance. === Recreational and religious use === While it has been occasionally used recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties, the experiences are often unpleasant, mentally and physically. It is also physically dangerous and officially classified as a deliriant drug, so repeated recreational use is rare. In June 2008, more than 20 people were hospitalized with psychosis in Norway after ingesting counterfeit rohypnol tablets containing scopolamine. In January 2018, 9 individuals were hospitalized in Perth, Western Australia, after reportedly ingesting scopolamine. The alkaloid scopolamine, when taken recreationally for its psychoactive effect, is usually taken in the form of preparations from plants of the genera Datura or Brugmansia, often by adolescents or young adults in order to achieve hallucinations and an altered state of consciousness induced by muscarinic antagonism. In circumstances such as these, the intoxication is usually built on a synergistic, but even more toxic mixture of the additional alkaloids in the plants which includes atropine and hyoscyamine. Historically, the various plants that produce scopolamine have been used psychoactively for spiritual and magical purposes, particularly by witches in western culture and indigenous groups throughout the Americas, such as Native American tribes like the Chumash. When entheogenic preparations of these plants were used, scopolamine was considered to be the main psychoactive compound and was largely responsible for the hallucinogenic effects, particularly when the preparation was made into a topical ointment, most notably flying ointment. Scopolamine is reported to be the only active alkaloid within these plants that can effectively be absorbed through the skin to cause effects. Different recipes for these ointments were explored in European witchcraft at least as far back as the Early Modern period and included multiple ingredients to help with the transdermal absorption of scopolamine, such as animal fat, as well as other possible ingredients to counteract its noxious and dysphoric effects. In the Bible, there are multiple mentions of Mandrake, a psychoactive and hallucinogenic plant root that contains scopolamine. It was associated with fertility and (sexual) desire for which it was yearned by Rachel, who was ""barren"" (infertile) but trying to conceive. === Interrogation === The effects of scopolamine were studied for use as a truth serum in interrogations in the early 20th century, but because of the side effects, investigations were dropped. In 2009, the Czechoslovak state security secret police were proven to have used scopolamine at least three times to obtain confessions from alleged antistate dissidents. === Use in crime === Ingestion of scopolamine can render a victim unconscious for 24 hours or more. In large doses, it can cause respiratory failure and death. The most common seems to be recorded in Colombia, where unofficial estimates put the number of annual scopolamine incidents at approximately 50,000. A travel advisory published by the U.S. Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) in 2012 stated: One common and particularly dangerous method that criminals use to rob a victim is through the use of drugs. Scopolamine is most often administered in liquid or powder form in foods and beverages. The majority of these incidents occur in nightclubs and bars, and usually, men, perceived to be wealthy, are targeted by young, attractive women. It is recommended that to avoid becoming a victim of scopolamine, a person should never accept food or beverages offered by strangers or new acquaintances, nor leave food or beverages unattended in their presence. Victims of scopolamine or other drugs should seek immediate medical attention. Between 1998 and 2004, 13% of emergency-room admissions for ""poisoning with criminal intentions"" in a clinic of Bogotá have been attributed to scopolamine, and 44% to benzodiazepines. Most commonly, the person has been poisoned by a robber who gave the victim a scopolamine-laced beverage, in the hope that the victim would become unconscious or unable to effectively resist the robbery. Beside robberies, it is also allegedly involved in express kidnappings and sexual assault. In 2008, the Hospital Clínic in Barcelona introduced a protocol to help medical workers identify cases. In February 2015, Madrid hospitals adopted a similar working document. Hospital Clínic has found little scientific evidence to support this use and relies on the victims' stories to reach any conclusion. Although poisoning by scopolamine appears quite often in the media as an aid for raping, kidnapping, killing, or robbery, the effects of this drug and the way it is applied by criminals (transdermal injection, on playing cards and papers, etc.) are often exaggerated, especially skin exposure, as the dose that can be absorbed by the skin is too low to have any effect. Scopolamine transdermal patches must be used for hours to days. There are certain other aspects of the usage of scopolamine in crimes. Powdered scopolamine is referred to as ""devil's breath"". In popular media and television, it is portrayed as a method to brainwash or control people into being defrauded by their attackers. There is debate whether these claims are true. == Research == Scopolamine is used as a research tool to study memory encoding. Initially, in human trials, relatively low doses of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine were found to induce temporary cognitive defects. Since then, scopolamine has become a standard drug for experimentally inducing cognitive defects in animals. Results in primates suggest that acetylcholine is involved in the encoding of new information into long-term memory. Scopolamine has been shown to exert a greater impairment on episodic memory, event-related potentials, memory retention and free recall compared to diphenhydramine (an anticholinergic and antihistamine). Scopolamine produces detrimental effects on short-term memory, memory acquisition, learning, visual recognition memory, visuospatial praxis, visuospatial memory, visuoperceptual function, verbal recall, and psychomotor speed. It does not seem to impair recognition and memory retrieval, though. Acetylcholine projections in hippocampal neurons, which are vital in mediating long-term potentiation, are inhibited by scopolamine. Scopolamine inhibits cholinergic-mediated glutamate release in hippocampal neurons, which assist in depolarization, potentiation of action potential, and synaptic suppression. Scopolamine's effects on acetylcholine and glutamate release in the hippocampus favor retrieval-dominant cognitive functioning. Scopolamine has been used to model the defects in cholinergic function for models of Alzheimer's, dementia, fragile X syndrome, and Down syndrome. Scopolamine has been identified as a psychoplastogen, which refers to a compound capable of promoting rapid and sustained neuroplasticity in a single dose. It has been and continues to be investigated as a rapid-onset antidepressant, with many small studies finding positive results, particularly in female subjects. NASA agreed to develop a nasal administration method. With a precise dosage, the NASA spray formulation has been shown to work faster and more reliably than the oral form to treat motion sickness. Although a fair amount of research has been applied to scopolamine in the field of medicine, its hallucinogenic (psychoactive) effects as well as the psychoactive effects of other antimuscarinic deliriants haven't been extensively researched or as well understood compared to other types of hallucinogens such as psychedelic and dissociative compounds, despite the alkaloid's long history of usage in mind-altering plant preparations. == References == == External links == Media related to Scopolamine at Wikimedia Commons",Hyoscine hydrobromide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.438573680294212e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00016878610767889768), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2519431412220001)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([mdwiki.org](https://www.mdwiki.org/wiki/Hyoscine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=79, start_index=9, title='Hyoscine - WikiProjectMed', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mdwiki.org/wiki/Hyoscine?utm_source=openai')])"
4615,"('Scopolamine', 'Hyoscine', 'Scopine tropate', 'Transderm-scop', 'Hyosol')",Medical,"Scopolamine, also known as hyoscine, or Devil's Breath, is a natural or synthetically produced tropane alkaloid and anticholinergic drug that is used as a medication to treat motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting. It is also sometimes used before surgery to decrease saliva. When used by injection, effects begin after about 20 minutes and last for up to 8 hours. It may also be used orally and as a transdermal patch since it has been long known to have transdermal bioavailability. Scopolamine is in the antimuscarinic family of drugs and works by blocking some of the effects of acetylcholine within the nervous system. Scopolamine was first written about in 1881 and started to be used for anesthesia around 1900. Scopolamine is also the main active component produced by certain plants of the nightshade family, which historically have been used as psychoactive drugs, known as deliriants, due to their antimuscarinic-induced hallucinogenic effects in higher doses. In these contexts, its mind-altering effects have been utilized for recreational and occult purposes. The name ""scopolamine"" is derived from one type of nightshade known as Scopolia, while the name ""hyoscine"" is derived from another type known as Hyoscyamus niger, or black henbane. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Scopolamine has a number of formal uses in modern medicine where it is used in its isolated form and in low doses to treat: Postoperative nausea and vomiting Motion sickness, including sea sickness, leading to its use by scuba divers (where it is often applied as a transdermal patch behind the ear) Gastrointestinal spasms Renal or biliary spasms Aid in gastrointestinal radiology and endoscopy Irritable bowel syndrome Clozapine-induced drooling Bowel colic Eye inflammation It is sometimes used as a premedication, especially to reduce respiratory tract secretions in surgery, most commonly by injection. Common side effects include sleepiness, blurred vision, dilated pupils, and dry mouth. It is not recommended in people with angle-closure glaucoma or bowel obstruction. Whether its use during pregnancy is safe remains unclear, and use during breastfeeding is still cautioned by health professionals and manufacturers of the drug. === Breastfeeding === Scopolamine enters breast milk by secretion. Although no human studies exist to document the safety of scopolamine while nursing, the manufacturer recommends that caution be taken if scopolamine is administered to a breastfeeding woman. == Adverse effects == Adverse effect incidence: Uncommon (0.1–1% incidence) adverse effects include: Dry mouth Anhidrosis (reduced ability to sweat to cool off) Tachycardia (usually occurs at higher doses and is succeeded by bradycardia) Bradycardia Urticaria (hives) Pruritus (itching) Rare (<0.1% incidence) adverse effects include: Constipation Urinary retention Hallucinations Agitation Confusion Restlessness Seizures Unknown frequency adverse effects include: Anaphylactic shock or reactions Dyspnea (shortness of breath) Rash Erythema Other hypersensitivity reactions Blurred vision Mydriasis (dilated pupils) Drowsiness Dizziness Somnolence == Overdose == Physostigmine, a cholinergic drug that readily crosses the blood–brain barrier, has been used as an antidote to treat the central nervous system depression symptoms of a scopolamine overdose. Other than this supportive treatment, gastric lavage and induced emesis (vomiting) are usually recommended as treatments for oral overdoses. The symptoms of overdose include: Tachycardia Arrhythmia Blurred vision Photophobia Urinary retention Drowsiness or paradoxical reaction, which can present with hallucinations Cheyne–Stokes respiration Dry mouth Skin reddening Inhibition of gastrointestinal motility == Route of administration == Scopolamine can be taken by mouth, subcutaneously, in the eye, and intravenously, as well as via a transdermal patch. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The pharmacological effects of scopolamine are mediated through the drug's competitive antagonism of the peripheral and central muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Scopolamine acts as a nonspecific muscarinic antagonist at all four (M1, M2, M3, and M4) receptor sites. In doses higher than intended for medicinal use, the hallucinogenic alteration of consciousness, as well as the deliriousness in particular, are tied to the compound's activity at the M1 muscarinic receptor. M1 receptors are located primarily in the central nervous system and are involved in perception, attention, and cognitive functioning. Delirium is only associated with the antagonism of postsynaptic M1 receptors and currently other receptor subtypes have not been implicated. Peripheral muscarinic receptors are part of the autonomic nervous system. M2 receptors are located in the brain and heart, M3 receptors are in salivary glands and M4 receptors are in the brain and lungs. Due to the drug's inhibition of various signal transduction pathways, the decrease in acetylcholine signaling is what leads to many of the cognitive deficits, mental impairments, and delirium associated with psychoactive doses. Medicinal effects appear to mostly be tied to activation of the peripheral receptors and only from marginal decreases in acetylcholine signaling. Although often broadly referred to as simply being 'anticholinergic', antimuscarinic would be more specific and accurate terminology to use for scopolamine, as, for example, it is not known to block nicotinic receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Scopolamine undergoes first-pass metabolism and about 2.6% is excreted unchanged in urine. It has a bioavailability of 20-40%, reaches peak plasma concentration in about 45 minutes, and in healthy subjects has an average half-life of 5 hours (observed range 2 - 10 hours). Scopolamine is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, and Grapefruit juice decreases metabolism of scopolamine, consequently increasing plasma concentration. == Chemistry == === Biosynthesis in plants === Scopolamine is among the secondary metabolites of plants from Solanaceae (nightshade) family of plants, such as henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), jimson weed (Datura), angel's trumpets (Brugmansia), deadly nightshade (Belladonna), mandrake (Mandragora officinarum), and corkwood (Duboisia). The biosynthesis of scopolamine begins with the decarboxylation of L-ornithine to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase. Putrescine is methylated to N-methylputrescine by putrescine N-methyltransferase. A putrescine oxidase that specifically recognizes methylated putrescine catalyzes the deamination of this compound to 4-methylaminobutanal, which then undergoes a spontaneous ring formation to N-methyl-pyrrolium cation. In the next step, the pyrrolium cation condenses with acetoacetic acid yielding hygrine. No enzymatic activity could be demonstrated to catalyze this reaction. Hygrine further rearranges to tropinone. Subsequently, tropinone reductase I converts tropinone to tropine, which condenses with phenylalanine-derived phenyllactate to littorine. A cytochrome P450 classified as Cyp80F1 oxidizes and rearranges littorine to hyoscyamine aldehyde.

In the final step, hyoscyamine undergoes epoxidation catalyzed by 6beta-hydroxyhyoscyamine epoxidase yielding scopolamine. == History == Plants naturally containing scopolamine such as Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade), Brugmansia (angels trumpet), Datura (Jimson weed), Hyoscyamus niger, Mandragora officinarum, Scopolia carniolica, Latua and Duboisia myoporoides have been known about and used for various purposes in both the New and Old Worlds since ancient times. Being one of the earlier alkaloids isolated from plant sources, scopolamine has been in use in its purified forms, such as various salts, including hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, and sulfate, since its official isolation by the German scientist Albert Ladenburg in 1880, and as various preparations from its plant-based form since antiquity and perhaps prehistoric times. In 1899, Dr. Schneiderlin recommended the use of scopolamine and morphine for surgical anaesthesia, and it started to be used sporadically for that purpose. The use of this combination in obstetric anesthesiology (childbirth) was first proposed by Richard von Steinbuchel in 1902 and was picked up and further developed by Carl Gauss in Freiburg, Germany, starting in 1903. The method, which was based on a drug synergy between both scopolamine and morphine came to be known as Dämmerschlaf (""twilight sleep"") or the ""Freiburg method"". It spread rather slowly, and different clinics experimented with different dosages and ingredients. In 1915, the Canadian Medical Association Journal reported, ""the method [was] really still in a state of development"". It remained widely used in the US until the 1960s, when growing chemophobia and a desire for more natural childbirth led to its abandonment. == Society and culture == === Names === Hyoscine hydrobromide is the international nonproprietary name, and scopolamine hydrobromide is the United States Adopted Name. Other names include levo-duboisine, devil's breath, and burundanga. === Australian bush medicine === A bush medicine developed by Aboriginal peoples of the eastern states of Australia from the soft corkwood tree (Duboisia myoporoides) was used by the Allies in World War II to stop soldiers from getting seasick when they sailed across the English Channel on their way to France during the Invasion of Normandy. Later, the same substance was found to be usable in the production of scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which are used in eye surgery, and a multimillion-dollar industry was built in Queensland based on this substance. === Recreational and religious use === While it has been occasionally used recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties, the experiences are often unpleasant, mentally and physically. It is also physically dangerous and officially classified as a deliriant drug, so repeated recreational use is rare. In June 2008, more than 20 people were hospitalized with psychosis in Norway after ingesting counterfeit rohypnol tablets containing scopolamine. In January 2018, 9 individuals were hospitalized in Perth, Western Australia, after reportedly ingesting scopolamine. The alkaloid scopolamine, when taken recreationally for its psychoactive effect, is usually taken in the form of preparations from plants of the genera Datura or Brugmansia, often by adolescents or young adults in order to achieve hallucinations and an altered state of consciousness induced by muscarinic antagonism. In circumstances such as these, the intoxication is usually built on a synergistic, but even more toxic mixture of the additional alkaloids in the plants which includes atropine and hyoscyamine. Historically, the various plants that produce scopolamine have been used psychoactively for spiritual and magical purposes, particularly by witches in western culture and indigenous groups throughout the Americas, such as Native American tribes like the Chumash. When entheogenic preparations of these plants were used, scopolamine was considered to be the main psychoactive compound and was largely responsible for the hallucinogenic effects, particularly when the preparation was made into a topical ointment, most notably flying ointment. Scopolamine is reported to be the only active alkaloid within these plants that can effectively be absorbed through the skin to cause effects. Different recipes for these ointments were explored in European witchcraft at least as far back as the Early Modern period and included multiple ingredients to help with the transdermal absorption of scopolamine, such as animal fat, as well as other possible ingredients to counteract its noxious and dysphoric effects. In the Bible, there are multiple mentions of Mandrake, a psychoactive and hallucinogenic plant root that contains scopolamine. It was associated with fertility and (sexual) desire for which it was yearned by Rachel, who was ""barren"" (infertile) but trying to conceive. === Interrogation === The effects of scopolamine were studied for use as a truth serum in interrogations in the early 20th century, but because of the side effects, investigations were dropped. In 2009, the Czechoslovak state security secret police were proven to have used scopolamine at least three times to obtain confessions from alleged antistate dissidents. === Use in crime === Ingestion of scopolamine can render a victim unconscious for 24 hours or more. In large doses, it can cause respiratory failure and death. The most common seems to be recorded in Colombia, where unofficial estimates put the number of annual scopolamine incidents at approximately 50,000. A travel advisory published by the U.S. Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) in 2012 stated: One common and particularly dangerous method that criminals use to rob a victim is through the use of drugs. Scopolamine is most often administered in liquid or powder form in foods and beverages. The majority of these incidents occur in nightclubs and bars, and usually, men, perceived to be wealthy, are targeted by young, attractive women. It is recommended that to avoid becoming a victim of scopolamine, a person should never accept food or beverages offered by strangers or new acquaintances, nor leave food or beverages unattended in their presence. Victims of scopolamine or other drugs should seek immediate medical attention. Between 1998 and 2004, 13% of emergency-room admissions for ""poisoning with criminal intentions"" in a clinic of Bogotá have been attributed to scopolamine, and 44% to benzodiazepines. Most commonly, the person has been poisoned by a robber who gave the victim a scopolamine-laced beverage, in the hope that the victim would become unconscious or unable to effectively resist the robbery. Beside robberies, it is also allegedly involved in express kidnappings and sexual assault. In 2008, the Hospital Clínic in Barcelona introduced a protocol to help medical workers identify cases. In February 2015, Madrid hospitals adopted a similar working document. Hospital Clínic has found little scientific evidence to support this use and relies on the victims' stories to reach any conclusion. Although poisoning by scopolamine appears quite often in the media as an aid for raping, kidnapping, killing, or robbery, the effects of this drug and the way it is applied by criminals (transdermal injection, on playing cards and papers, etc.) are often exaggerated, especially skin exposure, as the dose that can be absorbed by the skin is too low to have any effect. Scopolamine transdermal patches must be used for hours to days. There are certain other aspects of the usage of scopolamine in crimes. Powdered scopolamine is referred to as ""devil's breath"". In popular media and television, it is portrayed as a method to brainwash or control people into being defrauded by their attackers. There is debate whether these claims are true. == Research == Scopolamine is used as a research tool to study memory encoding. Initially, in human trials, relatively low doses of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine were found to induce temporary cognitive defects. Since then, scopolamine has become a standard drug for experimentally inducing cognitive defects in animals. Results in primates suggest that acetylcholine is involved in the encoding of new information into long-term memory. Scopolamine has been shown to exert a greater impairment on episodic memory, event-related potentials, memory retention and free recall compared to diphenhydramine (an anticholinergic and antihistamine). Scopolamine produces detrimental effects on short-term memory, memory acquisition, learning, visual recognition memory, visuospatial praxis, visuospatial memory, visuoperceptual function, verbal recall, and psychomotor speed. It does not seem to impair recognition and memory retrieval, though. Acetylcholine projections in hippocampal neurons, which are vital in mediating long-term potentiation, are inhibited by scopolamine. Scopolamine inhibits cholinergic-mediated glutamate release in hippocampal neurons, which assist in depolarization, potentiation of action potential, and synaptic suppression. Scopolamine's effects on acetylcholine and glutamate release in the hippocampus favor retrieval-dominant cognitive functioning. Scopolamine has been used to model the defects in cholinergic function for models of Alzheimer's, dementia, fragile X syndrome, and Down syndrome. Scopolamine has been identified as a psychoplastogen, which refers to a compound capable of promoting rapid and sustained neuroplasticity in a single dose. It has been and continues to be investigated as a rapid-onset antidepressant, with many small studies finding positive results, particularly in female subjects. NASA agreed to develop a nasal administration method. With a precise dosage, the NASA spray formulation has been shown to work faster and more reliably than the oral form to treat motion sickness. Although a fair amount of research has been applied to scopolamine in the field of medicine, its hallucinogenic (psychoactive) effects as well as the psychoactive effects of other antimuscarinic deliriants haven't been extensively researched or as well understood compared to other types of hallucinogens such as psychedelic and dissociative compounds, despite the alkaloid's long history of usage in mind-altering plant preparations. == References == == External links == Media related to Scopolamine at Wikimedia Commons",Scopolamine hydrobromide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.008129963040119e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00017474555352237076), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5759554505348206)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ', [])"

People with chronic breathing disorders such as asthma use this as a bronchodilator to make breathing easier. It is most commonly available as the hydrochloride salt, clenbuterol hydrochloride. It was patented in 1967 and came into medical use in 1977. == Medical uses == Clenbuterol is approved for use in some countries as a bronchodilator for asthma. Clenbuterol is a β2 agonist with some structural and pharmacological similarities to epinephrine and salbutamol, but its effects are more potent and longer-lasting as a stimulant and thermogenic drug. It is commonly used for smooth muscle-relaxant properties as a bronchodilator and tocolytic. It is classified by the World Anti-Doping Agency as an anabolic agent, not as a β2 agonist. Clenbuterol is prescribed for treatment of respiratory diseases for horses, and as an obstetrical aid in cattle. It is illegal in some countries to use in livestock used for food. == Side effects == Clenbuterol can cause these side effects: Nervousness Thyrotoxicosis Tachycardia Subaortic stenosis High blood pressure == Overdose == Use over the recommended dose of about 120 μg can cause muscle tremors, headache, dizziness, and gastric irritation. Persons self-administering the drug for weight loss or to improve athletic performance have experienced nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, and myocardial infarction. Use of the drug may be confirmed by detecting its presence in semen or urine. == Pharmacology == Clenbuterol acts as a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Clenbuterol is not an ingredient of any therapeutic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and is now banned for IOC-tested athletes. In the US, administration of clenbuterol to any animal that could be used as food for human consumption is banned by the FDA. === Weight-loss === Although often used by bodybuilders during their ""cutting"" cycles, the drug has been more recently known to the mainstream, particularly through publicized stories of use by celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohan, for its off-label use as a weight-loss drug similar to usage of other sympathomimetic amines such as ephedrine, despite the lack of sufficient clinical testing either supporting or negating such use. In 2021, Odalis Santos Mena, a Mexican fitness influencer, died after suffering a cardiac arrest while being anesthetized for a procedure of miraDry, a treatment that uses thermal energy to eliminate underarm sweat glands. The coroner reported that Mena's death was attributed to a combination of Clenbuterol and anesthesia. === Performance-enhancing drug === A common misconception about clenbuterol is that it has anabolic properties, and can increase muscle mass when used in higher dosages. This claim has never been substantiated, and likely originated from equine research. A β2 agonist, Clenbuterol has been found to increase short-term work rate and cardiovascular output, and consequently, its anabolic effects in horses can be attributed to exercise output and increased caloric intake. Given its ability to increase basal metabolic rate, maximum heart rate, and exercise output, Clenbuterol has ergogenic properties more closely related to ephedrine or amphetamine. The notion that Clenbuterol is an anabolic agent likely originated from author and renowned authority on performance-enhancement Dan Duchaine. Duchaine popularized the drug in the bodybuilding community, and was the first to suggest the drug had muscle-building properties. Likewise, Duchaine erred in promoting the drug Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) as an anabolic agent, and served time for the unlawful possession and distribution of the drug in the mid-1990s. As of 2011, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) listed Clenbuterol as an anabolic agent, despite the fact there is no evidence to suggest this is the case. Clenbuterol has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug. One issue is that clenbuterol is a food contaminant in some countries; doping control must distinguish between accidental and deliberate intake. === Food contamination === Clenbuterol is occasionally referred to as ""bute"" and this risks confusion with phenylbutazone, also called ""bute"". Phenylbutazone, which is a drug also used with horses, was tested for in the 2013 European meat adulteration scandal. Intended to result in leaner meat with a higher muscle-to-fat ratio, the use of clenbuterol has been banned in meat since 1991 in the US and since 1996 in the European Union. The drug is banned due to health concerns about symptoms noted in consumers. These include increased heart rate, muscular tremors, headaches, nausea, fever, and chills. In several cases in Europe, these adverse symptoms have been temporary. Clenbuterol is a growth-promoting drug in the β agonist class of compounds. It is not licensed for use in China, the United States, or the EU for food-producing animals, but some countries have approved it for animals not used for food, and a few countries have approved it for therapeutic uses in food-producing animals. Not just athletes are affected by contamination. In Portugal, 50 people were reported as affected by clenbuterol in liver and pork between 1998 and 2002, while in 1990, veal liver was suspected of causing clenbuterol poisoning in 22 people in France and 135 people in Spain. In September 2006, some 330 people in Shanghai suffered from food poisoning after eating clenbuterol-contaminated pork. In February 2009, at least 70 people in one Chinese province (Guangdong) suffered food poisoning after eating pig organs believed to contain clenbuterol residue. The victims complained of stomach aches and diarrhea after eating pig organs bought in local markets. In March 2011, China's Ministry of Agriculture said the government would launch a one-year crackdown on illegal additives in pig feed, after a subsidiary of Shuanghui Group, China's largest meat producer, was exposed for using clenbuterol-contaminated pork in its meat products. A total of 72 people in central Henan Province, where Shuanghui is based, were taken into police custody for allegedly producing, selling, or using clenbuterol. The situation has dramatically improved in China since September 2011, when a ban of clenbuterol was announced by China's Ministry of Agriculture. Authorities around the world appear to be issuing stricter food safety requirements, such as the Food Safety Modernization Act in the United States, Canada's revision of their import regulations, China's new food laws published since 2009, South Africa's new food law, and many more global changes and restrictions. == Veterinary use == Clenbuterol is administered as an aerosol for the treatment of allergic respiratory disease in horses as a bronchodilator, and intravenously in cattle to relax the uterus in cows at the time of parturition, specifically to facilitate exteriorisation of the uterus during Caesarian section surgery.

4620,"('Daunorubicin hcl (daunomycin hcl)',)",Medical," The purpose of these studies was to evaluate bone marrow from male CD rats following exposure to known hematotoxins using flow cytometry (FC) and a monoclonal antibody to the cell surface antigen CD71. Rats were treated with either CHO (300 mg/kg for 10 days) or DAUN (10 mg/kg for 1 day). Control groups received the appropriate vehicle. Half of the animals from each group were euthanized at the end of the dosing schedule and the remaining animals were euthanized after a recovery period. Hematology analyses were completed prior to the onset of each study and on the day of necropsy. Marrow was isolated from the tibia, stained with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD71 (transferrin receptor on proliferating cells) monoclonal antibody, and then analyzed by FC for myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratios. FC determinations of myeloid and erythroid population percentages and M:E ratios from untreated rats were confirmed by microscopic examination of marrow cytospins and selected flow cell sorts. M:E ratios for control animals determined by FC were not significantly different between the two studies (1.83 vs 1.89). CHO treatment caused a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in M:E ratios (0.96 for CHO vs 1.48 for control) at day 11 due to increased erythroid cells. M:E ratios were significantly increased (p < 0.05) with DAUN treatment at day 3 (5.07 for DAUN vs 1.70 for control) and corresponded to generalized depletion of all marrow cell lines, especially erythroid cells. After recovery, M:E ratios of CHO and DAUN rats were similar to controls. Hematological values corroborated changes in marrow myeloid and erythroid populations evaluated by this FC technique. Using FC and a monoclonal antibody to the cell surface antigen CD71, this study confirmed the reversible selective toxicity on myeloid and erythroid marrow populations following in vivo exposure to CHO or DAUN.

4621,"('Cerubidin', 'Daunorubicin mixt. with native calf thymus dna', 'Daunorubicine', 'Rubomycin c', 'Rubomycin')",Medical,"Daunorubicin, also known as daunomycin, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer. Specifically it is used for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and Kaposi's sarcoma. It is administered by injection into a vein. A liposomal formulation known as liposomal daunorubicin also exists. Common side effects include hair loss, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and inflammation of the inside of the mouth. Other severe side effects include heart disease and tissue death at the site of injection. Use in pregnancy may harm the fetus. Daunorubicin is in the anthracycline family of medication. It works in part by blocking the function of topoisomerase II. Daunorubicin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1979. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally isolated from bacteria of the Streptomyces type. == Medical uses == It slows or stops the growth of cancer cells in the body. Treatment is usually performed together with other chemotherapy drugs (such as cytarabine), and its administration depends on the type of tumor and the degree of response. In addition to its major use in treating acute myeloid leukemia, daunorubicin is also used to treat neuroblastoma. Daunorubicin has been used with other chemotherapy agents to treat the blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Daunorubicin is also used as the starting material for semi-synthetic manufacturing of doxorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin. == Mechanism of action == Similar to doxorubicin, daunorubicin interacts with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits the progression of the enzyme topoisomerase II, which relaxes supercoils in DNA; without action of topoisomerase II, these DNA supercoils interfere in transcription of DNA. Daunorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. On binding to DNA, daunomycin intercalates, with its daunosamine residue directed toward the minor groove. It has the highest preference for two adjacent G/C base pairs flanked on the 5' side by an A/T base pair. Crystallography shows that daunomycin induces a local unwinding angle of 8°, and other conformational disturbances of adjacent and second-neighbour base pairs. It can also induce histone eviction from chromatin upon intercalation. == History == In the 1950s, an Italian research company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to isolate anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle in Apulia. A new strain of Streptomyces peucetius which produced a red pigment was isolated, and an antibiotic was produced from this bacterium that was found to have good activity against murine tumors. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug saw success in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity. In 2015–16, a team at Ohio State University ""showed that, by carefully manipulating strands of viral DNA, an origami structure with complex folds can be created in just 10 minutes. Incredibly, these structures are only 100 nanometers across – that’s 1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Small volumes of daunorubicin can be wrapped up in these minuscule pods, which can then be released into a leukemia cell-filled environment."" == Route of administration == Daunorubicin should only be administered in a rapid intravenous infusion. It should not be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, since it may cause extensive tissue necrosis. It should also never be administered intrathecally (into the spinal canal), as this will cause extensive damage to the nervous system and may lead to death. Daunorubicin has been used intravitreally (inside the eye) for the purposes of preventing proliferative vitreoretinopathy, a common complication following retinal detachment surgery, but has not been found to be effective and is not used for any other ophthalmic purposes at this time. == References ==",Rubomycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001586013357155025), ('ICAL', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008666404522955418)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/rubromicin,https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/rubomycin ', [])"

4623,"('Magnesium omeprazole', 'Omeprazole magnesium', 'Esomeprazole sodium', 'Magnesium bis(5-methoxy-2-{[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)methyl]sulfinyl}benzimidazol-1-ide)')",Medical,"Esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium [or Neksium] among others, is a medication which reduces stomach acid. It is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Its effectiveness is similar to that of other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. Serious side effects may include angioedema, Clostridioides difficile infection, and pneumonia. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe, while safety during breastfeeding is unclear. Esomeprazole is the (S)-(−)-enantiomer (or less specifically the S-isomer) of omeprazole. It works by blocking H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells of the stomach. It was patented in 1993 and approved for medical use in 2000. It is available as a generic medication and sold over the counter in several countries. In 2022, it was the 122nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. It is also available in lower dose formulations without a prescription in the United States, the United Kingdom as well as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. == Medical use == The primary uses of esomeprazole are gastroesophageal reflux disease, treatment and maintenance of erosive esophagitis, treatment of duodenal ulcers caused by H. pylori, prevention of gastric ulcers in those on chronic NSAID therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with Crohn's disease. === Gastroesophageal reflux disease === Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which the digestive acid in the stomach comes in contact with the esophagus. The irritation caused by this disorder is known as heartburn. Long-term contact between gastric acids and the esophagus can cause permanent damage to the esophagus and is associated with Barrett's esophagus. Esomeprazole reduces the production of digestive acids, thus reducing their effect on the esophagus. === Duodenal ulcers === Esomeprazole is combined with the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin (or metronidazole instead of amoxicillin in penicillin-hypersensitive patients) in a 10-day eradication triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori. Infection by H. pylori is a causative factor in the majority of peptic and duodenal ulcers. === Efficacy === A 2006 meta analysis concluded that compared to other proton pump inhibitors, esomeprazole confers a modest overall benefit in esophageal healing and symptom relief. When broken down by disease severity, the benefit of esomeprazole relative to other proton pump inhibitors was negligible in people with mild disease (number needed to treat 50), but appeared more in those with severe disease (number needed to treat 8). A second meta analysis also found increases in erosive esophageal healing (>95% healing rate) when compared to standardized doses in broadly selected patient populations. A 2017 study found esomeprazole to be among a number of effective PPIs. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, decreased appetite, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. More severe side effects are severe allergic reactions, chest pain, dark urine, fast heartbeat, fever, paresthesia, persistent sore throat, severe stomach pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, and yellowing of the eyes or skin. Proton pump inhibitors may be associated with a greater risk of hip fractures and Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea. Patients are frequently administered the drugs in intensive care as a protective measure against ulcers, but this use is also associated with a 30% increase in occurrence of pneumonia. Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors in patients treated for Helicobacter pylori has been shown to dramatically increase the risk of gastric cancer. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is a possible adverse reaction when using proton pump inhibitors. == Interactions == Esomeprazole is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2C19, and may therefore interact with drugs that depend on it for metabolism, such as diazepam and warfarin; the concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with esomeprazole. Conversely, clopidogrel (Plavix) is an inactive prodrug that partially depends on CYP2C19 for conversion to its active form; inhibition of CYP2C19 blocks the activation of clopidogrel, thus reducing its effects. Drugs that depend on stomach pH for absorption may interact with esomeprazole; drugs that depend on an acidic environment (such as ketoconazole or atazanavir) will be poorly absorbed, whereas drugs that are broken down in acidic environments (such as erythromycin) will be absorbed to a greater extent than normal. == Pharmacokinetics == Single 20 to 40 mg oral doses generally give rise to peak plasma esomeprazole concentrations of 0.5-1.0 mg/L within 1–4 hours, but after several days of once-daily administration, these levels may increase by about 50%. A 30-minute intravenous infusion of a similar dose usually produces peak plasma levels on the order of 1–3 mg/L. The drug is rapidly cleared from the body, largely by urinary excretion of pharmacologically inactive metabolites such as 5-hydroxymethylesomeprazole and 5-carboxyesomeprazole. Esomeprazole and its metabolites are analytically indistinguishable from omeprazole and the corresponding omeprazole metabolites unless chiral techniques are employed. == Dosage forms == Esomeprazole is available as delayed-release capsules in the United States or as delayed-release tablets in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada (containing esomeprazole magnesium) in strengths of 20 and 40 mg, as delayed-release capsules in the United States (containing esomeprazole strontium) in a 49.3 mg strength (delivering the equivalent of 40 mg of esomeprazole, and as esomeprazole sodium for intravenous injection/infusion. Oral esomeprazole preparations are enteric-coated, due to the rapid degradation of the drug in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This is achieved by formulating capsules using the multiple-unit pellet system. The combination naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium (brand name Vimovo) is used for the prevention of gastric ulcers associated with chronic NSAID therapy. Vimovo is available in two dosage strengths: 500/20 mg and 375/20 mg. Clinical trials of naproxen/esomeprazole demonstrated an incidence of GI ulcer in 24% of patients on naproxen (alone) versus 7% on naproxen/esomeprazole. The FDA has added warnings to the label for Vimovo concerning acute interstitial nephritis and risk of kidney problems in some patients. === Multiple-unit pellet system === Esomeprazole capsules, as well as Losec/Prilosec tablets, are formulated as a ""multiple-unit pellet system"" (MUPS). Essentially, the capsule consists of extremely small enteric-coated granules (pellets) of the esomeprazole formulation inside an outer shell. When the capsule is immersed in an aqueous solution, as happens when the capsule reaches the stomach, water enters the capsule by osmosis. The contents swell from water absorption, causing the shell to burst, and releasing the enteric-coated granules. For most patients, the multiple-unit pellet system is of no advantage over conventional enteric-coated preparations. Patients for whom the formulation is of benefit include those requiring nasogastric tube feeding and those with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). == Society and culture == === Global distribution === In 2010, AstraZeneca announced a co-promotion agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to distribute Nexium in Japan. In September 2011, Nexium was approved for sale and was launched by Daiichi Sankyo in Japan. Esomeprazole was approved for use in the United States in February 2001. === Economics === Between the launch of esomeprazole in 2001 and 2005, the drug netted AstraZeneca about $14.4 billion. === Controversy === There has been some controversy about AstraZeneca's behaviour in creating, patenting, and marketing the drug. Esomeprazole's successful predecessor, omeprazole, is a mixture of two mirror-imaged molecules (esomeprazole which is the S-enantiomer, and R-omeprazole); critics said the company was trying to ""evergreen"" its omeprazole patent by patenting the pure esomeprazole and aggressively marketing to doctors that it is more effective than the mixture. === Brand names === Generic versions of esomeprazole magnesium are available worldwide. It is available over-the-counter under the brand name Nexium in the United States and the UK. === Veterinary use === Injection formulations of esomeprazole are used for gastroprotection in veterinary medicine. In goats administered the drug by intravenous or subcutaneous injection rapid elimination was noted. In that study the sulfone metabolite was detectable for several hours after injection of the parent drug. == Other uses == Esomeprazole can be used as a parasiticide. Gokmen et al., 2016 screen for efficacy against Trichomonas vaginalis isolates from horses. They found esomeprazole to be effective as a veterinary antiparasitic. == References == == Further reading ==",Esomeprazole sodium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2278481335670222e-05), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024801704566925764)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699054.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Esomeprazole: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a699054.html?utm_source=openai')])"

This study aims to evaluate the effect of adding 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D3 on the eradication rates of the standard clarithromycin-based triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. This is a randomized prospective comparative study of 150 patients diagnosed with H. pylori gastritis using magnifying narrow-band imaging endoscopy and supported by a stool antigen test. Patients were divided into two groups: group A (n = 75) treated with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and esomeprazole for 2 weeks; group B (n = 75) treated with 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D3 for 1 month plus amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and esomeprazole for 2 weeks. The H. pylori eradication rates were assessed using stool antigen test conducted 4 weeks after the end of therapy. Furthermore, the H. pylori eradication rates were assessed with per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. The current results showed that H. pylori eradication was achieved in 46 of 62 (74.19%) and 46 of 75 (61.33%) patients via PP and ITT analyses, respectively, in group A. However, eradication was achieved in 60 of 68 (88.23%) and 60 of 75 (80%) patients via PP and ITT analyses, respectively, in group B.

4625,"('(r)-omeprazole', 'Esomeprazole', 'Omeprazole', '(r)-5-methoxy-2-(((4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridin-2-yl)methyl)sulfinyl)-1h-benzo[d]imidazole', 'R-omeprazole')",Medical,"Omeprazole, sold under the brand names Prilosec and Losec, among others, is a medication used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It is also used to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people who are at high risk. Omeprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and its effectiveness is similar to that of other PPIs. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. It is also available in the fixed-dose combination medication omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate as Zegerid and as Konvomep. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, abdominal pain, and increased intestinal gas. Serious side effects may include Clostridioides difficile colitis, an increased risk of pneumonia, an increased risk of bone fractures, and the potential of masking stomach cancer. Whether it is safe for use in pregnancy is unclear. It works by blocking the release of stomach acid. Omeprazole was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the ninth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 52 million prescriptions. It is also available without a prescription in the United States. == Medical uses == Omeprazole can be used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, erosive esophagitis, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis. === Peptic ulcers === Peptic ulcers may be treated with omeprazole. Infection with Helicobacter pylori can be treated by taking omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin together for 7–14 days. Amoxicillin may be replaced with metronidazole in patients who are allergic to penicillin. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects occurring in at least 1% of people include: Central nervous system: headache (7%), dizziness (2%) Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infection (2%), cough (1%) Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain (5%), diarrhea (4%), nausea (4%), vomiting (3%), flatulence (3%), acid regurgitation (2%), constipation (2%) Neuromuscular and skeletal: back pain (1%), weakness (1%) Dermatologic: rash (2%) Other concerns related to adverse effects are: Recurrence of Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea Osteoporosis-related fractures Hypomagnesemia Concern has been expressed regarding vitamin B12 and iron malabsorption, but effects seem to be insignificant, especially when supplement therapy is provided. Since their introduction, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs, especially omeprazole) have also been associated with several cases of acute interstitial nephritis, an inflammation of the kidneys that often occurs as an adverse drug reaction. === Long-term use === Long-term use of PPIs is strongly associated with the development of benign polyps from fundic glands (which is distinct from fundic gland polyposis); these polyps do not cause cancer and resolve when PPIs are discontinued. No association is seen between PPI use and cancer, but use of PPIs may mask gastric cancers or other serious gastric problems and physicians should be aware of this effect. There is a possible association between long term use and dementia which requires further study to confirm. A review article in U.S. Pharmacist in 2013 states that long-term use of PPIs is associated with decreased calcium absorption (causing increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures), decreased magnesium absorption (causing electrolyte disturbances), and increased risk of certain infections such as C. difficile and community-acquired pneumonia. They hypothesize that this is due to decreased stomach acid production. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === The safety of using omeprazole has not been established in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Epidemiological data do not show an increased risk of major birth defects after maternal use of omeprazole during pregnancy. == Interactions == Important drug interactions are rare. However, the most significant major drug interaction concern is the decreased activation of clopidogrel when taken together with omeprazole. Although still controversial, this may increase the risk of stroke or heart attack in people taking clopidogrel to prevent these events. This interaction is possible because omeprazole is an inhibitor of the enzymes CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Clopidogrel is an inactive prodrug that partially depends on CYP2C19 for conversion to its active form. Inhibition of CYP2C19 may block the activation of clopidogrel, which could reduce its effects. Almost all benzodiazepines are metabolised by the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 pathways, and inhibition of these enzymes results in a higher area under the curve (i.e., the total effect over time of a given dose). Other examples of drugs dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism are escitalopram, warfarin, oxycodone, tramadol, and oxymorphone. The concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with omeprazole. Omeprazole is also a competitive inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, as are other PPIs. Drugs that depend on an acidic stomach environment (such as ketoconazole or atazanavir) may be poorly absorbed, whereas acid-labile antibiotics (such as erythromycin which is a very strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) may be absorbed to a greater extent than normal due to the more alkaline environment of the stomach. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) and Ginkgo biloba significantly reduce plasma concentrations of omeprazole through induction of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. Proton-pump inhibitors like omeprazole have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate. == Pharmacology == Omeprazole irreversibly blocks the enzyme system on parietal cells that is needed for the secretion of gastric acid. It is a specific H+/K+ATPase inhibitor. This is the enzyme needed for the final step in the secretion of gastric acid. === Mechanism of action === Omeprazole is a selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor. It suppresses stomach acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase system found at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton, or H+) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole inhibits the final step of acid production. Omeprazole also inhibits both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus as it blocks the last step in acid secretion. The drug binds non-competitively so it has a dose-dependent effect. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole occurs within 1 hour after oral administration. The maximum effect occurs within 2 hours. The duration of inhibition is up to 72 hours. When omeprazole is stopped, baseline stomach acid secretory activity returns after 3 to 5 days. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion will plateau after 4 days of repeated daily dosing. === Pharmacokinetics === The absorption of omeprazole takes place in the small intestine and is usually completed within 3 to 6 hours. The systemic bioavailability of omeprazole after repeated doses is about 60%. Omeprazole has a volume of distribution of 0.4 L/kg. It has high plasma protein binding of 95%. Omeprazole, as well as other PPIs, are only effective on active H+/K+-ATPase pumps. These pumps are stimulated in the presence of food to aid in digestion. For this reason, patients should be advised to take omeprazole with a glass of water, before a meal. Additionally, most sources recommend that after taking omeprazole, at least 30 minutes should be allowed to elapse before eating (at least 60 minutes for immediate-release omeprazole plus sodium bicarbonate products, such as Zegerid). Omeprazole is completely metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, mainly in the liver, by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes. Identified metabolites are the sulfone, the sulfide, and hydroxy-omeprazole, which exert no significant effect on acid secretion. About 77% of an orally given dose is excreted as metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found in the feces, primarily originating from bile secretion. Omeprazole has a half life of 0.5 to 1 hour. == Chemistry == Omeprazole contains a tricoordinated sulfinyl sulfur in a pyramidal structure and therefore can exist as either the (S)- or (R)-enantiomers. Omeprazole is a racemate, an equal mixture of the two. In the acidic conditions of the canaliculi of parietal cells, both enantiomers are converted to achiral products (sulfenic acid and sulfenamide configurations) which react with a cysteine group in H+/K+ ATPase, thereby inhibiting the ability of the parietal cells to produce gastric acid. AstraZeneca also developed esomeprazole (Nexium) which is a eutomer, purely the (S)-enantiomer, rather than a racemate like omeprazole. Omeprazole undergoes a chiral shift in vivo which converts the inactive (R)-enantiomer to the active (S)-enantiomer, doubling the concentration of the active form. This chiral shift is accomplished by the CYP2C19 isozyme of cytochrome P450, which is not found equally in all human populations. Those who do not metabolize the drug effectively are called ""poor metabolizers"". The proportion of the poor metabolizer phenotype varies widely between populations, from 2.0 to 2.5% in African Americans and white Americans to >20% in Asians. Several pharmacogenomics studies have suggested that PPI treatment should be tailored according to CYP2C19 metabolism status. === Measurement in body fluids === Omeprazole may be quantified in plasma or serum to monitor therapy or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients. Plasma omeprazole concentrations are usually in a range of 0.2–1.2 mg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically by the oral route and 1–6 mg/L in people with acute overdose. Enantiomeric chromatographic methods are available to distinguish esomeprazole from racemic omeprazole. == History == Omeprazole was first made in 1979 by Swedish AB Hässle, part of Astra AB. It was the first of the proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Astra AB, now AstraZeneca, launched it as an ulcer medicine under the name Losec in Sweden. It was first sold in the United States in 1989 under the brand name Losec. In 1990, at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the brand name Losec was changed to Prilosec to avoid confusion with the diuretic Lasix (furosemide). The new name led to confusion between omeprazole (Prilosec) and fluoxetine (Prozac), an antidepressant. == Society and culture == === Economics === When Prilosec's U.S. patent expired in April 2001, AstraZeneca introduced esomeprazole (Nexium) as a patented replacement drug. Many companies introduced generics as AstraZeneca's patents expired worldwide, which are available under many brand names. Omeprazole was a subject of a patent litigation in the U.S. The invention involved application of two different coatings to a drug in pill form to ensure that the omeprazole did not disintegrate before reaching its intended site of action in stomach. Although the solution by means of two coating was obvious, the patent was found valid, because the source of the problem was non-obvious and was discovered by the patentee. In September 2023, AstraZeneca announced it would pay $425 million to settle product liability litigations against Prilosec in the United States. === Brand names === Brand names include Losec, Prilosec, Zegerid, Miracid, and Omez. == Veterinary uses == In February 2025, the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the veterinary medicinal product Omeprazole TriviumVet, gastro-resistant capsule, hard, intended for dogs.

4631,"('Metoclopramide hydrochloride', 'Maxolon', 'Metoclopramide monohydrochloride', 'Cerucal', 'Paspertin')",Medical,"Metoclopramide is a medication used to treat nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. It is also used to treat migraine headaches. Common side effects include feeling tired, diarrhea, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. More serious side effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome and depression. It is thus rarely recommended that people take the medication for longer than twelve weeks. No evidence of harm has been found after being taken by many pregnant women. It belongs to the group of medications known as dopamine-receptor antagonists and works as a prokinetic. In 2012, metoclopramide was one of the top 100 most prescribed medications in the United States. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 245th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Nausea === Metoclopramide is commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with conditions such as uremia, radiation sickness, cancer and the effects of chemotherapy, labor, infection, and emetogenic drugs. As a perioperative anti-emetic, the effective dose is usually 25 to 50 mg (compared to the usual 10 mg dose). It is also used in pregnancy as a second choice for treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum (severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy). It is also used preventatively by some EMS providers when transporting people who are conscious and spinally immobilized. === Migraine === In migraine headaches, metoclopramide may be used in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or in combination with aspirin. === Gastroparesis === Evidence also supports its use for gastroparesis, a condition that causes the stomach to empty poorly, and as of 2010 it was the only drug approved by the FDA for that condition. It is also used in gastroesophageal reflux disease. === Lactation === While metoclopramide is used to increase breast milk production, evidence for its effectiveness for this indication is poor. Its safety for this use is also unclear. === Procedures === Intravenous metoclopramide is used in small-bowel follow-through, small-bowel enema, and radionuclide gastric-emptying studies to reduce the time taken for the barium to go through the intestines, thus reducing the total time needed for the procedures. Metoclopramide also prevents vomiting after oral ingestion of barium. == Contraindications == Metoclopramide is contraindicated in pheochromocytoma. It should be used with caution in Parkinson's disease since, as a dopamine antagonist, it may worsen symptoms. Long-term use should be avoided in people with clinical depression, as it may worsen one's mental state. It is contraindicated for people with a suspected bowel obstruction, in epilepsy, if a stomach operation has been performed in the previous three or four days, perforation or blockage of the stomach, and in newborn babies. The European Medicines Agency reviewed the drug's safety in 2011, which determined that it should not be prescribed in high doses, for periods of more than five days, or given to children below 1 year of age. They suggested its use in older children should be restricted to treating post-chemotherapy or post-surgery nausea and vomiting, and even then only for patients where other treatments have failed. For adults, they recommended its use be restricted to treating migraines and post-chemotherapy or post-surgery patients. === Pregnancy === Metoclopramide has long been used in all stages of pregnancy with no evidence of harm to the mother or foetus. A large cohort study of babies born to Israeli women exposed to metoclopramide during pregnancy found no evidence that the drug increases the risk of congenital malformations, low birth weight, preterm birth, or perinatal mortality. A large cohort study in Denmark found, in addition, no association between metoclopramide exposure and miscarriage. Metoclopramide is excreted into milk. === Infants === A systematic review found a wide range of reported outcomes for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in infants rating the evidence as ""poor"" and ""inconclusive"" for safety and efficacy for the treatment of GERD in infants. == Side effects == Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with metoclopramide therapy include restlessness (akathisia), and focal dystonia. Infrequent ADRs include hypertension, hypotension, hyperprolactinaemia leading to galactorrhea, headache, and extrapyramidal effects such as oculogyric crisis. Metoclopramide may be the most common cause of drug-induced movement disorders. The risk of extrapyramidal effects is increased in people under 20 years of age, and with high-dose or prolonged therapy. Tardive dyskinesia may be persistent and irreversible in some people. The majority of reports of tardive dyskinesia occur in people who have used metoclopramide for more than three months. Consequently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that metoclopramide be used for short-term treatment, preferably less than 12 weeks. In 2009, the FDA required all manufacturers of metoclopramide to issue a black box warning regarding the risk of tardive dyskinesia with chronic or high-dose use of the drug. Dystonic reactions may be treated with benzatropine, diphenhydramine, trihexyphenidyl, or procyclidine. Symptoms usually subside with intramuscularly injected diphenhydramine. Agents in the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be helpful, but benefits are usually modest, and the side effects of sedation and weakness can be problematic. In some cases, the akathisia effects of metoclopramide are directly related to the infusion rate when the drug is administered intravenously. Side effects were usually seen in the first 15 minutes after administering the dose of metoclopramide. Withdrawal effects were reported for a female taking metoclopramide for about six months. The adverse symptoms oscillated between akinesian and akathisian, including amenorrhea, and appeared like secondary parkinsonism. Adverse effects remained a year after the metoclopramide had been gradually withdrawn. === Rare side effects === Diabetes, age, and female gender are risk factors that increase the likelihood of experiencing a neuropsychiatric side effect of metoclopramide. Panic disorder Major depressive disorder Agoraphobia Agranulocytosis, supraventricular tachycardia, hyperaldosteronism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, akathisia and tardive dyskinesia. Methaemoglobinaemia* == Pharmacology == Metoclopramide appears to bind to dopamine D2 receptors with nanomolar affinity (Ki = 28.8 nM), where it is a receptor antagonist, and is also a mixed 5-HT3 receptor antagonist/5-HT4 receptor agonist. === Mechanism of action === The antiemetic action of metoclopramide is due to its antagonist activity at D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain — this action prevents nausea and vomiting triggered by most stimuli. At higher doses, 5-HT3 antagonist activity may also contribute to the antiemetic effect. The gastroprokinetic activity of metoclopramide is mediated by muscarinic activity, D2 receptor antagonist activity, and 5-HT4 receptor agonist activity. The gastroprokinetic effect itself may also contribute to the antiemetic effect. Metoclopramide also increases the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. Metoclopramide might influence mood because of its antagonistic blockade on 5-HT3 and agonistic (activating) action on 5-HT4. While muscarinic receptors affect gastrointestinal motility, metoclopramide’s prokinetic effects are not primarily due to direct muscarinic receptor activity. Instead, they result from its actions on 5-HT4 and D2 receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === CYP2D6 metabolizes metoclopramide, a reversible inhibitor, but not inactivator, of CYP2D6. The major metabolites of metoclopramide are N-hydroxylation and N-deethylation by all common CYP enzymes. == Chemistry == Metoclopramide is a substituted benzamide; cisapride and mosapride are structurally related. == History == Metoclopramide was first described by Louis Justin-Besançon and Charles Laville in 1964, while working to improve the anti-dysrhythmic properties of procainamide. That research project also produced the product sulpiride. The first clinical trials were published by Tourneu et al. in 1964 and by Boisson and Albot in 1966. Justin-Besançon and Laville worked for Laboratoires Delagrange and that company introduced the drug Primperan in 1964. Laboratoires Delagrange was acquired by Synthelabo in 1991 which eventually became part of Sanofi. A.H. Robins introduced the drug in the US under the brand name Reglan in 1979 as an injectable and an oral form was approved in 1980. in 1989 A.H. Robins was acquired by American Home Products, which changed its name to Wyeth in 2002. The drugs were initially used to control nausea for people with severe headaches or migraines, and later used for nausea caused by radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and later yet for treating nausea caused by anesthesia. In the US the injectable form was labelled for chemotherapy-induced nausea and the oral form was eventually labelled for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It became widely used in the 1980s, becoming the most commonly used drug to treat anesthesia-induced nausea and for treating gastritis in emergency rooms. The first generics were introduced in 1985. In the early 1980s signs began to emerge in pharmacovigilance studies from Sweden that the drug was causing tardive dyskinesia in some patients. The FDA required a warning about tardive dyskinesia to be added to the drug label in 1985 stating that: ""tardive dyskinesia . . . may develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,” and warned against use longer than 12 weeks, as that was how long the drug has been tested. In 2009 the FDA required that a black box warning be added to the label. The emergence of this severe side effect led to a wave of product liability litigation against generic manufacturers as well as Wyeth. The litigation was complicated since there was a lack of clarity in jurisdiction between state laws, where product liability is determined, and federal law, which determines how drugs are labelled, as well as between generics companies, which had no control over labelling, and the originator company, which did. The litigation yielded at least two important cases. In Conte v. Wyeth in the California state courts, the claims of the plaintiff against the generic companies Pliva, Teva, and Purepac that had sold the drugs that the plaintiff actually took, and the claims against Wyeth, whose product the plaintiff never took, were all dismissed by the trial court, but the case was appealed, and in 2008 the appellate court upheld the dismissal of the cases against the generic companies, but reversed on Wyeth, allowing the case against Wyeth to proceed. This established an ""innovator liability"" or ""pioneer liability"" for pharmaceutical companies. The precedent was not widely followed in California nor in other states. Litigation over the same issues related to metoclopramide also reached the US Supreme Court in Pliva, Inc. v. Mensing, in which the court held in 2011 that generic companies cannot be held liable for information, or the lack of information, on the originator's label. As of August 2015 there were about 5000 suits pending across the US and efforts to consolidate them into a class action had failed. Shortly following the Pliva decision, the FDA proposed a rule change that would allow generics manufacturers to update the label if the originating drug had been withdrawn from the market for reasons other than safety. As of May 2016 the rule, which turned out to be controversial since it would open generic companies to product liability suits, was still not finalized, and the FDA had stated the final rule would be issued in April 2017. The FDA issued a draft guidance for generic companies to update labels in July 2016. == Society and culture == === Brand names === == Veterinary use == Metoclopramide is commonly used to prevent vomiting in cats and dogs.

The drugs were initially used to control nausea for people with severe headaches or migraines, and later used for nausea caused by radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and later yet for treating nausea caused by anesthesia. In the US the injectable form was labelled for chemotherapy-induced nausea and the oral form was eventually labelled for gastroesophageal reflux disease. It became widely used in the 1980s, becoming the most commonly used drug to treat anesthesia-induced nausea and for treating gastritis in emergency rooms. The first generics were introduced in 1985. In the early 1980s signs began to emerge in pharmacovigilance studies from Sweden that the drug was causing tardive dyskinesia in some patients. The FDA required a warning about tardive dyskinesia to be added to the drug label in 1985 stating that: ""tardive dyskinesia . . . may develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,” and warned against use longer than 12 weeks, as that was how long the drug has been tested. In 2009 the FDA required that a black box warning be added to the label. The emergence of this severe side effect led to a wave of product liability litigation against generic manufacturers as well as Wyeth. The litigation was complicated since there was a lack of clarity in jurisdiction between state laws, where product liability is determined, and federal law, which determines how drugs are labelled, as well as between generics companies, which had no control over labelling, and the originator company, which did. The litigation yielded at least two important cases. In Conte v. Wyeth in the California state courts, the claims of the plaintiff against the generic companies Pliva, Teva, and Purepac that had sold the drugs that the plaintiff actually took, and the claims against Wyeth, whose product the plaintiff never took, were all dismissed by the trial court, but the case was appealed, and in 2008 the appellate court upheld the dismissal of the cases against the generic companies, but reversed on Wyeth, allowing the case against Wyeth to proceed. This established an ""innovator liability"" or ""pioneer liability"" for pharmaceutical companies. The precedent was not widely followed in California nor in other states. Litigation over the same issues related to metoclopramide also reached the US Supreme Court in Pliva, Inc. v. Mensing, in which the court held in 2011 that generic companies cannot be held liable for information, or the lack of information, on the originator's label. As of August 2015 there were about 5000 suits pending across the US and efforts to consolidate them into a class action had failed. Shortly following the Pliva decision, the FDA proposed a rule change that would allow generics manufacturers to update the label if the originating drug had been withdrawn from the market for reasons other than safety. As of May 2016 the rule, which turned out to be controversial since it would open generic companies to product liability suits, was still not finalized, and the FDA had stated the final rule would be issued in April 2017. The FDA issued a draft guidance for generic companies to update labels in July 2016. == Society and culture == === Brand names === == Veterinary use == Metoclopramide is commonly used to prevent vomiting in cats and dogs.

4633,"('Corlopam', 'Fenoldopam (mesylate)', 'Fenoldopam methanesulfonate', 'Corlopam mesylate', 'Fenoldopam mesilate')",Medical,"Fenoldopam mesylate (Corlopam) is a drug and synthetic benzazepine derivative which acts as a selective D1 receptor partial agonist. Fenoldopam is used as an antihypertensive agent. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 1997. == Indications == Fenoldopam is used as an antihypertensive agent postoperatively, and also intravenously (IV) to treat a hypertensive crisis. Since fenoldopam is an intravenous agent with minimal adrenergic effects that improves renal perfusion, in theory it could be beneficial in hypertensive patients with concomitant chronic kidney disease. It can cause reflex tachycardia, but it is dependent on the infusion of the drug. == Pharmacology == Fenoldopam causes arterial/arteriolar vasodilation leading to a decrease in blood pressure by activating peripheral D1 receptors. It decreases afterload and also promotes sodium excretion via specific dopamine receptors along the nephron. The renal effect of fenoldopam and dopamine may involve physiological antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney. In contrast to dopamine, fenoldopam is a selective D1 receptor agonist with no effect on beta adrenoceptors, although there is evidence that it may have some alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist activity. D1 receptor stimulation activates adenylyl cyclase and raises intracellular cyclic AMP, resulting in vasodilation of most arterial beds, including renal, mesenteric, and coronary arteries. to cause a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Fenoldopam has a rapid onset of action (4 minutes) and short duration of action (< 10 minutes) and a linear dose–response relationship at usual clinical doses. == Side effects == Adverse effects include headache, flushing, nausea, hypotension, reflex tachycardia, and increased intraocular pressure. == Contraindications, warnings and precautions == Fenoldopam mesylate contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may rarely cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and asthma in susceptible people. Fenoldopam mesylate administration should be undertaken with caution to patients with glaucoma or raised intraocular pressure as fenoldopam raises intraocular pressure. Concomitant use of fenoldopam with a beta-blocker should be avoided if possible, as unexpected hypotension can result from beta-blocker inhibition of sympathetic-mediated reflex tachycardia in response to fenoldopam. == References ==",Corlopam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.8410845667822286e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004148687236011028)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenoldopam,https://www.drugs.com/pro/corlopam.html,https://www.drugs.com/mtm/corlopam.html ', [])"
4634,"('Ultram', 'Cyclohexanol, 2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-1-(m-methoxyphenyl)-', 'Maxitram', 'Tilodol', 'Amanda')",Medical,"Amanda is a Latin feminine gerundive (i.e. verbal adjective) name meaning, literally, ""she who must (or is fit to) be loved"". Other translations, with similar meaning, could be ""deserving to be loved,"" ""worthy of love,"" or ""loved very much by everyone."" Its diminutive form includes Mandy, Manda and Amy. It is common in countries where Germanic and Romance languages are spoken. ""Amanda"" comes from ama- (the stem of the Latin verb amare, ""to love"") plus the feminine nominative singular gerundive ending (-nda). Other names, especially female names, were derived from this verb form, such as ""Miranda"". The name ""Amanda"" occasionally appears in Late Antiquity, such as the Amanda who was the ""wife of the ex-advocate and ex-provincial governor Aper (q.v.); she cared for his estates and raised their children after he adopted the monastic life: 'curat illa saeculi curas, ne tu cures'"" (Paul. Nol. Epist. 44.4). In England the name ""Amanda"" first appears in 1212 on a birth record from Warwickshire, England, and five centuries later the name was popularized by poets and playwrights. In the United States, ""Amanda"" slowly became more prominent from the 1930s to the 1960s, ranking among the top 200 baby names. From 1976 to 1995, ""Amanda"" ranked in the ten most popular female baby names in the United States. The name was most popular from 1978 to 1992, when it ranked in the top four. At its prime, in 1980, it was the second most popular. In 2009, ""Amanda"" ranked number 166. It was ranked among the top ten names given to girls born in Puerto Rico in 2009. The name has also recently been popular in Sweden, where it ranked twentieth for girls born in 2009, down five places from the year 2008. It is also popular in Swedish-speaking families in Finland, where it ranked among the top ten names for girls born to this demographic group. == People == === A === Amanda Aasa (born 1996), Swedish singer and songwriter Amanda Abizaid, American Lebanese actress, model, singer, and songwriter Amanda Abbington (born 1974), English actress Amanda Adams (born 1976), American archaeologist and author Amanda Aday (born 1981), American actress Amanda L.

4635,"('Tramadol', 'Cis-tramadol', 'Tramadolum [inn-latin]', '(1r,2r)-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexan-1-ol', 'Ralivia flashtab')",Medical,"Tramadol, sold under the brand name Ultram among others, is an opioid pain medication and a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) used to treat moderately severe pain. When taken by mouth in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually begins within an hour. It is also available by injection. It is available in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen). As is typical of opioids, common side effects include constipation, itchiness, and nausea. Serious side effects may include hallucinations, seizures, increased risk of serotonin syndrome, decreased alertness, and drug addiction. A change in dosage may be recommended in those with kidney or liver problems. It is not recommended in those who are at risk of suicide or in those who are pregnant. While not recommended in women who are breastfeeding, those who take a single dose should not generally have to stop breastfeeding. Tramadol is converted in the liver to O-desmethyltramadol (desmetramadol), an opioid with a stronger affinity for the μ-opioid receptor. Tramadol was patented in 1972 and launched under the name ""Tramal"" in 1977 by the West German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal GmbH. In the mid-1990s, it was approved in the United Kingdom and the United States. It is available as a generic medication and marketed under many brand names worldwide. In 2022, it was the 55th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Tramadol is used primarily to treat mild to severe pain, both acute and chronic. There is moderate evidence for use as a second-line treatment for fibromyalgia, but it is not FDA-approved for this use. Its use is approved for treatment of fibromyalgia as a secondary painkiller by the NHS. Its analgesic effects take approximately an hour to be realized, and it takes from two to four hours to reach peak effect after oral administration with an immediate-release formulation. On a dose-by-dose basis, tramadol has about one-tenth the potency of morphine (thus 100 mg is commensurate with 10 mg morphine but may vary) and is practically equally potent when compared with pethidine and codeine. For moderate pain, its effectiveness is roughly equivalent to that of codeine in low doses and hydrocodone at very high doses. For severe pain, it is less effective than morphine. Pain-reducing effects last approximately six hours. The potency of analgesia varies considerably as it depends on an individual's genetics. People with specific variants of CYP2D6 enzymes may not produce adequate amounts of the active metabolite (desmetramadol) for effective pain control. Sleep medicine physicians sometimes prescribe tramadol (or other opioid medications) for refractory restless legs syndrome (RLS); that is, RLS that does not respond adequately to treatment with first-line medications such as dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole) or gabapentinoids, often due to augmentation. == Contraindications == Individuals with certain genetic variations of CYP2D6 enzymes, which convert tramadol into an inactive molecule, may not experience enough pain relief from tramadol. These genetic polymorphisms are not currently routinely tested for in clinical practice. === Pregnancy and lactation === Use of tramadol during pregnancy is generally avoided, as it may cause some reversible withdrawal effects in the newborn. A small prospective study in France found, while an increased risk of miscarriages existed, no major malformations were reported in the newborn. Its use during lactation is also generally advised against, but a small trial found that infants breastfed by mothers taking tramadol were exposed to about 2.88% of the dose the mothers were taking. No evidence of this dose harming the newborn was seen. === Labor and delivery === Its use as an analgesic during labor is not advised due to its long onset of action (1 hour). The ratio of the mean concentration of the drug in the fetus compared to that of the mother when it is given intramuscularly for labor pains has been estimated to be 1:94. === Children === Its use in children is generally advised against, although it may be done under the supervision of a specialist. On 21 September 2015, the FDA started investigating the safety of tramadol in use in persons under the age of 17. The investigation was initiated because some of these people have experienced slowed or difficult breathing. The FDA lists age under 12 years old as a contraindication. === Elderly === The risk of opioid-related adverse effects such as respiratory depression, falls, cognitive impairment, and sedation is increased. Tramadol may interact with other medications and increase the risk for adverse events. === Liver and kidney failure === The drug should be used with caution in those with liver or kidney failure, due to metabolism in the liver (to the active molecule desmetramadol) and elimination by the kidneys. == Side effects == The most common adverse effects of tramadol include nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, indigestion, abdominal pain, vertigo, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, and headache. Other side effects may result from interactions with other medications. Tramadol has the same dose-dependent adverse effects as morphine including respiratory depression. === Dependence and withdrawal === Long-term use of high doses of tramadol causes physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. These include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) withdrawal; symptoms include numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and tinnitus. Psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. In most cases, tramadol withdrawal will set in 12–20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary. Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids. Seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically 3 or 4 days for other codeine analogs. == Overdose == The clinical presentation in overdose cases can vary but typically includes neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal manifestations. The predominant neurological symptoms are seizures and altered levels of consciousness, ranging from somnolence to coma. Seizures are particularly notable due to tramadol's lowering of the seizure threshold, occurring in approximately half of acute poisoning cases. Patients often exhibit tachycardia and mild hypertension. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting are common, and agitation, anxiety, and cold and clammy skin may also be present. While less common, severe complications like respiratory depression and serotonin syndrome can occur, particularly in polydrug overdoses involving other CNS depressants (such as benzodiazepines, opioids, and alcohol) and agents with serotonergic activity. Additionally, individuals with genetic variations leading to CYP2D6 enzyme duplication (rapid metabolizers) may have an increased risk of adverse effects, due to faster conversion of tramadol to its active metabolite. Acute tramadol overdose is generally not life-threatening, with most fatalities resulting from polysubstance overdose. Management includes cardiovascular monitoring, activated charcoal administration, hydration, and treatment of seizures. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can partially reverse some effects of tramadol overdose, particularly respiratory depression. However, its use may increase the risk of seizures due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. For suspected serotonin syndrome, cyproheptadine, a serotonin antagonist, is considered an effective antidote. The incidence of tramadol-related overdose deaths has been on the rise in certain regions. For instance, Northern Ireland has reported an increased frequency of such cases. In 2013, England and Wales recorded 254 tramadol-related deaths, while Florida reported 379 cases in 2011. In 2011, 21,649 emergency room visits in the United States were related to tramadol. The likely explanation for these observations is due to increase in frequency of prescriptions and use due to easier access due to lighter regulatory scheduling by authorities but this is starting to change. In 2021, Health Canada announced tramadol would be added to Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to the Narcotic Control Regulations due to tramadol being suspected of having contributed to 18 reported deaths in Canada between 2006 and 2017. == Interactions == Tramadol can have pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic interactions. Tramadol is metabolized by CYP2D6 enzymes which contributes to the metabolism of approximately 25% of all medications. Any medications with the ability to inhibit or induce these enzymes may interact with tramadol. These include common antiarrhythmics, antiemetics, antidepressants (sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine in particular), antipsychotics, analgesics, and tamoxifen. Due to tramadol's serotonergic effects, tramadol has the potential to contribute to the development of an acute or chronic hyper-serotonin state called serotonin syndrome when used concurrently with other pro-serotonergic medications such as antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics, MAOIs), antipsychotics, triptans, cold medications containing dextromethorphan, and some herbal products such as St. John's wort. Concurrent use of 5-HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron, dolasetron, and palonosetron may reduce the effectiveness of both drugs. Tramadol also acts as an opioid agonist and thus can increase the risk for side effects when used with other opioid and opioid-containing analgesics (such as morphine, pethidine, tapentadol, oxycodone, fentanyl, and Tylenol 3). Tramadol increases the risk for seizures by lowering the seizure threshold. Using other medications that lower seizure threshold - such as antipsychotic medications, bupropion (an anti-depressant and smoking cessation drug), and amphetamines - can further increase this risk. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tramadol induces analgesic effects through a variety of different targets on the noradrenergic system, serotonergic system, and opioid receptors system. Tramadol affects serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition similarly to certain antidepressants known as serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as venlafaxine and duloxetine. Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture, the positive enantiomer inhibits serotonin reuptake while the negative enantiomer inhibits noradrenaline re-uptake, by binding to and blocking the transporters. Both enantiomers of tramadol are agonists of the μ-opioid receptor and its M1 metabolite, O-desmetramadol, is also a μ-opioid receptor agonist but is 6 times more potent than tramadol itself. All of these actions may work synergistically to induce analgesia. Tramadol has been found to possess these actions: Agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and to a far lesser extent of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and κ-opioid receptor (KOR) Serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; hence, an SNRI Serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonist M1 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist NMDA receptor antagonist (very weak) TRPA1 inhibitor Tramadol acts on the opioid receptors through its major active metabolite desmetramadol, which has as much as 700-fold higher affinity for the MOR relative to tramadol. Moreover, tramadol itself has been found to possess no efficacy in activating the MOR in functional activity assays, whereas desmetramadol activates the receptor with high intrinsic activity (Emax equal to that of morphine). As such, desmetramadol is exclusively responsible for the opioid effects of tramadol. Both tramadol and desmetramadol have pronounced selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR in terms of binding affinity. Tramadol is well-established as an SRI. In addition, a few studies have found that it also acts as a serotonin releasing agent (1–10 μM), similar in effect to fenfluramine. The serotonin releasing effects of tramadol could be blocked by sufficiently high concentrations of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor 6-nitroquipazine, which is in accordance with other serotonin releasing agents such as fenfluramine and MDMA. However, two more recent studies failed to find a releasing effect of tramadol at respective concentrations up to 10 and 30 μM. In addition to serotonergic activity, tramadol is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is not a norepinephrine releasing agent. Tramadol does not inhibit the reuptake or induce the release of dopamine. A positron emission tomography imaging study found that single oral 50-mg and 100-mg doses of tramadol to human volunteers resulted in 34.7% and 50.2% respective mean occupation of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the thalamus. The estimated median effective dose (ED50) for SERT occupancy hence was 98.1 mg, which was associated with a plasma tramadol level of about 330 ng/mL (1,300 nM). The estimated maximum daily dosage of tramadol of 400 mg (100 mg q.i.d.) would result in as much as 78.7% occupancy of the SERT (in association with a plasma concentration of 1,220 ng/mL or 4,632 nM). This is close to that of SSRIs, which occupy the SERT by 80% or more. Peak plasma concentrations during treatment with clinical dosages of tramadol have generally been found to be in the range of 70 to 592 ng/mL (266–2,250 nM) for tramadol and 55 to 143 ng/mL (221–573 nM) for desmetramadol. The highest levels of tramadol were observed with the maximum oral daily dosage of 400 mg per day divided into one 100-mg dose every 6 hours (i.e., four 100-mg doses evenly spaced out per day). Some accumulation of tramadol occurs with chronic administration; peak plasma levels with the maximum oral daily dosage (100 mg q.i.d.) are about 16% higher and the area-under-the-curve levels 36% higher than following a single oral 100-mg dose. Positron emission tomography imaging studies have reportedly found that tramadol levels are at least four-fold higher in the brain than in plasma. Conversely, brain levels of desmetramadol ""only slowly approach those in plasma"". The plasma protein binding of tramadol is only 4–20%; hence, almost all tramadol in circulation is free, thus bioactive. ==== Correspondence to effects ==== Co-administration of quinidine, a potent CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor, with tramadol, a combination which results in markedly reduced levels of desmetramadol, was found not to significantly affect the analgesic effects of tramadol in human volunteers. However, other studies have found that the analgesic effects of tramadol are significantly decreased or even absent in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The analgesic effects of tramadol are only partially reversed by naloxone in human volunteers, hence indicating that its opioid action is unlikely the sole factor; tramadol's analgesic effects are also partially reversed by α2-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as yohimbine, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron, and the 5-HT7 receptor antagonists SB-269970 and SB-258719. Pharmacologically, tramadol is similar to tapentadol and methadone in that it not only binds to the MOR, but also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine due to its action on the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, such as its ""atypical"" opioid activity. Tramadol has inhibitory actions on the 5-HT2C receptor. Antagonism of 5-HT2C could be partially responsible for tramadol's reducing effect on depressive and obsessive–compulsive symptoms in patients with pain and co-morbid neurological illnesses. 5-HT2C blockade may also account for its lowering of the seizure threshold, as 5-HT2C knockout mice display significantly increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures, sometimes resulting in spontaneous death. However, the reduction of seizure threshold could be attributed to tramadol's putative inhibition of GABAA receptors at high doses (significant inhibition at 100 μM). In addition, desmetramadol is a high-affinity ligand of the DOR, and activation of this receptor could be involved in tramadol's ability to provoke seizures in some individuals, as DOR agonists are well known for inducing seizures. Nausea and vomiting caused by tramadol are thought to be due to activation of the 5-HT3 receptor via increased serotonin levels. In accordance, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron can be used to treat tramadol-associated nausea and vomiting. Tramadol and desmetramadol themselves do not bind to the 5-HT3 receptor. === Pharmacokinetics === Tramadol is metabolised in the liver via the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, being O- and N-demethylated to five different metabolites. Of these, desmetramadol (O-desmethyltramadol) is the most significant, since it has 200 times the μ-affinity of (+)-tramadol, and furthermore has an elimination half-life of 9 hours, compared with 6 hours for tramadol itself. As with codeine, in the 6% of the population who have reduced CYP2D6 activity (hence reducing metabolism), a reduced analgesic effect is seen. Those with decreased CYP2D6 activity require a dose increase of 30% to achieve the same degree of pain relief as those with a normal level of CYP2D6 activity. Phase II hepatic metabolism renders the metabolites water-soluble, which are excreted by the kidneys. Thus, reduced doses may be used in renal and hepatic impairment. Its volume of distribution is around 306 L after oral administration and 203 L after parenteral administration. == Chemistry == Tramadol is marketed as a racemic mixture of both R- and S-stereoisomers, because the two isomers complement each other's analgesic activities. The (+)-isomer is predominantly active as an opiate with a higher affinity for the μ-opiate receptor (20 times higher affinity than the (-)-isomer). === Synthesis and stereoisomerism === The chemical synthesis of tramadol is described in the literature. Tramadol [2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol] has two stereogenic centers at the cyclohexane ring. Thus, 2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol may exist in four different configurational forms: (1R,2R)-isomer (1S,2S)-isomer (1R,2S)-isomer (1S,2R)-isomer The synthetic pathway leads to the racemate (1:1 mixture) of (1R,2R)-isomer and the (1S,2S)-isomer as the main products. Minor amounts of the racemic mixture of the (1R,2S)-isomer and the (1S,2R)-isomer are formed as well. The isolation of the (1R,2R)-isomer and the (1S,2S)-isomer from the diastereomeric minor racemate [(1R,2S)-isomer and (1S,2R)-isomer] is realized by the recrystallization of the hydrochlorides. The drug tramadol is a racemate of the hydrochlorides of the (1R,2R)-(+)- and the (1S,2S)-(−)-enantiomers. The resolution of the racemate [(1R,2R)-(+)-isomer / (1S,2S)-(−)-isomer] was described employing (R)-(−)- or (S)-(+)-mandelic acid. This process does not find industrial application, since tramadol is used as a racemate, despite known different physiological effects of the (1R,2R)- and (1S,2S)-isomers, because the racemate showed higher analgesic activity than either enantiomer in animals and in humans. === Detection in biological fluids === Tramadol and desmetramadol may be quantified in blood, plasma, serum, or saliva to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a sudden death. Most commercial opiate immunoassay screening tests do not cross-react significantly with tramadol or its major metabolites, so chromatographic techniques must be used to detect and quantify these substances. The concentration of desmetramadol in the blood or plasma of a person who has taken tramadol is generally 10–20% that of the parent drug. === Discrepant reports on natural agency === In 2013, researchers Michel de Waard (then at Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble and Grenoble Institute of Neuroscience, La Tronche) reported in Angewandte Chemie that tramadol was found in relatively high concentrations (>1%) in the roots of the African pin cushion tree, Nauclea latifolia, concluding that it was a natural product in addition to its being a later human synthetic, and presenting a putative biosynthetic hypothesis for its origin. In 2014, Michael Spiteller (Technische Universität Dortmund) and collaborators reported results, also in Angewandte Chemie, that supported the conclusion that the presence of tramadol in those tree roots was the result of tramadol having been ingested by humans and having been administered to cattle (by farmers in the region); Spiteller et al. presented data that tramadol and its metabolites were present in animal excreta, which they then argue contaminated soil around the trees. They further observed that tramadol and its mammalian metabolites were found in tree roots in the far north of Cameroon where the commercial drug was in use, but not in the south where it was not being administered. A news report appearing in Lab Times at the time of the latter, 2014 paper, and reporting on its contents, also reported that Michel de Waard (communicating author of the original paper) continued to contest the notion that tramadol in tree roots was the result of anthropogenic contamination. The point was made that samples were taken from trees that grew in national parks, where livestock were forbidden, and it quoted de Waard extensively, who stated that ""thousands and thousands of tramadol-treated cattle sitting around a single tree and urinating"" would be required to produce the concentrations discovered. In 2016, Spiteller and colleagues followed up their preceding work with a radiocarbon analysis that supported their contention that the tramadol found in N. latifolia roots was of human synthetic origin rather being plant-derived. == Society and culture == === Formulations === Available dosage forms include liquids, syrups, drops, elixirs, effervescent tablets, and powders for mixing with water, capsules, tablets including extended-release formulations, suppositories, compounding powder, and injections. === Patent history === The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tramadol in March 1995, and an extended-release (ER) formulation in September 2005. ER Tramadol was protected by US patents nos. 6,254,887 and 7,074,430. The FDA listed the patents' expiration as 10 May 2014. However, in August 2009, the US District Court for the District of Delaware ruled the patents invalid, a decision upheld the following year by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Manufacture and distribution of generic equivalents of Ultram ER in the United States was therefore permitted before the expiration of the patents. === Legal status === Effective August 2014, tramadol has been placed into Schedule IV of the federal Controlled Substances Act in the United States. Before that, some US states had already classified tramadol as a Schedule IV controlled substance under their respective state laws. Tramadol is classified in Schedule 4 (prescription only) in Australia, rather than as a Schedule 8 Controlled Drug (Possession without authority illegal) like most other opioids. Effective May 2008, Sweden classified tramadol as a controlled substance in the same category as codeine and dextropropoxyphene, but allows a normal prescription to be used. In June 2014, the United Kingdom's Home Office classified tramadol as a Class C, Schedule 3 controlled drug, but exempted it from the safe custody requirement. In October 2023, New Zealand's Medsafe reclassified tramadol as a Class C2 Controlled Drug (in addition to its existing status as a prescription only medication). === Misuse === Illicit use of the drug is thought to be a major factor in the success of the Boko Haram terrorist organization. When used at higher doses, the drug ""can produce similar effects to heroin."" One former member said, ""whenever we took tramadol, nothing mattered to us anymore except what we were sent to do because it made us very high and very bold, it was impossible to go on a mission without taking it."" Tramadol is also used as a coping mechanism in the Gaza Strip under Israeli siege. It is also abused in the United Kingdom, inspiring the title of the TV show Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights (2010). From March 2019, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) banned the drug, after riders were using the painkiller to improve their performance. == Research == === Investigational uses === Diabetic neuropathy Antidepressant Postherpetic neuralgia Premature ejaculation Adjunct to local anesthesia == Veterinary medicine == Tramadol may be used to treat post-operative, injury-related, and chronic (e.g., cancer-related) pain in dogs and cats as well as rabbits, coatis, many small mammals including rats and flying squirrels, guinea pigs, ferrets, and raccoons. == See also == Tramadol/paracetamol == References == == Further reading ==",Tramadol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.276871418871451e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002489208010956645)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/tramadol-information?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=144, start_index=9, title='Tramadol Information | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/tramadol-information?utm_source=openai')])"

It has low osmolality (relatively few molecules per volume), typically resulting in fewer side effects than high-osmolality media. It is manufactured by Guerbet, but marketing in the US has been discontinued. As of 2021, it may still be available in some European countries. It is applied in form of its salts, ioxaglate meglumine and ioxaglate sodium. == Medical uses == Uses include angiography (imaging of blood vessels, including those of the brain and heart), arthrography (imaging of joints), urography (imaging of the urinary system), hysterosalpingography (imaging of the uterus and fallopian tubes), imaging of the gastrointestinal tract, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP; imaging of the biliary and pancreatic ducts). == Contraindications == Ioxaglic acid is contraindicated in people with hyperthyreosis because of the drug's iodine content. It must not be used for myelography (spinal cord imaging), for hysterosalpingography in women who are pregnant or have an acute inflammation in the pelvic region, or for arthrography if the joint is infected. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects include reactions at the injection site, such as a hot or painful feeling as well as general reactions such as nausea and vomiting. All of these are usually mild and transient. Allergy-like effects such as itching, sneezing, coughing and yawning can be the first sign of severe adverse reactions, especially a shock. Accidental intrathecal administration (into the spinal canal) can result in life-threatening reactions such as convulsions, cerebral (brain) edema or cerebral bleed. == Interactions == Iodine-131, a radioactive isotope used for thyroid imaging (scintigraphy) and therapy of thyroid cancers, can be less effective when used within two to six weeks after application of ioxaglic acid because of residual iodine in the body. == Pharmacology == === Chemistry and mechanism of action === Ioxaglic acid is an iodine-containing, water-soluble radiocontrast agent. The iodine atoms readily absorb X-rays, resulting in a higher contrast of X-ray images. It has a low osmolality of 600 mosm/kg water at 37 °C (99 °F), meaning that the solution has a relatively low concentration of molecules; this is usually associated with fewer adverse effects than high-osmolality contrast agents. === Pharmacokinetics === After injection into a vein, 14% of the circulating ioxaglic acid is bound to blood plasma proteins, which is unusually high for a water-soluble iodinated contrast agent. The substance is distributed in the body with a half-life of 12 minutes (range 4 to 17 minutes) and eliminated in unmetabolized (unchanged) form via the kidneys with a half-life of 92 minutes (range 61 to 140 minutes). In people with kidney failure, it is eliminated via the bile duct, saliva or sweat. == References ==",Ioxaglate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.936446541454643e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011829291470348835)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioxaglic_acid,https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/ioxaglate,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18377-ioxaglate-meglumine-ioxaglate-sodium-injection ', [])"

We enrolled participants with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (i.e., resistant to rifampin, a fluoroquinolone, and an aminoglycoside), pre-XDR tuberculosis (i.e., resistant to rifampin and to either a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside), or rifampin-resistant tuberculosis that was not responsive to treatment or for which a second-line regimen had been discontinued because of side effects. We randomly assigned the participants to receive bedaquiline for 26 weeks (200 mg daily for 8 weeks, then 100 mg daily for 18 weeks), pretomanid (200 mg daily for 26 weeks), and daily linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks or 9 weeks or 600 mg for 26 weeks or 9 weeks. The primary end point in the modified intention-to-treat population was the incidence of an unfavorable outcome, defined as treatment failure or disease relapse (clinical or bacteriologic) at 26 weeks after completion of treatment. Safety was also evaluated. A total of 181 participants were enrolled, 88% of whom had XDR or pre-XDR tuberculosis. Among participants who received bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid with linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks or 9 weeks or 600 mg for 26 weeks or 9 weeks, 93%, 89%, 91%, and 84%, respectively, had a favorable outcome; peripheral neuropathy occurred in 38%, 24%, 24%, and 13%, respectively; myelosuppression occurred in 22%, 15%, 2%, and 7%, respectively; and the linezolid dose was modified (i.e., interrupted, reduced, or discontinued) in 51%, 30%, 13%, and 13%, respectively. Optic neuropathy developed in 4 participants (9%) who had received linezolid at a dose of 1200 mg for 26 weeks; all the cases resolved. Six of the seven unfavorable microbiologic outcomes through 78 weeks of follow-up occurred in participants assigned to the 9-week linezolid groups. A total of 84 to 93% of the participants across all four bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid treatment groups had a favorable outcome. The overall risk-benefit ratio favored the group that received the three-drug regimen with linezolid at a dose of 600 mg for 26 weeks, with a lower incidence of adverse events reported and fewer linezolid dose modifications. (Funded by the TB Alliance and others; ZeNix ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03086486.). Post hoc analyses of clinical trial data suggested that linezolid may be more effective than vancomycin for treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial pneumonia. This study prospectively assessed efficacy and safety of linezolid, compared with a dose-optimized vancomycin regimen, for treatment of MRSA nosocomial pneumonia. This was a prospective, double-blind, controlled, multicenter trial involving hospitalized adult patients with hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated MRSA pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours) or vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours) for 7-14 days. Vancomycin dose was adjusted on the basis of trough levels. The primary end point was clinical outcome at end of study (EOS) in evaluable per-protocol (PP) patients. Prespecified secondary end points included response in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population at end of treatment (EOT) and EOS and microbiologic response in the PP and mITT populations at EOT and EOS. Survival and safety were also evaluated. Of 1184 patients treated, 448 (linezolid, n = 224; vancomycin, n = 224) were included in the mITT and 348 (linezolid, n = 172; vancomycin, n = 176) in the PP population. In the PP population, 95 (57.6%) of 165 linezolid-treated patients and 81 (46.6%) of 174 vancomycin-treated patients achieved clinical success at EOS (95% confidence interval for difference, 0.5%-21.6%; P = .042). All-cause 60-day mortality was similar (linezolid, 15.7%; vancomycin, 17.0%), as was incidence of adverse events. Nephrotoxicity occurred more frequently with vancomycin (18.2%; linezolid, 8.4%). For the treatment of MRSA nosocomial pneumonia, clinical response at EOS in the PP population was significantly higher with linezolid than with vancomycin, although 60-day mortality was similar. With the introduction of new anti-tuberculosis drugs, all-oral regimens with shorter treatment durations for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have been anticipated. We aimed to investigate whether a new all-oral regimen was non-inferior to the conventional regimen including second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs for 20-24 months in the treatment of fluoroquinolone-sensitive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. In this multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 2/3 non-inferiority trial, we enrolled men and women aged 19-85 years with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis confirmed by phenotypic or genotypic drug susceptibility tests or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis by genotypic tests at 12 participating hospitals throughout South Korea. Participants with fluoroquinolone-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to two groups using a block randomisation, stratified by the presence of diabetes and cavitation on baseline chest radiographs. The investigational group received delamanid, linezolid, levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide for 9 months, and the control group received a conventional 20-24-month regimen, according to the 2014 WHO guidelines. The primary outcome was the treatment success rate at 24 months after treatment initiation in the modified intention-to-treat population and the per-protocol population. Participants who were ""cured"" and ""treatment completed"" were defined as treatment success following the 2014 WHO guidelines. Non-inferiority was confirmed if the lower limit of a 97·5% one-sided CI of the difference between the groups was greater than -10%. Safety data were collected for 24 months in participants who received a predefined regimen at least once. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02619994. Between March 4, 2016, and Sept 14, 2019, 214 participants were enrolled, 168 (78·5%) of whom were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. At 24 months after treatment initiation, 60 (70·6%) of 85 participants in the control group had treatment success, as did 54 (75·0%) of 72 participants in the shorter-regimen group (between-group difference 4·4% [97·5% one-sided CI -9·5% to ∞]), satisfying the predefined non-inferiority margin. No difference in safety outcomes was identified between the control group and the shorter-regimen group. 9-month treatment with oral delamanid, linezolid, levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide could represent a new treatment option for participants with fluoroquinolone-sensitive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

4638,"('Rimantadine hydrochloride', 'Flumadine', 'Rimantadine hcl', 'Meradane', 'Rimantadine (hydrochloride)')",Medical,"Rimantadine (INN, sold under the trade name Flumadine) is an orally administered antiviral drug used to treat, and in rare cases prevent, influenzavirus A infection. When taken within one to two days of developing symptoms, rimantadine can shorten the duration and moderate the severity of influenza. Rimantadine can mitigate symptoms, including fever. Both rimantadine and the similar drug amantadine are derivates of adamantane. Rimantadine is found to be more effective than amantadine because when used the patient displays fewer symptoms. Rimantadine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1994. Rimantadine was approved for medical use in 1993. Seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples tested have shown resistance to rimantadine, and it is no longer recommended to prescribe for treatment of the flu. == Medical uses == === Influenza A === Rimantadine inhibits influenza activity by binding to amino acids in the M2 transmembrane channel and blocking proton transport across the M2 channel. Rimantadine is believed to inhibit influenza's viral replication, possibly by preventing the uncoating of the virus's protective shells, which are the envelope and capsid. The M2 channel is known to be responsible for viral replication in the influenza virus. Genetic studies suggest that the virus M2 protein, an ion channel specified by virion M2 gene, plays an important role in the susceptibility of influenza A virus to inhibition by rimantadine. Rimantadine is bound inside the pore to amantadine specific amino acid binding sites with hydrogen binding and van der Waals interactions. The ammonium group (with neighboring water molecules) is positioned towards the C terminus with the amantadane group is positioned towards the N-terminus when bound inside the M2 pore. ==== Influenza resistance ==== Resistance to rimantadine can occur as a result of amino acid substitutions at certain locations in the transmembrane region of M2. This prevents binding of the antiviral to the channel. The mutation S31N binding site with rimantadine is shown in the image to the left. It shows rimantadine binding into lumenal (top) or peripheral (bottom) binding sites with influenza M2 channel Serine 31 (gold) or Asparagine 31 (blue). ==== Rimantadine enantiomers interactions with M2 ==== Rimantadine, when sold as flumadine, is present as a racemic mixture; the R and S states are both present in the drug. Solid state NMR studies have shown that the R enantiomer has a stronger binding affinity to the M2 channel pore than the S-enantiomer of rimantadine. Antiviral assay and electrophysiology studies show that there is no significant difference between the R and S enantiomers in binding affinity to amino acids in the M2 channel. Since the enantiomers have similar binding affinity, they also have similar ability to block the channel pore and work as an effective antiviral. Rimantadine enantiomers R and S are pictured interacting with the M2 pore below to the right. This image shows that there is not a significant modeled difference between the R and S enantiomers. === Parkinson's disease === Rimantadine, like its antiviral cousin amantadine, possesses antiparkinsonian activity and can be used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, in general, neither rimantadine nor amantadine is a preferred agent for this therapy and would be reserved for cases of the disease that are less responsive to front-line treatments. === Others === Rimantadine is shown to be effective against other RNA-containing viruses. It can treat arboviruses like Saint Louis encephalitis and Sindbis. Other viruses that can be treated with Rimantadine include respiratory synctial and parainfluenza viruses. Rimantadine has also been shown to treat chronic hepatitis C. == Side effects == Rimantadine can produce gastrointestinal and central nervous system adverse effects. Approximately 6% of patients (compared to 4% of patients taking a placebo) reported side-effects at a dosage of 200 mg/d. Common side effects include: Nausea Upset stomach Nervousness Tiredness Lightheadedness Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Difficulty concentrating Confusion Rimantadine shows fewer CNS symptoms than its sister drug amantadine. == Interactions == Taking paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol) or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) while taking rimantadine is known to reduce the body's uptake of rimantadine by approximately 12%. Cimetidine also affects the body's uptake of rimantadine. Taking anticholinergic drugs with amantadine may increase underlying seizure disorders and aggravate congestive heart failure. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The related drugs memantine and to a much lesser extent amantadine are known to act as NMDA receptor antagonists. The affinity of rimantadine for the NMDA receptor does not seem to have been reported. Analogues of rimantadine are known to act as NMDA receptor antagonists. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === 1-carboxyadamatanones are reduced with sodium borohydride to create racemic hydroxy acid. Excess methyllithium is then added to create methyl ketones which when reduced with lithium aluminum hydride gives the amine group. The synthesis pictured to the left is a synthesis of rimantadine as synthesized in Europe. == History == Rimantadine was discovered in 1963 and patented in 1965 in the US by William W. Prichard in Du Pont & Co., Wilmington, Delaware (patent on new chemical compound U.S. patent 3,352,912, 1965 and on the first method of synthesis U.S. patent 3,592,934, 1967). Prichard's methods of synthesis of rimantadine from the corresponding ketone oxime were based on its reduction with lithium aluminum hydride. == See also == Adapromine Bromantane Memantine Tromantadine == References == == External links == U.S. FDA press release announcing rimantadine's approval U.S. Center for Drug Evaluation and Research rimantadine description U.S. NIH rimantadine description U.S. CDC flu anti-viral treatment information",Flumadine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.053033626405522e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011745942756533623)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/mtm/flumadine.html ', [])"
4639,"('Deferoxamine mesylate', 'Desferrioxamine b mesylate', 'Desferal', 'Desferrioxamine mesylate', 'Deferoxamine mesilate')",Medical,"Deferoxamine (DFOA), also known as desferrioxamine and sold under the brand name Desferal, is a medication that binds iron and aluminium. It is specifically used in iron overdose, hemochromatosis either due to multiple blood transfusions or an underlying genetic condition, and aluminium toxicity in people on dialysis. It is used by injection into a muscle, vein, or under the skin. Common side effects include pain at the site of injection, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, hearing loss, and eye problems. Severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and low blood pressure may occur. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the baby. Deferoxamine is a siderophore from the bacteria Streptomyces pilosus. Deferoxamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Deferoxamine is used to treat acute iron poisoning, especially in small children. This agent is also frequently used to treat hemochromatosis, a disease of iron accumulation that can be either genetic or acquired. Acquired hemochromatosis is common in patients with certain types of chronic anemia (e.g. thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) who require many blood transfusions, which can greatly increase the amount of iron in the body. Treatment with iron-chelating drugs such as deferoxamine reduces mortality in persons with sickle cell disease or β‐thalassemia who are transfusion dependent. Administration for chronic conditions is generally accomplished by subcutaneous injection over a period of 8–12 hours each day. Administration of deferoxamine after acute intoxication may color the urine a pinkish red, a phenomenon termed ""vin rosé urine"". Apart from iron toxicity, deferoxamine can be used to treat aluminium toxicity (an excess of aluminium in the body) in selected patients. In US, the drug is not FDA-approved for this use. Deferoxamine is also used to minimize doxorubicin's cardiotoxic side effects and in the treatment of patients with aceruloplasminemia. Deferoxamine may be effective for improving neurologic outcomes in persons with intracranial hemorrhage, although the evidence supporting the efficacy and safety for this indication was weak. Some published manuscripts suggesting the use of deferoxamine for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 because of the high level of ferritin among them. == Adverse effects == It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Chronic use of deferoxamine may increase the risk of hearing loss in patients with thalassemia major. Chronic use of deferoxamine may cause ocular symptoms, growth retardation, local reactions and allergy. == Mechanism == Deferoxamine is produced by removal of the trivalent iron moiety from ferrioxamine B, an iron-bearing sideramine produced by the actinomycetes, Streptomyces pilosus. Its discovery was a serendipitous result of research conducted by scientists at Ciba in collaboration with scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the University Hospital in Freiburg, Germany Deferoxamine acts by binding free iron in the bloodstream and enhancing its elimination in the urine. By removing excess iron from persons with hemochromatosis, the agent reduces the damage done to various organs and tissues, such as the liver. Also, it speeds healing of nerve damage (and minimizes the extent of recent nerve trauma). Deferoxamine may modulate expression and release of inflammatory mediators by specific cell types. == Research == Deferoxamine is being studied as a treatment for spinal cord injury and intracerebral hemorrhage. It is also used to induce hypoxia-like environment in mesenchymal stem cells. Since the terminal amine group of Deferoxamine does not participate in metal chelation, it has been used to immobilize Deferoxamine to surfaces and substrates for various industrial and biomedical applications. == See also == Chelation therapy == References ==",Desferal,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.2782016205601394e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011059768497943878)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The reactions have been found to be extremely dependent on the dominant E/Z isomeric form of the TSC ligands present in the reaction medium. Consequently the isomerisation processes occurring on the free ligands have also been monitored under equivalent conditions. The isomerisation process is found to be acid dependent, despite the absence of protonation under the conditions used, and presumably proceeds via an azo-type tautomer of the ligand. In all cases the existence of outer-sphere interaction processes has been established, both promoting the reactions and producing dead-end complexes. The better oriented forms of the ligands (EZ thiolate) have been found to react faster with the [Fe(HDFO)](+) complex, although for mono-N(4) substituted thiosemicarbazones the process is retarded by the formation of a dead-end outer-sphere complex. A comparison with the abstraction of Fe(III) from [Fe(EDTA)(H(2)O)](-) has also been conducted with significant differences in the kinetic features that implicate keystone outer-sphere interactions which dominate reactivity, even with isomeric forms that are not the best suited for direct complexation. Iron is essential for many biological functions in bacteria, but its poor solubility is a limiting factor for growth. Bacteria produce siderophores, soluble natural products that bind iron with high affinity, to overcome this challenge. Siderophore-iron complexes return to the cell through specific outer membrane transporters. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa makes multiple transporters that recognize its own siderophores, pyoverdine and pyochelin, and xenosiderophores produced by other bacteria or fungi, which gives it a competitive advantage. Some antibiotics exploit these transporters to bypass the membrane to reach their intracellular targets-including the thiopeptide antibiotic, thiostrepton (TS), which uses the pyoverdine transporters FpvA and FpvB to cross the outer membrane. Here, we assessed TS susceptibility in the presence of various siderophores and discovered that ferrichrome and ferrioxamine B antagonized TS uptake via FpvB. Unexpectedly, we found that FpvB transports ferrichrome and ferrioxamine B with higher affinity than pyoverdine. Site-directed mutagenesis of FpvB coupled with competitive growth inhibition and affinity label quenching studies suggested that the siderophores and antibiotic share a binding site in an aromatic pocket formed by the plug and barrel domains but have differences in their binding mechanism and molecular determinants for uptake. This work describes an alternative uptake pathway for ferrichrome and ferrioxamine B in P. aeruginosa and emphasizes the promiscuity of siderophore transporters, with implications for Gram-negative antibiotic development via the Trojan horse approach.

4641,"('Topotecan hcl', 'Hycamtin', 'Topotecan (hydrochloride)', 'Nogitecan hydrochloride', 'Topotecan monohydrochloride')",Medical,"Topotecan, sold under the brand name Hycamtin among others, is a chemotherapeutic agent medication that is a topoisomerase inhibitor. It is a synthetic, water-soluble analog of the natural chemical compound camptothecin. It is used in the form of its hydrochloride salt to treat ovarian cancer, lung cancer and other cancer types. After GlaxoSmithKline received final FDA approval for topotecan on 15 October 2007, it became the first topoisomerase I inhibitor for oral use. == Uses == Ovarian cancer (FDA May 1996). Cervical cancer (FDA June 2006). Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (FDA Oct 2007). === Experimental uses === As of 2016, experiments were under way for Neuroblastoma, Brainstem glioma, Ewing's sarcoma and Angelman's syndrome. In addition, topotecan is experimentally treating Non-small cell lung cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Breast cancer, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Endometrial cancer, and Oligodendroglioma. === Angelman's syndrome === Angelman's syndrome is a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by severe developmental delays, seizures, speech impairments and physical impairments. It is an epigenetic disease and other treatments focus on symptoms. It is caused by a deletion or mutation of the maternal allele for the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A. UBE3A is expressed in most body tissues. However, in neurons only the maternal copy of the gene is expressed. UBE3A is located on chromosome 15 and the paternal copy for the gene is genetically imprinted and is silenced by an antisense RNA transcript. The maternal copy control center of the gene is methylated, suppressing transcription in the antisense direction while the paternal copy control center is unmethylated. Treatment involves unsilencing the paternal allele allowing the normal paternal UBE3A allele to be transcribed. UBE3A, in normal function, adds ubiquitin chains to proteins to target unnecessary or damaged proteins for degradation by the proteasome. 16 topoisomerase inhibitors unsilence paternal UBE3A. Topoisomerases are enzymes that regulate the unwinding of DNA. Of these 16 inhibitors, topotecan was found to induce the strongest upregulation of UBE3A. The enzymes bind to the DNA and cut the phosphate backbone, allowing the DNA to be unwound. Topotecan unsilences the paternal UBE2A allele by reducing the transcription of an antisense transcript. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase I restoring UBE3A levels to wild-type range in cultured mince neurons. Transgenic mice with a fluorescently tagged UBE3A were used to test the effectiveness of unsilencing the paternal copy. When tested on mice in vivo, topotecan affected the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex but not the cerebellum unless a higher dose was administered (21.6 micrograms/hour for five days). The study suggested that the topoisomerase inhibitors have the potential to produce a normally functioning UBE3A protein. Most symptoms due to Angelman's syndrome are traditionally treated by speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Anti-seizure medication is often prescribed as seizures are a common symptom of Angelman's syndrome. These treatments target only symptoms. This drug has been administered to cancer patients. It was well tolerated when administered to pediatric and adult patients. == Mechanism of action == Topotecan is a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecin is a natural product extracted from the bark of the tree Camptotheca acuminata. Topoisomerase-I is a nuclear enzyme that relieves torsional strain in DNA by opening single strand breaks. Once topoisomerase-I creates a single strand break, the DNA can rotate in front of the advancing replication fork. In physiological environments, topotecan is in equilibrium with its inactive carboxylate form. Topotecan's active lactone form intercalates between DNA bases in the topoisomerase-I cleavage complex. The binding of topotecan in the cleavage complex prevents topoisomerase-I from religating the nicked DNA strand after relieving the strain. This intercalation therefore traps the topoisomerase-I in the cleavage complex bound to the DNA. When the replication-fork collides with the trapped topoisomerase-I, DNA damage occurs. The unbroken DNA strand breaks and mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks. The accumulation of trapped topoisomerase-I complexes is a known response to apoptotic stimuli. This disruption prevents DNA replication and ultimately leads to cell death. This process leads to breaks in the DNA strand resulting in apoptosis. Administration of topotecan down-regulates its target, topoisomerase-I; therefore, it is dosed to maximize efficacy and minimize related toxicity. Topotecan is often given in combination with paclitaxel as first line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. == Side effects == Myelosuppression, specifically neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and constipation Increased susceptibility to infections Asthenia == Generic versions == Two generic versions have been approved in the European Union.

It is generally less preferred for this use than inhaled corticosteroids. It is not useful for acute asthma attacks. Other uses include allergic rhinitis and hives of long duration. For allergic rhinitis it is a second-line treatment. Common side effects include abdominal pain, cough, and headache. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis and eosinophilia. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Montelukast is in the leukotriene receptor antagonist family of medications. It works by blocking the action of leukotriene D4 in the lungs resulting in decreased inflammation and relaxation of smooth muscle. Montelukast was approved for medical use in the United States in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the seventeenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 29 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Montelukast is used for a number of conditions including asthma, exercise induced bronchospasm, allergic rhinitis, and urticaria. It is mainly used as a complementary therapy in adults in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, if inhaled steroids alone do not bring the desired effect. It is also used to prevent allergic reactions and asthma flare-ups during the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin. It may also be used as an adjunct therapy in symptomatic treatment of mastocytosis. It is taken by mouth, as a tablet, chewable tablet, or as granules. == Pharmacology == Montelukast is in the leukotriene receptor antagonist family of medications. It works by blocking the action of leukotriene D4 in the lungs resulting in decreased inflammation and relaxation of smooth muscle. Montelukast functions as a leukotriene receptor antagonist (cysteinyl leukotriene receptors) and consequently opposes the function of these inflammatory mediators; leukotrienes are produced by the immune system and serve to promote bronchoconstriction, inflammation, microvascular permeability, and mucus secretion in asthma and COPD. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mild rashes, asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes, and fever. Uncommon side effects include fatigue and malaise, behavioral changes, paresthesias and seizures, muscle cramps, and nose bleeds. Rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people taking montelukast) but serious side effects include behavioral changes (including suicidal thoughts), angioedema, erythema multiforme, and liver problems. In 2019 and 2020, concerns for neuropsychiatric reactions were added to the prescription labels in the United Kingdom and the United States where the most frequently suspected were nightmares, depression, insomnia (may affect between 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,000 people taking montelukast); aggression, anxiety and abnormal behavior or changes in behavior (may affect between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 10,000 people taking montelukast). === FDA investigation === In June 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded a review into the possibility of neuropsychiatric side effects with leukotriene modulator drugs. Although clinical trials revealed only an increased risk of insomnia, post-marketing surveillance showed that the drugs were associated with a possible increase in suicidal behavior and other side effects such as agitation, aggression, anxiousness, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, depression, irritability, restlessness, and tremor. In March 2020, the FDA required a boxed warning for montelukast to strengthen an existing warning about the risk of neuropsychiatric events associated with the drug in the wake of an increase in case reporting of neuropsychiatric events around the time of the initial communications about the concern from FDA in 2008. The boxed warning advises health care providers to avoid prescribing montelukast to patients with mild symptoms, particularly those with allergic rhinitis, because there are many other allergy medicines that can safely and effectively manage this condition. In the FDA's data analysis, in comparison to case reports that based on people's self-reports, the propensity of developing neuropsychiatric disorders after montelukast use did not outpace that of inhaled corticosteroids; and there were no statistically significant risks of new-onset neuropsychiatric disorders among males, females, patients 12 years and older, patients with a psychiatric history, or after the 2008 FDA communication and prescribing information changes that first publicized the concern. In addition, the FDA's analysis summary of its findings said ""exposure to montelukast was significantly associated with a decreased risk of treated outpatient depressive disorder and the decreased risks were seen among patients with a history of a psychiatric disorder, in patients 12 to 17 years as well as 18 years and older, and in both females and males."" ""Treated outpatient depressive disorder"" refers to patients who sought treatment specifically for depressive disorders in outpatient psychiatric settings. In 2024, following reports of night terrors, uncontrollable aggression, intrusive thoughts, depression and rare cases of hallucinations and suicidal behavior in children, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was reviewing the risks of montelukast after identifying ""further concerns"". The FDA has begun, as of 2020, an internal expert review of why the drug may cause ""neuropsychiatric side effects"". In a limited audience review of some findings of this internal group to the American College of Toxicology, on November 20, 2024 in Austin, TX, Jessica Oliphant, deputy director for FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, said ""that laboratory tests showed “significant binding” of montelukast to multiple receptors found in the brain"" and that ""These data indicate that montelukast is highest in brain regions known to be involved in (psychiatric effects),”. The FDA does not plan to update the box warning label. == Drug interactions == Montelukast is an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2C8, part of the cytochrome P450 system. Therefore, it is theoretically possible that the combination of montelukast with a CYP2C8 substrate (e.g. amodiaquine, an anti-malarial drug) could increase the plasma concentrations of the substrate. However, clinical studies have shown minimal interactions between montelukast and other CYP2C8 substrate drugs, which is most likely due to the high plasma protein binding exhibited by montelukast. == Society and culture == === Patents === Singulair was covered by US Patent No. 5,565,473 which expired on 3 August 2012. The same day, the FDA approved several generic versions of montelukast. The United States Patent and Trademark Office launched a reexamination of the patent covering Singulair on May 2009. The decision was driven by the discovery of references that were not included in the original patent application process. The references were submitted through Article One Partners, an online research community focused on finding literature relating to existing patents. The references included a scientific article produced by a Merck employee on the active ingredient in Singulair. A previously filed patent had been submitted in the same technology area. Seven months later the US Patent and Trademark Office determined that the patent in question was valid based on the initial reexamination and new information provided, submitting their decision on 17 December 2009. === Use with loratadine === Schering-Plough and Merck sought permission to market a combined tablet with loratadine and montelukast. However, the FDA has found no benefit from a combined pill for seasonal allergies over taking the two drugs in combination, and in April 2008, issued a not-approvable letter for the combination. === Brand names === The Mont in montelukast stands for Montreal, where Merck (MSD) developed the drug. Montelukast is sold under a variety of brand names including Monalast (Ziska Pharmaceuticals Ltd) Montenaaf (NAAFCO Pharma) Montelon-10 (Apex), Montene (Square), Montair-10, Lukotas, Montelo-10, Monteflo, and Tukast L in India, Reversair (ACI Bangladesh), Monas, Miralust, Montiva, Provair, Montril, Lumona, Lumenta, Arokast and Trilock in Bangladesh, Ventair in Nepal, Montika in Pakistan, Montelair in Brazil, Zykast in the Philippines though combined with levocetirizine, Desmont, Levmont, Aircomb and Notta in Turkey, Topraz and Monte-Air in South Africa. == References ==",Montair,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00021526881027966738), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009253510506823659)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.4740770161151886)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.1mg.com/drugs/montair-10-tablet-701452 ', [])"
4643,"('Cis-montelukast', 'Montelukast ep impurity g', 'Mk 0476;mk-0476;mk0476')",Medical," A simple and accurate assay for quantitating MK-0476 [sodium 1-(((1(R)-(3-(2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)-(E)-(ethenyl)phenyl)(3-(2-(1- hydroxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl)propyl)thio)-methyl)cyclopropane)acetate], which is a potent and selective leukotriene D4-receptor antagonist, in human plasma has been developed. The method involves precipitation of protein and reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The assay is linear in the range of 30-3000 ng ml-1 of MK-0476, and the limit of detection is 5 ng ml-1. The interday precision (% relative standard deviation) values of this method at 51 and 2040 ng ml-1 are 10 and 3%, respectively. The interday accuracy values at these concentrations are 94 and 104%, respectively. The absolute recovery of MK-0476 is 99%. The utility of this method to determine plasma concentrations of MK-0476 in humans receiving the drug orally was demonstrated. A study was conducted to (i) characterize the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of oral montelukast sodium (MK-0476), 10 mg d-1 in healthy young subjects (N = 12), (ii) evaluate the pharmacokinetics of montelukast in healthy elderly subjects (N = 12), and (iii) compare the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of montelukast between elderly and young subjects. Following oral administration of montelukast sodium, 10 mg d-1 (the therapeutic regimen for montelukast sodium) for 7 d, there was little difference in the plasma concentration-time profiles of montelukast in young subjects between day 1 and day 7 dosing. On average, trough plasma concentrations of montelukast were nearly constant, ranging from 18 to 24 ng mL-1 on days 3-7, indicating that the steady state of montelukast was attained on day 2. The mean accumulation ratio was 1.14, indicating that this dose regimen results in a 14% accumulation of montelukast. In elderly subjects, mean values of plasma clearance (Cl), steady-state volume of distribution (Vss), plasma terminal half-life (t1/2), and mean residence time in the body (MRTIV) following a 7 mg intravenous (5 min infusion) administration of montelukast sodium in the elderly were 30.8 mL min-1, 9.7 L, 6.7 h, and 5.4 h, respectively. Following a 10 mg oral dose, the bioavailability of montelukast in healthy elderly averaged 61%, very close to that (62%) determined previously in healthy young subjects. Also following the 10 mg oral administration, the mean values of AUC0-->infinity, Cmax, tmax, and t1/2, and the mean plasma concentration-time profile of montelukast in the elderly, were generally similar to those in young subjects, indicating that age has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of montelukast.

4644,"('Streptomycin sulfate', 'Streptomycin sulfate (250mg/ml)')",Medical,"Streptomycin is an antibiotic medication used to treat a number of bacterial infections, including tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, endocarditis, brucellosis, Burkholderia infection, plague, tularemia, and rat bite fever. For active tuberculosis it is often given together with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. It is administered by injection into a vein or muscle. Common side effects include vertigo, vomiting, numbness of the face, fever, and rash. Use during pregnancy may result in permanent deafness in the developing baby. Use appears to be safe while breastfeeding. It is not recommended in people with myasthenia gravis or other neuromuscular disorders. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside. It works by blocking the ability of 30S ribosomal subunits to make proteins, which results in bacterial death. Albert Schatz first isolated streptomycin in 1943 from Streptomyces griseus. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies it as critically important for human medicine. == Uses == === Medication === Infective endocarditis: An infection of the endocardium caused by enterococcus; used when the organism is not sensitive to gentamicin Tuberculosis: Used in combination with other antibiotics. For active tuberculosis it is often given together with isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. It is not the first-line treatment, except in medically under-served populations where the cost of more expensive treatments is prohibitive. It may be useful in cases where resistance to other drugs is identified. Plague (Yersinia pestis): Has historically been used as the first-line treatment. However streptomycin is approved for this purpose only by the US Food and Drug Administration. In veterinary medicine, streptomycin is the first-line antibiotic for use against gram negative bacteria in large animals (horses, cattle, sheep, etc.). It is commonly combined with procaine penicillin for intramuscular injection. Tularemia infections have been treated mostly with streptomycin. Streptomycin is traditionally given intramuscularly, and in many nations is only licensed to be administered intramuscularly, though in some regions the drug may also be administered intravenously. === Pesticide === Streptomycin also is used as a pesticide, to combat the growth of bacteria beyond human applications. Streptomycin controls bacterial diseases of certain fruit, vegetables, seed, and ornamental crops. A major use is in the control of fireblight on apple and pear trees. As in medical applications, extensive use can be associated with the development of resistant strains. Streptomycin could potentially be used to control cyanobacterial blooms in ornamental ponds and aquaria. While some antibacterial antibiotics are inhibitory to certain eukaryotes, this seems not to be the case for streptomycin, especially in the case of anti-fungal activity. === Cell culture === Streptomycin, in combination with penicillin, is used in a standard antibiotic cocktail to prevent bacterial infection in cell culture. === Protein purification === When purifying protein from a biological extract, streptomycin sulfate is sometimes added as a means of removing nucleic acids and ribonuclear proteins. Since it binds to ribosomes and precipitates out of solution, it serves as a method for removing rRNA, mRNA, and even DNA if the extract is from a prokaryote. == Side effects == The most concerning side effects, as with other aminoglycosides, are kidney toxicity and ear toxicity. Transient or permanent deafness may result. The vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII (the vestibulocochlear nerve) can be affected, resulting in tinnitus, vertigo, ataxia, kidney toxicity, and can potentially interfere with diagnosis of kidney malfunction. Common side effects include vertigo, vomiting, numbness of the face, fever, and rash. Fever and rashes may result from persistent use. Use is not recommended during pregnancy. Congenital deafness has been reported in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Use appears to be okay while breastfeeding. It is not recommended in people with myasthenia gravis. == Mechanism of action == Streptomycin functions as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It binds to the small 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosomal subunit irreversibly, interfering with the binding of formyl-methionyl-tRNA to the 30S subunit. This causes codon misreading, inhibition of protein synthesis, and ultimately death of the cell through mechanisms that are not well understood. Speculation indicates that the binding of the molecule to the 30S subunit interferes with 30S subunit association with the mRNA strand. This results in an unstable ribosomal-mRNA complex, leading to premature stopping of protein synthesis, leading to cell death. As human and bacteria both have ribosomes, streptomycin has significant side effects in humans. At low concentrations, however, streptomycin inhibits only bacterial growth. Streptomycin is an antibiotic that inhibits both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and is therefore a useful broad-spectrum antibiotic. == History == Streptomycin was first isolated on October 19, 1943, by Albert Schatz, a PhD student in the laboratory of Selman Abraham Waksman at Rutgers University in a research project funded by Merck and Co. Waksman and his laboratory staff discovered several antibiotics, including actinomycin, clavacin, streptothricin, streptomycin, grisein, neomycin, fradicin, candicidin, and candidin. Of these, streptomycin and neomycin found extensive application in the treatment of numerous infectious diseases. Streptomycin was the first antibiotic cure for tuberculosis (TB). In 1952 Waksman was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition ""for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic active against tuberculosis"". Waksman was later accused of playing down the role of Schatz who did the work under his supervision, claiming that Elizabeth Bugie had a more important role in its development. Schatz sued both Dr. Waksman and the Rutgers Research and Endowment Foundation, wanting to be given credit as co-discover and to receive the royalties for the streptomycin. By the end of the settlement, Waksman would receive a 10% royalty, while Schatz got 3% and compensation for his missed royalties. The rest of the lab shared the remaining 7% of the royalties, in which Bugie received 0.2%. Bugie was pursuing a master's degree in Waksman's lab at Rutgers University at this time. Prior to this, she received her bachelor's degree in microbiology at New Jersey College for Women. Although Bugie was considered to be the second author on the Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology paper, she was not listed on the patent submission. Bugie's contributions to Waksman's lab were great. In addition to her work on streptomycin, she also helped develop other antimicrobial substances, had two peer-reviewed publications, and researched the use of antimicrobials against plant pathogens, among several other important contributions to the scientific field, particularly in regard to microbiology. The Rutgers team reported streptomycin in the medical literature in January 1944. Within months they began working with William Feldman and H. Corwin Hinshaw of the Mayo Clinic with hopes of starting a human clinical trial of streptomycin in tuberculosis.: 209–241 The difficulty at first was even producing enough streptomycin to do a trial, because the research laboratory methods of creating small batches had not yet been translated to commercial large-batch production. They managed to do an animal study in a few guinea pigs with just 10 grams of the scarce drug, demonstrating survival.: 209–241 This was just enough evidence to get Merck & Co. to divert some resources from the young penicillin production program to start work toward streptomycin production.: 209–241 At the end of World War II, the United States Army experimented with streptomycin to treat life-threatening infections at a military hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan. The first person who was treated with streptomycin did not survive; the second person survived but became blind as a side effect of the treatment. In March 1946, the third person—Robert J. Dole, later Majority Leader of the United States Senate and presidential nominee—experienced a rapid and robust recovery. The first randomized trial of streptomycin against pulmonary tuberculosis was carried out in 1946 through 1948 by the MRC Tuberculosis Research Unit under the chairmanship of Geoffrey Marshall (1887–1982). The trial was neither double-blind nor placebo-controlled. It is widely accepted to have been the first randomized curative trial. Results showed efficacy against TB, albeit with minor toxicity and acquired bacterial resistance to the drug. === New Jersey === Because streptomycin was isolated from a microbe discovered on New Jersey soil, and because of its activity against tuberculosis and Gram negative organisms, and in recognition of both the microbe and the antibiotic in the history of New Jersey, S. griseus was nominated as the Official New Jersey state microbe. The draft legislation was submitted by Senator Sam Thompson (R-12) in May 2017 as bill S3190 and Assemblywoman Annette Quijano (D-20) in June 2017 as bill A31900. The bill was passed on 2018-01-08 The bill designates Streptomyces griseus as New Jersey State Microbe (New Jersey Senate Bill 3190 (2017).

4646,"('Epinephrine', 'Adrenaline', 'Adrenalin', 'Levoepinephrine', 'Adnephrine')","Endogenous, Medical","Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a medication and hormone. As a medication, it is used to treat several conditions, including anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, asthma, and superficial bleeding. Inhaled epinephrine may be used to improve the symptoms of croup. It may also be used for asthma when other treatments are not effective. It is given intravenously, by injection into a muscle, by inhalation, or by injection just under the skin. Common side effects include shakiness, anxiety, and sweating. A fast heart rate and high blood pressure may occur. Occasionally, it may result in an abnormal heart rhythm. While the safety of its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear, the benefits to the mother must be taken into account. Epinephrine is normally produced by both the adrenal glands and a small number of neurons in the brain, where it acts as a neurotransmitter. It plays an essential role in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles, heart output, pupil dilation, and blood sugar. Epinephrine does this through its effects on alpha and beta receptors. It is found in many animals and some single-celled organisms, but the medication is produced synthetically and is not harvested from animals. Jōkichi Takamine first isolated epinephrine in 1901, and it came into medical use in 1905. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 240th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Etymology == The word epinephrine is formed from the Ancient Greek ἐπι- (epi-, ""on"") and νεφρός (nephros, ""kidney"") because the adrenal glands, where it is produced, are located just above the kidneys. == Medical uses == Epinephrine is used to treat a number of conditions, including cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, and superficial bleeding. It has been used historically for bronchospasm and low blood sugar, but newer treatments for these that are selective for β2 adrenoceptors, such as salbutamol, are preferred. === Heart problems === While epinephrine is often used to treat cardiac arrest, it has not been shown to improve long-term survival or mental function after recovery. It does, however, improve return of spontaneous circulation. === Anaphylaxis === Epinephrine is the only life-saving treatment for anaphylaxis. The commonly used epinephrine autoinjector delivers a 0.3 mg epinephrine injection (0.3 mL, 1:1000). It is indicated in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis to stings, contrast agents, medicines, or people with a history of anaphylactic reactions to known triggers. A lower-strength product is available for children. Intramuscular injection can be complicated in that the depth of subcutaneous fat varies and may result in subcutaneous injection, or may be injected intravenously in error, or the wrong strength used. Intramuscular injection gives a faster and higher pharmacokinetic profile compared to subcutaneous injection. In August 2024, an epinephrine nasal spray (brand name Neffy) was approved in the United States for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (type I), including those that are life-threatening (anaphylaxis), in people who weigh at least 30 kilograms (66 lb). It is the first nasal spray for the treatment of anaphylaxis approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In March 2025, the FDA expanded the indication of Neffy to include children aged four years of age and older who weigh 15 to 30 kilograms (33 to 66 lb). The approval of epinephrine nasal spray is based on four studies in 175 healthy adults, without anaphylaxis, that measured the epinephrine concentrations in the blood following administration of epinephrine nasal spray or approved epinephrine injection products. Results from these studies showed comparable epinephrine blood concentrations between epinephrine nasal spray and approved epinephrine injection products. Epinephrine nasal spray also demonstrated similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate as epinephrine injection products, two critical effects of epinephrine in the treatment of anaphylaxis. A study of epinephrine nasal spray in children weighing more than 66 pounds showed that epinephrine concentrations in children were similar to adults who received epinephrine nasal spray. The most common side effects of epinephrine nasal spray include throat irritation, tingling nose (intranasal paresthesia), headache, nasal discomfort, feeling jittery, tingling sensation (paresthesia), fatigue, tremor, runny nose (rhinorrhea), itchiness inside the nose (nasal pruritus), sneezing, abdominal pain, gum (gingival) pain, numbness in the mouth (hypoesthesia oral), nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. The FDA granted the application of epinephrine nasal spray fast track designation and granted the approval of Neffy to ARS Pharmaceuticals. === Asthma === Epinephrine is also used as a bronchodilator for asthma if specific β2 agonists are unavailable or ineffective. Because of the high intrinsic efficacy (receptor binding ability) of epinephrine, high drug concentrations cause adverse side effects when treating asthma. The value of using nebulized epinephrine in acute asthma is unclear. === Croup === Racemic epinephrine has been used for the treatment of croup. Racemic adrenaline is a 1:1 mixture of the two enantiomers of adrenaline. The L-form is the active component. Racemic adrenaline works by stimulating the alpha-adrenergic receptors in the airway, with resultant mucosal vasoconstriction and decreased subglottic edema, and by stimulating the β adrenergic receptors, with resultant relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle. === Bronchiolitis === There is a lack of consensus as to whether inhaled nebulized epinephrine is beneficial in the treatment of bronchiolitis, with most guidelines recommending against its use. === Local anesthetics === When epinephrine is mixed with local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine or lidocaine, and used for local anesthesia or intrathecal injection, it prolongs the numbing effect and motor block effect of the anesthetic by up to an hour. Epinephrine is frequently combined with local anesthetic and can cause panic attacks. Epinephrine is mixed with cocaine to form Moffett's solution, used in nasal surgery. === Upper airway obstruction === Upper airway obstruction with edema and stridor can be treated with racemic epinephrine. == Adverse effects == Adverse reactions to adrenaline include palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmia, anxiety, panic attack, headache, anorexia, tremor, hypertension, and acute pulmonary edema. The use of epinephrine based eye-drops, commonly used to treat glaucoma, may also lead to a buildup of adrenochrome pigments in the conjunctiva, iris, lens, and retina. Rarely, exposure to medically administered epinephrine may cause Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Use is contraindicated in people on nonselective β-blockers because severe hypertension and even cerebral hemorrhage may result. The most common side effects of epinephrine nasal spray include throat irritation, tingling nose (intranasal paresthesia), headache, nasal discomfort, feeling jittery, tingling sensation (paresthesia), fatigue, tremor, runny nose (rhinorrhea), itchiness inside the nose (nasal pruritus), sneezing, abdominal pain, gum (gingival) pain, numbness in the mouth (hypoesthesia oral), nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. The FDA granted the application of epinephrine nasal spray fast track designation and granted the approval of Neffy to ARS Pharmaceuticals. == Mechanism of action == Epinephrine acts by binding to a variety of adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine is a nonselective agonist of all adrenergic receptors, including the major subtypes α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3. Epinephrine's binding to these receptors triggers several metabolic changes. Binding to α-adrenergic receptors inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreas, stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle, and stimulates glycolysis and inhibits insulin-mediated glycogenesis in muscle. β adrenergic receptor binding triggers glucagon secretion in the pancreas, increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary gland, and increased lipolysis by adipose tissue. Together, these effects increase blood glucose and fatty acids, providing substrates for energy production within cells throughout the body. In the heart, the coronary arteries have a predominance of β2 receptors, which cause vasodilation of the coronary arteries in the presence of epinephrine. Its actions increase peripheral resistance via α1 receptor-dependent vasoconstriction and increase cardiac output via its binding to β1 receptors. The goal of reducing peripheral circulation is to increase coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures and therefore increase oxygen exchange at the cellular level. While epinephrine does increase aortic, cerebral, and carotid circulation pressure, it lowers carotid blood flow and end-tidal CO2 or ETCO2 levels. It appears that epinephrine may improve macrocirculation at the expense of the capillary beds where perfusion takes place. == Chemistry == Epinephrine, or adrenaline, also known as 3,4,β-trihydroxy-N-methylphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and catecholamine. It is the N-methylated analogue of norepinephrine (noradrenaline; 3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine) and the N-methylated and β-hydroxylated analogue of dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine). == History == Extracts of the adrenal gland were first obtained by Polish physiologist Napoleon Cybulski in 1895. These extracts, which he called nadnerczyna, contained adrenaline and other catecholamines. American ophthalmologist William H. Bates discovered adrenaline's usage for eye surgeries prior to 20 April 1896. Japanese chemist Jōkichi Takamine and his assistant Keizo Uenaka independently discovered adrenaline in 1900. In 1901, Takamine successfully isolated and purified the hormone from the adrenal glands of sheep and oxen. Adrenaline was first synthesized in the laboratory by Friedrich Stolz and Henry Drysdale Dakin, independently, in 1904. == Society and culture == === Names === === Brand names === Epinephrine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, while adrenaline is its BANTooltip British Approved Name.

In this study, we investigated the effects of the adenosine A1 receptor agonist and antagonist (adenosine 5'-monophosphate [5'-AMP] and 8 p-sulfophenyl theophylline [8-SPT], respectively) on thermoregulation in chickens. Male chicks were used in this study. After administration of 5'-AMP and 8-SPT, the rectal temperature, plasma metabolites, and gene expressions in the hypothalamus and liver were measured. The rectal temperature was reduced by peripheral administration of 5'-AMP, and the hypothermic effect of 5'-AMP was attenuated by central injection of 8-SPT in chicks. In the hypothalamus, the mRNA level of the agouti-related protein (AgRP) was increased by 5'-AMP administration, whereas it was suppressed by 8-SPT. The plasma levels of free fatty acid were elevated in 5'-AMP-treated chicks and that elevation was suppressed by the 8-SPT treatment. The gene expression of proopiomelanocortin in the hypothalamus was affected by 8-SPT. Nevertheless, the gene expressions of the thermoregulation-related genes, such as the thyrotropin-releasing hormone, were not affected by 5'-AMP and 8-SPT. Hepatic gene expressions related to lipid intake and metabolism were suppressed by 5'-AMP. However, the gene expression of the uncoupling protein was upregulated by 5'-AMP. Based on these results, birds, like mammals, will undergo adenosine A1 receptor-induced hypothermia. In conclusion, it is suggested that 5'-AMP-mediated hypothermia via the adenosine A1 receptor may affect the central melanocortin system and suppress hepatic lipid metabolism in chickens. D-galactosamine (GalN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lethality and acute liver failure is dependent on endogenously produced inflammatory cytokines. Adenosine has been proven to be a central role in the regulation of inflammatory response. It is not entirely clear that which adenosine action is actually crucial to limiting inflammatory tissue destruction. Here we showed that GalN/LPS challenge elevated hepatic adenosine and induced lethality in adenosine receptor-deficient mice with equal efficiency as wild-type mice. In GalN/LPS-treated mice, pretreatment with adenosine 5'-monophosphate (5'-AMP) significantly elevated hepatic adenosine level and reduced mortality through decreasing cytokine and chemokine production. In RAW264.7 cells, 5'-AMP treatment inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines, which is not mediated through adenosine receptors. 5'-AMP failed to attenuate LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 nuclear translocation, but reduced LPS-induced recruitment of NF-κB p65 to inflammatory gene promoters and decreased LPS-induced enrichment of H3K4 dimethylation at the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) promoter, which was involved in 5'-AMP-induced elevation of cellular adenosine and a decline of methylation potential. In vitro biochemical analysis revealed that adenosine directly attenuated recruitment of NF-κB to the TNF-α and interleukin-6 promoters. Our findings demonstrate that 5'-AMP-inhibiting inflammatory response is not mediated by adenosine receptors and it may represent a potential protective agent for amelioration of LPS-induced liver injury. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master sensor of cellular energy status that plays a key role in the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis. AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by upstream kinases LKB1, CaMKKβ, and Tak1, among others. AMPK exists as αβγ trimeric complexes that are allosterically regulated by AMP, ADP, and ATP. Dysregulation of AMPK has been implicated in a number of metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Recent studies have associated roles of AMPK with the development of cancer and neurological disorders, making it a potential therapeutic target to treat human diseases.

4649,"('Mianserin hydrochloride', 'Mianserin hcl', 'Mianserine hydrochloride', 'Tolvon', 'Mianserin (hydrochloride)')",Medical,"Mianserin, sold under the brand name Tolvon among others, is an atypical antidepressant that is used primarily in the treatment of depression in Europe and elsewhere in the world. It is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA). Mianserin is closely related to mirtazapine, both chemically and in terms of its actions and effects, although there are significant differences between the two drugs (for example, its higher noradrenergic activity and lower 5-HT3 receptor antagonism). == Medical uses == Mianserin at higher doses (30–90 mg/day) is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It can also be used at lower doses (around 10 mg/day) to treat insomnia. == Contraindications == It should not be given, except if based on clinical need and under strict medical supervision, to people younger than 18 years old, as it can increase the risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thinking, and it can increase aggressiveness. While there is no evidence that it can harm a fetus from animal models, there are no data showing it safe for pregnant women to take. People with severe liver disease should not take mianserin, and it should be used with caution for people with epilepsy or who are at risk for seizures, as it can lower the threshold for seizures. If based on clinical decision, normal precautions should be exercised and the dosages of mianserin and any concurrent therapy kept under review and adjusted as needed. == Side effects == Very common (incidence > 10%) adverse effects include constipation, dry mouth, and drowsiness at the beginning of treatment. Common (1% < incidence ≤ 10%) adverse effects include drowsiness during maintenance therapy, tremor, headache, dizziness, vertigo, and weakness. Uncommon (0.1% < incidence ≤ 1%) adverse effects include weight gain. === Withdrawal === Abrupt or rapid discontinuation of mianserin may provoke a withdrawal, the effects of which may include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, decreased appetite or anorexia, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and flu-like symptoms, such as allergies or pruritus, among others. == Overdose == Overdose of mianserin is known to produce sedation, coma, hypotension or hypertension, tachycardia, and QT interval prolongation. == Interactions == Mianserin may enhance the sedative effects of drugs such as alcohol, anxiolytics, hypnotics, or antipsychotics when co-administered. It may decrease the efficacy of antiepileptic medications. Carbamazepine and phenobarbital will cause the body to metabolize mianserin faster and may reduce its effects. There is a risk of dangerously low blood pressure if people take mianserin along with diazoxide, hydralazine, or nitroprusside. Mianserin can make antihistamines and antimuscarinics have stronger effects. Mianserin should not be taken with apraclonidine, brimonidine, sibutramine, or the combination drug of artemether with lumefantrine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Mianserin appears to exert its effects via antagonism of histamine and serotonin receptors, and inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake. More specifically, it is an antagonist/inverse agonist at most, if not all sites of the histamine H1 receptor, serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, and adrenergic α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors, and additionally a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. As an H1 receptor inverse agonist with high affinity, mianserin has strong antihistamine effects (e.g., sedation). Conversely, it has low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and hence lacks anticholinergic properties. Mianserin has been found to be a low affinity but potentially significant partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 1.7 μM; EC50 = 0.53 μM), similarly to some tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Blockade of the H1 and possibly α1-adrenergic receptors has sedative effects, and also antagonism of the 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptors inhibits activation of intracellular phospholipase C (PLC), which seems to be a common target for several different classes of antidepressants. By antagonizing the somatodendritic and presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors, which function predominantly as inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, mianserin disinhibits the release of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine in various areas of the brain and body. Along with mirtazapine, although to a lesser extent in comparison, mianserin has sometimes been described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA). However, the actual evidence in support of this label has been regarded as poor. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of mianserin is 20 to 30%. Its plasma protein binding is 95%. Mianserin is metabolized in the liver by the CYP2D6 enzyme via N-oxidation and N-demethylation. Its elimination half-life is 21 to 61 hours. The drug is excreted 4 to 7% in the urine and 14 to 28% in feces. == Chemistry == Mianserin is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine. Mirtazapine was developed by the same team of organic chemists and differs via addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings. (S)-(+)-Mianserin is approximately 200–300 times more active than its enantiomer (R)-(−)-mianserin; hence, the activity of mianserin lies in the (S)-(+) isomer. == History == It was developed but not discovered by Organon International; the first patents were issued in The Netherlands in 1967, and it was launched in France in 1979 under the brand name Athymil, and soon thereafter in the UK as Norval. Investigators conducting clinical trials in the US submitted fraudulent data, and it was never approved in the US.: 21 : 318 Mianserin was one of the first antidepressants to reach the UK market that was less dangerous than the tricyclic antidepressants in overdose; as of 2012 it was not prescribed much in the UK. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Mianserin is the English and German generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while mianserin hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in French and its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française are miansérine, in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are mianserina, and in Latin is mianserinum. === Brand names === Mianserin is marketed in many countries mainly under the brand name Tolvon. It is also available throughout the world under a variety of other brand names including Athymil, Bonserin, Bolvidon, Deprevon, Lantanon, Lerivon, Lumin, Miansan, Serelan, Tetramide, and Tolvin among others. === Availability === Mianserin is not approved for use in the United States, but is available in the United Kingdom and other European countries. A mianserin generic drug received TGATooltip Therapeutic Goods Administration approval in May 1996 and is available in Australia. == Research == The use of mianserin to help people with schizophrenia who are being treated with antipsychotics has been studied in clinical trials; the outcome is unclear. == References == == Further reading ==",Tolvon,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.58813522325363e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009184433147311211)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mianserin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Mianserin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mianserin?utm_source=openai')])"

It can be used in the treatment of asthma, hay fever, rhinitis, and urticaria, but is now less common as it has been replaced by newer antihistamines. The drug was patented at CIBA, which merged with Geigy into Ciba-Geigy, and eventually becoming Novartis. == Medical uses == Where and when it is/was in common use, tripelennamine is used much like other mildly-anticholinergic antihistamines to treat conditions of the upper respiratory tract arising from illnesses and hay fever. It can be used alone or in combination with other agents to have the desired effect. Cough medicines of the general formula tripelennamine + codeine/dihydrocodine/hydrocodone ± expectorant ± decongestant(s) are popular where available. Among these are the Pyribenzamine cough syrups which contain codeine, with and without decongestants, listed in the 1978 Physicians' Desk Reference; the codeine-tripelennamine synergy is well-known and makes such mixtures more useful for their intended purposes. == Side effects == Tripelennamine is mildly sedating. Other side effects can include irritation, dry mouth, nausea, and dizziness. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tripelennamine acts primarily as an antihistamine, or H1 receptor antagonist. It has little to no anticholinergic activity, with 180-fold selectivity for the H1 receptor over the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (for comparison, diphenhydramine had 20-fold selectivity for the H1 receptor). In addition to its antihistamine properties, tripelennamine also acts as a weak serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). === Pharmacokinetics === The elimination half-life of tripelennamine is 4 to 6 hours.

4651,"('Gabapentin hydrochloride', 'Gabapentin hcl', 'Gabapentin (hydrochloride)', 'Gabarone', 'Cyclohexaneacetic acid, 1-(aminomethyl)-, hydrochloride')",Medical,"Gaborone (UK: GAB-ə-ROH-nee, HAB-, US: GAH-bə-ROH-nee, -⁠nay, Tswana: [χabʊˈrʊnɛ]) is the capital and largest city of Botswana, with a population of 246,325 based on the 2022 census, about 10% of the total population of Botswana. Its metropolitan area is home to 534,842 inhabitants at the 2022 census. Gaborone is situated between Kgale Hill and Oodi Hill, near the confluence of the Notwane River and Segoditshane River in the southeastern corner of Botswana, within 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the South African border. The city is served by the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport. It is an administrative district in its own right, but is the capital of the surrounding South-East District. Locals often refer to the city as GC or Motse-Mshate. The city of Gaborone is named after Chief Gaborone of the Tlokwa people, who once controlled land nearby. Because it was not affiliated with any specific indigenous group and was close to fresh water, the city was planned to be the capital in the mid-1960s when the Bechuanaland Protectorate became an independent nation. The centre of the city comprises a long strip of commercial businesses, called ""Main Mall"", with a semi-circular area of government offices to its east. Gaborone was once one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and this has created problems with housing and illegal settlements. The city has also dealt with conflicts spilling into the country from Zimbabwe and South Africa during the 1980s. Gaborone is the political and economic capital of Botswana, home to its largest companies and the Botswana Stock Exchange. It is also serves as the headquarters of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The main spoken languages in the city include Setswana (Tswana), English, Kalanga, and Kgalagadi. == History == Evidence shows that there have been inhabitants along the Notwane River for centuries. In more recent history, the Tlokwa left the Magaliesberg ranges to settle in the area around 1880, and called the settlement Moshaweng. The word ""Gaborone"" literally means ""it does not fit badly"" or ""it is not unbecoming"". The city was then called ""Gaberones"" by early European colonizers. Gaberones, a shortening of ""Gaborone's Village"", was named after Chief Gaborone of the Tlokwa, whose home village (now called Tlokweng) was across the river from the Government Camp, the name of the colonial government headquarters. The nickname, ""GC"", comes from the name ""Government Camp"". In 1890, Cecil John Rhodes picked Gaberones to house a colonial fort. The fort was where Rhodes planned the Jameson Raid. The city changed its name from Gaberones to Gaborone in 1969. The modern town was only founded in 1964, after a decision was taken to establish a capital for Botswana, which became a self governing territory in 1965, before becoming a fully independent republic on 30 September 1966. In 1965, the capital of the Bechuanaland Protectorate moved from Mafeking to Gaberones. When Botswana gained its independence, Lobatse was the first choice as the nation's capital. However, Lobatse was deemed too limited, and instead, a new capital city would be created next to Gaberones. The city was chosen because of its proximity to a fresh water source, its proximity to the railway to Pretoria, its central location among the central tribes, and its lack of association with those surrounding tribes. The city was planned under Garden city principles with numerous pedestrian walkways and open spaces. Building of Gaborone started in mid-1964. During the city's construction, the chairman of Gaberones Township Authority, Geoffrey Cornish, likened the layout of the city to a ""brandy glass"" with the government offices in the base of the glass and businesses in the ""mall"", a strip of land extending from the base. Most of the early town was built within three years, as a small town designed to accommodate 20,000 people – only to later develop after independence into a modern city. Buildings in early Gaborone include assembly buildings, government offices, a power station, a hospital, schools, a radio station, a telephone exchange, police stations, a post office, and more than 1,000 houses. Because the town was built so quickly, there was a massive influx of labourers who had built illegal settlements on the new city's southern industrial development zone. These settlements were named Naledi. The latter term literally means ""the star"", but could also mean ""under the open sky"" or ""a community that stands out from all others"". In 1971, because of the growth of illegal settlements, the Gaborone Town Council and the Ministry of Local Government and Lands surveyed an area called Bontleng, which would contain low-income housing. However, Naledi still grew, and the demand for housing was greater than ever. In 1973, the Botswana Housing Corporation (BHC) built a ""New Naledi"" across the road from the ""Old Naledi"". Residents from Old Naledi would be moved to New Naledi. However, the demand for housing increased yet again; moreover, the residents who relocated to New Naledi disliked the houses. The problem was solved in 1975 when Sir Seretse Khama, the president of Botswana, rezoned Naledi from an industrial zone to a low-income housing area. On 30 September 1966, Bechuanaland became the eleventh British dependency in Africa to become independent. The first mayor of Gaborone was Reverend Derek Jones. The old Gaberones became a suburb of the new Gaborone, and is now known as ""the Village"". In the mid-1980s, South Africa attacked Botswana and conducted raids on Gaborone and other border towns. The Raid on Gaborone resulted in twelve deaths. After the 1994 General Elections, riots started in Gaborone because of high unemployment and other issues. Today, Gaborone is growing very rapidly. In 1964, Gaborone only had 3,855 citizens; seven years later, the city had almost 18,000 residents. The city originally planned on 20,000 citizens, but by 1992, the city had 138,000 people. This has led to many squatter settlements on undeveloped land. Former mayor Veronica Lesole has stated that Gaborone's development problems were caused by the original city planners. == Geography == Gaborone is situated at 24°39′29″S 25°54′44″E between Kgale and Oodi Hills, on the Notwane River in the south-eastern corner of Botswana, and 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the South African border. The city lies at an elevation of 1,010 metres (3,310 ft) above sea level. Gaborone is surrounded by the following cities: Ramotswa to the southwest, Mogoditshane to the northwest, and Mochudi to the east, and Tlokweng across the river. Most of them are commuter towns for Gaborone. Suburbs in Gaborone include Broadhurst, Gaborone West, The Village, Naledi. Phakalane, an affluent suburb, lies about 13 km north of the city center. In the centre of the city lies the Main Mall which houses many diplomatic missions. At the eastern end of the Mall, one can find the Civic Centre along with the Pula Arch that commemorates Botswana's independence. The Botswana Stock Exchange, National Museum and Art Gallery, and the main campus of the University of Botswana also lie near the Main Mall. To the west of the Main Mall is the Government Enclave. This area contains the governmental buildings such as the National Assembly of Botswana and Ntlo ya Dikgosi buildings. The National Archives building is also found here. === Climate === Gaborone has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh). Most of the year, Gaborone is very sunny. The summers are usually hot. The nights are cool. Usually, the summers with little rainfall are warmer than summers with regular rainfall. If there is a drought, the hottest temperatures of the year are usually in January or February. If there is normal rainfall, the hottest temperatures are usually in October, right before the rain starts. During the winter, days are still warm, and the nights are cold.

There are on average fifty-one days per year with temperatures below 7 °C (45 °F). There is on average one day per year with temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F). The average dew point peaks around January and February at 16 °C (61 °F) and hits the lowest levels in July at 2 °C (36 °F). The average dew point in a given year is 10 °C (50 °F). The record high temperature ever registered in Gaborone was 43.9 °C (111.0 °F). The lowest temperature registered in Gaborone was −6.5 °C (20.3 °F). Precipitation in Gaborone is scanty and erratic. Most of the rainfall in Gaborone falls during the summer months, between October and April. There are on average forty days of thunderstorms per year, most of them happening during the summer months, and four days of fog, usually happening during the winter months. Gaborone has been affected by three floods based on records going back to 1995, one in 2000, one in 2001 that caused an estimated 5,000,000 Botswana pula worth of damage, and one in 2006. The highest relative humidity occurs in June at 90% while the lowest is in September at 28%. Solar irradiance ranges from 4.1 kWh m−2 d−1 in June to 7.3 kWh m−2 d−1 in December. It is windier from September to November at 14 km/h (8.7 mph), and it is calmer from May to August at 8 km/h (5.0 mph). The average wind speed in a given year is 12 km/h (7.5 mph). == Demographics == The population, based on the 2022 census, is 246,325. There are 118,727 males and 127,598 females in the city. There are 58,476 households in Gaborone. In 2001, the average household size was 3.11 people. The city of Gaborone is home to over 10% of the population of Botswana. Almost half of Botswana citizens live within 100 kilometres (62 mi) of Gaborone. The population growth rate of Gaborone is 3.4%, the highest in the country. This is most likely because the city has a more developed infrastructure, making it more livable. Gaborone is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Much of the growth is based on net in migration from the rest of Botswana. The sex ratio of Gaborone is 96.3, meaning that there are 963 men for every 1,000 women. Most of the marriages in Botswana are registered in Gaborone; about 15% of all marriages in Botswana were registered in Gaborone in 2007. On average, there are 3.3 persons per household in Gaborone. This is a low number compared to the rest of Botswana. == Places of worship == Among places of worship, Christian churches and temples predominate. These include houses of worship affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Botswana (Lutheran World Federation), Assemblies of God, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, International Pentecostal Holiness Church, Christ Embassy, Roman Catholic Diocese of Gaborone (Catholic Church). Accompanying a significant community of ethnic Serbs in the city, there are also two Serbian Orthodox churches within Gaborone; the St. Nicholas Church and the St. Sava Church. == Culture == The National Museum and Art Gallery is located just northwest of the Mall along Independence Road. The museum opened in 1968. It holds many things from traditional crafts to works of art by local artists. The museum houses original paintings by Thomas Baines and Lucas Sithole. Exhibits include Artists in Botswana, Children's Art Competition and Thapong International. Outside the museum, there are various forms of transportation such as wagons, sledges, and bakkies (pickup trucks). There is also an exhibit on the San, the earliest inhabitants of southern Africa. The museum opened a 3.6-hectare (9-acre) botanical garden called the National Botanical Garden on 2 November 2007. The garden was built to protect Botswana's indigenous plant life, and 90% of its total plant species are native plants from Botswana. The Maitisong Festival was started in 1987 and is held every year for seven days on either the last week of March or the first week of April. The festival holds outdoor concerts, plays, and films in various venues around the city. ""My African Dream"" was a performing-arts competition during the 2000s that was held every year at the Gaborone International Convention Center. The show featured many kwaito dancers and musicians. The book series The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, written by Scottish author Alexander McCall Smith, is set in Gaborone. The books follow Precious Ramotswe, the first female private detective in Botswana, and the mysteries that she solves. The Detective Kubu series, by Michael Stanley (South African co-writers Michael Sears and Stanley Trollip), features Assistant Superintendent David 'Kubu' Bengu of the Botswana Police Service Criminal Investigation Department. == Economy == Gaborone is the center of the national economy. The headquarters of important financial institutions such as the Bank of Botswana, Bank Gaborone, BancABC, and the Botswana Stock Exchange are centrally located, as well as the headquarters for Air Botswana, Consumer Watchdog, Botswana Telecommunications Corporation, and Debswana, the joint diamond mining venture between De Beers and the Botswana government. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has its headquarters in Gaborone; the organization was formed in 1980 to increase economic cooperation among its members and reduce dependence on South Africa. Several international companies have invested in the city: Hyundai, SABMiller, Daewoo, Volvo, and Siemens. Orapa House, owned by Debswana, is where the diamonds mined from Debswana are sorted and valued. Orapa House is located at the intersection of Khama Crescent and Nelson Mandela Drive. It has a unique style of architecture that allows the optimal amount of indirect sunlight to shine through the windows in order to accurately sort diamonds. A Diamond Technology Park was recently opened, this is as part of Botswana Government's vision for establishment of downstream diamond industry. Companies dealing in diamonds have established their local operations in the park. The Botswana Resource Conference is held annually at the Gaborone International Conference Centre. The unemployment rate in Gaborone is 11.7% as of 2008. 19.7% of the population in Gaborone is employed in the financial sector. According to Mercer's 2011 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, Gaborone has the 195th highest cost of living for expatriates in the world, up from 203rd in 2010. Gaborone comes between Chennai, India and Quito, Ecuador. Gaborone is the fourth least expensive city for expatriates in Africa, coming in above Addis Ababa, Ethiopia at 211th, Kampala, Uganda at 202nd and Windhoek, Namibia at 198th. == Sport == There are several football stadiums located in and around Gaborone. These include SSKB Stadium, Mochudi Stadium, and Botswana National Stadium. There are also several football teams representing Gaborone, which include, amongst others, Botswana Defence Force XI, Gaborone United, Police XI, Township Rollers and Uniao Flamengo Santos FC, which is based in nearby Gabane; all of them have played in the Botswana Premier League. The Botswana national football team plays in the National Stadium, but has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, even though they recently qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations, held in Gabon in January 2012. The Botswana Cricket Association, the governing body of cricket in Botswana, is headquartered in Gaborone. There are two Ovals where cricket is played in the city. The Steinmetz Gaborone Marathon, the second marathon in Botswana, was held for the first time on 18 April 2010. The route started at the Phakalane Golf Estate in Phakalane, north of the city, and went through Gaborone, passing the National Assembly Building. The marathon, which was cancelled in 2011, has been held annually starting from 2012. == Parks and recreation == The Gaborone Dam is located south of Gaborone along the Gaborone-Lobatse road, and provides water for both Gaborone and Lobatse. The dam is the second biggest in Botswana, able to hold 141,400,000 cubic metres (184,900,000 cu yd). It is also starting to be marketed as a recreational area. The northern end of the reservoir is planned to become an entertainment venue called The Waterfront. There is a yacht club, called Gaborone Yacht Club, also on the northern side of the lake. The southern end houses the Kalahari Fishing Club and a new public facility called City Scapes. City Scapes contains parks, playgrounds, and boating facilities. The dam is popular with birdwatchers, windsurfers, and anglers. However, there is no swimming due to the presence of crocodiles and parasitic bilharzias. === Wildlife === The Gaborone Game Reserve is a 600-hectare (1,500-acre) park east of the city on Limpopo Drive. The reserve was built in 1988 and is now the third-busiest in Botswana. Examples of animals in the park are impala, kudu, ostriches, wildebeest, zebras, gemsbok, bushbuck, springbok, duiker, common eland, and common warthogs. The park is a destination for birdwatching. Birds in the marshy section of the park include snake eagles, boubou, gallinule, kingfishers, and hornbills. Kgale Hill is located a few hundred metres from the city. The hill is nicknamed the Sleeping Giant and is 1,287 metres (4,222 ft). There are three different paths to reach the top, usually taking two hours. The Mokolodi Nature Reserve is a 30-square-kilometre (12 sq mi) reserve that was created in 1994. It is located 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) south of Gaborone. There are many different species of animals found in the park such as common warthogs, steenbok, kudu, zebras, giraffes, common eland, ostriches, hippos and rhinos. The park helps with wildlife projects in Botswana that include: the reintroduction of the white rhino and the relocation of ""problem"" cheetahs. Mokolodi also holds the Education Centre, which teaches children about the conservation projects. Somarelang Tikologo (Environment Watch Botswana) is a member-based environmental NGO housed inside an ecological park at the heart of Gaborone. The aim of the organization is to promote sustainable environmental protection by educating, demonstrating and encouraging best practices in environmental planning, resource conservation and waste management in Botswana. The park was officially opened by the Botswana Minister of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism, Onkokame kitso Mokaila on 27 February 2009. The park contains a playground for children to play on throughout the day, a community organic garden, a recycling drop-off center, and a shop where visitors can purchase products made of recycled material. == Government == === Local government === Gaborone is controlled by the Gaborone City Council, the wealthiest council in Botswana. It is composed of 35 councillors representing the wards of Gaborone. The Townships Act mandates the structure of local governments in Botswana. Because Botswana is a unitary state, the power of the local councils are delegated from the national level. The Ministry of Local Government, Land and Housing has a major influence in terms of personnel hiring and training, budgeting, and development planning. The city commission-style council is run by the city clerk and the deputy city clerk. The city is governed by the mayor, deputy mayor, and several committees run by councillors: the financial and general purposes committee; the public health, social welfare and housing committee; the Self-Help Housing Agency (SHAA) management committee; the town planning committee; the trade licensing committee; and the education committee. The councillors elect the mayor in a first-past-the-post system and place each other in the committees yearly. The council has 2,515 employees. An income tax called the Local Government Tax used to be the main source of income of the city council, but it was abolished. Today, the city council derives most of its revenue from property rates. City councillors feel that because of recurrent obligations, they have little room to institute new solutions. The city council has been criticised by the Botswana Association of Local Authorities for its closed elections and minimal authority. In 2010, the council had problems with waste management: Frenic, the waste management company hired by the city, sued the Gaborone City Council for unpaid compensation. This has led to a buildup of uncollected garbage. Haskins Nkaigwa, mayor of Gaborone from 2011, has stressed the importance of more local autonomy. He advocates for a stronger city council with the power to determine budgets and hire and fire clerks and officers. === National government === Gaborone is the political centre of Botswana. Most government buildings are located west of the Main Mall in an area called the Government Enclave. The National Assembly of Botswana, the Ntlo ya Dikgosi, the National Archives, the Department of Taxes and Attorney General's Chambers Building, and the Ministry of Health. Near the entrance of the parliament building, there is a statue of Sir Seretse Khama, Botswana's first president as well as a memorial dedicated to the three hundred Batswana who were killed from 1939 to 1945. Another monument pays tribute to the Botswana Defence Force soldiers who died in the Rhodesian Bush War. Before 1982, Gaborone held one parliamentary constituency, in the Parliament of Botswana. From 1982 to 1993, Gaborone was divided into two constituencies, Gaborone North and Gaborone South. A third seat in Parliament was given to a member elected for the whole city of Gaborone. In January 1993, two new constituencies were created: Gaborone West and Gaborone Central. For local government elections, the four constituencies were divided into wards. Gaborone North had seven, Gaborone West had seven. Gaborone Central had six, and Gaborone South had five. In 2019, the city had five constituencies: Gaborone North, Gaborone Central, Gaborone South, Gaborone Bonnington North, and Gaborone Bonnington South. An International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) was established on 24 July 2000 in Gaborone. The academy would provide training for middle managers for the countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). There are 21 diplomatic missions in Gaborone. == Education == There are more people who have earned a degree or postgraduate qualifications in Gaborone than anywhere else in Botswana. 70.9% of the population of Gaborone have earned at least a secondary-level education 2.6% of the population of Gaborone has never attended school. Gaborone has many primary and secondary schools, both public and private. These include Westwood International School, Maru-a-Pula School, St. Joseph's College, Kgale, Legae Academy, Northside Primary School, Thornhill Primary School and Hillcrest International School. Seventeen of the sixty private schools in Botswana are located in Gaborone. The main campus of the University of Botswana (which was established in 1982) is on the eastern extent of the city. In addition there are other universities or institutions of higher education that cater to specialized study and instruction. Limkokwing University Of Creative Technology (which also has a campus in Gaborone) Botswana Accountancy College (which caters to both accounting and IT students) Botswana Institute of Administration and Commerce Botswana Open University (offering long-distance learning) Gaborone Technical College Boitekanelo College Botho University (which offers courses ranging from computing, accounting and finance, business, engineering and health information management) Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources, situated approximately 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the city centre Further, in year 2006, the Gaborone Universal College of Law, opened its main campus in Gaborone, with its first group of students graduating in 2010. == Media == Newspapers published in Gaborone include Mmegi, The Botswana Gazette, The Monitor, Midweek Sun, The Patriot on Sunday, Sunday Standard, and The Voice. Magazines published are Lapologa, Peolwane, Kutwlano among others. Radio station Yarona FM broadcasts from Gaborone; its frequency in Gaborone is 106.6 FM. Another small, local radio station in Gaborone is Gabz FM, Duma FM & Yarona FM. 86.6% of Gaborone households own a working radio. Before 2000, residents of Gaborone received television programming from BOP TV in Mahikeng via a repeating transmitter on the summit of Kgale Hill. Today, the Gaborone Broadcasting Company and Botswana TV provide television programming for Gaborone. 78.7% of the households in Gaborone have a working television. Other local channels based in Gaborone are Now TV, Khuduga HD, Access TV & Maru TV. 93.7% of the households in Gaborone have a cell phone. == Infrastructure == Gaborone is one of the fastest-growing cities in Africa. The growth of Gaborone, especially suburban growth, has caused much of the farmland surrounding the city to be absorbed into the city. Much of the food for Gaborone comes from north of the city with some smaller-scale farms on the southern end. The city centre was planned to be functionalist, with major buildings designed and built in the style of Modern architecture. The city is surrounded by smaller buildings. The city's central business district (CBD) is still under construction so when one says downtown, they actually mean the Main Mall and Government Enclave areas where tall buildings are usually found. The Main Mall, a car-free shopping and commercial area, runs in an east–west direction with the Government Enclave and National Assembly on the west end and the Gaborone City Town Council complex on the east. Gaborone's CBD is home to the new Square Mall, The Tower, the new SADC headquarters, the Industrial Court, a court specifically for settling trade disputes, and the Three Dikgosi Monument, a landmark featuring the statues of Khama III, Sebele I, and Bathoen I, three dikgosi, or chiefs, who traveled to Great Britain to establish the Bechuanaland Protectorate separate from Southern Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) or the Cape Colony (present-day South Africa). The monument was inaugurated on 29 September 2005. While the statues represent famous historical figures, there has been some controversy over the cost of the construction, P12,000,000 (approx. US$1.7M, €1.4M, or £1.1M as of June 2010), and over the construction company, North Korean Mansudae Overseas Projects, putting the wrong inscription date. Other buildings under construction in the CBD include the Holiday Inn Gaborone, retail space, and office space. === Utilities === The city gets most of its water from the reservoir formed from the Gaborone Dam on the southeast side of the city, which has facilitated growth. The city of Gaborone was originally constructed as a small town, so the Gaborone Dam needed to be built to provide water for all its citizens. From 2007 to 2008, 23,963,000 cubic metres (31,342,000 cu yd) of water was sold in Gaborone. The government sector bought the most water, 11,359,000 cubic metres (14,857,000 cu yd). 8,564,000 cubic metres (11,200,000 cu yd) of water was bought for domestic use, and 4,040,000 cubic metres (5,280,000 cu yd) of water was bought by the commercial and industrial sectors. In 2008, the city of Gaborone consumed 25,657,363 kilolitres (33,558,564 cu yd) of water, and the water consumption per capita was 0.184 cubic metres (0.241 cu yd) per person per year, the lowest rate since 1999. Gaborone has some of the highest water tariffs in the country because of high transportation costs and high water consumption. The high tariffs may also be due to the fact that some of Gaborone's water supply is imported from the Letsibogo Dam. The average pH of the water in the Gaborone Dam is 7.95 as of February 2006. The concentration of calcium in the reservoir was 14.87milligrams per litre from April 2001 to August 2006. During the same period, the concentration of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was 57.73 milligrams per litre, slightly over Botswana's ideal concentration which means the water is hard. Also during the same period, the chloride concentration was 6.44 mg/l, the fluoride concentration was 0.54 mg/l, the potassium concentration was 6.72 mg/l, and the sodium concentration was 10.76 mg/l. == Healthcare == The Botswana Red Cross Society, established in 1968, is headquartered in Gaborone. The Princess Marina Hospital is the main referral hospital in Gaborone and houses 500 beds. There is also Gaborone Private Hospital and Sidilega Private Hospital all operating in the city of Gaborone. The Cancer Association of Botswana is a voluntary non-governmental organization established as a trust in 1998. === HIV/AIDS === AIDS is a very serious problem in Gaborone. 17,773 Gaborone citizens, 17.1% of the total population of Gaborone, have tested positive for HIV. There is a higher prevalence of HIV among women; 20.5% of women have tested positive compared to 13.6% of men. The population between 45 and 49 years of age are most likely to have AIDS with 35.4% of the residents in that age group testing positive. HIV/AIDS education is extensive in Gaborone. However, a 2008 study shows that 14.5% of Gaborone residents between 10 and 64 who have heard of HIV/AIDS believe that HIV can be spread through witchcraft, and 31.3% of the residents believe HIV can be spread through mosquito bites. == Transportation == === Railways === The railway that served the founding purpose of the city remains important, bisecting the city in a north–south direction. Botswana Railways runs a line that goes from Cape Town to Harare via Bulawayo. The railway station in Gaborone is located south of the Parliament House in the city's centre. The line stops at the following cities in and near Botswana: Ramatlabama on the South African border, Lobatse, Gaborone, Palapye, Serule, Francistown, Ramokgwebana, and Plumtree, Zimbabwe. The line became a cargo-only line on 1 April 2009 but passenger services resumed in early 2016. === Airports === Sir Seretse Khama International Airport (ICAO code: FBSK IATA code: GBE) lies 25 kilometres (16 mi) north of the city and in 2018 has flights to Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Addis Ababa and various domestic destinations. It is the headquarters of Air Botswana, the national airline of Botswana. In 2008, Sir Seretse Khama International Airport handled 15,844 aircraft movements, second only to Maun Airport (ICAO code: FMBN IATA code: MUB) Air traffic in Gaborone has decreased since 2006. However, Gaborone has the most air passenger traffic, accounting for 51.6% of all passenger movement in Botswana. International passengers total 244,073 passengers while domestic air passenger movement comes up to 333,390 passengers. Gaborone International Airport terminal was rebuilt into a modern terminal in 2010. === Roads === Highways in and around Gaborone include the Trans-Kalahari Highway, A1 Highway, A10 Highway and the Cairo-Cape Town Highway. There are five major roads in Gaborone that go to Lobatse, Kanye, Molepolole, Francistown via Mochudi, and Tlokweng. === Public transport === Kombi Public transport in the city is generally reliable, when compared with major African cities. Kombis (small vans) and taxis ply the routes within the city, while buses serve surrounding villages and other towns in Botswana. === Private traffic === Gaborone has several vehicle licensing stations. 15,538 new private motor vehicles, accounting for 46.5% of Botswana's total new vehicle registrations, were registered in Gaborone in 2008, of which 8,440 were passenger cars, 440 were minibuses, 204 were motorcycles, and 181 were tractors. The total has increased from 12,690 new vehicle registrations in 2007. Gaborone also has the highest number of vehicle registration renewals at 73,206 in 2008. Including the district of Gaborone West, Gaborone had 9,415 vehicle accidents with 74 human fatalities in 2008. Most of the traffic collisions in that year, 3,146 collisions, were side collisions. 263 accidents involved animals. The city has also seen 679 pedestrian casualties in 2008; 24 pedestrians were killed. The majority of vehicle accident casualties involved pedestrians, and most traffic accidents occur between 16:00 and 18:00. == Notable people == Letsile Tebogo (b. 2003) Motswana Athlete, Sprinter, won He won the silver medal at the 2023 World Championships in the 100 m Kgosi Gaborone (c. 1825–1931), Motswana chief, after whom the city is named Alec Campbell (1932–2012), archaeologist and museum curator Thamsanga Mnyele (1948–1985), member of the African National Congress and artist Vernon Nkadimeng (1958–1985), member of the African National Congress, killed in Gaborone by the apartheid police Boniface Tshosa Setlalekgosi (b. 1927), Roman Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Gaborone, Botswana from 1981 to 2009 Wally Serote (b. 1944), poet and anti-apartheid activist Dipsy Selolwane (b. 1978), football player Mpule Kwelagobe (b. 1979), Miss World Botswana 1997, Miss Universe Botswana 1999 and Miss Universe 1999 Alister Walker (b. 1982), squash player Abednico Powell (b. 1983), football player Joel Mogorosi (b. 1984), football player Dirang Moloi (b. 1985), member of the Botswana national football team Donald Molosi (b. 1985), actor, writer and playwright attended Maru a Pula School in his teens, and the National Arts Festival in South Africa Sumaiyah Marope (c. 1987), Miss Botswana 2009 Emma Wareus (b. 1990), Miss World Botswana 2010, first runner-up to Miss World 2010 Matsieng, a Setswana traditional music group, formed in Gaborone in 2005 == International relations == Gaborone has been twinned with: Burbank, United States Sorong, Indonesia Västerås, Sweden Zhejiang, China Chongqing, China == Gallery == == References == == External links == Gaborone City Council Website Gaborone Satellite view at WikiMapia (not affiliated with Wikipedia/Wikimedia Foundation) Gaborone Encyclopædia Britannica entry Map of Gaborone",Gabarone,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.2664456789934775e-06)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00011848701251437888), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00046397410915233195)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0019286326132714748), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

4653,"('Cytarabin', 'Cytosar', '.beta.-arabinosylcytosine', '.beta.-cytosine arabinoside', '.beta.-d-arabinosylcytosine')",Medical,"Cytarabine, also known as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), is a chemotherapy medication used to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is given by injection into a vein, under the skin, or into the cerebrospinal fluid. There is a liposomal formulation for which there is tentative evidence of better outcomes in lymphoma involving the meninges. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, vomiting, diarrhea, liver problems, rash, ulcer formation in the mouth, and bleeding. Other serious side effects include loss of consciousness, lung disease, and allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Cytarabine is in the antimetabolite and nucleoside analog families of medication. It works by blocking the function of DNA polymerase. Cytarabine was patented in 1960 and approved for medical use in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Cytarabine is mainly used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and in lymphomas, where it is the backbone of induction chemotherapy. Cytarabine also possesses antiviral activity, and it has been used for the treatment of generalised herpesvirus infection. However, cytarabine is not very selective in this setting and causes bone marrow suppression and other severe side effects. Therefore, ara-C is not a useful antiviral agent in humans because of its toxic profile. Cytarabine is also used in the study of the nervous system to control the proliferation of glial cells in cultures, the amount of glial cells having an important impact on neurons. Recently, cytarabine was reported to promote robust and persistent neuronal differentiation in NSC-34 motor neuron-like cell line. Cytarabine is permissive, dispensable, and mostly irreversible in priming NSC-34 cells for neurite initiation and regeneration after mechanical dislodgement. == Side effects == One of the unique toxicities of cytarabine is cerebellar toxicity when given in high doses, which may lead to ataxia. Cytarabine may cause granulocytopenia and other impaired body defenses, which may lead to infection, and thrombocytopenia, which may lead to hemorrhage. Toxicity: pancreatitis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, GI disturbances, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, pneumonitis, fever, and dermatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. Rarely, myelopathy has been reported after high dose or frequent intrathecal Ara-C administration. When used in protocols designated as high dose, cytarabine can cause cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction, ocular toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, severe GI ulceration and peripheral neuropathy (rare). To prevent the side effects and improve the therapeutic efficiency, various derivatives of these drugs (including amino acid, peptide, fatty acid and phosphates) have been evaluated, as well as different delivery systems. == Mechanism of action == Cytosine arabinoside combines a cytosine base with an arabinose sugar. It is an antimetabolic agent with the chemical name of 1β-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Certain sponges, where similar compounds were originally found, use arabinoside sugars for chemical defense. Cytosine arabinoside is similar enough to human deoxycytosine to be incorporated into human DNA, but different enough that it kills the cell. Cytosine arabinoside interferes with the synthesis of DNA. Its mode of action is due to its rapid conversion into cytosine arabinoside triphosphate, which damages DNA when the cell cycle holds in the S phase (synthesis of DNA). Rapidly dividing cells, which require DNA replication for mitosis, are therefore most affected. Cytosine arabinoside also inhibits both DNA and RNA polymerases and nucleotide reductase enzymes needed for DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is the first of a series of cancer drugs that altered the sugar component of nucleosides. Other cancer drugs modify the base. Cytarabine is often given by continuous intravenous infusion, which follows a biphasic elimination – initial fast clearance rate followed by a slower rate of the analog. Cytarabine is transported into the cell primarily by hENT-1. It is then monophosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase and eventually cytarabine-5´-triphosphate, which is the active metabolite being incorporated into DNA during DNA synthesis. Several mechanisms of resistance have been reported. Cytarabine is rapidly deaminated by cytidine deaminase in the serum into the inactive uracil derivative. Cytarabine-5´-monophosphate is deaminated by deoxycytidylate deaminase, leading to the inactive uridine-5´-monophosphate analog. Cytarabine-5´-triphosphate is a substrate for SAMHD1. Furthermore, SAMHD1 has been shown to limit the efficacy of cytarabine efficacy in patients. When used as an antiviral, cytarabine-5´-triphosphate functions by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is able to inhibit herpesvirus and vaccinia virus replication in cells during tissue culture. However, cytarabine treatment was only effective for herpesvirus infection in a murine model. In mice, Ara-CTP (cytarabine-5'-triphosphate) blocks memory consolidation, but not short-term memory, of a context fear conditioning event. The blockage of memory consolidation was proposed to be due to the inhibition by Ara-CTP of the DNA non-homologous end joining pathway. Thus transient DNA breakage followed by non-homologous end joining appear to be necessary steps in the formation of a long-term memory of an event. == History == Isolation of arabinose-containing nucleotides from the Caribbean sponge Cryptotheca crypta (now Tectitethya crypta) together with the realization that these compounds could act as DNA synthesis chain terminators led to exploration of these novel nucleotides as potential anticancer therapeutics. Cytarabine was first synthesized in 1959 by Richard Walwick, Walden Roberts, and Charles Dekker at the University of California, Berkeley. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in June 1969, and was initially marketed in the US by Upjohn under the brand name Cytosar-U. == Names == It is also known as ara-C (arabinofuranosyl cytidine).
