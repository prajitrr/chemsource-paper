However, translation of these data to molecules suitable for clinical development has yet to be accomplished. Herein we expand the mechanistic understanding of BET inhibitors in multiple myeloma by using the chemical probe molecule I-BET151. I-BET151 induces apoptosis and exerts strong antiproliferative effect in vitro and in vivo. This is associated with contrasting effects on oncogenic MYC and HEXIM1, an inhibitor of the transcriptional activator P-TEFb. I-BET151 causes transcriptional repression of MYC and MYC-dependent programs by abrogating recruitment to the chromatin of the P-TEFb component CDK9 in a BRD2-4-dependent manner. In contrast, transcriptional upregulation of HEXIM1 is BRD2-4 independent. Finally, preclinical studies show that I-BET762 has a favorable pharmacologic profile as an oral agent and that it inhibits myeloma cell proliferation, resulting in survival advantage in a systemic myeloma xenograft model. These data provide a strong rationale for extending the clinical testing of the novel antimyeloma agent I-BET762 and reveal insights into biologic pathways required for myeloma cell proliferation. As one of the most fatal malignancies, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has significant resistance to the currently available treatment approaches. Gemcitabine, the standard chemotherapeutic agent for locally advanced and metastatic PDAC, has limited efficacy, which is attributed to innate/acquired resistance and the activation of prosurvival pathways. Here, we investigated the in vitro efficacy of I-BET762, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins, in treating PDAC cell lines alone and in combination with gemcitabine (GEM). The effect of these two agents was also examined in xenograft PDAC tumors in mice. We found that I-BET762 induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and cell death and suppressed cell proliferation and metastatic stem cell factors in PDAC cells. In addition, the BH3-only protein Bim, which is related to chemotherapy resistance, was upregulated by I-BET762, which increased the cell death triggered by GEM in PDAC cells. Moreover, GEM and I-BET762 exerted a synergistic effect on cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Bim is necessary for I-BET762 activity and modulates the synergistic effect of GEM and I-BET762 in PDAC. In conclusion, we investigated the effect of I-BET762 on PDAC and suggest an innovative strategy for PDAC treatment.",I-bet762,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.03046262077987194), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03810705617070198)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([cellsignal.com](https://www.cellsignal.com/products/activators-inhibitors/i-bet762-gsk525762a/45122?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=127, start_index=6, title='I-BET762 (GSK525762A) | Cell Signaling Technology', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cellsignal.com/products/activators-inhibitors/i-bet762-gsk525762a/45122?utm_source=openai')])"

This was an open-label, two-part, Phase I/II study investigating molibresib monotherapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies (NCT01943851). Part 1 (dose escalation) determined the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of molibresib in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or multiple myeloma. Part 2 (dose expansion) investigated the safety and efficacy of molibresib at the RP2D in patients with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; as well as AML evolved from antecedent MDS) or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The primary endpoint in Part 1 was safety and the primary endpoint in Part 2 was objective response rate (ORR). There were 111 patients enrolled (87 in Part 1, 24 in Part 2). Molibresib RP2Ds of 75 mg daily (for MDS) and 60 mg daily (for CTCL) were selected. Most common Grade 3+ adverse events included thrombocytopenia (37%), anemia (15%), and febrile neutropenia (15%). Six patients achieved complete responses [3 in Part 1 (2 AML, 1 NHL), 3 in Part 2 (MDS)], and 7 patients achieved partial responses [6 in Part 1 (4 AML, 2 NHL), 1 in Part 2 (MDS)]. The ORRs for Part 1, Part 2, and the total study population were 10% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.8-18.7], 25% (95% CI, 7.3-52.4), and 13% (95% CI, 6.9-20.6), respectively. While antitumor activity was observed with molibresib, use was limited by gastrointestinal and thrombocytopenia toxicities. Investigations of molibresib as part of combination regimens may be warranted. Molibresib (GSK525762), an orally bioavailable small molecule with 2 major equipotent active metabolites, is being developed for the treatment of cancers. Molibresib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To enable administering safe doses of molibresib to healthy volunteers, this 2-part randomized, open-label, crossover drug-drug interaction trial was conducted as an adaptive design study using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation to predict the lowest doses of molibresib that could be safely administered alone (10 mg) or with itraconazole and rifampicin (strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and P-gp, respectively). PBPK simulation guided the molibresib dose (5 mg) to be administered along with itraconazole in part 1. Itraconazole increased total exposure (AUC) of molibresib by 4.15-fold with a 66% increase in C Molibresib (GSK525762) is an investigational, orally bioavailable, small-molecule bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitor for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Molibresib was initially evaluated in a first-time-in-human (FTIH) study BET115521 consisting of two parts: Part 1 of the study (dose escalation) was conducted in 94 patients with nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma and other solid tumors, and Part 2 (expansion cohort) was conducted in 99 patients with different solid tumor types. Molibresib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes to produce two major active metabolites that are equipotent to the parent molecule. The metabolites are measured together after full conversion of one to the other and reported as an active metabolite composite (GSK3529246). The molibresib pharmacokinetic (PK) profile has been characterized by a decrease in exposure over time, with the decrease more pronounced at higher doses, and accompanied by a slight increase of the metabolite concentrations. Autoinduction of molibresib metabolism was suspected and confirmed in vitro. Here we report the development of a semimechanistic liver-compartment population PK model using PK data from the FTIH study, which adequately describes the autoinduction of molibresib clearance and the PK of both molibresib and GSK3529246. Covariate analysis indicated body weight had a significant effect on the volume of distribution of molibresib and GSK3529246, and higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase resulted in the lower clearance of GSK3529246.

Each trial incorporated positron emission tomography and/or cerebrospinal fluid to evaluate brain amyloid pathology, as well as typical eligibility criteria used in early AD trials. Across the trials, 10,804 US participants were screened: 193 (2%) were of Hispanic ethnicity and Black race, 2,624 (25%) were of Hispanic ethnicity and White race, 118 (1%) were of non-Hispanic ethnicity (NH) and Asian race, 696 (7%) were of NH ethnicity and Black race, and 7,017 (65%) were of NH ethnicity and White race. Data from 156 participants who did not fit into these categories were excluded.

Elenbecestat, an oral BACE-1 inhibitor that has been shown to reduce Aβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid, was investigated in two global phase 3 studies in early AD. Here we report on differences observed in characteristics of APOE ε4 and amyloid positive subjects in the large screening cohort. Screening was performed in 5 sequential tiers over a maximum of 80 days, as part of placebo controlled, double blind phase 3 studies. Subjects were evaluated at sites in 7 regions (29 countries). Overall, 9758 subjects were screened. All screened subjects that were eligible received either placebo or 50 mg QID elenbecestat post randomisation. Gender, disease staging, APOE ε4 status, amyloid status, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) and amyloid PET Centiloid (CL) values were determined for screened subjects; by country and region. In this program, 44% of subjects were APOE ε4 positive. Frequency of females was similar in both APOE ε4 positive and negative groups. However, early mild AD subjects were slightly higher in the APOE ε4 positive group compared with the APOE ε4 negative group. 56% of subjects were amyloid positive. The mean age in the amyloid positive group was slightly higher than the amyloid negative group. The gender distribution was similar between amyloid groups. A lower number of mild cognitive impairment was observed in the amyloid positive group along with a higher number of early mild AD. APOE ε4 positive subjects were higher in amyloid positive group compared to the amyloid negative group. China had the lowest APOE ε4 and amyloid positivity rates with Western Europe and Oceania performing best. Subjects received florbetapir, florbetaben or flutemetamol amyloid PET tracer. Amyloid negative and positive subjects CL values were normally distributed around their respective means of 1.5 CL and 83 CL. However, there was an appreciable overlap in the 20-40 CL range.

The compound elicited a short-lasting suppressive effect when applied after immunisation; the number of PFC decreased two days after treatment while 5 days after drug administration increased as compared to the untreated animals. Treatment prior to immunisation proved to be ineffective. The titre of circulating antibodies showed changes similar although of lesser extent. Five days following treatment marked infiltration of plasmacytes was present in the axillary lymph nodes. Rats bearing transplantable Guérin tumor showed similar changes in immune response as the tumor free animals following DAD treatment. Mice 2--4 days of age were pretreated with a single 5 mg/kg dose of dianhydrodulcitol (DAD) and later infected intracerebrally with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus.

Specifically it is used for NSCLC with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) — either an exon 19 deletion (del19) or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation — which has spread to other parts of the body. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain, and cough. Serious side effects may include lung problems, kidney problems, liver failure, gastrointestinal perforation, stroke, and corneal ulceration. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which acts on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Erlotinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Lung cancer === Erlotinib in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer when added to chemotherapy improves overall survival by 19%, and improved progression-free survival (PFS) by 29%, when compared to chemotherapy alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erlotinib for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that has failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In lung cancer, erlotinib has been shown to be effective in patients with or without EGFR mutations, but appears to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations. Overall survival, progression-free survival and one-year survival are similar to standard second-line therapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed). Overall response rate is about 50% better than standard second-line chemotherapy. Patients who are non-smokers, and light former smokers, with adenocarcinoma or subtypes like BAC are more likely to have EGFR mutations, but mutations can occur in all types of patients. A test for the EGFR mutation has been developed by Genzyme. === Pancreatic cancer === In November 2005, the FDA approved erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine for treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. === Resistance to treatment === As with other ATP competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib in CML, patients rapidly develop resistance. In the case of erlotinib this typically occurs 8–12 months from the start of treatment. Over 50% of resistance is caused by a mutation in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR kinase domain involving substitution of a small polar threonine residue with a large nonpolar methionine residue (T790M). Approximately 20% of drug resistance is caused by amplification of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, which drives ERBB3 dependent activation of PI3K. == Side effects == === Common === Rash occurs in the majority of patients. This resembles acne and primarily involves the face and neck. It is self-limited and resolves in the majority of cases, even with continued use. Some clinical studies have indicated a correlation between the severity of the skin reactions and increased survival though this has not been quantitatively assessed. The Journal of Clinical Oncology reported in 2004 that ""cutaneous [skin] rash seems to be a surrogate marker of clinical benefit, but this finding should be confirmed in ongoing and future studies."" The newsletter Lung Cancer Frontiers reported in its October 2003 issue, ""Patients with moderate to severe cutaneous reactions [rashes] have a far better survival, than those with only mild reactions and much better than those with no cutaneous manifestations of drug effects.""

This may be severe and must be considered among those patients whose breathing acutely worsens. ingrown hairs, such as eyelashes gastrointestinal tract toxicity serious or fatal gastrointestinal tract perforations skin toxicity bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin conditions (some fatal) Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ocular disorders corneal lesions Pulmonary toxicity interstitial pneumonitis bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) pulmonary fibrosis fatal asymmetric interstitial lung disease == Interactions == Erlotinib is not a substrate for either of hepatic OATPs (OATP1B1 or OATP1B3). Also, erlotinib is not an inhibitor of OATP-1B1 or OATP-1B3 transporter. Erlotinib is mainly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Compounds which induce this enzyme (i.e. stimulate its production), such as St John's wort, can lower erlotinib concentrations, while inhibitors can increase concentrations. == Mechanism == Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFR inhibitor). The drug follows Iressa (gefitinib), which was the first drug of this type. Erlotinib specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various forms of cancer. It binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. For the signal to be transmitted, two EGFR molecules need to come together to form a homodimer. These then use the molecule of ATP to trans-phosphorylate each other on tyrosine residues, which generates phosphotyrosine residues, recruiting the phosphotyrosine-binding proteins to EGFR to assemble protein complexes that transduce signal cascades to the nucleus or activate other cellular biochemical processes. When erlotinib binds to EGFR, formation of phosphotyrosine residues in EGFR is not possible and the signal cascades are not initiated. == Society and culture == It is marketed in the United States by Genentech and OSI Pharmaceuticals and elsewhere by Roche. The drug's U.S. patent expired in 2020. In May 2012, the US District Court of Delaware passed an order in favor of OSI Pharmaceutical LLC against Mylan Pharmaceuticals upholding the validity of the patent for Erlotinib.

The medication was discovered in collaboration between PsychoGenics Inc. and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals (which was subsequently merged into Sumitomo Pharma) using PsychoGenics' behavior and AI-based phenotypic drug discovery platform, SmartCube. Ulotaront is in phase III clinical trial for schizophrenia, phase II/III for generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, and discontinued for narcolepsy and psychotic disorders. Research has shown that ulotaront results in a greater reduction from baseline in the PANSS total score than placebo. Treatment with ulotaront, as compared with placebo, was also associated with an improvement in sleep quality. Ulotaront was awarded a Breakthrough Therapy designation due to its increased efficacy and greatly reduced side effects compared to current treatments. == Adverse effects == Some adverse events reported in preliminary clinical trials are somnolence, agitation, nausea, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. The adverse effect profile of ulotaront differs from that of other antipsychotics because its mechanism of action does not involve antagonism of dopamine receptors in the brain, which is responsible for the drug-induced movement disorders (like akathisia) that may occur with those agents. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of ulotaront in the treatment of schizophrenia is unclear. However, it is thought to be an agonist at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. This mechanism of action is unique among available antipsychotics, which generally antagonize dopamine receptors (especially dopamine D2 receptor). Ulotaront is a full agonist of the human TAAR1 with an EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration of 140 nM and an EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy of 101.3%. It is also a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (EC50 = 2,300 nM; Emax = 74.7%) and of the serotonin 5-HT1D receptor (EC50 = 262 nM; Emax = 57.1%). Conversely, its activities at various other targets, such as various other serotonin receptors as well as adrenergic and dopamine receptors, are much less potent. Ulotaront decreases basal locomotor activity in rodents and this effect was absent in TAAR1 knockout mice. It prevented the hyperlocomotion induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). Conversely, ulotaront did not affect dextroamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion. Similarly, it did not reverse apomorphine-induced climbing behavior. === Pharmacokinetics === The precise pharmacokinetic profile of ulotaront has not been reported, though the developer has suggested that the pharmacokinetic data supports once daily dosing. == Research == As of 2018, Sunovion, the maker of another antipsychotic called lurasidone (Latuda), is conducting clinical trials on ulotaront in partnership with the preclinical research company PsychoGenics. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted ulotaront the breakthrough therapy designation. In addition to schizophrenia, ulotaront is also being studied for the treatment of psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease. The Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) has been used to assess the effect of Ulotaront on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In July 2023, the pharmaceutical company behind the drug announced that the drug had failed to outperform placebo in the treatment of acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia, as measured by the PANSS. == See also == List of investigational antipsychotics § Monoamine receptor modulators Ralmitaront == References ==",Ulotaront,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.258291978156194e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001511027687229216)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35047111/?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37165101/?utm_source=openai), [otsuka-us.com](https://otsuka-us.com/news/sunovion-and-otsuka-initiate-clinical-development-ulotaront-treatment-generalized-anxiety?utm_source=openai), [otsuka-us.com](https://www.otsuka-us.com/news/otsuka-and-sunovion-initiate-clinical-development-ulotaront-adjunctive-treatment-major?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=489, start_index=6, title='Ulotaront: A TAAR1 Agonist for the Treatment of Schizophrenia', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35047111/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=489, start_index=6, title='Ulotaront: review of preliminary evidence for the efficacy and safety of a TAAR1 agonist in schizophrenia - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37165101/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=489, start_index=6, title='Sunovion and Otsuka Initiate Clinical Development of Ulotaront for the Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder | Otsuka US', type='url_citation', url='https://otsuka-us.com/news/sunovion-and-otsuka-initiate-clinical-development-ulotaront-treatment-generalized-anxiety?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=489, start_index=6, title='Otsuka and Sunovion Initiate Clinical Development of Ulotaront for the Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder | Otsuka US', type='url_citation', url='https://www.otsuka-us.com/news/otsuka-and-sunovion-initiate-clinical-development-ulotaront-adjunctive-treatment-major?utm_source=openai')])"

It is structurally related to the allylamine antifungals terbinafine & naftifine. == Medical uses == Butenafine is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur, as well as athlete's foot (Tinea pedis), ringworm (Tinea corporis) and jock itch (Tinea cruris) due to Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton tonsurans. It also displays superior activity against Candida albicans than terbinafine and naftifine. Butenafine demonstrates low minimum inhibitory concentrations against Cryptococcus and Aspergillus. There is some evidence that it is effective against dermatophyte infections of the toenails, but needs to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year). === Available forms === Butenafine is typically available as a 1% topical cream. == Pharmacology == Like the allylamine antifungals (e.g terbinafine), butenafine works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol by binding to and inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme in the pathway used for creation of the sterols needed in fungal cell membranes. Lacking ergosterol, the cell membranes increase in permeability, allowing their contents to leak out. Furthermore, inhibition of squalene epoxidase leads to a toxic buildup of squalene. This double action of butenafine (increased membrane permeability and toxic buildup of squalene) makes butenafine fungicidal rather than merely fungistatic. In addition to being an antifungal, butenafine is an anti inflammatory. Because fungal skin infections are often accompanied by significant inflammation, this is a desirable property. The fact that butenafine has intrinsic anti inflammatory properties is also desirable since it is not necessary to add topical glucocorticoids, which often come with undesired side effects. == Chemistry == Butenafine hydrochloride is an odorless white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, and chloroform, yet is only slightly soluble in water. == Synthesis == Reductive amination of 1-naphthaldehyde (1) with methylamine (2) gives the intermediate secondary amine (3).

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase Ib/II study (NCT02407054), following a lead-in segment for evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics of samotolisib and enzalutamide combination, patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer with progression on prior abiraterone were randomized to receive enzalutamide (160 mg daily)/samotolisib (200 mg twice daily) or placebo. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group criteria (PCWG2). Secondary and exploratory endpoints included radiographic PFS (rPFS) and biomarkers, respectively. Log-rank tests assessed treatment group differences. Overall, 13 and 129 patients were enrolled in phase Ib and II, respectively. Dose-limiting toxicity was not reported in patients during phase Ib and mean samotolisib exposures remained in the targeted range despite a 35% decrease when administered with enzalutamide. In phase II, median PCWG2-PFS and rPFS was significantly longer in the samotolisib/enzalutamide versus placebo/enzalutamide arm (3.8 vs. 2.8 months; P = 0.003 and 10.2 vs. 5.5 months; P = 0.03), respectively.

Samotolisib/enzalutamide has tolerable side effects and significantly improved PFS in patients with mCRPC with cancer progression on abiraterone, and this may be enriched in patients with PTEN intact and no androgen receptor splice variant 7. Patients age 1-21 years with relapsed or refractory solid and CNS tumors were assigned to phase II studies of molecularly targeted therapies on the National Cancer Institute-Children's Oncology Group (NCI-COG) Pediatric Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) trial. Patients whose tumors harbored predefined genetic alterations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and lacked mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activating alterations were treated with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor samotolisib. Patients received samotolisib twice daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A rolling 6 limited dose escalation was performed as, to our knowledge, this was the first pediatric study of samotolisib. The primary end point was the objective response rate; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and the recommended phase II dose and toxicity of samotolisib in children. A total of 3.4% (41/1,206) of centrally tested patients were matched to this arm. Seventeen patients were treated. Among treated patients, the most common diagnoses included osteosarcoma (n = 6) and high-grade glioma (n = 5) harboring alterations in phosphatase and tensin homolog (n = 6),  This nationwide study was successful at identifying patients and evaluating the efficacy of molecularly targeted therapy for rare molecular subgroups of patients in a histology-agnostic fashion. Unfortunately, there was no activity of samotolisib against tumors with PI3K/mTOR pathway alterations. Prospective trials such as the NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of molecularly targeted therapies given their increasing use in clinical practice. Acute liver injury (ALI) is associated with poor survival in patients with sepsis. During sepsis, the liver is the main site of bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promotes caspase-4/5/11 activation, leading to pyroptosis, a major sepsis driver. This study aimed to identify novel drugs that can control hepatocyte caspase-4/5/11 activation during sepsis. We performed LPS-induced caspase-11 activation and pyroptosis in RAW 264.7 cells and established an LPS-induced ALI mouse model. We identified samotolisib (ST), a novel dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, by screening a library of 441 pyroptosis compounds with known targets, which dose-dependently inhibited caspase-11 activation and N-terminal fragment of gasdermin D (GSDMD-NT) generation, reducing RAW 264.7 cell pyroptosis. In mice, ST preconditioning improved survival, attenuated LPS-induced serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity, and inhibited severe liver inflammation and damage. Importantly, ST treatment activated Nedd4, which directly interacts with and mediates caspase-11 ubiquitination and degradation. This was largely abrogated by insulin-like growth factor 1. ST ameliorated LPS-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting caspase-11/GSDMD-NT pyroptosis signaling via regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR/Nedd4 signaling.

10,"('Bilastine', 'Bilaxten', 'Ilaxten', 'Bilastine [inn]', 'Bilastinum')",Medical,"Bilastine is an antihistamine medication used to treat hives (urticaria), allergic rhinitis and itchy inflamed eyes (allergic conjunctivitis) caused by an allergy. It is a second-generation antihistamine and takes effect by selectively inhibiting the histamine H1 receptor, preventing these allergic reactions. Bilastine has an effectiveness similar to cetirizine, fexofenadine, and desloratadine. Bilastine was discovered by the Spanish firm FAES Farma and received its first approval in the European Union in 2010 for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. It is also approved in Canada and Australia. As of 2023, it remained unapproved for any use in the United States, although Hikma Pharmaceuticals had agreed in 2021 to begin the FDA approval process. Evidence has shown that bilastine is effective in treating skin and eye symptoms of allergic reactions, improving patient's quality of life. Bilastine meets the treatment criteria for allergic rhinitis, as published by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative. == Medical uses == === Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis === The clinical effectiveness of bilastine in treating allergic rhinitis (AR) and urticaria has been evaluated in 10 clinical trials, involving over 4,600 patients. In each study, bilastine was compared with a placebo and another second-generation antihistamine with established efficacy (active comparator). ==== Allergic rhinitis ==== The studies on SAR were double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group involving male and female patients over 12 year of age with symptomatic disease at the beginning of the study. Nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and congestion) were assessed both before treatment and during treatment period on a daily basis. Non-nasal symptoms (itchy eye, watery eye, itchy ear, and palate) were also assessed according to a 0–3 scale, so that the Total Symptoms Score (TSS) and other related parameters could clearly reflect daily evolution of SAR in each patient and treatment group. Parameters such as quality of life and discomfort were also assessed, and in the same way the type and frequency of AE, tolerability and general safety of treatment were registered. In this SAR studies the daily oral administration during 14 days of bilastine proves to have the same efficacy as the administration of cetirizine and desloratadine. === Urticaria === A review article evaluated data from trials which detailed the efficacy of bilastine in skin models and urticaria to assess whether bilastine has an optimal profile for updosing in urticaria. The authors concluded that bilastine has an excellent profile for both efficacy and safety, although there is a need for controlled clinical trials to compare the efficacy of bilastine in a real-life updosing study in patients with urticaria, paying special attention to itch control. === Dosage and administration === Bilastine comes as a tablet taken by mouth (PO) and it is supposed to be swallowed whole with water. Bilastine should not be given with, or within 1 hour before or 2 hours after, food as it may reduce its effectiveness. Australian dosing guidelines for Allertine give a maximum dose of 20 mg (one tablet) daily as needed (PRN). Dose changes are not required for hepatic or renal impairment. While the onset of its effects vary between formulations, bilastine generally takes effect within 30–60 minutes. It should be taken only by children older than 4 years and adults, or anyone over 12 years for Allertine. == Side effects == Toxicity of bilastine investigated in preclinical toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs after oral and intravenous administration showed no mortality observed after oral administration of massive doses. After intravenous administration, LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of animals) values were 33 and 45–75 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively. No signs of toxicity were observed in any organ after bilastine massive overdosing, either orally (in mice, rats and dogs), or intravenously (in rats and dogs) during 4 weeks. No effects on fertility, no teratogenic or mutagenic effects, and no apparent carcinogenic potential were seen in the studies carried out in rats, mice and rabbits. In clinical research, bilastine has proven to be well tolerated, with an adverse events profile similar to that of placebo in healthy volunteers, patients with AR and with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Although the tolerance profile of bilastine and levocetirizine or desloratadine were very similar, bilastine was markedly better tolerated than cetirizine in a clinical assay in SAR, with fewer adverse events in the bilastine group. No anticholinergic adverse events were observed in the clinical trials with bilastine. No serious adverse events were reported during the research and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG) or laboratory tests. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and studies in special populations indicate that dose adjustment of bilastine is not necessary in elderly patients or in chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease. === Cardiac safety === The clinical cardiac safety of bilastine has been assessed in many clinical trials performed (more than 3,500 patients treated with bilastine) and in a phase I study (Thorough QT/QTc study) designed according to the ICH E14 guidance and the most demanding requirements from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).When electrocardiograms (ECG) data from all of the phase I studies are analysed, no significant alteration is appreciated in any of the parameters after administering bilastine at single doses (up to 11 times the therapeutic dose), nor at multiple doses (up to 10 times the therapeutic dose). Phase II and III studies on AR and urticaria (including the open-label extension phase of 12 months) do not reveal alterations in the ECG, nor significant prolongations of the QTc interval after administration of bilastine 20 mg. The Thorough QT/QTc study was designed to assess the effect on the QT/QTc interval, both of the therapeutic dose (20 mg) and 100 mg of bilastine, but also the coadministration of the therapeutic dose with usual doses of ketoconazol (400 mg/day), a metabolism inhibitor and a P-gP dependent transport system. It was verified that bilastine 20 and 100 mg administered during 4 days, does not induce significant changes in the QT/QTc interval duration in any of the individuals. Likewise, coadministration of bilastine 20 mg and ketoconazol 400 mg does not produce any significant prolongation of the QT/QTc interval attributable to bilastine. == Interactions == Preclinical data suggest the possibility of interactions between bilastine and drugs or food that are inhibitors or inducers of the P-glycoproteins. Coadministration of bilastine and grapefruit juice (a known P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport activator) significantly reduced bilastine systemic exposure. This interaction is due to the known effect of grapefruit flavonoids on intestinal transporter systems such as P-glycoproteins and organic anion transporting peptide (OATP). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Bilastine binds to guinea-pig cerebellar histamine H1-receptors (Ki=44 nM) and to human recombinant histamine H1-receptors (Ki=64 nM) with an affinity comparable to that of astemizole and diphenhydramine, and superior than that of cetirizine by three-fold and fexofenadine by five-fold (Corcóstegui). In different murine models, bilastine by oral route, antagonizes the effects of histamine in a dose-dependent manner, with potency similar to that of cetirizine and between 5.5 and 10 times greater than that of fexofenadine. Preclinical investigations demonstrate the affinity and specificity of bilastine for histamine H1-receptors compared with other histamine receptors subtypes and other 30 receptors from different amines. In vivo experimentation confirmed the antihistaminic and antiallergic activity, which was at least comparable to that of other second-generation H1-antihistamines such as cetirizine. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Bilastine is most quickly absorbed with the absence of food, and reaches a mean peak plasma concentration of 220 ng/mL approximately 1 h after both single and multiple dosing. Absorption is reduced by a high-fat breakfast or fruit juice, and the estimated global oral bioavailability is approximately 60%. Bilastine has linear pharmacokinetics in the 2.5–220 mg dose range in healthy adult subjects without evidence of accumulation after 14 days of treatment. ==== Distribution ==== Bilastine distribution has an apparent volume of distribution of 1.29 L/kg, and has an elimination half-life of 14.5 h and plasma protein binding of 84–90%. Bilastine is a peripherally selective drug, and this is thought to be due to limited brain uptake caused by binding to P-glycoprotein. ==== Metabolism ==== Bilastine is not significantly metabolized in humans and is largely eliminated unchanged both in urine and feces – a third and two thirds of the administered dose, respectively, according to a Phase I mass-balance study with radiolabeled bilastine. Bilastine does not readily cross the blood brain barrier and is not metabolized by the liver. Ninety six percent of the administered dose is eliminated within 24 hours. In relation to its antihistamine effect, oral doses of 20 mg daily of bilastine, measured as skin wheal-and-flare surface areas for 24 h, bilastine is capable of inhibiting 50% of the surface areas – throughout the whole administration interval. == Chemistry == Bilastine, or 2-[4-[2-[4-[1-(2-ethoxyethyl) benzimidazol-2-yl] piperidin-1-yl] ethyl] phenyl]-2-methylpropionic acid, is a molecule with a molecular weight of 463.6 daltons and a chemical structure similar to piperidinyl-benzimidazole. Bilastine can be therefore classified into the same chemical group as many of the new antihistamines on the market, although it is not structurally derived, nor is it a metabolite or enantiomer of any of them, but an original molecule designed with the intent of fulfilling all the requirements of a second-generation antihistamine. === Research === Clinical studies using different dosages were done on histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction over a 24-h period, compared with a single 10 mg oral dose of cetirizine. The results of this research indicated that bilastine was at least as efficient as cetirizine in reducing histamine-mediated effects in healthy volunteers. Notably, 20 and 50 mg of bilastine reduced the wheal and flare reaction faster than cetirizine. == References ==",Bilaxten,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.8053239627042785e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00036173476837575436)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilastine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Bilastine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilastine?utm_source=openai')])"

12,"('Dihydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'Beta-nadph', 'Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'Dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate', 'Reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, abbreviated NADP or, in older notation, TPN (triphosphopyridine nucleotide), is a cofactor used in anabolic reactions, such as the Calvin cycle and lipid and nucleic acid syntheses, which require NADPH as a reducing agent ('hydrogen source'). NADPH is the reduced form, whereas NADP+ is the oxidized form. NADP+ is used by all forms of cellular life. NADP+ is essential for life because it is needed for cellular respiration. NADP+ differs from NAD+ by the presence of an additional phosphate group on the 2' position of the ribose ring that carries the adenine moiety. This extra phosphate is added by NAD+ kinase and removed by NADP+ phosphatase. == Biosynthesis == === NADP+ === In general, NADP+ is synthesized before NADPH is. Such a reaction usually starts with NAD+ from either the de-novo or the salvage pathway, with NAD+ kinase adding the extra phosphate group. ADP-ribosyl cyclase allows for synthesis from nicotinamide in the salvage pathway, and NADP+ phosphatase can convert NADPH back to NADH to maintain a balance. Some forms of the NAD+ kinase, notably the one in mitochondria, can also accept NADH to turn it directly into NADPH. The prokaryotic pathway is less well understood, but with all the similar proteins the process should work in a similar way. === NADPH === NADPH is produced from NADP+. The major source of NADPH in animals and other non-photosynthetic organisms is the pentose phosphate pathway, by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the first step. The pentose phosphate pathway also produces pentose, another important part of NAD(P)H, from glucose. Some bacteria also use G6PDH for the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, but NADPH production remains the same. Ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase, present in all domains of life, is a major source of NADPH in photosynthetic organisms including plants and cyanobacteria. It appears in the last step of the electron chain of the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is used as reducing power for the biosynthetic reactions in the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide and help turn the carbon dioxide into glucose. It has functions in accepting electrons in other non-photosynthetic pathways as well: it is needed in the reduction of nitrate into ammonia for plant assimilation in nitrogen cycle and in the production of oils. There are several other lesser-known mechanisms of generating NADPH, all of which depend on the presence of mitochondria in eukaryotes. The key enzymes in these carbon-metabolism-related processes are NADP-linked isoforms of malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and glutamate dehydrogenase. In these reactions, NADP+ acts like NAD+ in other enzymes as an oxidizing agent. The isocitrate dehydrogenase mechanism appears to be the major source of NADPH in fat and possibly also liver cells. These processes are also found in bacteria. Bacteria can also use a NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase for the same purpose. Like the pentose phosphate pathway, these pathways are related to parts of glycolysis. Another carbon metabolism-related pathway involved in the generation of NADPH is the mitochondrial folate cycle, which uses principally serine as a source of one-carbon units to sustain nucleotide synthesis and redox homeostasis in mitochondria. Mitochondrial folate cycle has been recently suggested as the principal contributor to NADPH generation in mitochondria of cancer cells. NADPH can also be generated through pathways unrelated to carbon metabolism. The ferredoxin reductase is such an example. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase transfers the hydrogen between NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+, and is found in eukaryotic mitochondria and many bacteria. There are versions that depend on a proton gradient to work and ones that do not. Some anaerobic organisms use NADP+-linked hydrogenase, ripping a hydride from hydrogen gas to produce a proton and NADPH. Like NADH, NADPH is fluorescent. NADPH in aqueous solution excited at the nicotinamide absorbance of ~335 nm (near UV) has a fluorescence emission which peaks at 445-460 nm (violet to blue). NADP+ has no appreciable fluorescence. == Function == NADPH provides the reducing agents, usually hydrogen atoms, for biosynthetic reactions and the oxidation-reduction involved in protecting against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), allowing the regeneration of glutathione (GSH). NADPH is also used for anabolic pathways, such as cholesterol synthesis, steroid synthesis, ascorbic acid synthesis, xylitol synthesis, cytosolic fatty acid synthesis and microsomal fatty acid chain elongation. The NADPH system is also responsible for generating free radicals in immune cells by NADPH oxidase. These radicals are used to destroy pathogens in a process termed the respiratory burst. It is the source of reducing equivalents for cytochrome P450 hydroxylation of aromatic compounds, steroids, alcohols, and drugs. == Stability == NADH and NADPH are very stable in basic solutions, but NAD+ and NADP+ are degraded in basic solutions into a fluorescent product that can be used conveniently for quantitation. Conversely, NADPH and NADH are degraded by acidic solutions while NAD+/NADP+ are fairly stable to acid. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a coenzyme == Many enzymes that bind NADP share a common super-secondary structure named named the ""Rossmann fold"". The initial beta-alpha-beta (βαβ) fold is the most conserved segment of the Rossmann folds. This segment is in contact with the ADP portion of NADP. Therefore, it is also called an ""ADP-binding βαβ fold"". Adrenodoxin reductase: This enzyme is present ubiquitously in most organisms. It transfers two electrons from NADPH to FAD. In vertebrates, it serves as the first enzyme in the chain of mitochondrial P450 systems that synthesize steroid hormones. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a substrate == In 2018 and 2019, the first two reports of enzymes that catalyze the removal of the 2' phosphate of NADP(H) in eukaryotes emerged. First the cytoplasmic protein MESH1 (Q8N4P3), then the mitochondrial protein nocturnin were reported. Of note, the structures and NADPH binding of MESH1 (5VXA) and nocturnin (6NF0) are not related. == References ==",Dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -1.259079363080673e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.5048530030981055e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.006848316174000502), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.0371154530730564e-05), ('OUS', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860765486955643)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide_phosphate ', [])"
13,"('Guanethidine (sulfate)', 'Guanethidine monosulfate', 'Ismelin', 'Oktadin', 'Abapresin')",Medical,"Guanethidine is an antihypertensive drug that reduces the release of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine. Guanethidine is transported across the sympathetic nerve membrane by the same mechanism that transports norepinephrine itself (NET, uptake 1), and uptake is essential for the drug's action. Once guanethidine has entered the nerve, it is concentrated in transmitter vesicles, where it replaces norepinephrine. It may also inhibit the release of granules by decreasing norepinephrine. == Medical uses == Guanethidine was once a mainstay for hypertension resistant to other agents, and was often used safely during pregnancy, but it is no longer used in the US due to lack of availability. It is still licensed in some countries, e.g., UK, for the rapid control of blood pressure in a hypertensive emergency. Intravenous nerve block (Bier block) using guanethidine has been used to treat chronic pain caused by complex regional pain syndrome. == Side effects == Side effects include postural and exercise hypotension, sexual dysfunction (delayed or retrograde ejaculation), and diarrhea. == Pharmacology == Guanethidine is transported by uptake 1 into the presynaptic terminal transported by norepinephrine transporter (NET). (In this it competes with norepinephrine so can potentiate exogenously applied norepinephrine.) It becomes concentrated in norepinephrine transmitter vesicles, replacing norepinephrine in these vesicles. This leads to a gradual depletion of norepinephrine stores in the nerve endings. Once inside the terminal it blocks the release of norepinephrine in response to arrival of an action potential.

15,"('Ivabradine (hydrochloride)', 'Ivabradine', 'Corlanor', 'Corlentor', 'S 16257')",Medical,"Ivabradine, sold under the brand name Procoralan among others, is a medication, which is a pacemaker current (If) inhibitor, used for the symptomatic management of heart-related chest pain and heart failure. Patients who qualify for use of ivabradine for congestive heart failure are patients who have symptomatic heart failure, with reduced ejection fraction, and heart rate at least 70 bpm, and the condition not able to be fully managed by beta blockers. Ivabradine acts by allowing negative chronotropy in the sinoatrial structure, thus reducing the heart rate via specific inhibition of the pacemaker current. It operates by a mechanism different from that of beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, which are two commonly prescribed antianginal classes of cardiac drugs. Ivabradine has no apparent inotropic properties and may be a cardiotonic agent. == Medical uses == It is used for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in patients with normal sinus rhythm who cannot take beta blockers. It is also being used off-label in the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST). Ivabradine stands as a pharmacological option for controlling HR and rhythm without associated side effects in postoperative CABG patients with IST. === Chest pain === Ivabradine is as effective as the beta blocker atenolol and comparable with amlodipine in the management of chronic stable angina, as demonstrated by improvements in total exercise duration in non-inferiority trials, hence it can be an alternative therapy for those who cannot tolerate conventional therapies. In people not sufficiently managed with beta blockers for their angina, adding ivabradine can further reduce heart rate and improve total exercise duration. === Heart failure === It is used in combination with beta blockers in people with heart failure with LVEF lower than 35 percent inadequately controlled by beta blockers alone and whose heart rate exceeds 70 beats per minute. In people not sufficiently managed with beta blockers for their heart failure adding ivabradine decreases the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. === Tachycardia === The clinical use of ivabradine is predicated on its mechanism of action on sinoatrial nodal tissue where it selectively inhibits the funny current (If) and results in a decrease in heart rate. Ivabradine’s most frequent application in electrophysiology is for the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Its use for inappropriate sinus tachycardia is not a European Medicines Agency or Food and Drug Administration approved indication for ivabradine. It has been used experimentally for the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in patients with long COVID. It was used for POTS prior to this too. Many cardiologists have found success with this in their POTS patients. == Contraindications == Ivabradine is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome. It should also not be used concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, including azole antifungals (such as ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics, nefazodone and the antiretroviral drugs nelfinavir and ritonavir. Use of ivabradine with verapamil or diltiazem is contraindicated. == Adverse effects == Overall, 14.5% of patients taking ivabradine experience luminous phenomena (by patients described as sensations of enhanced brightness in a fully maintained visual field). This is probably due to blockage of Ih ion channels in the retina, which are very similar to cardiac If. These symptoms are mild, transient, and fully reversible. In clinical studies, about 1% of all patients had to discontinue the drug because of these sensations, which occurred on average 40 days after the drug was started. In a large clinical trial, bradycardia (unusually slow heart rate) occurred in 2% and 5% of patients taking ivabradine at doses of 7.5 and 10 mg respectively (compared to 4.3% in those taking atenolol). Headaches were reported in 2.6 to 4.8 percent of cases. Other common adverse drug reactions (1–10% of patients) include first-degree AV block, ventricular extrasystoles, dizziness and/or blurred vision. == Mechanism of action == Ivabradine acts on the If (f is for ""funny"", so called because it had unusual properties compared with other current systems known at the time of its discovery) ion current, which is highly expressed in the sinoatrial node. If is a mixed Na+–K+ inward current activated by hyperpolarization and modulated by the autonomic nervous system. It is one of the most important ionic currents for regulating pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial (SA) node. Ivabradine selectively inhibits the pacemaker If current in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking this channel reduces cardiac pacemaker activity, selectively slowing the heart rate and allowing more time for blood to flow to the myocardium. By inhibiting the If channel, ivabradine reduces the heart rate and workload on the heart. This is relevant in the usage of the medication to treat angina as well as congestive heart failure. This is in contrast to other commonly used rate-reducing medications, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which not only reduce heart rate, but also the cardiac contractility. Given the selective decrease in rate without loss of contractility, ivabradine may prove efficacious for treatment of congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Ivabradine binds to HCN4 receptors (potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4), utilizing Y506, F509 and I510 residues. == Clinical trials == === Coronary artery disease === The BEAUTIFUL study randomised over 10917 patients having stable coronary artery disease and left ventricle dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%). Ivabradine did not show a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, admission to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, and admission to hospital for new onset or worsening heart failure. However, in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a baseline heart rate of more than 70 bpm, ivabradine significantly reduced the following secondary endpoints: Coronary events by 22% (P=0.023) Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 36% (P=0.001) Coronary revascularization by 30% (P=0.016). These results were seen in combination therapy with beta blockers, and were found to be safe and effective in improving coronary artery disease outcomes in patients with heart rates of 70 bpm or more. The SIGNIFY trial randomised 19102 patients with stable coronary artery disease and an elevated heart rate greater than 70 beats per minute were assigned to an intervention of ivabradine or placebo in addition to standard therapy. Ivabradine did not significantly improve the secondary outcomes in patient groups, however did demonstrate a reduction in heart rate. When compared to the SHIFT study, a reduction in cardiovascular death or hospital admission was also demonstrated and hence should be considered when additional therapy is in question. === Chronic heart failure === In the SHIFT study, ivabradine significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of hospitalization for worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death by 18% (P<0.0001) compared with placebo on top of optimal therapy. These benefits were observed after 3 months of treatment. SHIFT also showed that administration of ivabradine to heart failure patients significantly reduced the risk of death from heart failure by 26% (P=0.014) and hospitalization for heart failure by 26% (P<0.0001). The improvements in outcomes were observed throughout all prespecified subgroups: female and male, with or without beta-blockers at randomization, patients below and over 65 years of age, with heart failure of ischemic or non-ischemic etiology, NYHA class II or class III, IV, with or without diabetes, and with or without hypertension. A 2020 Cochrane review found no difference in cardiovascular mortality and serious adverse events between long-term treatment with ivabradine and placebo/usual care/no treatment in participants with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. A note of caution must be emphasised. Ivabradine, though indicated for chronic heart failure in patients who are clinically stable, is not indicated in acute heart failure where the enhanced heart rate represents cardiac reserve. Indiscriminate use of Ivabradine could destabilise these patients. == Society and culture == === Approval === Ivabradine was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2005, and by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2015. === Alleged conflict of interest === According to a documentary and article of the Danish media channel TV2 in September 2024, a former president of the European Society of Cardiology during 2006-2008, professor Kim Fox, had a conflict of interest in relation to clinical trials of ivabradine and his recommendation of ivabradine based on the trials. According to TV2, Fox and his partner founded a company, Heart Research Ltd., which performed clinical trials and received payments from the pharmaceutical industry, allowing them to extract a total profit of 500 million DKK (67 million euro) during 2003-2015, mostly from a cooperation with the French pharmaceutical company Servier. According to TV2's research of financial statements of the company, in the period of 2004-2006, the couple received a salary of over 20 million DKK (2.7 million euro) from their company, while during the same period, Kim Fox was chairman of the taskforce recommending ivabradine, and as president of the European Society of Cardiology, he also had the role of presenting the research results and recommending ivabradin as a ""gold standard"" treatment at a European cardiological conference in 2008. Karsten Juhl Jørgensen, professor of medicine and conflict of interests expert at Odense University and the Nordic Cochrane Centre, commented that the conflict of interest was ""probably the largest he had seen"". Danish chief physician Niels Holmark Andersen commented that Fox's conflict of interest was of an ""oligarchal magnitude"" and ""the mother of all conflicts of interests"" because Fox was involved in all parts of the process, that the clinical results did not sustain claims of the superiority of the medication which has serious adverse effect, and further that Servier had marketed ivabradine ""aggressively"" and offered physicians exclusive trips to castles in France to promote the medication during the decade of 2000-2010. === Names === It is marketed by Amgen under the brand name Corlanor in the United States, and by Servier in the rest of the world under the brand names Procoralan (worldwide), Coralan (in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and some other countries), Corlentor (in Armenia, Spain, Italy and Romania), Lancora (in Canada) and Coraxan (in Russia and Serbia).

Another treatment option (typically used after 16w gestation) are a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (given with leucovorin). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The antibiotic action involves inhibition of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell during translocation. Resistance to spiramycin can develop by several mechanisms and its prevalence is to a considerable extent proportional to the frequency of prescription in a given area. The antibacterial spectrum comprises Gram-positive cocci and rods, Gram-negative cocci and also Legionellae, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, some types of spirochetes, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium species. Enterobacteria, pseudomonads and pathogenic moulds are resistant. Its action is mainly bacteriostatic, on highly sensitive strains it exerts a bactericide action. As compared with erythromycin, it is in vitro weight for weight 5 to 20 less effective, an equipotential therapeutic dose is, however, only double. This difference between the effectiveness in vitro and in vivo is explained above all by the great affinity of spiramycin to tissues where it achieves concentrations many times higher than serum levels. An important part is played also by the slow release of the antibiotic from the tissue compartment, the marked action on microbes in sub-inhibition concentrations and the relatively long persisting post-antibiotic effect.

When it's radiolabeled with technetium-99m, it's used in many types of diagnostic testing. A full course of Succimer lasts for 19 days of oral administration. A second course should be given when more than two weeks pass after the first course. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and low blood neutrophil levels. Liver problems and allergic reactions may also occur with use. Whether use during pregnancy is safe for the baby is unclear. Dimercaptosuccinic acid is in the chelating agent family of medications. It works by binding with lead and a number of other heavy metals, allowing them to leave the body in the urine. Succimer has been used medically since the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, no generic version was available as of 2015. == Medical uses == Succimer is indicated for the treatment of lead poisoning in children with blood level measured above 45 μg/dL. The use of dimercaptosuccinic acid is not approved for prevention of lead poisoning in anticipation of exposure in known lead-contaminated environments. Dimercaptosuccinic acid can cross the blood–brain barrier of mice, but it is not known if this is also the case in humans. Even if dimercaptosuccinic acid cannot reverse the damages done to the central nervous system, it might prevent further deterioration. Succimer facilitates urinary excretion of lead, and with sufficiently aggressive treatment, can reduce lead content in the brain. It also increases urinary excretion of copper and zinc. Dimercaptosuccinic acid improved cognitive function in rats that had been exposed to lead, but reduced cognitive function in rats that had not been exposed to lead. == Chemistry == Succimer is an isomer of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid. 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid is the organosulfur compound with the formula HO2CCH(SH)CH(SH)CO2H. This colorless solid contains two carboxylic acid and two thiol groups, the latter being responsible for its mildly unpleasant odour. It occurs in two diastereomers, meso and the chiral dl forms. The 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid molecule has two stereocentres (two asymmetric carbon atoms), and can exist as three different stereoisomers. The 2S,3S and 2R,3R isomers are a pair of enantiomers, whereas the 2R,3S isomer (succimer) is a meso compound and thus optically inactive. == Preparation and reactivity == Dimercaptosuccinic acid may be prepared by reacting acetylenedicarboxylic acid with sodium thiosulfate or thioacetic acid followed by hydrolysis. The dimethyl ester is also known. Meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid binds to ""soft"" heavy metals such as Hg2+ and Pb2+, mobilizing these ions for excretion. It binds to metal cations through the thiol groups, which ionize upon complexation. == History == Dimercaptosuccinic acid was first synthesized by V. L. Nirenburg in the Urals Polytechnic Institute, commissioned by one of the electrical enterprises of Sverdlovsk, Russia, which consumed many tons of mercury and was looking for a medicine to prevent poisoning of personnel. In 1957, Chinese scientists found that dimercaptosuccinic acid can effectively treat antimony poisoning due to overdose of tartar emetic. Pronounced protective effect in animal poisoning with arsenic and mercury was first shown by I. E. Okonishnikova in 1962. In 1984, the now-defunct Bock Pharmaceutical Company requested the FDA grant approval for orphan drug status under the brand name Chemet and the FDA approved of this in 1991. It provided exclusivity until 1998 which was conveyed to the successor Sanofi in 1996. == References == == Further reading ==",Dimercaptosuccinic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.770858453819528e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01417978573590517)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/9354,https://healthencyclopedia.org/dimercaptosuccinic-acid/,https://www.glpbio.com/succimer-dimercaptosuccinic-acid.html ', [])"
20,"('Sacubitril/valsartan', 'Valsartan', 'Diovan', 'Tareg', 'Provas')",Medical,"Valsartan, sold under the brand name Diovan among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It belongs to a class of medications referred to as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness, high blood potassium, diarrhea, and joint pain. Other serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Valsartan was patented in 1990, and came into medical use in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 117th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valsartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to reduce death for people with left ventricular dysfunction after having a heart attack. === High blood pressure === Valsartan (and other ARBs) are an appropriate initial treatment option for most people with high blood pressure and no other coexisting conditions, as are ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers. If patients have coexisting diabetes or kidney disease, ARBs or ACE inhibitors may be considered over other classes of blood pressure medicines. === Heart failure === Valsartan has reduced rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalisations when used alone or in combination with beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure. Importantly, the combination of valsartan and ACE inhibitors has not shown morbidity or mortality benefits but rather increases mortality risk when added to combination beta blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy, and increases the risk of adverse events like hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal failure. As shown in the PARADIGM-HF study, valsartan combined with sacubitril for the treatment of heart failure, significantly reduced all cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisations due to heart failure. === Diabetic kidney disease === In people with type 2 diabetes, antihypertensive therapy with valsartan decreases the rate of progression of albuminuria (albumin in urine), promotes regression to normoalbuminuria and may reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. == Contraindications == The packaging for valsartan includes a warning stating the drug should not be used with the renin inhibitor aliskiren in people with diabetes. It also states the safety of the drug in severe renal impairment has not been established. Valsartan includes a black box warning for fetal toxicity. Discontinuation of these agents is recommended immediately after detection of pregnancy and an alternative medication should be started. Breastfeeding is not recommended. == Side effects == Side effects depend on the reason the medication is being used. === Heart failure === Adverse effects are based on a comparison versus placebo in people with heart failure. Most common side effects include dizziness (17% vs 9% ), low blood pressure (7% vs 2%), and diarrhea (5% vs 4%). Less common side effects include joint pain, fatigue, and back pain (all 3% vs 2%). === Hypertension === Clinical trials for valsartan treatment for hypertension versus placebo demonstrate side effects like viral infection (3% vs 2%), fatigue (2% vs 1%) and abdominal pain (2% vs 1%). Minor side effects that occurred at >1% but were similar to rates from the placebo group include: headache dizziness upper respiratory infection cough diarrhea rhinitis/sinusitis nausea pharyngitis edema arthralgia === Kidney failure === People treated with ARBs including valsartan or diuretics are susceptible to conditions of developing low renal blood flow such as abnormal narrowing of blood vessels in the kidney, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion whose renal function is in part dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system like efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction done by angiotensin II are at high risk of deterioration of renal function comprising acute kidney failure, oliguria, worsening azotemia or heightened serum creatinine. When blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidney activates a series of responses that triggers angiotensin release to constrict blood vessels and facilitate blood flow in the kidney. So long as the nephron function degradation is progressive or reaches clinically significant levels, withholding or discontinuing valsartan is warranted. == Interactions == The US prescribing information lists the following drug interactions for valsartan: Other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the risks of low blood pressure, kidney problems, and hyperkalemia. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. NSAIDs may increase the risk of kidney problems and may interfere with blood pressure-lowering effects. Valsartan may increase the concentration of lithium. Valsartan and other angiotensin-related blood pressure medications may interact with the antibiotics co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin to increase risk of sudden death due to cardiac arrest. === Food interaction === With the tablet, food decreases the valsartan tablet taker's exposure to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, evidenced by AUC change. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Valsartan blocks the actions of angiotensin II, which include constricting blood vessels and activating aldosterone, to reduce blood pressure. The drug binds to angiotensin type I receptors (AT1), working as an antagonist. This mechanism of action is different than that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, which block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As valsartan acts at the receptor, it can provide more complete angiotensin II antagonism since angiotensin II is generated by other enzymes as well as ACE. Also, valsartan does not affect the metabolism of bradykinin like ACE inhibitors do. === Pharmacodynamics === === Pharmacokinetics === The peak concentration of valsartan in plasma occurs 2 to 4 hours after dosing. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan are observed to be approximately linearly dose-dependent over therapeutic dosing range. Owing to its relatively short elimination half life attribution, valsartan concentration in plasma does not accumulate in response to repeated dosing. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2010, valsartan (trade name Diovan) achieved annual sales of $2.052 billion in the United States and $6.053 billion worldwide. The patents for valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide expired in September 2012. === Combinations === Versions are available as the combinations valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/nebivolol, and valsartan/sacubitril. Valsartan is combined with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (or both) into single-pill formulations for treating hypertension with multiple drugs. Valsartan is also available as the combination valsartan/sacubitril. It is used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. === Recalls === In July 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recalled certain batches of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide film-coated tablets distributed in 22 countries in the European Union. Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. (ZHP) in Linhai, China manufactured the bulk ingredient contaminated by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a carcinogen. The active pharmaceutical ingredient was subsequently imported by a number of generic drugmakers, including Novartis, and marketed in Europe and Asia under their subsidiary Sandoz labeling, and in the UK by Dexcel Pharma Ltd and Accord Healthcare. Valsartan was recalled in Canada. Authorities believe the degree of contamination is negligible. In July 2018, The National Agency of Drug and Food Control (NA-DFC or Badan POM Indonesia) announced voluntary recalls for two products containing valsartan produced by Actavis Indonesia and Dipa Pharmalab Intersains. In July 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced voluntary recalls of certain supplies of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in the US distributed by Solco Healthcare LLC, Major Pharmaceuticals, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Hong Kong's Department of Health initiated a similar recall. In August 2018, the FDA published two lengthy, updated lists, classifying hundreds of specific US products containing valsartan into those included versus excluded from the recall. A week later, the FDA cited two more drugmakers, Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceuticals of China and Hetero Labs Limited of India, as additional sources of the contaminated valsartan ingredient. In September 2018, the FDA announced that retesting of all valsartan supplies had found a second carcinogenic impurity, N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), in the recalled products made by ZHP in China and marketed in the US under the Torrent Pharmaceuticals (India) brand. According to a 2018 Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies' records, more than 50 companies around the world have recalled valsartan mono-preparations or combination products manufactured from the tainted valsartan ingredient. The contamination has likely been present since 2012 when the manufacturing process was changed and approved by EDQM and FDA authorities. Based on inspections in late 2018, both agencies have suspended the Chinese and Indian manufacturers' certificates of suitability for the supply of valsartan in the EU and the US. In 2019, many more preparations of valsartan and its combinations were recalled due to the presence of the contaminant NDMA. In August 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. === Shortages === Since July 2018, numerous recalls of losartan, valsartan and irbesartan drug products have caused marked shortages of these life saving medications in North America and Europe, particularly for valsartan. In March 2019, the FDA approved an additional generic version of valsartan to address the issue. According to the agency, the shortage of valsartan was resolved in April 2020, but the availability of the generic form remained unstable into July 2020. Pharmacies in the European Union were notified that the supply of the drug, particularly for higher dosage forms, would remain unstable well into December 2020. == Research == In people with impaired glucose tolerance, valsartan may decrease the incidence of developing diabetes mellitus type 2. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (less than 1 percent per year) and diet, exercise or other drugs, may be more protective. In the same study, no reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events (including death) was shown. In one study of people without diabetes, valsartan reduced the risk of developing diabetes mellitus over amlodipine, mainly for those with hypertension. A prospective study demonstrated a reduction in the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. == References ==",Diovan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0371154530730564e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0001267114421352744)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/diovan.html ', [])"
21,"('Atuveciclib', 'Atuveciclib [inn]')",Medical," This study was designed to analyse the effects of the novel, orally bioavailable CDK9-inhibitor Atuveciclib (BAY 1143572) in combination with tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cancer cells. To assess the effect of combinatorial use of atuveciclib and TRAIL on pancreatic cancer cells, we used an MTT assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis. Atuveciclib combined with TRAIL significantly reduced the viability of pancreatic cancer cells and their colony formation potential by inducing apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Atuveciclib sensitised PDAC cells to TRAIL-induced cell death through the concomitant suppression of cFlip and Mcl-1. A gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cell-line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines were also suppressed by this combinatorial approach. This study provides the basis for further preclinical and clinical evaluation of combined treatment with atuveciclib and TRAIL. Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by the deregulated secretion of inflammatory factors in multiple organs. The aberrant activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is vital for the pathology of psoriasis, leading to the accumulation of inflammatory factors and the progression of skin damage. In this study, we explored the effect of CDK9 inhibition on attenuating the secretion of inflammatory factors and alleviating skin damage in psoriasis models both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that Atuveciclib, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, significantly relieved skin lesions in Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mice models by lowering the expression of CDK9 and p-RNA Pol II  Selective inhibition of exclusively transcription-regulating PTEFb/CDK9 is a promising new approach in cancer therapy. Starting from lead compound BAY-958, lead optimization efforts strictly focusing on kinase selectivity, physicochemical and DMPK properties finally led to the identification of the orally available clinical candidate atuveciclib (BAY 1143572). Structurally characterized by an unusual benzyl sulfoximine group, BAY 1143572 exhibited the best overall profile in vitro and in vivo, including high efficacy and good tolerability in xenograft models in mice and rats. BAY 1143572 is the first potent and highly selective PTEFb/CDK9 inhibitor to enter clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.",Atuveciclib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.842555426876061e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00037555795279331505), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008626103401184082)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28961375/,https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cmdc.201700447 ', [])"
22,"('Binimetinib', 'Mektovi', 'Binimetinib (mek-162)', 'Binimetinib (mek162, arry-162, arry-438162)', 'Binimetinib [usan:inn]')",Medical,"Binimetinib, sold under the brand name Mektovi, is an anti-cancer medication used to treat various cancers. Binimetinib is a selective inhibitor of MEK, a central kinase in the tumor-promoting MAPK pathway. Inappropriate activation of the pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers. In June 2018 it was approved by the FDA in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma. In October 2023, it was approved by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation in combination with encorafenib. It was developed by Array Biopharma. == Mechanism of action == Binimetinib is an orally available inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), or more specifically, a MAP2K inhibitor. MEK is part of the RAS pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival. MEK is upregulated in many forms of cancer. Binimetinib, uncompetitive with ATP, binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2 kinase, which has been shown to regulate several key cellular activities including proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types. Inhibition of MEK1/2 prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, which may result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling. As demonstrated in preclinical studies, this may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. == Development == In 2015, it was in phase III clinical trials for ovarian cancer, BRAF mutant melanoma, and NRAS Q61 mutant melanoma. In December 2015, the company announced that the mutant-NRAS melanoma trial was successful. In the trial, those receiving binimetinib had a median progression-free survival of 2.8 months versus 1.5 months for those on the standard dacarbazine treatment. NDA submitted Jun 2016, and the FDA should decide by 30 June 2017. In April 2016, it was reported that the phase III trial for low-grade ovarian cancer was terminated due to lack of efficacy. In 2017, the FDA informed Array Biopharma that the phase III trial data was not sufficient and the New Drug Application was withdrawn. In June 2018, it was approved for the treatment of certain melanomas by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with encorafenib. The FDA approved binimetinib based primarily on evidence from one clinical trial (NCT01909453) of 383 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma that was advanced or could not be removed by surgery. The trial was conducted at 162 sites in Europe, North America, and various countries around the world. In October 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved encorafenib with binimetinib for adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. == References == == External links ==",Mektovi,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.811964830267243e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005656072753481567)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/mektovi,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-175531/mektovi-oral/details,https://hemonc.org/wiki/Binimetinib_%28Mektovi%29 ', [])"
23,"('Donepezil', 'Aricept', 'Donepezilo', '(s)-e2020 (free base)', 'Donepezil [inn:ban]')",Medical,"Donepezil, sold under the brand name Aricept among others, is a medication used to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type. It appears to result in a small benefit in mental function and ability to function. Use, however, has not been shown to change the progression of the disease. Treatment should be stopped if no benefit is seen. It is taken by mouth or via a transdermal patch. Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and structurally unrelated to other anticholinesterase agents. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, aggression, diarrhea, feeling tired, and muscle cramps. Serious side effects may include abnormal heart rhythms, urinary incontinence, and seizures. Donepezil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 146th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Alzheimer's disease === There is no evidence that donepezil or other similar agents alter the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease. Six-to-twelve-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition or behavior. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends donepezil as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved donepezil for treatment of mild, moderate and severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease. === Other === Lewy body dementia: Some studies have shown benefits of donepezil for the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Lewy body dementia. Traumatic brain injury: Some research suggests an improvement in memory dysfunction in patients with traumatic brain injury with donepezil use. Vascular dementia: Studies have shown that donepezil may improve cognition in patients with vascular dementia but not overall global functioning. Dementia associated with Parkinson disease: Some evidence suggests that donepezil can improve cognition, executive function, and global status in Parkinson disease dementia. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other side effects included difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps and loss of appetite. Most side effects were observed in patients taking the 23 mg dose compared to 10 mg or lower doses. Side effects are mild and transient in most patients, lasting up to three weeks and usually improved even with continued use. Donepezil, like other cholinesterase inhibitors, can cause nightmares due to enhanced activation of the visual association cortex during REM sleep. Dosing donepezil in the morning can reduce the frequency of nightmares. === Precautions === Donepezil should be used with caution in people with heart disease, cardiac conduction disturbances, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, severe cardiac arrhythmia and sick sinus syndrome. People with peptic ulcer disease or taking NSAIDs should use with caution because increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was noted. Slow heart beat and fainting in people with heart problems were also seen. These symptoms may appear more frequent when initiating treatment or increasing the donepezil dose. Although occurrence of seizures is rare, people who have a predisposition to seizures should be treated with caution. If daily donepezil has suspended for 7 days or less, restarting at the same dose is recommended, while if the suspension lasts longer than 7 days, retitrate from 5 mg daily is suggested. == Mechanism of action == Donepezil binds and reversibly inhibits enzymes called cholinesterases, especially acetylcholinesterase, thus inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine. This increases acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses. The precise mechanism of action of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. Certainly, Alzheimer's disease involves a substantial loss of the elements of the cholinergic system and it is generally accepted that the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are related to this cholinergic deficit, particularly in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain. In addition to its actions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil has been found to act as a potent agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 14.6 nM), and has been shown to produce specific antiamnestic effects in animals mainly via this action. Some noncholinergic mechanisms have also been proposed. Donepezil upregulates the nicotinic receptors in the cortical neurons, adding to neuroprotective activity. It inhibits voltage-activated sodium currents reversibly and delays rectifier potassium currents and fast transient potassium currents, although this action is unlikely to contribute to clinical effects. == Synergy == Donepezil was claimed to act synergistically with an agent called FK962 [283167-06-6] & FK960 [133920-70-4]. {potential activation of somatostatinergic neurotransmission} However, the development was discontinued after Phase II ""since the data reviewed did not indicate clear efficacy of the compound for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."" == Stereochemistry == Donepezil medications are racemates. == History == Research leading to the development of donepezil began in 1983, at Eisai, and in 1996, Eisai received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donepezil under the brand Aricept, which it co-marketed with Pfizer. The team at Eisai was led by Hachiro Sugimoto. As of 2011, Aricept was the world's best-selling Alzheimer's disease treatment. The first generic donepezil became available in November 2010, with the US FDA approval of a formulation prepared by Ranbaxy Labs. == Research == Donepezil has been tested in other cognitive disorders, including Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia, but it is not currently approved for these indications. Donepezil has also been found to improve sleep apnea in people with Alzheimer's. It also improves gait in people with mild Alzheimer's. Donepezil has also been studied in people with mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, post-coronary artery bypass surgery cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with multiple sclerosis, CADASIL syndrome, and Down syndrome. A three-year National Institutes of Health trial in people with mild cognitive impairment reported donepezil was superior to placebo in delaying rate of progression to dementia during the initial 18 months of the study, but this was not sustained at 36 months. In a secondary analysis, a subgroup of individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype showed sustained benefits with donepezil throughout the study. At this time, though, donepezil is not indicated for prevention of dementia. === Cognitive enhancement === Donepezil has shown mixed results for improving cognitive abilities in healthy individuals. A 2009 double-blind, placebo controlled study (n=24) investigating donepezil's effects across a variety of memory tests in reported an improvement in spatial memory accuracy both before (90 minutes after dosing) and at theoretical Tmax (210 minutes after dosing). However, a later 2011 paper featuring two study double-blind, placebo controlled experiments evaluating donepezil's effects in older but healthy subjects reported impairment after acute (5 hours after dose) and chronic (4 weeks) donepezil administration. === ADHD === The addition of donepezil with existing ADHD medications has shown mixed results. In those with Tourette syndrome and ADHD, donepezil may reduce tics while it had no effect on ADHD's symptoms. === Pervasive developmental disorder === Donepezil, along with other cholinesterase inhibitors, is suggested as having potential for trouble behaviors: irritability, hyperactivity, and difficulty in social communication which are typically seen in those with pervasive developmental disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and autism-spectrum disorder. === Anorexia nervosa === Donepezil is furthermore suggested as a feasible therapeutic option for anorexia nervosa. Emerging literature reports that a subset of patients suffering from restrictive anorexia nervosa have enhanced habit formation compared with healthy controls. Habit formation is modulated by striatal cholinergic interneurons. Based on the physiopathology of anorexia nervosa, namely in terms of cholinergic deficiencies, the effects of donepezil and other drugs that act as cholinesterase inhibitors could thus be effective in the treatment of the disorder. However, no trial to date supports this hypothesis. == References == == Further reading == Brenner GD, Brenner GM (2000). Pharmacology. Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders. ISBN 978-0-7216-7757-6.

24,"('(s)-equol', 'Equol', '(s)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chroman-7-ol', 'S-equol', '(s)-3,4-dihydro-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2h-1-benzopyran-7-ol')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Equol (4',7-isoflavandiol) is an isoflavandiol estrogen metabolized from daidzein, a type of isoflavone found in soybeans and other plant sources, by bacterial flora in the intestines. While endogenous estrogenic hormones such as estradiol are steroids, equol is a nonsteroidal estrogen. Only about 30–50% of people have intestinal bacteria that make equol. == History == (S)-Equol was first isolated from horse urine in 1932, and the name was suggested by this equine connection. Since then, equol has been found in the urine or plasma of many other animal species, although these animals have significant differences in their ability to metabolize daidzein into equol. In 1980, scientists reported the discovery of equol in humans. The ability of (S)-equol to play a role in the treatment of estrogen- or androgen-mediated diseases or disorders was first proposed in 1984. == Chemical structure == Equol is a compound that can exist in two mirror-image forms known as enantiomers: (S)-equol and (R)-equol. (S)-equol is produced in humans and animals with the ability to metabolize the soy isoflavone daidzein, while (R)-equol can be chemically synthesized. The molecular and physical structure of (S)-equol is similar to that of the hormone estradiol. (S)-Equol preferentially binds estrogen receptor beta. == Pharmacology == === Estrogen receptor binding === (S)-equol is a nonsteroidal, selective agonist of ERβ (Ki = 16 nM) with 13-fold selectivity for ERβ over ERα. Relative to (S)-equol, (R)-equol is less potent and binds to ERα (Ki = 50 nM) with 3.5-fold selectivity over ERβ. (S)-Equol has about 2% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and 20% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). The preferential binding of (S)-equol to ERβ vs. ERα and in comparison to that of estradiol suggests the molecule may share some of the characteristics of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Equol has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30). === Pharmacokinetics === (S)-Equol is a very stable molecule that essentially remains unchanged when digested, and this lack of further metabolism explains its very quick absorption and high bioavailability. When (S)-equol is consumed, it is rapidly absorbed and achieves a Tmax (rate of peak plasma concentration) in two to three hours. In comparison, the Tmax of daidzein is 4 to 10 hours because daidzein exists in glycoside (with a glucose side chain) form. The body must convert daidzein to its aglycone form (without the glucose side chain) via removal of the sugar side chain during digestion before it can use daidzein. If consumed directly in aglycone form, daidzein has a Tmax of one to three hours. The percent fractional elimination of (S)-equol in urine after oral administration is high and in some adults can reach close to 100 percent. The percent fractional elimination of daidzein is much lower at 30 to 40 percent. == Production in humans == To produce (S)-equol after soy consumption, humans must have certain strains of bacteria living within their intestines. Twenty-one different strains of intestinal bacteria cultured from humans have been shown to have the ability to transform daidzein into (S)-equol or a related intermediate compound. Several studies indicate that only 25 to 30 percent of the adult populations of Western countries produce (S)-equol after eating soy foods containing isoflavones, while 50 to 60 percent of adults from Japan, Korea, and China are equol-producers. Vegetarians have also been reported to be more capable of transforming daidzein into (S)-equol. Seaweed and dairy consumption can enhance the production of equol. The ability of a person to produce (S)-equol is determined by testing people who have not taken any antibiotics for at least a month. For this standardized test, the individual drinks two 240 milliliter glasses of soy milk or eats a soy food equivalent for three days. The (S)-equol concentration in each test subject's urine is determined on day four. === Equol producing bacteria === While many more bacteria are involved in the related intermediate process of equol production, such as conversion of daidzin to daidzein, or genistein to 5-Hydroxy-equol, the bacteria that achieve the complete conversion of daidzein to (S)-equol, include: Adlercreutzia equolifaciens Asaccharobacter celatus AHU1763 Bacteroides ovatus Bifidobacterium Bifidobacterium animalis Coriobacteriaceae sp MT1B9 Eggerthella sp YY7918 Enterococcus faecium Eubacterium sp D1 and D2 Finegoldia magna Lactobacillus mucosae Lactobacillus sp Niu-O16 Lactococcus garvieae (Lc 20-92) Ruminococcus productus Slackia sp HE8 Slackia equolifaciens (Strain DZE) Streptococcus intermedius Veillonella sp Conversion by Bifidobacterium has only been reported once by Tsangalis et al. in 2002 and not reproduced since.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Mixed cultures such as Lactobacillus sp. Niu-O16 and Eggerthella sp. Julong 732 can also produce (S)-equol.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Some equol producing bacteria, as implied by their nomenclature, are Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Slackia equolifaciens and Slackia isoflavoniconvertens. == Health effects == === Skin health === The topical effects of equol as an anti-aging substance have been shown in different studies. The effects result from both molecular and structural changes to the skin. Equol can, for instance, lead to an increase in telomere length. As an antioxidant, equol can decrease the aging process by reducing damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). It may also act as a protective anti-photoaging substance by inhibiting acute UVA- induced lipid peroxidation. In addition, equol may have a positive impact on epigenetic regulation. Equol's phytoestrogenic properties may also affect skin health. Reduction of dark circles and eye wrinkles after treatment with equol has been reported. Equol may also protect skin from damage by pollution due to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Each of the enantiomers and the racemic mixture of both enantiomers have different characteristics, bioavailabilities and molecular effects. According to one study, (RS)-equol provided the greatest overall improvement in skin health, especially when applied topically. === Hormone-related health effects === Beyond topical effects, medicinal equol has been shown to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and muscle and joint pain. (RS)-equol was also reported to reduce symptoms associated with menopausal vaginal atrophy, such as vaginal itching, vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse and cause positive shifts in the vaginal bacterial population, cell composition, and pH. According to animal studies, it has anti-androgenic effects and may lead to inhibited 5-alpha reductase as well as lowered dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. == See also == Daidzein Estrogen receptor Genistein Liquiritigenin Menerba Prinaberel WAY-200070 Diarylpropionitrile == References ==",S-equol,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.623033881187439), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' PERSONAL', -0.5251848101615906), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.048682522028684616), (' MED', -0.07221764326095581), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('EN', -0.7040520310401917), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.0007918321643956006), ('ĠFOOD', -0.4764033555984497), (',', -0.0380597747862339), ('ĠMED', -0.10402414202690125), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.20144237577915192), ('ĠPERSON', -0.00014876213390380144), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.597391747054644e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00017355366435367614)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.53765869140625), ('OD', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
25,"('(¬±)-equol', 'Equol', '(r,s)-equol', '( inverted exclamation marka)-equol', 'Rac-equol')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Equol (4',7-isoflavandiol) is an isoflavandiol estrogen metabolized from daidzein, a type of isoflavone found in soybeans and other plant sources, by bacterial flora in the intestines. While endogenous estrogenic hormones such as estradiol are steroids, equol is a nonsteroidal estrogen. Only about 30–50% of people have intestinal bacteria that make equol. == History == (S)-Equol was first isolated from horse urine in 1932, and the name was suggested by this equine connection. Since then, equol has been found in the urine or plasma of many other animal species, although these animals have significant differences in their ability to metabolize daidzein into equol. In 1980, scientists reported the discovery of equol in humans. The ability of (S)-equol to play a role in the treatment of estrogen- or androgen-mediated diseases or disorders was first proposed in 1984. == Chemical structure == Equol is a compound that can exist in two mirror-image forms known as enantiomers: (S)-equol and (R)-equol. (S)-equol is produced in humans and animals with the ability to metabolize the soy isoflavone daidzein, while (R)-equol can be chemically synthesized. The molecular and physical structure of (S)-equol is similar to that of the hormone estradiol. (S)-Equol preferentially binds estrogen receptor beta. == Pharmacology == === Estrogen receptor binding === (S)-equol is a nonsteroidal, selective agonist of ERβ (Ki = 16 nM) with 13-fold selectivity for ERβ over ERα. Relative to (S)-equol, (R)-equol is less potent and binds to ERα (Ki = 50 nM) with 3.5-fold selectivity over ERβ. (S)-Equol has about 2% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and 20% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). The preferential binding of (S)-equol to ERβ vs. ERα and in comparison to that of estradiol suggests the molecule may share some of the characteristics of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Equol has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30). === Pharmacokinetics === (S)-Equol is a very stable molecule that essentially remains unchanged when digested, and this lack of further metabolism explains its very quick absorption and high bioavailability.

26,"('Estramustine (phosphate sodium)', 'Estracyt', 'Emcyt (free acid)', 'Leo 299', 'Ls 299')",Medical,"Estramustine phosphate (EMP), also known as estradiol normustine phosphate and sold under the brand names Emcyt and Estracyt, is a dual estrogen and chemotherapy medication which is used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. It is taken multiple times a day by mouth or by injection into a vein. Side effects of EMP include nausea, vomiting, gynecomastia, feminization, demasculinization, sexual dysfunction, blood clots, and cardiovascular complications. EMP is a dual cytostatic and hence chemotherapeutic agent and a hormonal anticancer agent of the estrogen type. It is a prodrug of estramustine and estromustine in terms of its cytostatic effects and a prodrug of estradiol in relation to its estrogenic effects. EMP has strong estrogenic effects at typical clinical dosages, and consequently has marked antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects. EMP was introduced for medical use in the early 1970s. It is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, other European countries, and elsewhere in the world. == Medical uses == EMP is indicated, in the United States, for the palliative treatment of metastatic and/or progressive prostate cancer, whereas in the United Kingdom it is indicated for the treatment of unresponsive or relapsing prostate cancer. The medication is usually reserved for use in hormone-refractory cases of prostate cancer, although it has been used as a first-line monotherapy as well. Response rates with EMP in prostate cancer are said to be equivalent to conventional high-dose estrogen therapy. Due to its relatively severe side effects and toxicity, EMP has rarely been used in the treatment of prostate cancer. This is especially true in Western countries today. As a result, and also due to the scarce side effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators (GnRH modulators) like leuprorelin, EMP was almost abandoned. However, encouraging clinical research findings resulted in renewed interest of EMP for the treatment of prostate cancer. EMP has been used at doses of 140 to 1,400 mg/day orally in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, oral EMP is most commonly used at a dose of 560 to 640 mg/day (280–320 mg twice daily). The recommended dosage of oral EMP in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label for Emcyt is 14 mg per kg of body weight (i.e., one 140 mg oral capsule for each 10 kg or 22 lbs of body weight) given in 3 or 4 divided doses per day. The label states that most patients in studies of oral EMP in the United States have received 10 to 16 mg per kg per day. This would be about 900 to 1,440 mg/day for a 90-kg or 200-lb man. Lower doses of oral EMP, such as 280 mg/day, have been found to have comparable effectiveness as higher doses but with improved tolerability and reduced toxicity. Doses of 140 mg/day have been described as a very low dosage. EMP has been used at doses of 240 to 450 mg/day intravenously. EMP and other estrogens such as polyestradiol phosphate and ethinylestradiol are far less costly than newer therapies such as GnRH modulators, abiraterone acetate, and enzalutamide. In addition, estrogens may offer significant benefits over other means of androgen deprivation therapy, for instance in terms of bone loss and fractures, hot flashes, cognition, and metabolic status. EMP has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the start of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. === Available forms === EMP is or has been available in the form of both capsules (140 mg, 280 mg) for oral administration and aqueous solutions (300 mg) for intravenous injection. == Contraindications == EMP is contraindicated when used in children, patients hypersensitive to estrogens or nitrogen mustards, those with peptic ulcer (an ulcer in the digestive tract), those with severely compromised liver function, those with weak heart muscle (also known as myocardial insufficiency) and those with thromboembolic disorders or complications related to fluid retention. == Side effects == The side effects of EMP overall have been described as relatively severe. The most common side effects of EMP have been reported to be gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with nausea and vomiting occurring in 40% of men. They are usually mild or moderate in severity, and the nausea and vomiting can be managed with prophylactic antiemetic medications. Nonetheless, severe cases of gastrointestinal side effects with EMP may require dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. Although nausea and vomiting have been reported to be the most common side effects of EMP, gynecomastia (male breast development) has been found to occur in as many as 83% of men treated with EMP, and the incidence of erectile dysfunction is possibly similar to or slightly less than the risk of gynecomastia. As a rule, feminization, a gynoid fat distribution, demasculinization, and impotence are said to occur in virtually or nearly 100% of men treated with high-dose estrogen therapy. Decreased sexual activity has also been reported in men treated with EMP. These side effects are due to high estrogen levels and low testosterone levels. Prophylactic irradiation of the breasts can be used to decrease the incidence and severity of gynecomastia with estrogens. Severe adverse effects of EMP are thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, thrombophlebitis, coronary artery disease (ischemic heart disease; e.g., myocardial infarction), thrombophlebitis, and congestive heart failure with fluid retention. EMP produces cardiovascular toxicity similarly to diethylstilbestrol, but to a lesser extent in comparison at low doses (e.g., 280 mg/day oral EMP vs. 1 mg/day oral diethylstilbestrol). The prostate cancer disease state also increases the risk of thromboembolism, and combination with docetaxel may exacerbate the risk of thromboembolism as well. Meta-analyses of clinical trials have found that the overall risk of thromboembolism with EMP is 4 to 7%, relative to 0.4% for chemotherapy regimens without EMP. Thromboembolism is the major toxicity-related cause of discontinuation of EMP. Anticoagulant therapy with medications such as aspirin, warfarin, unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists can be useful for decreasing the risk of thromboembolism with EMP and other estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol. Adverse liver function tests are commonly seen with EMP, but severe liver dysfunction is rare with the medication. Central nervous system side effects are rarely seen with EMP, although enlarged ventricles and neuronal pigmentation have been reported in monkeys treated with very high doses of EMP (20–140 mg/kg/day) for 3 to 6 months. EMP does not appear to have cytostatic effects in normal brain tissue. In women treated with EMP in clinical studies, a few instances of minor gynecological hemorrhages have been observed. EMP is described as relatively well tolerated among cytostatic antineoplastic and nitrogen-mustard agents, rarely or not at all being associated with significant hematologic toxicity such as myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), gastrointestinal toxicity, or other more marked toxicity associated with such agents. In contrast to most other cytostatic agents, which often cause myelosuppression, leukopenia (decreased white blood cell count), and neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count), EMP actually produces leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) as a side effect. In a small low-dose study using 280 mg/day oral EMP for 150 days, tolerability was significantly improved, with gastrointestinal irritation occurring in only 15% of men, and there was no incidence of severe cardiovascular toxicity or deep vein thrombosis. In addition, no other side effects besides slight transient elevated liver enzymes were observed. These findings suggest that lower doses of oral EMP may be a safer option than higher doses for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, a subsequent 2004 meta-analysis of 23 studies of thromboembolic events with EMP found substantial incidence of thromboembolic events regardless of dosage and no association of EMP dose with risk of these complications. == Overdose == There has been no clinical experience with overdose of EMP. Overdose of EMP may result in pronounced manifestations of the known adverse effects of the medication. There is no specific antidote for overdose of EMP. In the event of overdose, gastric lavage should be used to evacuate gastric contents as necessary and treatment should be symptom-based and supportive. In the case of dangerously low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets, whole blood may be given as needed. Liver function should be monitored with EMP overdose. After an overdose of EMP, hematological and hepatic parameters should continue to be monitored for at least 6 weeks. EMP has been used at high doses of as much as 1,260 mg/day by the oral route and 240 to 450 mg/day by intravenous injection. == Interactions == EMP has been reported to increase the efficacy and toxicity of tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine. When products containing calcium, aluminium, and/or magnesium, such as dairy products like milk, various foods dietary supplements, and antacids, are consumed concomitantly with EMP, an insoluble chelate complex/phosphate salt between EMP and these metals can be formed, and this can markedly impair the absorption and hence oral bioavailability of EMP. There may be an increased risk of angioedema in those concurrently taking ACE inhibitors. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === EMP, also known as estradiol normustine phosphate, is a combined estrogen ester and nitrogen mustard ester. It consists of estradiol, an estrogen, linked with a phosphate ester as well as an ester of normustine, a nitrogen mustard. In terms of its pharmacodynamic effects, EMP is a prodrug of estramustine, estromustine, and estradiol. As a prodrug of estradiol, EMP is an estrogen and hence an agonist of the estrogen receptors. EMP itself has only very weak affinity for the estrogen receptors. The medication is of about 91% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 normustine and C17β phosphate esters. Because EMP is a prodrug of estradiol, it may be considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen, although it does have additional cytostatic activity via estramustine and estromustine. EMP acts by a dual mechanism of action: 1) direct cytostatic activity via a number of actions; and 2) as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy via estrogen receptor-mediated antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects. The antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects of EMP consist of strong suppression of gonadal androgen production and hence circulating levels of androgens such as testosterone; greatly increased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin and hence a decreased fraction of free androgens in the circulation; and direct antiandrogenic actions in prostate cells. The free androgen index with oral EMP has been found to be on average 4.6-fold lower than with orchiectomy. As such, EMP therapy results in considerably stronger androgen deprivation than orchiectomy. Metabolites of EMP, including estramustine, estromustine, estradiol, and estrone, have been found to act as weak antagonists of the androgen receptor (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 0.5–3.1 μM), although the clinical significance of this is unknown. Extremely high levels of estradiol and estrone occur during EMP therapy. The estrogenic metabolites of EMP are responsible for its most common adverse effects and its cardiovascular toxicity. EMP has been described as having relatively weak estrogenic effects in some publications. However, it has shown essentially the same rates and degrees of estrogenic effects, such as breast tenderness, gynecomastia, cardiovascular toxicity, changes in liver protein synthesis, and testosterone suppression, as high-dose diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol in clinical studies. The notion that EMP has relatively weak estrogen activity may have been based on animal research, which found that EMP had 100-fold lower uterotrophic effects than estradiol in rats, and may also not have taken into account the very high doses of EMP used clinically in humans. The mechanism of action of the cytostatic effects of EMP is complex and only partially understood. EMP is considered to mainly be a mitotic inhibitor, inhibiting mechanisms involved in the mitosis phase of the cell cycle. Specifically, it binds to microtubule-associated proteins and/or to tubulin and produces depolymerization of microtubules (Kd = 10–20 μM for estramustine), resulting in the arrest of cell division in the G2/M phase (specifically metaphase). EMP was originally thought to mediate its cytostatic effects as a prodrug of normustine, a nitrogen mustard, and hence was thought to be an alkylating antineoplastic agent. However, subsequent research has found that EMP is devoid of alkylating actions, and that the influence of EMP on microtubules is mediated by intact estramustine and estromustine, with normustine or estradiol alone having only minor or negligible effects. As such, the unique properties of the estramustine and estromustine structures, containing a carbamate-ester bond, appear to be responsible for the cytostatic effects of EMP. In addition to its antimitotic actions, EMP has also been found to produce other cytostatic effects, including induction of apoptosis, interference with DNA synthesis, nuclear matrix interaction, cell membrane alterations, induction of reactive oxygen species (free oxygen radicals), and possibly additional mechanisms. EMP has been found to have a radiosensitizing effect in prostate cancer and glioma cells, improving sensitivity to radiation therapy as well. The cytostatic metabolites of EMP are accumulated in tissues in a selective manner, for instance in prostate cancer cells. This may be due to the presence of a specific estramustine-binding protein (EMBP) (Kd = 10–35 nM for estramustine), also known as prostatin or prostatic secretion protein (PSP), which has been detected in prostate cancer, glioma, melanoma, and breast cancer cells. Because of its tissue selectivity, EMP is said to produce minimal cytostatic effects in healthy tissues, and its tissue selectivity may be responsible for its therapeutic cytostatic efficacy against prostate cancer cells. EMP was originally developed as a dual ester prodrug of an estrogen and normustine as a nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent which, due to the affinity of the estrogen moiety for estrogen receptors, would be selectively accumulated in estrogen target tissues and hence estrogen receptor-positive tumor cells. Consequentially, it was thought that EMP would preferentially deliver the alkylating normustine moiety to these tissues, allowing for reduced cytostatic effects in healthy tissues and hence improved efficacy and tolerability. However, subsequent research found that there is very limited and slow cleavage of the normustine ester and that EMP is devoid of alkylating activity. In addition, it appears that estramustine and estromustine may be preferentially accumulated in estrogen target tissues not due to affinity for the estrogen receptors, but instead due to affinity for the distinct EMBP. Extremely high, pregnancy-like levels of estradiol may be responsible for the leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) that is observed in individuals treated with EMP. This side effect is in contrast to most other cytotoxic agents, which instead cause myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), leukopenia (decreased white blood cell count), and neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count). ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== EMP at a dosage 280 mg/day has been found to suppress testosterone levels in men into the castrate range (to 30 ng/dL) within 20 days and to the low castrate range (to 10 ng/dL) within 30 days. Similarly, a dosage of 70 mg/day EMP suppressed testosterone levels into the castrate range within 4 weeks. === Pharmacokinetics === Upon oral ingestion, EMP is rapidly and completely dephosphorylated by phosphatases into estramustine during the first pass in the gastrointestinal tract. Estramustine is also partially but considerably oxidized into estromustine by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases during the first pass. As such, EMP reaches the circulation as estramustine and estromustine, and the major metabolite of EMP is estromustine. A limited quantity of approximately 10 to 15% of estramustine and estromustine is further slowly metabolized via hydrolysis of the normustine ester into estradiol and estrone, respectively. This reaction is believed to be catalyzed by carbamidases, although the genes encoding the responsible enzymes have not been characterized. The circulating levels of normustine formed from EMP are insignificant. Release of nitrogen mustard gas from normustine via cleavage of the carboxylic acid group has not been demonstrated and does not seem to occur. The oral bioavailability of EMP is low, which is due to profound first-pass metabolism; specifically, dephosphorylation of EMP. The oral bioavailability of EMP specifically as estramustine and estromustine is 44 to 75%, suggesting that absorption may be incomplete. In any case, there is a linear relationship between the oral dose of EMP and circulating levels of estramustine and estromustine. Consumption of calcium, aluminium, or magnesium with oral EMP can markedly impair its bioavailability due to diminished absorption from the intestines, and this may interfere with its therapeutic effectiveness at low doses. Following a single oral dose of 420 mg EMP in men with prostate cancer, maximal levels of estromustine were 310 to 475 ng/mL (475,000 pg/mL) and occurred after 2 to 3 hours. Estradiol levels with 280 mg/day oral EMP have been found to increase to very high concentrations within one week of therapy. In one study, levels of estradiol were over 20,000 pg/mL after 10 days, were about 30,000 pg/mL after 30 days, and peaked at about 40,000 pg/mL at 50 days. Another study found lower estradiol levels of 4,900 to 9,000 pg/mL during chronic therapy with 560 mg/day oral EMP. An additional study found estradiol levels of about 17,000 pg/mL with 140 mg/day oral EMP and 38,000 pg/mL with 280 mg/day oral EMP. The circulating levels of estradiol and estrone during EMP therapy have been reported to exceed normal levels in men by more than 100- and 1,000-fold, respectively. Levels of estramustine and estradiol in the circulation are markedly lower than those of estromustine and estrone, respectively, with a ratio of about 1:10 in both cases. Nonetheless, estradiol levels during EMP therapy appear to be similar to those that occur in mid-to-late pregnancy, which range from 5,000 to 40,000 pg/mL. No unchanged EMP is seen in the circulation with oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of EMP are different with intravenous injection. Following a single intravenous injection of 300 mg EMP, levels of EMP were higher than those of its metabolites for the first 8 hours. This is likely due to the bypassing of first-pass metabolism. However, by 24 hours after the dose, unchanged EMP could no longer be detected in the circulation. The clearance of EMP from blood plasma is 4.85 ± 0.684 L/h. The volumes of distribution of EMP with intravenous injection were small; under a two-compartment model, the volume of distribution for the central compartment was 0.043 L/kg and for the peripheral compartment was 0.11 L/kg. The plasma protein binding of EMP is high. Estramustine is accumulated in tumor tissue, for instance prostate cancer and glioma tissue, with estramustine levels much higher in these tissues than in plasma (e.g., 6.3- and 15.9-fold, respectively). Conversely, levels of estromustine in tumor versus plasma are similar (1.0- and 0.5-fold, respectively). Estramustine and estromustine appear to accumulate in adipose tissue. The elimination half-life of estromustine with oral EMP was 13.6 hours on average, with a range of 8.8 to 22.7 hours. Conversely, the elimination half-life of estromustine with intravenous injection was 10.3 hours, with a range of 7.36 to 12.3 hours. For comparison, the corresponding elimination half-lives of estrone were 16.5 and 14.7 hours for oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Estramustine and estromustine are mainly excreted in bile and hence in feces. They are not believed to be excreted in urine. == Chemistry == EMP, also known as estradiol 3-normustine 17β-phosphate or as estradiol 3-(bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamate) 17β-(dihydrogen phosphate), is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is an estrogen ester; specifically, EMP is a diester of estradiol with a C3 normustine (nitrogen mustard–carbamate moiety) ester and a C17β phosphate ester. EMP is provided as the sodium or meglumine salt. EMP is similar as a compound to other estradiol esters such as estradiol sulfate and estradiol valerate, but differs in the presence of its nitrogen mustard ester moiety. Antineoplastic agents related to EMP, although none of them were marketed, include alestramustine, atrimustine, cytestrol acetate, estradiol mustard, ICI-85966, and phenestrol. Due to its hydrophilic phosphate ester moiety, EMP is a readily water-soluble compound. This is in contrast to most other estradiol esters, which are fatty acid esters and lipophilic compounds that are not particularly soluble in water. Unlike EMP, estramustine is highly lipophilic, practically insoluble in water, and non-ionizable. The phosphate ester of EMP was incorporated into the molecule in order to increase its water solubility and allow for intravenous administration. The molecular weight of EMP sodium is 564.3 g/mol, of EMP meglumine is 715.6 g/mol, of EMP is 520.4 g/mol, of estramustine is 440.4 g/mol, and of estradiol is 272.4 g/mol. As a result of these differences in molecular weights, EMP contains about 52%, EMP sodium about 48%, and EMP meglumine about 38% of the amount of estradiol within their structures as does an equal-mass quantity of estradiol. == History == EMP was first synthesized in the mid-1960s and was patented in 1967. It was initially developed for the treatment of breast cancer. The idea for EMP was inspired by the uptake and accumulation of radiolabeled estrogens into breast cancer tissue. However, initial clinical findings of EMP in women with breast cancer were disappointing. Subsequently, radiolabeled EMP was found to be taken up into and accumulated rat prostate gland, and this finding culminated in the medication being repurposed for the treatment of prostate cancer. EMP was introduced for medical use in the treatment of this condition in the early 1970s, and was approved in the United States for this indication in 1981. EMP was originally introduced for use by intravenous injection. Subsequently, an oral formulation was introduced, and the intravenous preparation was almost abandoned in favor of the oral version. == Society and culture == === Generic names === EMP is provided as the sodium salt for oral administration, which has the generic names estramustine phosphate sodium (USANTooltip United States Adopted Name) and estramustine sodium phosphate (BANMTooltip British Approved Name, JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name), and as the meglumine salt for intravenous administration, which has the generic name estramustine phosphate meglumine. The INNMTooltip International Nonproprietary Name is estramustine phosphate. The name estramustine phosphate is a contraction of estradiol normustine phosphate. EMP is also known by its former developmental code names Leo 299, Ro 21-8837, and Ro 21-8837/001. === Brand names === EMP is most commonly marketed under the brand names Estracyt and Emcyt, but has also been sold under a number of other brand names, including Amsupros, Biasetyl, Cellmustin, Estramustin HEXAL, Estramustina Filaxis, Estranovag, Multosin, Multosin Injekt, Proesta, Prostamustin, and Suloprost. === Availability === EMP is marketed in the United States, Canada, and Mexico under the brand name Emcyt, whereas the medication is marketed under the brand name Estracyt in the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout Europe as well as in Argentina, Chile, and Hong Kong. It has been discontinued in a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Ireland, and Norway. == Research == EMP has been studied in the treatment of other cancers such as glioma and breast cancer. It has been found to slightly improve quality of life in people with glioma during the first 3 months of therapy. == References == == Further reading ==",Estracyt,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.745722592109814e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007163104019127786)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estramustine_phosphate,https://www.rxreasoner.com/atccodes/L01XX11,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/86404/ ', [])"

The objective of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, first-in-human study was to evaluate safety, efficacy, cutaneous and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of topical bimiralisib in healthy volunteers (HVs) and MF patients. In this trial, a total of 6 HVs and 19 early-stage MF patients were treated with 2.0% bimiralisib gel and/or placebo. Drug efficacy was assessed by the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score, supported by objective measuring methods to quantify lesion severity. PK blood samples were collected frequently and cutaneous PK was investigated in skin punch biopsies on the last day of treatment. Local distribution of bimiralisib in HVs showed a mean exposure of 2.54 µg/g in the epidermis. A systemic concentration was observed after application of a target dose of 2 mg/cm PI3K/mTOR inhibition leads to apoptosis of NOTCH1-mutant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. We tested the efficacy of the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor bimiralisib in patients with NOTCH1-mutant HNSCC. Patients with recurrent/metastatic NOTCH1-mutant HNSCC who had progressed during chemotherapy and immunotherapy received bimiralisib until unacceptable toxicity or progression. To assess whether NOTCH1 mutations can be detected in blood, we measured circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). To assess activated NOTCH1 protein levels, we quantitated cleaved NOTCH1 (cl-NOTCH) by immunohistochemistry. Eight patients were treated, and 6 were evaluable for response. The objective response rate was 17%. For all 8 patients, median progression-free and overall survival was 5 and 7 months, respectively. Bimiralisib was well tolerated, with expected hyperglycemia. Pharmacokinetic values were consistent with published studies. NOTCH1 mutations were detected in 83.3% of ctDNA. Staining for tumor cl-NOTCH1 was negative. The trial closed early due to sponsor insolvency. Although the trial was small, outcomes with bimiralisib were better than the historical standard of care; Results will need to be confirmed in a larger trial. The lack of cl-NOTCH1 was consistent with loss-of-function mutations and validated our mutation function algorithm. The ability to detect NOTCH1 mutations in blood will help future studies. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03740100). Bimiralisib is a pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor demonstrating antitumor efficacy in preclinical models. The objectives of this study were to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), a dosing schedule, and adverse events (AEs) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients received oral bimiralisib to determine the MTD of one continuous (once daily) and two intermittent schedules (A: Days 1, 2 weekly; B: Days 1, 4 weekly) until progression or unacceptable AEs occurred. The MTD for the continuous schedule was 80 mg, with grade three fatigue as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). No MTD was reached with intermittent schedules, with only one DLT in schedule B. PK analysis suggested that 140 mg (schedule A) was within the biologically active dose range and was selected for further exploration. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs were hyperglycemia (76.2%) in the continuous schedule, and nausea (56-62.5%) in schedules A and B. The most frequent treatment-emergent > grade three AE for all schedules combined was hyperglycemia (28.6%, continuous schedule; 12.0%, schedule A; 12.5%, schedule B). There was one partial response in a head and neck squamous cancer patient with a NOTCH1 Bimiralisib demonstrated a manageable AE profile consistent with this compound class. Intermittent schedules had fewer > grade three AEs, while also maintaining favorable PK profiles.

It is a rare example of an amino acid bearing a sulfinic acid functional group. It is a white solid that is soluble in water.

It is not a coded amino acid, but is produced post-translationally. Peptides containing the cysteine sulfinic acid residue are substrates for cysteine sulfinic acid reductase. Cysteine sulfinic acid is derived from cysteine. Cysteine is formed from cystathionine via the cystathionine gamma-lyase enzyme, and is either broken down by cysteine lyase or cystathionine gamma-lyase or enters the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway where it is oxidized by cysteine dioxygenase to form cysteine sulfinic acid. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to form hypotaurine, which in turn is oxidized by hypotaurine dehydrogenase to yield taurine.

32,"('Tranylcypromine (hemisulfate)', 'Tranylcypromine hemisulfate', 'Trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine hemisulfate salt', 'Tranylcypromine', '(1r,2s)-2-phenylcyclopropanamine')",Medical,"Tranylcypromine, sold under the brand name Parnate among others, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). More specifically, tranylcypromine acts as nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It is used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent in the clinical treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, respectively. It is also effective in the treatment of ADHD. Tranylcypromine is also known as trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl-1-amine and is formed pro forma from the cyclization of amphetamine's isopropylamine side chain. As a result, it is classified structurally as a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine. == Medical uses == Tranylcypromine is used to treat major depressive disorder, including atypical depression, especially when there is an anxiety component, typically as a second-line treatment. It is also used in depression that is not responsive to reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, such as the SSRIs, TCAs, or bupropion. In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, tranylcypromine has been demonstrated to be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that tranylcypromine is significantly more effective in the treatment of depression than placebo and has efficacy over placebo similar to that of other antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Porphyria Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease Pheochromocytoma Tyramine, found in several foods, is metabolized by MAO. Ingestion and absorption of tyramine causes extensive release of norepinephrine, which can rapidly increase blood pressure to the point of causing hypertensive crisis. Concomitant use of serotonin-enhancing drugs, including SSRIs, serotonergic TCAs, dextromethorphan, and meperidine may cause serotonin syndrome. Concomitant use of MRAs, including fenfluramine, amphetamine, and pseudoephedrine may cause toxicity via serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. L-DOPA given without carbidopa may cause hypertensive crisis. === Dietary restrictions === Tyramine is a biogenic amine produced as a (generally undesirable) byproduct during the fermentation of certain tyrosine-rich foods. It is rapidly metabolized by MAO-A in those not taking MAO-inhibiting drugs. Individuals sensitive to tyramine-induced hypertension may experience an uncomfortable, yet fleeting, increase in blood pressure after ingesting relatively small amounts of tyramine. Advances in food safety standards in most nations, as well as the widespread use of starter-cultures shown to result in undetectable to low levels of tyramine in fermented products has rendered concerns of serious hypertensive crises rare in those consuming a modern diet. Those treated with MAOIs should still exercise caution, particularly at home, if it is unclear whether food has been properly refrigerated. Since tyramine-producing microbes also produce compounds to which humans have a natural aversion, disposal of any questionable food—particularly meats—should be sufficient to avoid hypertensive crises. == Adverse effects == Incidence of adverse effects Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Dizziness secondary to orthostatic hypotension (17%) Common (1-10% incidence) adverse effects include: Tachycardia (5–10%) Hypomania (7%) Paresthesia (5%) Weight loss (2%) Confusion (2%) Dry mouth (2%) Sexual function disorders (2%) Hypertension (1–2 hours after ingestion) (2%) Rash (2%) Urinary retention (2%) Other (unknown incidence) adverse effects include: Increased/decreased appetite Blood dyscrasias Chest pain Diarrhea Edema Hallucinations Hyperreflexia Insomnia Jaundice Leg cramps Myalgia Palpitations Sensation of cold Suicidal ideation Tremor Of note, there has not been found to be a correlation between sex and age below 65 regarding incidence of adverse effects. Tranylcypromine is not associated with weight gain and has a low risk for hepatotoxicity compared to the hydrazine MAOIs. It is generally recommended that MAOIs be discontinued prior to anesthesia; however, this creates a risk of recurrent depression. In a retrospective observational cohort study, patients on tranylcypromine undergoing general anesthesia had a lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension, while there was no difference between patients not taking an MAOI regarding intraoperative incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypertension. The use of indirect sympathomimetic drugs or drugs affecting serotonin reuptake, such as meperidine or dextromethorphan poses a risk for hypertension and serotonin syndrome respectively; alternative agents are recommended. Other studies have come to similar conclusions. Pharmacokinetic interactions with anesthetics are unlikely, given that tranylcypromine is a high-affinity substrate for CYP2A6 and does not inhibit CYP enzymes at therapeutic concentrations. Tranylcypromine abuse has been reported at doses ranging from 120 to 600 mg per day. It is thought that higher doses have more amphetamine-like effects and abuse is promoted by the fast onset and short half-life of tranylcypromine. Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during tranylcypromine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. Symptoms of tranylcypromine overdose are generally more intense manifestations of its usual effects. == Interactions == In addition to contraindicated concomitant medications, tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6, which may reduce the metabolism and increase the toxicity of substrates of this enzyme, such as: Dexmedetomidine nicotine TSNAs (found in cured tobacco products, including cigarettes) Valproate Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors prevent neuronal uptake of tyramine and may reduce its pressor effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tranylcypromine acts as a nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Regarding the isoforms of monoamine oxidase, it shows slight preference for the MAOB isoenzyme over MAOA. This leads to an increase in the availability of monoamines, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, epinephrine as well as a marked increase in the availability of trace amines, such as tryptamine, octopamine, and phenethylamine. The clinical relevance of increased trace amine availability is unclear. It may also act as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor at higher therapeutic doses. Compared to amphetamine, tranylcypromine shows low potency as a dopamine releasing agent, with even weaker potency for norepinephrine and serotonin release. Tranylcypromine has also been shown to inhibit the histone demethylase, BHC110/LSD1. Tranylcypromine inhibits this enzyme with an IC50 < 2 μM, thus acting as a small molecule inhibitor of histone demethylation with an effect to derepress the transcriptional activity of BHC110/LSD1 target genes. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. Tranylcypromine has been found to inhibit CYP46A1 at nanomolar concentrations. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. === Pharmacokinetics === Tranylcypromine reaches its maximum concentration (tmax) within 1–2 hours. After a 20 mg dose, plasma concentrations reach at most 50-200 ng/mL. While its half-life is only about 2 hours, its pharmacodynamic effects last several days to weeks due to irreversible inhibition of MAO. Metabolites of tranylcypromine include 4-hydroxytranylcypromine, N-acetyltranylcypromine, and N-acetyl-4-hydroxytranylcypromine, which are less potent MAO inhibitors than tranylcypromine itself. Amphetamine was once thought to be a metabolite of tranylcypromine, but has not been shown to be. Tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6 at therapeutic concentrations. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === == History == Tranylcypromine was originally developed as an analog of amphetamine. Although it was first synthesized in 1948, its MAOI action was not discovered until 1959. Precisely because tranylcypromine was not, like isoniazid and iproniazid, a hydrazine derivative, its clinical interest increased enormously, as it was thought it might have a more acceptable therapeutic index than previous MAOIs. The drug was introduced by Smith, Kline and French in the United Kingdom in 1960, and approved in the United States in 1961. It was withdrawn from the market in February 1964 due to a number of patient deaths involving hypertensive crises with intracranial bleeding. However, it was reintroduced later that year with more limited indications and specific warnings of the risks. == Research == Tranylcypromine is known to inhibit LSD1, an enzyme that selectively demethylates two lysines found on histone H3. Genes promoted downstream of LSD1 are involved in cancer cell growth and metastasis, and several tumor cells express high levels of LSD1. Tranylcypromine analogues with more potent and selective LSD1 inhibitory activity are being researched in the potential treatment of cancers. Tranylcypromine may have neuroprotective properties applicable to the treatment of Parkinson's disease, similar to the MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline. As of 2017, only one clinical trial in Parkinsonian patients has been conducted, which found some improvement initially and only slight worsening of symptoms after a 1.5 year followup. == See also == Tranylcypromine/trifluoperazine == References ==",Tranylcypromine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.510157047363464e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007164295529946685)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranylcypromine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=9, title='Tranylcypromine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranylcypromine?utm_source=openai')])"
33,"('Glycolic acid', 'Hydroxyacetic acid', 'Glycollic acid', 'Hydroxyethanoic acid', 'Acetic acid, hydroxy-')","Endogenous, Food, Medical, Personal Care","Glycolic acid (or hydroxyacetic acid; chemical formula HOCH2CO2H) is a colorless, odorless and hygroscopic crystalline solid, highly soluble in water. It is used in various skin-care products. Glycolic acid is widespread in nature. A glycolate (sometimes spelled ""glycollate"") is a salt or ester of glycolic acid. == History == The name ""glycolic acid"" was coined in 1848 by French chemist Auguste Laurent (1807–1853). He proposed that the amino acid glycine—which was then called glycocolle—might be the amine of a hypothetical acid, which he called ""glycolic acid"" (acide glycolique). Glycolic acid was first prepared in 1851 by German chemist Adolph Strecker (1822–1871) and Russian chemist Nikolai Nikolaevich Sokolov (1826–1877). They produced it by treating hippuric acid with nitric acid and nitrogen dioxide to form an ester of benzoic acid and glycolic acid (C6H5C(=O)OCH2COOH), which they called ""benzoglycolic acid"" (Benzoglykolsäure; also benzoyl glycolic acid). They boiled the ester for days with dilute sulfuric acid, thereby obtaining benzoic acid and glycolic acid (Glykolsäure). == Preparation == Glycolic acid can be synthesized in various ways. The predominant approaches use a catalyzed reaction of formaldehyde with synthesis gas (carbonylation of formaldehyde), for its low cost. It is also prepared by the reaction of chloroacetic acid with sodium hydroxide followed by re-acidification. Other methods, not noticeably in use, include hydrogenation of oxalic acid, and hydrolysis of the cyanohydrin derived from formaldehyde. Some of today's glycolic acids are formic acid-free. Glycolic acid can be isolated from natural sources, such as sugarcane, sugar beets, pineapple, cantaloupe and unripe grapes. Glycolic acid can also be prepared using an enzymatic biochemical process that may require less energy. == Properties == Glycolic acid is slightly stronger than acetic acid due to the electron-withdrawing power of the terminal hydroxyl group. The carboxylate group can coordinate to metal ions, forming coordination complexes. Of particular note are the complexes with Pb2+ and Cu2+ which are significantly stronger than complexes with other carboxylic acids. This indicates that the hydroxyl group is involved in complex formation, possibly with the loss of its proton. == Applications == Glycolic acid is used in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent. === Organic synthesis === Glycolic acid is a useful intermediate for organic synthesis, in a range of reactions including: oxidation-reduction, esterification and long chain polymerization. It is used as a monomer in the preparation of polyglycolic acid and other biocompatible copolymers (e.g. PLGA). Commercially, important derivatives include the methyl (CAS# 96-35-5) and ethyl (CAS# 623-50-7) esters which are readily distillable (boiling points 147–149 °C and 158–159 °C, respectively), unlike the parent acid. The butyl ester (b.p. 178–186 °C) is a component of some varnishes, being desirable because it is nonvolatile and has good dissolving properties. == Occurrence == Plants produce glycolic acid during photorespiration. It is recycled by conversion to glycine within the peroxisomes and to tartronic acid semialdehyde within the chloroplasts. Because photorespiration is a wasteful side reaction in regard to photosynthesis, much effort has been devoted to suppressing its formation. One process converts glycolate into glycerate without using the conventional BASS6 and PLGG1 route; see glycerate pathway. == Safety == Glycolic acid is an irritant to the skin. It occurs in all green plants. == References == == External links == Glycolic acid MS Spectrum Hazardous Substances Data Bank",Hydroxyethanoic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.48342254757881165), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.006000251974910498), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.005250244867056608), (' INDUSTR', -6.670925358776003e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('P', -0.18702386319637299), ('ERSON', 0.0), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ĠCARE', -3.6954195820726454e-05), (',', -0.0002668739762157202), ('ĠFOOD', -0.018833857029676437), (',', -0.1602596491575241), ('ĠINDU', -0.009573147632181644), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10024626553058624)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.2662762701511383), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -2.935296834039036e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.47411930561065674), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.003177952254191041), (' INDUSTR', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
34,"('Ethionamide',)",Medical,"Ethionamide is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, to treat active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It is no longer recommended for leprosy. It is taken by mouth. Ethionamide has a high rate of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Serious side effects may include liver inflammation and depression. It should not be used in people with significant liver problems. Use in pregnancy is not recommended as safety is unclear. Ethionamide is in the thioamides family of medications. It is believed to work by interfering with the use of mycolic acid. Ethionamide was discovered in 1956 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Ethionamide is used in combination with other antituberculosis agents as part of a second-line regimen for active tuberculosis. Ethionamide is well absorbed orally with or without food, but is often administered with food to improve tolerance. It crosses the blood brain barrier to achieve concentrations in the cerebral-spinal fluid equivalent to plasma. The antimicrobial spectrum of ethionamide includes M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. smegmatis. It also is used rarely against infections with M. leprae and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as M. avium and M. kansasii. While working in a similar manner to isoniazid, cross resistance is only seen in 13% of strains, since they are both prodrugs but activated by different pathways. Resistance can emerge from mutations in ethA, which is needed to activate the drug, or ethR, which can be overexpressed to repress ethA. Mutations in inhA or the promoter of inhA can also lead to resistance through changing the binding site or overexpression. The FDA has placed it in pregnancy category C, because it has caused birth defects in animal studies. It is not known whether ethionamide is excreted into breast milk. == Adverse effects == Ethionamide frequently causes gastrointestinal distress with nausea and vomiting which can lead patients to stop taking it. This can sometimes be improved by taking it with food. Ethionamide can cause hepatocellular toxicity and is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment. Patients on ethionamide should have regular monitoring of their liver function tests. Liver toxicity occurs in up to 5% of patients and follows a pattern similar to isoniazid, usually arising in the first 1 to 3 months of therapy, but can occur even after more than 6 months of therapy. The pattern of liver function test derangement is often a rise in the ALT and AST. Both central neurological side effects such as psychiatric disturbances and encephalopathy, along with peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Administering pyridoxine along with ethionamide may reduce these effects and is recommended. Ethionamide is structurally similar to methimazole, which is used to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, and has been linked to hypothyroidism in several TB patients. Periodic monitoring of thyroid function while on ethionamide is recommended. === Interactions === Ethionamide may worsen the adverse effects of other antituberculous drugs being taken at the same time. It boosts levels of isoniazid when taken together and can lead to increased rates of peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. When taken with cycloserine, seizures have been reported. High rates of hepatotoxicty have been reported when taken with rifampicin. The drug's labeling cautions against excessive alcohol ingestion as it may provoke a psychotic reaction. == Mechanism of action == Ethionamide is a prodrug which is activated by the enzyme ethA, a mono-oxygenase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then binds NAD+ to form an adduct which inhibits InhA in the same way as isoniazid. The mechanism of action is thought to be through disruption of mycolic acid. Expression of the ethA gene is controlled by ethR, a transcriptional repressor. It is thought that improving ethA expression will increase the efficacy of ethionamide and prompting interest by drug developers in EthR inhibitors as a co-drug. == Other names == 1314 2-ethylisothionicotinamide amidazine thioamide iridocin It is sold under the brand name Trecator by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals which was purchased by Pfizer in 2009. == References == == External links == ""Ethionamide"".

35,"('Rotundine', 'Tetrahydropalmatine', 'Gindarine', '(s)-tetrahydropalmatine', 'Caseanine')",Medical,"Tetrahydropalmatine (THP) is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in several different plant species, mainly in the genus Corydalis (Yan Hu Suo), but also in other plants such as Stephania rotunda. These plants have traditional uses in Chinese herbal medicine. The pharmaceutical industry has synthetically produced the more potent enantiomer Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (Levo-THP; technically l-THP, often written L-THP), which has been marketed worldwide under different brand names as an alternative to anxiolytic and sedative drugs of the benzodiazepine group and analgesics such as opiates. It is also sold as a dietary supplement. In 1940, a Vietnamese scientist Sang Dinh Bui extracted an alkaloid from the root of Stephania rotunda with the yield of 1.2–1.5% and he named this compound rotundin. From 1950 to 1952, two Indian scientists studied and extracted from Stephania glabra another alkaloid named hyndanrine. In 1965, the structure of rotundine and hyndarin was proved to be the same as tetrahydropalmatine. == Effects == Tetrahydropalmatine has been demonstrated to possess analgesic effects and may be beneficial in the treatment of heart disease and liver damage. It is a blocker of voltage-activated L-type calcium channel active potassium channels. It is a potent muscle relaxant. It is widely used in China as a sedative. It has also shown potential in the treatment of drug addiction to both cocaine and opiates, and preliminary human studies have shown promising results. In animal models, anti-addiction effects can manifest at sub-sedative doses. == Adverse effects == In November 2013, the Chinese National Medical Products Administration issued an order asking for all medications containing l-THP to have their package inserts revised, prohibiting use in pregnant women and those with extrapyramidal disorders, requiring warnings about liver impairement and operation of machinery, and highlighting risks of drowsiness and extrapyramidal symptoms with overuse or when combined with other CNS depressants. Long-term is not advised. The same order lists the following OTC medications as containing l-THP: == Mechanism of action == The pharmacological profile of l-THP includes antagonism of dopamine D1, and D2 receptors as well as actions at dopamine D3, alpha adrenergic and serotonin receptors. The Ki values for l-THP at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are approximately 124 nM (D1) and 388 nM (D2). In addition to the antagonism of post-synaptic dopamine receptors, the blockade of pre-synaptic autoreceptors by l-THP results in increased dopamine release, and it has been suggested that lower affinity of l-THP for D2 receptors may confer some degree of autoreceptor selectivity. Along with dopamine receptors, l-THP has been reported to interact with a number of other receptor types, including alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, at which it functions as an antagonist, and GABA-A receptors, through positive allosteric modulation. Additionally, l-THP displays significant binding to 5-HT1A and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. In the case of 5-HT1A receptors, l-THP binds with a Ki of approximately 340 nM. Animal experiments have shown that the sedative effect of THP results from blocking dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system where it occurs in several important signaling systems that regulate muscular activity and attention, as well as feelings of joy, enthusiasm, and creativity. Therefore, THP causes no feelings of euphoria, and has been seen as an alternative to addictive drugs for people suffering from anxiety and pain, and as a possibility for relief for people not helped by existing drugs. == Cases of poisoning == Several cases of poisoning related to THP have been reported. These cases involved bradycardia, respiratory depression, and CNS depression. Some cases report hepatitis, acute and chronic. Fatalities started to be reported in 1999 in cases where an overdose of THP had been used in combination with other drugs having analgesic and anti-anxiety effects. All 1999 deaths could be tied to a single THP-based supplement, sold under the name ""Jin Bu Huan Anodyne Tablets"". Toxicity has been reported in children when taken alone. This product was therefore blacklisted by US and European health authorities. In some other countries, such as Singapore, THP is treated as a controlled substance, and license is required to sell it. In addition, chronic hepatitis has been reported, caused by THP production in East Asia under conditions that were insufficiently sterile. == Research == The University of Maryland has completed a phase I study for THP in people with a history of cocaine use.

38,"('Ethambutol (dihydrochloride)', 'Emb dihydrochloride', 'Ethambutol', 'Ethambutolum', 'Aethambutolum')",Medical,"Ethambutol (EMB, E) is a medication primarily used to treat tuberculosis. It is usually given in combination with other tuberculosis medications, such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. It may also be used to treat Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include problems with vision, joint pain, nausea, headaches, and feeling tired. Other side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people with optic neuritis, significant kidney problems, or under the age of five. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been found to cause harm. In the United States the FDA has raised concerns about eye issues in the baby if used during pregnancy. Ethambutol is believed to work by interfering with the bacteria's metabolism. Ethambutol was discovered in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and is available as a generic medication. == Chirality and biological activity == (S,S)-(+)-Ethambutol is powerful and selective antitubercular drug. It is a typical example of an old drug that was introduced for clinical use in its unichiral form. Ethambutol contains two constitutionally symmetrical chiral centers in its structure and exists in three stereoisomeric forms, the enantiomeric pair (+)-(S,S)- and (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol, along with the achiral stereoisomer called meso-form. The (+)-(S,S)-enantiomer harbors the antitubercular activity. This enantiomer is 500 and 12 fold more potent than (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol and the meso-form respectively. On the other hand, all the three isomers are equipotent in terms of the major side-effect of the drug, optic neuritis. Toxicity is associated to both dose and duration of treatment. Hence the use of (S,S)-enantiomer greatly improved the risk/benefit balance. == Medical uses == Ethambutol is used along with other medications to treat a number of infections including: tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. == Adverse effects == Optic neuritis (hence contraindicated in children below six years of age) Red–green color blindness People taking ethambutol should be monitored for changes in visual acuity and color discrimination. Arthralgia Hyperuricaemia Vertical nystagmus Skin rash == Mechanism of action == Ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing TB bacilli. It works by obstructing the formation of cell wall. Mycolic acids attach to the 5'-hydroxyl groups of D-arabinose residues of arabinogalactan and form mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the cell wall. It disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. Disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads to increased permeability of the cell wall. == Pharmacokinetics == It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and well distributed in body tissues and fluids. 50% is excreted unchanged in urine. == References ==",Ethambutol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1324817933200393e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005715643637813628)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethambutol?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Ethambutol', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethambutol?utm_source=openai')])"

40,"('Acamprosate (calcium)', 'Calcium n-acetylhomotaurinate', 'Acamprosate', 'N-acetylhomotaurine', 'Campral')",Medical,"Acamprosate, sold under the brand name Campral, is a medication which reduces alcoholism cravings. It is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcohol withdrawal. When used alone, acamprosate is not an effective therapy for alcohol use disorder in most individuals, as it only addresses withdrawal symptoms and not psychological dependence. Acamprosate is a medication that works in the brain to treat alcohol use disorder. Acamprosate works by decreasing cravings and urges to use alcohol. This allows people who take the medication to control urges to drink and help to continue to not use alcohol. Acamprosate does not help with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. It facilitates a reduction in alcohol consumption as well as full abstinence when used in combination with psychosocial support or other drugs that address the addictive behavior. Serious side effects include allergic reactions, abnormal heart rhythms, and low or high blood pressure, while less serious side effects include headaches, insomnia, and impotence. Diarrhea is the most common side-effect. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Acamprosate is useful when used along with counseling in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Over three to twelve months it increases the number of people who do not drink at all and the number of days without alcohol. It appears to work as well as naltrexone for maintenance of abstinence from alcohol, however naltrexone works slightly better for reducing alcohol cravings and heavy drinking, and acamprosate tends to work more poorly outside of Europe where treatment services are less robust. Difference in severity may also play a role. === Compliance === Some struggle to take the full course of medication (2 tablets, 3 times a day), which makes acamprosate less effective. Standard support to help people take their medication involves monthly check-ins with addiction services or a GP. Research found that compared to standard support alone, extra telephone support by a pharmacist, plus financial incentives, increased the numbers who took medication as prescribed and was cost-effective. The same telephone support without financial incentives did not significantly increase the numbers taking their medication as prescribed and was less cost-effective. == Contraindications == Acamprosate is primarily removed by the kidneys. A dose reduction is suggested in those with moderately impaired kidneys (creatinine clearance between 30 mL/min and 50 mL/min). It is also contraindicated in those who have a strong allergic reaction to acamprosate calcium or any of its components. == Adverse effects == The US label carries warnings about increases in suicidal behavior, major depressive disorder, and kidney failure. Adverse effects that caused people to stop taking the drug in clinical trials included diarrhea, nausea, depression, and anxiety. Potential adverse effects include headache, stomach pain, back pain, muscle pain, joint pain, chest pain, infections, flu-like symptoms, chills, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, fainting, vomiting, upset stomach, constipation, increased appetite, weight gain, edema, sleepiness, decreased sex drive, impotence, forgetfulness, abnormal thinking, abnormal vision, distorted sense of taste, tremors, runny nose, coughing, difficulty breathing, sore throat, bronchitis, and rashes. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The pharmacodynamics of acamprosate are complex and not fully understood. Ethanol and benzodiazepines act on the central nervous system by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., they act as positive allosteric modulators at these receptors). In alcohol use disorder, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. these receptors become less sensitive to GABA). When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect, leading to physical withdrawal symptoms; since GABA normally inhibits neural firing, GABAA receptor desensitization results in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., fewer inhibitory postsynaptic potentials occur through GABAA receptors), leading to neuronal over-excitation (i.e., more action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron). In addition, alcohol also inhibits the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the overproduction (upregulation) of these receptors. Thereafter, sudden alcohol abstinence causes the excessive numbers of NMDARs to be more active than normal and to contribute to the symptoms of delirium tremens and excitotoxic neuronal death. Withdrawal from alcohol induces a surge in release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate, which activates NMDARs. Acamprosate reduces this glutamate surge. The drug also protects cultured cells from excitotoxicity induced by ethanol withdrawal and from glutamate exposure combined with ethanol withdrawal. Although its ability to correct an overabundance of glutamate is well-established, the actual molecular target behind this action is poorly known. Knowledge on this topic has seen several major revisions. ==== GABA/NMDA hypothesis ==== It is originally believed to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. Its activity on those receptors is indirect, unlike that of most other agents used in this context. An inhibition of the GABA-B system is believed to cause indirect enhancement of GABAA receptors. The effects on the NMDA complex are dose-dependent; the product appears to enhance receptor activation at low concentrations, while inhibiting it when consumed in higher amounts, which counters the excessive activation of NMDA receptors in the context of alcohol withdrawal. At high concentrations, well above those that occur clinically (1 μM to 3 μM), reports of inhibition of glutamate receptor-activated responses (1 mM), enhancement of NMDA receptor function (300 μM), weak antagonization of the NMDA receptor, and partial agonism of the polyamine site of the NMDA receptor. However, no direct action of acamprosate at clinically relevant concentrations has yet been reported. At clinical levels, any inhibiton of the NMDA receptor probably occurs in a allosteric way. One of acamprosate's purported mechanisms of action is the enhancement of GABA signaling at GABAA receptors via positive allosteric receptor modulation. It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it does not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear pain, and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle. ==== mGluR hypothesis ==== Two later hypothesized targets are mGluR1 and mGluR5 (10 μM). The idea originated from the fact that acamprosate blocked the neurotoxicity of an agonist of mGluR1 and mGluR5. However, a subsequent study found no action of acamprosate on the mGluR1 or mGluR5 at concentrations as high as 100 μM, nor at GABAA or glycine receptors or voltage-gated sodium channels. In addition, even if the 10 μM figure is correct, it would still be clinically irrelevant. ==== Calcium hypothesis ==== Spanagel et al. (2014) show that the effects of acamprosate calcium can mostly be attributed to the calcium component. Replacing calcium with sodium produces an inactive drug. Calcium chloride has a similar effect on glutamate neurotransmission. Moreover, calcium carbonate has a similar craving-reducing effect on human alcoholics. ==== Synergy hypothesis ==== Ademar et al. (2023) report that acamprosate sodium does, in fact, enhance the effect of calcium chloride in an animal alcoholism model, and hence is not a fully inactive molecule. They also show a role of increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbe downstream of the glycine receptor, partly mimicking ethanol. ==== Other effects ==== The product also increases the endogenous production of taurine. The substance also helps re-establish a standard sleep architecture by normalizing stage 3 and REM sleep phases, which is believed to be an important aspect of its pharmacological activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Acamprosate is not metabolized by the human body. Acamprosate's absolute bioavailability from oral administration is approximately 11%, and its bioavailability is decreased when taken with food. Following administration and absorption of acamprosate, it is excreted unchanged (i.e., as acamprosate) via the kidneys. Co-administration with naltrexone increases plasma levels. Its absorption and elimination are very slow, with a tmax of 6 hours and an elimination half life of over 30 hours. Steady-state levels are reached by day 5 of oral treatment. == History == Acamprosate was developed by Lipha, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA. and was approved for marketing in Europe in 1989. In October 2001 Forest Laboratories acquired the rights to market the drug in the US. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2004. The first generic versions of acamprosate were launched in the US in 2013. As of 2015, acamprosate was in development by Confluence Pharmaceuticals as a potential treatment for fragile X syndrome. The drug was granted orphan drug designation for this use by the FDA in 2013, and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2014. == Society and culture == === Names === Acamprosate is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and the British Approved Name (BAN). Acamprosate calcium is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and the Japanese Accepted Name (JAN). It is also technically known as N-acetylhomotaurine or as calcium acetylhomotaurinate. It is sold under the brand name Campral. == Research == In addition to its apparent ability to help people refrain from drinking, some evidence suggests that acamprosate is neuroprotective (that is, it protects neurons from damage and death caused by the effects of alcohol withdrawal, and possibly other causes of neurotoxicity). It has been tried for autism, both ideopathic and fragile X syndrome-linked. It appears to reduce amyloid-beta precursor protein levels. == References ==",Campral,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.417489309271332e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016616393986623734)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/campral.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Campral: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Interactions - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/campral.html?utm_source=openai')])"

The activity of PEGPH20 with modified fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) was evaluated in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). Patients had untreated mPC, a performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function. Tumor HA status was not required for eligibility. After a phase Ib dose-finding study of mFOLFIRINOX plus PEGPH20, the phase II open-label study randomly assigned patients (1:1) to the combination arm or to mFOLFIRINOX alone (n = 138). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). PEGPH20 dosages of 3 µg/kg every 2 weeks were more tolerable than twice-weekly dosages used in the phase I study, so 3 µg/kg every 2 weeks was the phase II dosage. An amendment instituted enoxaparin prophylaxis in the PEGPH20 combination arm as a result of increased thromboembolic (TE) events. The planned interim futility analysis when 35 deaths (of 103 analyzable patients) occurred resulted in an OS hazard ratio (HR) of 2.07 that favored the control arm, and the study was closed to accrual. The treatment-related grade 3 to 4 toxicity was significantly increased in the PEGPH20 combination arm relative to control (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.1). The median OS in the mFOLFIRINOX arm was 14.4 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 15.7 months) versus 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 9.3 months) in the PEGPH20 combination arm. Addition of PEGPH20 to mFOLFIRINOX seems to be detrimental in patients unselected for tumor HA status. This combination caused increased toxicity (mostly GI and TE events) and resulted in decreased treatment duration compared with mFOLFIRINOX alone. The median OS in the mFOLFIRINOX control arm (14.4 months) is, to our knowledge, the longest yet reported and can be considered for patients with good PS. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children worldwide. In previous work to develop point mutations in RSV with improved genetic stability, we observed that an attenuating mutation at amino acid position 1321 in the L polymerase protein was subject to deattenuation by a spontaneous second-site compensatory mutation at position 1313 (C. Luongo, C. C. Winter, P. L. Collins, and U. J. Buchholz, J. Virol. 86:10792-10804, 2012). In the present study, we found that deletion of position 1313 (Δ1313), irrespective of the presence of an attenuating mutation at position 1321, provided a new attenuating mutation. RSV bearing Δ1313 replicated in cell culture as efficiently as wild-type virus at 32°C, was restricted for replication at 37°C, and was restricted 50-fold and 150-fold in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, respectively, of mice. We combined the Δ1313 deletion with the previously described, attenuating NS2 gene deletion (ΔNS2) to produce the recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine candidate ΔNS2/Δ1313. During in vitro stress tests involving serial passage at incrementally increasing temperatures, a second-site compensatory mutation was detected in close proximity of Δ1313, namely, I1314T. This site was genetically and phenotypically stabilized by an I1314L substitution. Combination of I1314L with ΔNS2/Δ1313 yielded a virus, ΔNS2/Δ1313/1314L, with genetic stability at physiological temperature. This stabilized vaccine candidate was moderately temperature sensitive and had a level of restriction in chimpanzees comparable to that of MEDI-559, a promising RSV vaccine candidate that presently is in clinical trials but lacks stabilized attenuating mutations. The level of attenuation and genetic stability identify ΔNS2/Δ1313/1314L as a promising candidate for evaluation in pediatric phase I studies.",S1313,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.07889397442340851), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.02016472816467285), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31335410475730896)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/3-Phenylsulfanyl-1_3-thiazolidin-4-one,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/13-Sulfanyltridecylphosphonic-acid,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/S-phenyl-N-phenoxathiin-1-ylcarbamothioate,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/S-_1_3-thiazol-2-yl_-N-phenylcarbamothioate,https://www.invivochem.com/lansoprazole-sulfone.html,https://www.invivochem.com/phthalylsulfacetamide.html,https://www.targetmol.com/compound/chitin_synthase_inhibitor_13,https://www.benchchem.com/product/b1371131,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30073465/ ', [])"

Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway is one of the signal transduction pathways most closely related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. The regulation of various downstream molecules affects the proliferation and growth of tumor cells. In this study, we determined the effect of different concentrations of afuresertib on cell viability by MTT assay and determined the effect of afuresertib on cell apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining. Animal experiments verified the effects of afuresertib on VEGF, bFGF, and PI3K/Akt. Our results indicated that afuresertib is closely related to the survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of esophageal cancer cell lines. More importantly, we found that afuresertib could reduce tumor volume and mass in EC rats through in vivo experiments. In conclusion, afuresertib may exert its antitumor effect by inhibiting the expression of PI3K and Akt-related proteins in rat tumor tissues. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine neoplasm of the skin, which has an exceedingly poor prognosis. The AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in the modulation of protein synthesis and cell survival, has been shown to be extremely important for Merkel cell carcinogenesis. In the current study, we found that AKT has important regulatory functions in MCC cells and that inhibition of AKT with the novel ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor, afuresertib, has widespread effects on proliferative pathways. In particular, we found that treatment of MCC cells with afuresertib led to deactivation of mTOR and glycogen synthase kinase 3 pathway proteins while increasing activation of proapoptotic pathways through the upregulation of p16 expression and phosphomodulation of the B-cell lymphoma-2-associated death promoter. Overall, afuresertib treatment led to significant and robust inhibition of MCC cell proliferation, thus raising intriguing questions regarding the potential efficacy of AKT inhibition for the future clinical management of MCC. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an asbestos-related occupational disease, is an aggressive and incurable tumor of the thoracic cavity. Despite recent advances in MPM treatment, overall survival of patients with MPM is very low. Recent studies have implicated that PI3K/Akt signaling is involved in MPM cell survival and development. To investigate the effects of Akt inhibitors on MPM cell survival, we examined the effects of nine selective Akt inhibitors, namely, afuresertib, Akti-1/2, AZD5363, GSK690693, ipatasertib, MK-2206, perifosine, PHT-427, and TIC10, on six MPM cell lines, namely, ACC-MESO-4, Y-MESO-8A, MSTO-211H, NCI-H28, NCI-H290, and NCI-H2052, and a normal mesothelial cell line MeT-5A.

The term is derived from Latin fortis (""strong"") and facere (""to make""). From very early history to modern times, defensive walls have often been necessary for cities to survive in an ever-changing world of invasion and conquest. Some settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization were the first small cities to be fortified. In ancient Greece, large cyclopean stone walls fitted without mortar had been built in Mycenaean Greece, such as the ancient site of Mycenae. A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison, and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or fortress. These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower, to guard certain roads, passes, and borders. Though smaller than a real fortress, they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border. The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called ""castrametation"" since the time of the Roman legions. Fortification is usually divided into two branches: permanent fortification and field fortification. There is also an intermediate branch known as semipermanent fortification. Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory. Roman forts and hill forts were the main antecedents of castles in Europe, which emerged in the 9th century in the Carolingian Empire. The Early Middle Ages saw the creation of some towns built around castles. Medieval-style fortifications were largely made obsolete by the arrival of cannons in the 14th century. Fortifications in the age of black powder evolved into much lower structures with greater use of ditches and earth ramparts that would absorb and disperse the energy of cannon fire. Walls exposed to direct cannon fire were very vulnerable, so the walls were sunk into ditches fronted by earth slopes to improve protection. The arrival of explosive shells in the 19th century led to another stage in the evolution of fortification. Star forts did not fare well against the effects of high explosives, and the intricate arrangements of bastions, flanking batteries and the carefully constructed lines of fire for the defending cannon could be rapidly disrupted by explosive shells. Steel-and-concrete fortifications were common during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The advances in modern warfare since World War I have made large-scale fortifications obsolete in most situations. == History == === Early uses === Defensive fences for protecting humans and domestic animals against predators was used long before the appearance of writing and began ""perhaps with primitive man blocking the entrances of his caves for security from large carnivores"". From very early history to modern times, walls have been a necessity for many cities. Amnya Fort in western Siberia has been described by archeologists as one of the oldest known fortified settlements, as well as the northernmost Stone Age fort. In Bulgaria, near the town of Provadia a walled fortified settlement today called Solnitsata starting from 4700 BC had a diameter of about 300 feet (91 m), was home to 350 people living in two-story houses, and was encircled by a fortified wall. The huge walls around the settlement, which were built very tall and with stone blocks which are 6 feet (1.8 m) high and 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick, make it one of the earliest walled settlements in Europe but it is younger than the walled town of Sesklo in Greece from 6800 BC. Uruk in ancient Sumer (Mesopotamia) is one of the world's oldest known walled cities. The Ancient Egyptians also built fortresses on the frontiers of the Nile Valley to protect against invaders from adjacent territories, as well as circle-shaped mud brick walls around their cities. Many of the fortifications of the ancient world were built with mud brick, often leaving them no more than mounds of dirt for today's archeologists. A massive prehistoric stone wall surrounded the ancient temple of Ness of Brodgar 3200 BC in Scotland. Named the ""Great Wall of Brodgar"" it was 4 m (13 ft) thick and 4 m (13 ft) tall. The wall had some symbolic or ritualistic function. The Assyrians deployed large labor forces to build new palaces, temples and defensive walls. === Bronze Age Europe === In Bronze Age Malta, some settlements also began to be fortified. The most notable surviving example is Borġ in-Nadur, where a bastion built in around 1500 BC was found. Exceptions were few—notably, ancient Sparta and ancient Rome did not have walls for a long time, choosing to rely on their militaries for defense instead. Initially, these fortifications were simple constructions of wood and earth, which were later replaced by mixed constructions of stones piled on top of each other without mortar. In ancient Greece, large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece, such as the ancient site of Mycenae (famous for the huge stone blocks of its 'cyclopean' walls). In classical era Greece, the city of Athens built two parallel stone walls, called the Long Walls, that reached their fortified seaport at Piraeus a few miles away. In Central Europe, the Celts built large fortified settlements known as oppida, whose walls seem partially influenced by those built in the Mediterranean. The fortifications were continuously being expanded and improved. Around 600 BC, in Heuneburg, Germany, forts were constructed with a limestone foundation supported by a mudbrick wall approximately 4 meters tall, probably topped by a roofed walkway, thus reaching a total height of 6 meters. The wall was clad with lime plaster, regularly renewed. Towers protruded outwards from it. The Oppidum of Manching (German: Oppidum von Manching) was a large Celtic proto-urban or city-like settlement at modern-day Manching (near Ingolstadt), Bavaria (Germany). The settlement was founded in the 3rd century BC and existed until c. 50–30 BC. It reached its largest extent during the late La Tène period (late 2nd century BC), when it had a size of 380 hectares. At that time, 5,000 to 10,000 people lived within its 7.2 km long walls. The oppidum of Bibracte is another example of a Gaulish fortified settlement. === Bronze and Iron Age Near East === The term casemate wall is used in the archeology of Israel and the wider Near East, having the meaning of a double wall protecting a city or fortress, with transverse walls separating the space between the walls into chambers. These could be used as such, for storage or residential purposes, or could be filled with soil and rocks during siege in order to raise the resistance of the outer wall against battering rams. Originally thought to have been introduced to the region by the Hittites, this has been disproved by the discovery of examples predating their arrival, the earliest being at Ti'inik (Taanach) where such a wall has been dated to the 16th century BC. Casemate walls became a common type of fortification in the Southern Levant between the Middle Bronze Age (MB) and Iron Age II, being more numerous during the Iron Age and peaking in Iron Age II (10th–6th century BC). However, the construction of casemate walls had begun to be replaced by sturdier solid walls by the 9th century BC, probably due the development of more effective battering rams by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Casemate walls could surround an entire settlement, but most only protected part of it. The three different types included freestanding casemate walls, then integrated ones where the inner wall was part of the outer buildings of the settlement, and finally filled casemate walls, where the rooms between the walls were filled with soil right away, allowing for a quick, but nevertheless stable construction of particularly high walls. === Ancient Rome === The Romans fortified their cities with massive, mortar-bound stone walls. The most famous of these are the largely extant Aurelian Walls of Rome and the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, together with partial remains elsewhere. These are mostly city gates, like the Porta Nigra in Trier or Newport Arch in Lincoln. Hadrian's Wall was built by the Roman Empire across the width of what is now northern England following a visit by Roman Emperor Hadrian (AD 76–138) in AD 122. === Indian subcontinent === A number of forts dating from the Later Stone Age to the British Raj are found in the mainland Indian subcontinent (modern day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal). ""Fort"" is the word used in India for all old fortifications. Numerous Indus Valley Civilization sites exhibit evidence of fortifications. By about 3500 BC, hundreds of small farming villages dotted the Indus floodplain. Many of these settlements had fortifications and planned streets. The stone and mud brick houses of Kot Diji were clustered behind massive stone flood dykes and defensive walls, for neighboring communities bickered constantly about the control of prime agricultural land. The fortification varies by site. While Dholavira has stone-built fortification walls, Harrapa is fortified using baked bricks; sites such as Kalibangan exhibit mudbrick fortifications with bastions and Lothal has a quadrangular fortified layout. Evidence also suggested of fortifications in Mohenjo-daro. Even a small town—for instance, Kotada Bhadli, exhibiting sophisticated fortification-like bastions—shows that nearly all major and minor towns of the Indus Valley Civilization were fortified. Forts also appeared in urban cities of the Gangetic valley during the second urbanization period between 600 and 200 BC, and as many as 15 fortification sites have been identified by archeologists throughout the Gangetic valley, such as Kaushambi, Mahasthangarh, Pataliputra, Mathura, Ahichchhatra, Rajgir, and Lauria Nandangarh. The earliest Mauryan period brick fortification occurs in one of the stupa mounds of Lauria Nandangarh, which is 1.6 km in perimeter and oval in plan and encloses a habitation area.Mundigak (c. 2500 BC) in present-day south-east Afghanistan has defensive walls and square bastions of sun dried bricks. India currently has over 180 forts, with the state of Maharashtra alone having over 70 forts, which are also known as durg, many of them built by Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire. A large majority of forts in India are in North India. The most notable forts are the Red Fort at Old Delhi, the Red Fort at Agra, the Chittor Fort and Mehrangarh Fort in Rajasthan, the Ranthambhor Fort, Amer Fort and Jaisalmer Fort also in Rajasthan and Gwalior Fort in Madhya Pradesh. Arthashastra, the Indian treatise on military strategy describes six major types of forts differentiated by their major modes of defenses. ==== Sri Lanka ==== Forts in Sri Lanka date back thousands of years, with many being built by Sri Lankan kings. These include several walled cities. With the outset of colonial rule in the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka was occupied by several major colonial empires that from time to time became the dominant power in the Indian Ocean. The colonists built several western-style forts, mostly in and around the coast of the island. The first to build colonial forts in Sri Lanka were the Portuguese; these forts were captured and later expanded by the Dutch. The British occupied these Dutch forts during the Napoleonic wars. Most of the colonial forts were garrisoned up until the early 20th century. The coastal forts had coastal artillery manned by the Ceylon Garrison Artillery during the two world wars. Most of these were abandoned by the military but retained civil administrative officers, while others retained military garrisons, which were more administrative than operational. Some were reoccupied by military units with the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War; Jaffna fort, for example, came under siege several times. === China === Large tempered earth (i.e. rammed earth) walls were built in ancient China since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1050 BC); the capital at ancient Ao had enormous walls built in this fashion (see siege for more info). Although stone walls were built in China during the Warring States (481–221 BC), mass conversion to stone architecture did not begin in earnest until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The Great Wall of China had been built since the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC), although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD). In addition to the Great Wall, a number of Chinese cities also employed the use of defensive walls to defend their cities. Notable Chinese city walls include the city walls of Hangzhou, Nanking, the Old City of Shanghai, Suzhou, Xi'an and the walled villages of Hong Kong. The famous walls of the Forbidden City in Beijing were established in the early 15th century by the Yongle Emperor. The Forbidden City made up the inner portion of the Beijing city fortifications. === Philippines === ==== Spanish colonial fortifications ==== During the Spanish Era several forts and outposts were built throughout the archipelago. Most notable is Intramuros, the old walled city of Manila located along the southern bank of the Pasig River. The historic city was home to centuries-old churches, schools, convents, government buildings and residences, the best collection of Spanish colonial architecture before much of it was destroyed by the bombs of World War II. Of all the buildings within the 67-acre city, only one building, the San Agustin Church, survived the war. Partial listing of Spanish forts: Intramuros, Manila Cuartel de Santo Domingo, Santa Rosa, Laguna Fuerza de Cuyo, Cuyo, Palawan Fuerza de Cagayancillo, Cagayancillo, Palawan Real Fuerza de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Zaragoza, Zamboanga City Fuerza de San Felipe, Cavite City Fuerza de San Pedro, Cebu Fuerte de la Concepcion y del Triunfo, Ozamiz, Misamis Occidental Fuerza de San Antonio Abad, Manila Fuerza de Pikit, Pikit, Cotabato Fuerza de Santiago, Romblon, Romblon Fuerza de Jolo, Jolo, Sulu Fuerza de Masbate, Masbate Fuerza de Bongabong, Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro Cotta de Dapitan, Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte Fuerte de Alfonso XII, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur Fuerza de Bacolod, Bacolod, Lanao del Norte Guinsiliban Watchtower, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Laguindingan Watchtower, Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental Kutang San Diego, Gumaca, Quezon Baluarte Luna, Luna, La Union ==== Local fortifications ==== The Ivatan people of the northern islands of Batanes built their so-called idjang on hills and elevated areas to protect themselves during times of war. These fortifications were likened to European castles because of their purpose. Usually, the only entrance to the castles would be via a rope ladder that would only be lowered for the villagers and could be kept away when invaders arrived. The Igorots built forts made of stone walls that averaged several meters in width and about two to three times the width in height around 2000 BC. The Muslim Filipinos of the south built strong fortresses called kota or moong to protect their communities. Usually, many of the occupants of these kotas are entire families rather than just warriors. Lords often had their own kotas to assert their right to rule, it served not only as a military installation but as a palace for the local Lord. It is said that at the height of the Maguindanao Sultanate's power, they blanketed the areas around Western Mindanao with kotas and other fortifications to block the Spanish advance into the region. These kotas were usually made of stone and bamboo or other light materials and surrounded by trench networks. As a result, some of these kotas were burned easily or destroyed. With further Spanish campaigns in the region, the sultanate was subdued and a majority of kotas dismantled or destroyed. kotas were not only used by the Muslims as defense against Spaniards and other foreigners, renegades and rebels also built fortifications in defiance of other chiefs in the area. During the American occupation, rebels built strongholds and the datus, rajahs, or sultans often built and reinforced their kotas in a desperate bid to maintain rule over their subjects and their land. Many of these forts were also destroyed by American expeditions, as a result, very very few kotas still stand to this day. Notable kotas: Kota Selurong: an outpost of the Bruneian Empire in Luzon, later became the City of Manila. Kuta Wato/Kota Bato: Literally translates to ""stone fort"" the first known stone fortification in the country, its ruins exist as the ""Kutawato Cave Complex"" Kota Sug/Jolo: The capital and seat of the Sultanate of Sulu. When it was occupied by the Spaniards in the 1870s they converted the kota into the world's smallest walled city. === Pre-Islamic Arabia === ==== During Muhammad's lifetime ==== During Muhammad's era in Arabia, many tribes made use of fortifications. In the Battle of the Trench, the largely outnumbered defenders of Medina, mainly Muslims led by Islamic prophet Muhammad, dug a trench, which together with Medina's natural fortifications, rendered the confederate cavalry (consisting of horses and camels) useless, locking the two sides in a stalemate. Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the Medina-allied Banu Qurayza to attack the city from the south. However, Muhammad's diplomacy derailed the negotiations, and broke up the confederacy against him. The well-organized defenders, the sinking of confederate morale, and poor weather conditions caused the siege to end in a fiasco. During the Siege of Ta'if in January 630, Muhammad ordered his followers to attack enemies who fled from the Battle of Hunayn and sought refuge in the fortress of Taif. === Islamic world === === Africa === The entire city of Kerma in Nubia (present day Sudan) was encompassed by fortified walls surrounded by a ditch. Archeology has revealed various Bronze Age bastions and foundations constructed of stone together with either baked or unfired brick. The walls of Benin are described as the world's second longest man-made structure, as well as the most extensive earthwork in the world, by the Guinness Book of Records, 1974. The walls may have been constructed between the thirteenth and mid-fifteenth century CE or, during the first millennium CE. Strong citadels were also built other in areas of Africa. Yorubaland for example had several sites surrounded by the full range of earthworks and ramparts seen elsewhere, and sited on ground. This improved defensive potential—such as hills and ridges. Yoruba fortifications were often protected with a double wall of trenches and ramparts, and in the Congo forests concealed ditches and paths, along with the main works, often bristled with rows of sharpened stakes. Inner defenses were laid out to blunt an enemy penetration with a maze of defensive walls allowing for entrapment and crossfire on opposing forces. A military tactic of the Ashanti was to create powerful log stockades at key points. This was employed in later wars against the British to block British advances. Some of these fortifications were over a hundred yards long, with heavy parallel tree trunks. They were impervious to destruction by artillery fire. Behind these stockades, numerous Ashanti soldiers were mobilized to check enemy movement. While formidable in construction, many of these strongpoints failed because Ashanti guns, gunpowder and bullets were poor, and provided little sustained killing power in defense. Time and time again British troops overcame or bypassed the stockades by mounting old-fashioned bayonet charges, after laying down some covering fire. Defensive works were of importance in the tropical African Kingdoms. In the Kingdom of Kongo field fortifications were characterized by trenches and low earthen embankments. Such strongpoints ironically, sometimes held up much better against European cannon than taller, more imposing structures. === Medieval Europe === Roman forts and hill forts were the main antecedents of castles in Europe, which emerged in the 9th century in the Carolingian Empire. The Early Middle Ages saw the creation of some towns built around castles. These cities were only rarely protected by simple stone walls and more usually by a combination of both walls and ditches. From the 12th century, hundreds of settlements of all sizes were founded all across Europe, which very often obtained the right of fortification soon afterward. The founding of urban centers was an important means of territorial expansion and many cities, especially in eastern Europe, were founded precisely for this purpose during the period of Ostsiedlung. These cities are easy to recognize due to their regular layout and large market spaces. The fortifications of these settlements were continuously improved to reflect the current level of military development. During the Renaissance era, the Venetian Republic raised great walls around cities, and the finest examples, among others, are in Nicosia (Cyprus), Rocca di Manerba del Garda (Lombardy), and Palmanova (Italy), or Dubrovnik (Croatia), which proved to be futile against attacks but still stand to this day. Unlike the Venetians, the Ottomans used to build smaller fortifications but in greater numbers, and only rarely fortified entire settlements such as Počitelj, Vratnik, and Jajce in Bosnia. === Development after introduction of firearms === Medieval-style fortifications were largely made obsolete by the arrival of cannons on the 14th century battlefield. Fortifications in the age of black powder evolved into much lower structures with greater use of ditches and earth ramparts that would absorb and disperse the energy of cannon fire. Walls exposed to direct cannon fire were very vulnerable, so were sunk into ditches fronted by earth slopes. This placed a heavy emphasis on the geometry of the fortification to allow defensive cannonry interlocking fields of fire to cover all approaches to the lower and thus more vulnerable walls. The evolution of this new style of fortification can be seen in transitional forts such as Sarzanello in North West Italy which was built between 1492 and 1502. Sarzanello consists of both crenellated walls with towers typical of the medieval period but also has a ravelin like angular gun platform screening one of the curtain walls which is protected from flanking fire from the towers of the main part of the fort. Another example is the fortifications of Rhodes which were frozen in 1522 so that Rhodes is the only European walled town that still shows the transition between the classical medieval fortification and the modern ones. A manual about the construction of fortification was published by Giovanni Battista Zanchi in 1554. Fortifications also extended in depth, with protected batteries for defensive cannonry, to allow them to engage attacking cannons to keep them at a distance and prevent them from bearing directly on the vulnerable walls. The result was star shaped fortifications with tier upon tier of hornworks and bastions, of which Fort Bourtange is an excellent example. There are also extensive fortifications from this era in the Nordic states and in Britain, the fortifications of Berwick-upon-Tweed and the harbor archipelago of Suomenlinna at Helsinki being fine examples. === 19th century === During the 18th century, it was found that the continuous enceinte, or main defensive enclosure of a bastion fortress, could not be made large enough to accommodate the enormous field armies which were increasingly being employed in Europe; neither could the defenses be constructed far enough away from the fortress town to protect the inhabitants from bombardment by the besiegers, the range of whose guns was steadily increasing as better manufactured weapons were introduced. Therefore, since refortifying the Prussian fortress cities of Koblenz and Köln after 1815, the principle of the ring fortress or girdle fortress was used: forts, each several hundred meters out from the original enceinte, were carefully sited so as to make best use of the terrain and to be capable of mutual support with neighboring forts. Gone were citadels surrounding towns: forts were to be moved some distance away from cities to keep the enemy at a distance so their artillery could not bombard said urbanized settlements. From now on a ring of forts were to be built at a spacing that would allow them to effectively cover the intervals between them. The arrival of explosive shells in the 19th century led to yet another stage in the evolution of fortification. Star forts did not fare well against the effects of high explosives and the intricate arrangements of bastions, flanking batteries and the carefully constructed lines of fire for the defending cannon could be rapidly disrupted by explosive shells. Worse, the large open ditches surrounding forts of this type were an integral part of the defensive scheme, as was the covered way at the edge of the counterscarp. The ditch was extremely vulnerable to bombardment with explosive shells. In response, military engineers evolved the polygonal style of fortification. The ditch became deep and vertically sided, cut directly into the native rock or soil, laid out as a series of straight lines creating the central fortified area that gives this style of fortification its name. Wide enough to be an impassable barrier for attacking troops but narrow enough to be a difficult target for enemy shellfire, the ditch was swept by fire from defensive blockhouses set in the ditch as well as firing positions cut into the outer face of the ditch itself. The profile of the fort became very low indeed, surrounded outside the ditch covered by caponiers by a gently sloping open area so as to eliminate possible cover for enemy forces, while the fort itself provided a minimal target for enemy fire. The entrypoint became a sunken gatehouse in the inner face of the ditch, reached by a curving ramp that gave access to the gate via a rolling bridge that could be withdrawn into the gatehouse. Much of the fort moved underground. Deep passages and tunnel networks now connected the blockhouses and firing points in the ditch to the fort proper, with magazines and machine rooms deep under the surface. The guns, however, were often mounted in open emplacements and protected only by a parapet; both in order to keep a lower profile and also because experience with guns in closed casemates had seen them put out of action by rubble as their own casemates were collapsed around them. The new forts abandoned the principle of the bastion, which had also been made obsolete by advances in arms. The outline was a much-simplified polygon, surrounded by a ditch. These forts, built in masonry and shaped stone, were designed to shelter their garrison against bombardment. One organizing feature of the new system involved the construction of two defensive curtains: an outer line of forts, backed by an inner ring or line at critical points of terrain or junctions (see, for example, Séré de Rivières system in France). Traditional fortification however continued to be applied by European armies engaged in warfare in colonies established in Africa against lightly armed attackers from amongst the indigenous population. A relatively small number of defenders in a fort impervious to primitive weaponry could hold out against high odds, the only constraint being the supply of ammunition. === 20th and 21st centuries === Steel-and-concrete fortifications were common during the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the advances in modern warfare since World War I have made large-scale fortifications obsolete in most situations. In the 1930s and 1940s, some fortifications were built with designs taking into consideration the new threat of aerial warfare, such as Fort Campbell in Malta. Despite this, only underground bunkers are still able to provide some protection in modern wars. Many historical fortifications were demolished during the modern age, but a considerable number survive as popular tourist destinations and prominent local landmarks today. The downfall of permanent fortifications had two causes: The ever-escalating power, speed, and reach of artillery and airpower meant that almost any target that could be located could be destroyed if sufficient force were massed against it. As such, the more resources a defender devoted to reinforcing a fortification, the more combat power that fortification justified being devoted to destroying it, if the fortification's destruction was demanded by an attacker's strategy. From World War II, bunker busters were used against fortifications. By 1950, nuclear weapons were capable of destroying entire cities and producing dangerous radiation. This led to the creation of civilian nuclear air raid shelters. The second weakness of permanent fortification was its very permanency. Because of this, it was often easier to go around a fortification and, with the rise of mobile warfare in the beginning of World War II, this became a viable offensive choice. When a defensive line was too extensive to be entirely bypassed, massive offensive might could be massed against one part of the line allowing a breakthrough, after which the rest of the line could be bypassed. Such was the fate of the many defensive lines built before and during World War II, such as the Siegfried Line, the Stalin Line, and the Atlantic Wall. This was not the case with the Maginot Line; it was designed to force the Germans to invade other countries (Belgium or Switzerland) to go around it, and was successful in that sense. Instead field fortification rose to dominate defensive action. Unlike the trench warfare which dominated World War I, these defenses were more temporary in nature. This was an advantage because since it was less extensive it formed a less obvious target for enemy force to be directed against. If sufficient power were massed against one point to penetrate it, the forces based there could be withdrawn and the line could be reestablished relatively quickly. Instead of a supposedly impenetrable defensive line, such fortifications emphasized defense in depth, so that as defenders were forced to pull back or were overrun, the lines of defenders behind them could take over the defense. Because the mobile offensives practiced by both sides usually focused on avoiding the strongest points of a defensive line, these defenses were usually relatively thin and spread along the length of a line. The defense was usually not equally strong throughout, however. The strength of the defensive line in an area varied according to how rapidly an attacking force could progress in the terrain that was being defended—both the terrain the defensive line was built on and the ground behind it that an attacker might hope to break out into. This was both for reasons of the strategic value of the ground, and its defensive value. This was possible because while offensive tactics were focused on mobility, so were defensive tactics. The dug-in defenses consisted primarily of infantry and antitank guns. Defending tanks and tank destroyers would be concentrated in mobile brigades behind the defensive line. If a major offensive was launched against a point in the line, mobile reinforcements would be sent to reinforce that part of the line that was in danger of failing. Thus the defensive line could be relatively thin because the bulk of the fighting power of the defenders was not concentrated in the line itself but rather in the mobile reserves. A notable exception to this rule was seen in the defensive lines at the Battle of Kursk during World War II, where German forces deliberately attacked the strongest part of the Soviet defenses, seeking to crush them utterly. The terrain that was being defended was of primary importance because open terrain that tanks could move over quickly made possible rapid advances into the defenders' rear areas that were very dangerous to the defenders. Thus such terrain had to be defended at all costs. In addition, since in theory the defensive line only had to hold out long enough for mobile reserves to reinforce it, terrain that did not permit rapid advance could be held more weakly because the enemy's advance into it would be slower, giving the defenders more time to reinforce that point in the line. For example, the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest in Germany during the closing stages of World War II is an excellent example of how difficult terrain could be used to the defenders' advantage. After World War II, intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching much of the way around the world were developed, so speed became an essential characteristic of the strongest militaries and defenses. Missile silos were developed, so missiles could be fired from the middle of a country and hit cities and targets in another country, and airplanes (and aircraft carriers) became major defenses and offensive weapons (leading to an expansion of the use of airports and airstrips as fortifications). Mobile defenses could be had underwater, too, in the form of ballistic missile submarines capable of firing submarine launched ballistic missiles. Some bunkers in the mid to late 20th century came to be buried deep inside mountains and prominent rocks, such as Gibraltar and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. On the ground itself, minefields have been used as hidden defenses in modern warfare, often remaining long after the wars that produced them have ended. Demilitarized zones along borders are arguably another type of fortification, although a passive kind, providing a buffer between potentially hostile militaries. === Military airfields === Military airfields offer a fixed ""target rich"" environment for even relatively small enemy forces, using hit-and-run tactics by ground forces, stand-off attacks (mortars and rockets), air attacks, or ballistic missiles. Key targets—aircraft, munitions, fuel, and vital technical personnel—can be protected by fortifications. Aircraft can be protected by revetments, hesco barriers, hardened aircraft shelters and underground hangars which will protect from many types of attack. Larger aircraft types tend to be based outside the operational theater. Munition storage follows safety rules which use fortifications (bunkers and bunds) to provide protection against accident and chain reactions (sympathetic detonations). Weapons for rearming aircraft can be stored in small fortified expense stores closer to the aircraft. At Biên Hòa, South Vietnam, on the morning of May 16, 1965, as aircraft were being refueled and armed, a chain reaction explosion destroyed 13 aircraft, killed 34 personnel, and injured over 100; this, along with damage and losses of aircraft to enemy attack (by both infiltration and stand-off attacks), led to the construction of revetments and shelters to protect aircraft throughout South Vietnam. Aircrew and ground personnel will need protection during enemy attacks and fortifications range from culvert section ""duck and cover"" shelters to permanent air raid shelters. Soft locations with high personnel densities such as accommodation and messing facilities can have limited protection by placing prefabricated concrete walls or barriers around them, examples of barriers are Jersey Barriers, T Barriers or Splinter Protection Units (SPUs). Older fortification may prove useful such as the old 'Yugo' pyramid shelters built in the 1980s which were used by US personnel on 8 Jan 2020 when Iran fired 11 ballistic missiles at Ayn al-Asad Airbase in Iraq. Fuel is volatile and has to comply with rules for storage which provide protection against accidents. Fuel in underground bulk fuel installations is well protected though valves and controls are vulnerable to enemy action. Above-ground tanks can be susceptible to attack. Ground support equipment will need to be protected by fortifications to be usable after an enemy attack. Permanent (concrete) guard fortifications are safer, stronger, last longer and are more cost-effective than sandbag fortifications. Prefabricated positions can be made from concrete culvert sections. The British Yarnold Bunker is made from sections of a concrete pipe. Guard towers provide an increased field of view but a lower level of protection. Dispersal and camouflage of assets can supplement fortifications against some forms of airfield attack. ==== Counterinsurgency ==== Just as in colonial periods, comparatively obsolete fortifications are still used for low intensity conflicts. Such fortifications range in size from small patrol bases or forward operating bases up to huge airbases such as Camp Bastion/Leatherneck in Afghanistan. Much like in the 18th and 19th century, because the enemy is not a powerful military force with the heavy weaponry required to destroy fortifications, walls of gabion, sandbag or even simple mud can provide protection against small arms and antitank weapons—although such fortifications are still vulnerable to mortar and artillery fire. == Forts == Forts in modern American usage often refer to space set aside by governments for a permanent military facility; these often do not have any actual fortifications, and can have specializations (military barracks, administration, medical facilities, or intelligence). However, there are some modern fortifications that are referred to as forts. These are typically small semipermanent fortifications. In urban combat, they are built by upgrading existing structures such as houses or public buildings. In field warfare they are often log, sandbag or gabion type construction. Such forts are typically only used in low-level conflicts, such as counterinsurgency conflicts or very low-level conventional conflicts, such as the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, which saw the use of log forts for use by forward platoons and companies. The reason for this is that static above-ground forts cannot survive modern direct or indirect fire weapons larger than mortars, RPGs and small arms. == Prisons and others == Fortifications designed to keep the inhabitants of a facility in rather than attacker out can also be found, in prisons, concentration camps, and other such facilities. Those are covered in other articles, as most prisons and concentration camps are not primarily military forts (although forts, camps, and garrison towns have been used as prisons and/or concentration camps; such as Theresienstadt, Guantanamo Bay detention camp and the Tower of London for example). == Field fortifications == == Notes == == References == This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Jackson, Louis Charles (1911).

It is the dilactone of hexahydroxydiphenic acid. == Name == The name comes from the French term acide ellagique, from the word galle spelled backward because it can be obtained from noix de galle (galls), and to distinguish it from acide gallique (gallic acid). The molecule structure resembles to that of two gallic acid molecules being assembled ""head to tail"" and bound together by a C–C bond (as in biphenyl, or in diphenic acid) and two lactone links (cyclic carboxylic esters). == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Plants produce ellagic acid from hydrolysis of tannins such as ellagitannin and geraniin. === Biodegradation === Urolithins are gut flora human metabolites of dietary ellagic acid derivatives. Ellagic acid has low bioavailability, with 90% remaining unabsorbed from the intestines until metabolized by microflora to the more bioavailable urolithins. == History == Ellagic acid was first discovered by chemist Henri Braconnot in 1831. Maximilian Nierenstein prepared this substance from algarobilla, dividivi, oak bark, pomegranate, myrabolams, and valonea in 1905. He also suggested its formation from galloyl-glycine by Penicillium in 1915. Julius Löwe was the first person to synthesize ellagic acid by heating gallic acid with arsenic acid or silver oxide. == Natural occurrences == Ellagic acid is found in edible nuts. It is also found in oak species such as the North American white oak (Quercus alba) and European red oak (Quercus robur). The macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum produces ellagic acid. Ellagic acid can be found in the medicinal mushroom Phellinus linteus. === In food === The highest levels of ellagic acid are found in raw chestnuts, walnuts, pecans, cranberries, raspberries, strawberries, and grapes, as well as distilled beverages. It is also found in peaches and pomegranates. == Research and health claims == Ellagic acid has been marketed as a dietary supplement with various claimed benefits against cancer, heart disease, and other diseases. In the 21st century, numerous U.S.-based supplement companies received FDA warning letters for promoting ellagic acid with false anti-disease claims that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

In September 2005, Dynogen commenced a phase II proof-of-concept trial of pumosetrag in IBS with constipation; positive results were reported in February 2007 and a phase IIb trial was to start in the fourth quarter of 2007. In September 2006, the company had initiated a phase Ib trial in nocturnal GERD. Low basal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and transient LES relaxations are major causes of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

50,"('Cefditoren (pivoxil)', 'Cefditoren pivoxyl', 'Cefditoren pivaloyloxymethyl ester', 'Me 1207', 'Cefditoren pivoxil')",Medical,"Cefditoren, also known as cefditoren pivoxil is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. It is mainly used for treatment of community acquired pneumonia. It is taken by mouth and is in the cephalosporin family of antibiotics, which is part of the broader beta-lactam group of antibiotics. == Structure == Like other cephalosporins, cefditoren has a β-lactam ring at the 7 position of cephalosporin ring that is responsible for its inhibitory action on bacterial cell wall synthesis. In addition to the cephem nucleus common to all cephalosporins, cefditoren has an aminothiazole group that enhances its activity against Gram-negative organisms, a methylthiazole group that enhances its activity against Gram-positive organisms, a methoxyimino group that gives it stability against β-lactamases, and a pivoxil ester group that enhances oral bioavailability. == Antimicrobial activity == The spectrum of cefditoren includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. It has strong antimicrobial activity because of its high affinity for penicillin binding protein 2X, which responsible for cephalosporin resistance when mutated. Cefditoren pivoxil high intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains. Cefditoren holds a balanced antimicrobial spectrum that includes the three major pathogens of community-acquired lower-respiratory tract infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains, including β-lactamase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase-producing strains), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (including β-lactamase-producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase-producing strains. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Oral bioavailability: following oral administration, cefditoren pivoxil is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydrolyzed to cefditoren by esterases. Maximal plasma concentrations of cefditoren under fasting conditions average 1.8 ± 0.6 μg/mL following 200 mg dose and occur 1.5 to 3 hours following dosing. Cefditoren does not accumulate in plasma following twice daily administration to subjects with normal renal function. Under fasting conditions, the estimated absolute bioavailability of cefditoren pivoxil is approximately 14%. === Distribution === Binding of cefditoren to plasma proteins averages 88%, and the mean volume of distribution of cefditoren at steady state is 9.3L. Cefditoren has been shown to penetrate into bronchial mucosa, epithelial lining fluid, skin blister fluid and tonsillar tissue and clinically relevant concentrations against common pathogens are achieved in these tissues for at least 4 hours. === Metabolism and Excretion === Cefditoren is predominantly eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged drug and has a renal clearance of 4.1–5.6 L/h after multiple doses; its elimination half-life is 1.5 hours. == Medical uses == Cefditoren pivoxil is indicated to treat uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, otitis media (indications may differ in some countries). === Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility === Cefditoren pivoxil has a broad spectrum of activity and has been used to treat bacterial infections of the skin and respiratory tract, including bronchitis, pneumonia, and tonsillitis. The following represents minimum inhibitory concentration data for several medically significant microorganisms. Haemophilus influenzae: ≥0.063 – 0.25 μg/ml Staphylcoccus aureus: 0.25 – >128 μg/ml (not including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) Streptococcus pyogenes: ≤0.004 – 2 μg/ml Cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. == Dosage and administration == === Adults and Adolescents (≥12 Years) === Community-acquired pneumonia: 400 mg twice daily for 14 days Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis: 400 mg twice daily for 10 days Pharyngitis/tonsillitis, otitis media, sinusitis: 200 mg twice daily for 10 days Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections: 200 mg twice daily for 10 days === Children (2 months to 12 years of age) === Pneumonia, otitis media or sinusitis: 3 mg/kg/dose, 3 times a day, after meals. The dosage may be increased up to 6 mg/kg/dose as needed, but not exceed the maximum dose for adults. For children with diseases other than above: 3 mg/kg/dose, 3 times a day after meals. The dosage may be adjusted according to the disease or the patients age and symptoms, but not exceed the maximum dose for adults. Safety in low birth weight infants and newborns has not been established. == Pregnancy == === Pregnancy Category B === Cefditoren pivoxil was not teratogenic up to the highest doses tested in rats and rabbits. In rats, this dose was 1000 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 24 times a human dose of 200 mg twice daily based on mg/m2/day. In rabbits, the highest dose tested was 90 mg/kg/day, which is approximately four times a human dose of 200 mg twice daily based on mg/m2/day. This dose produced severe maternal toxicity and resulted in fetal toxicity and abortions. In a postnatal development study in rats, cefditoren pivoxil produced no adverse effects on postnatal survival, physical and behavioral development, learning abilities, and reproductive capability at sexual maturity when tested at doses of up to 750 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. This is approximately 18 times a human dose of 200 mg twice daily based on mg/m2/day. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. == Geriatric use == Of the 2675 patients in clinical studies who received cefditoren pivoxil 200 mg twice daily, 308 (12%) were >65 years of age. Of the 2159 patients in clinical studies who received cefditoren pivoxil 400 mg twice daily, 307 (14%) were >65 years of age. No clinically significant differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between older and younger patients. No dose adjustments are necessary in geriatric patients with normal renal function. This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. == International approvals == Cefditoren pivoxil is available as 200 and 400 mg tablets in the United States. It was marketed under the trade name Spectracef by Vansen Pharma Inc. Cefditoren is also marketed under the name Meiact by Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd. In India it is marketed under the brand name Zostum-O by Zuventus Healthcare. === Proprietary Preparations and Countries === US:Spectracef; India:Zostum-O; Japan:Meiact; Russia:Spectracef; China:Meiact; Greece:Spectracef; Indonesia:Meiact; Italy:Giasion; Mexico:Spectracef; Portugal:Meiact; Thailand:Meiact; Turkey: Cftiten, Meiact; Sefporin Spain: Spectracef, Meiact. == Contraindications == In patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics or any of its components. Patients with carnitine deficiency or inborn errors of metabolism that may result in clinically significant carnitine deficiency, because use of cefditoren causes renal excretion of carnitine. == Safety and tolerability == Cefditoren pivoxil is generally well-tolerated, with most adverse events being of mild-to-moderate severity and self-limiting. Gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g., diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain) were the most commonly reported adverse events, although they seldom led to treatment discontinuation. In a post-marketing surveillance evaluating safety in 2006 children with acute otitis media treated with cefditoren (median daily dose: 10.0 mg/kg with a median total treatment period of 7 days), the incidence of adverse reactions was 1.79%, without unexpected or serious adverse drug reactions reported. The most frequent adverse drug reaction was diarrhea (1.30%) that resolved or subsided during treatment or after discontinuation or completion of therapy in all cases. Data from the clinical studies carried out with cefditoren in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis from 2007 to 2010 in Japan showed that the percentage of adverse events was very low and diarrhea was the most frequent event. In the largest study (734 children), the incidence of adverse reactions was 1.50% (11 events in 11 patients), with 3 events of diarrhea and three of hematuria in urinalysis without clinical symptoms. In a study carried out in children in Thailand comparing cefditoren (66 patients) with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (72 patients) for 10 days in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, the most frequent adverse event was diarrhea, with significant (P = 0.02) differences in the percentages found for both compounds (4.5% with cefditoren vs. 18.1% for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid). == Guidelines == === Japanese Guidelines === Japanese guidelines for the management of respiratory infectious diseases in children recommend cefditoren pivoxil as an initial antimicrobial therapy in children (2 months and older). === A panel of 70 pulmonologists, coordinated by 9 experts in respiratory care recommendations === A consensus on appropriate prescribing in lower respiratory tract infection therapy was appraised by Delphi exercise, based on a panel of 70 pulmonologists, coordinated by a scientific committee of nine experts in respiratory medical care. Amongst 3rd-generation oral cephalosporins, cefditoren pivoxil has the highest intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-resistant strains included. Amongst 3rd-generation oral cephalosporins, the spectrum of cefditoren is particularly balanced, includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. The experts expressed the opinion that, due to its high intrinsic activity, cefditoren appears as an appropriate agent for either the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and for parenteral to oral switch therapy as well. == Ideal for switch therapy == The characteristics of oral antibiotics to be considered for the switch therapy (parenteral to oral antibiotic) are: (i) similar antimicrobial spectrum, (ii) high bioavailability, (iii) administration time 12–24 hours, (iv) good tolerability The expert panel reached a high level of consensus on cefditoren pivoxil as the most appropriate option for the switch therapy from parenteral third-generation cephalosporins (like cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) to oral therapy, because of the similar spectrum and the highest intrinsic activity. == References == == External links == Drug Approval Package Manufacturer's Product website Manufacturer's prescribing information for Spectracef",Cefditoren pivoxil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.9205850296420977e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000346362212439999)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cefditoren,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12389878/,https://www.acipharma.net/products/ceftoren ', [])"
51,"('Lipoic acid', '(r)-œ±-lipoic acid', 'R-thioctic acid', '(r)-lipoic acid', '(r)-5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid')","Endogenous, Medical, Personal Care","Lipoic acid (LA), also known as α-lipoic acid, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and thioctic acid, is an organosulfur compound derived from caprylic acid (octanoic acid). ALA, which is made in animals normally, is essential for aerobic metabolism. It is also available as a dietary supplement or pharmaceutical drug in some countries. Lipoate is the conjugate base of lipoic acid, and the most prevalent form of LA under physiological conditions. Only the (R)-(+)-enantiomer (RLA) exists in nature. RLA is an essential cofactor of many processes. == Physical and chemical properties == Lipoic acid contains two sulfur atoms connected by a disulfide bond in the 1,2-dithiolane ring. It also carries a carboxylic acid group. It is considered to be oxidized relative to its acyclic relative dihydrolipoic acid, in which each sulfur exists as a thiol. It is a yellow solid. (R)-(+)-lipoic acid (RLA) occurs naturally, but (S)-(-)-lipoic acid (SLA) has been synthesized. For use in dietary supplement materials and compounding pharmacies, the USP established an official monograph for R/S-LA. == Biological function == Lipoic acid is a cofactor for five enzymes or classes of enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, the glycine cleavage system, branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, and the α-oxo(keto)adipate dehydrogenase. The first two are critical to the citric acid cycle. The GCS regulates glycine concentrations. HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6, HDAC8, and HDAC10 are targets of the reduced form (open dithiol) of (R)-lipoic acid. === Biosynthesis and attachment === Most endogenously produced RLA are not ""free"" because octanoic acid, the precursor to RLA, is bound to the enzyme complexes prior to enzymatic insertion of the sulfur atoms. As a cofactor, RLA is covalently attached by an amide bond to a terminal lysine residue of the enzyme's lipoyl domains. The precursor to lipoic acid, octanoic acid, is made via fatty acid biosynthesis in the form of octanoyl-acyl carrier protein. In eukaryotes, a second fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in mitochondria is used for this purpose. The octanoate is transferred as a thioester of acyl carrier protein from fatty acid biosynthesis to an amide of the lipoyl domain protein by an enzyme called an octanoyltransferase. Two hydrogens of octanoate are replaced with sulfur groups via a radical SAM mechanism, by lipoyl synthase. As a result, lipoic acid is synthesized attached to proteins and no free lipoic acid is produced. Lipoic acid can be removed whenever proteins are degraded and by action of the enzyme lipoamidase. Free lipoate can be used by some organisms as an enzyme called lipoate protein ligase that attaches it covalently to the correct protein. The ligase activity of this enzyme requires ATP. === Cellular transport === Along with sodium and the vitamins biotin (B7) and pantothenic acid (B5), lipoic acid enters cells through the SMVT (sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter). Each of the compounds transported by the SMVT is competitive with the others. For example research has shown that increasing intake of lipoic acid or pantothenic acid reduces the uptake of biotin and/or the activities of biotin-dependent enzymes. === Enzymatic activity === Lipoic acid is a cofactor for at least five enzyme systems. Two of these are in the citric acid cycle through which many organisms turn nutrients into energy. Lipoylated enzymes have lipoic acid attached to them covalently. The lipoyl group transfers acyl groups in 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, and methylamine group in the glycine cleavage complex or glycine dehydrogenase. Lipoic acid is the cofactor of the following enzymes in humans: The most-studied of these is the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. These complexes have three central subunits: E1-3, which are the decarboxylase, lipoyl transferase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, respectively. These complexes have a central E2 core and the other subunits surround this core to form the complex. In the gap between these two subunits, the lipoyl domain ferries intermediates between the active sites. The lipoyl domain itself is attached by a flexible linker to the E2 core and the number of lipoyl domains varies from one to three for a given organism. The number of domains has been experimentally varied and seems to have little effect on growth until over nine are added, although more than three decreased activity of the complex. Lipoic acid serves as co-factor to the acetoin dehydrogenase complex catalyzing the conversion of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) to acetaldehyde and acetyl coenzyme A. The glycine cleavage system differs from the other complexes, and has a different nomenclature. In this system, the H protein is a free lipoyl domain with additional helices, the L protein is a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, the P protein is the decarboxylase, and the T protein transfers the methylamine from lipoate to tetrahydrofolate (THF) yielding methylene-THF and ammonia. Methylene-THF is then used by serine hydroxymethyltransferase to synthesize serine from glycine. This system is part of plant photorespiration. === Biological sources and degradation === Lipoic acid is present in many foods in which it is bound to lysine in proteins, but slightly more so in kidney, heart, liver, spinach, broccoli, and yeast extract. Naturally occurring lipoic acid is always covalently bound and not readily available from dietary sources. In addition, the amount of lipoic acid present in dietary sources is low. For instance, the purification of lipoic acid to determine its structure used an estimated 10 tons of liver residue, which yielded 30 mg of lipoic acid. As a result, all lipoic acid available as a supplement is chemically synthesized. Baseline levels (prior to supplementation) of RLA and R-DHLA have not been detected in human plasma. RLA has been detected at 12.3−43.1 ng/mL following acid hydrolysis, which releases protein-bound lipoic acid. Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein bound lipoic acid released 1.4−11.6 ng/mL and <1-38.2 ng/mL using subtilisin and alcalase, respectively. Digestive proteolytic enzymes cleave the R-lipoyllysine residue from the mitochondrial enzyme complexes derived from food but are unable to cleave the lipoic acid-L-lysine amide bond. Both synthetic lipoamide and (R)-lipoyl-L-lysine are rapidly cleaved by serum lipoamidases, which release free (R)-lipoic acid and either L-lysine or ammonia. Little is known about the degradation and utilization of aliphatic sulfides such as lipoic acid, except for cysteine. Lipoic acid is metabolized in a variety of ways when given as a dietary supplement in mammals. Degradation to tetranorlipoic acid, oxidation of one or both of the sulfur atoms to the sulfoxide, and S-methylation of the sulfide were observed. Conjugation of unmodified lipoic acid to glycine was detected especially in mice. Degradation of lipoic acid is similar in humans, although it is not clear if the sulfur atoms become significantly oxidized. Apparently mammals are not capable of utilizing lipoic acid as a sulfur source. == Diseases == === Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) === In the metabolic disease combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) due to ACSF3 deficiency, mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), which is the precursor reaction of lipoic acid biosynthesis, is impaired. The result is a reduced lipoylation degree of important mitochondrial enzymes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-KGDHC). Supplementation with lipoic acid does not restore mitochondrial function. == Chemical synthesis == SLA did not exist prior to chemical synthesis in 1952. SLA is produced in equal amounts with RLA during achiral manufacturing processes. The racemic form was more widely used clinically in Europe and Japan in the 1950s to 1960s despite the early recognition that the various forms of LA are not bioequivalent. The first synthetic procedures appeared for RLA and SLA in the mid-1950s. Advances in chiral chemistry led to more efficient technologies for manufacturing the single enantiomers by both classical resolution and asymmetric synthesis and the demand for RLA also grew at this time. In the 21st century, R/S-LA, RLA and SLA with high chemical and/or optical purities are available in industrial quantities. At the current time, most of the world supply of R/S-LA and RLA is manufactured in China and smaller amounts in Italy, Germany, and Japan. RLA is produced by modifications of a process first described by Georg Lang in a Ph.D. thesis and later patented by DeGussa. Although RLA is favored nutritionally due to its ""vitamin-like"" role in metabolism, both RLA and R/S-LA are widely available as dietary supplements. Both stereospecific and non-stereospecific reactions are known to occur in vivo and contribute to the mechanisms of action, but evidence to date indicates RLA may be the eutomer (the nutritionally and therapeutically preferred form). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === A 2007 human pharmacokinetic study of sodium RLA demonstrated the maximum concentration in plasma and bioavailability are significantly greater than the free acid form, and rivals plasma levels achieved by intravenous administration of the free acid form. Additionally, high plasma levels comparable to those in animal models where Nrf2 was activated were achieved. The various forms of LA are not bioequivalent. Very few studies compare individual enantiomers with racemic lipoic acid. It is unclear if twice as much racemic lipoic acid can replace RLA. The toxic dose of LA in cats is much lower than that in humans or dogs and produces hepatocellular toxicity. === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism and action of lipoic acid when supplied externally to an organism is controversial. Lipoic acid in a cell seems primarily to induce the oxidative stress response rather than directly scavenge free radicals. This effect is specific for RLA. Despite the strongly reducing milieu, LA has been detected intracellularly in both oxidized and reduced forms. LA is able to scavenge reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species in a biochemical assay due to long incubation times, but there is little evidence this occurs within a cell or that radical scavenging contributes to the primary mechanisms of action of LA. The relatively good scavenging activity of LA toward hypochlorous acid (a bactericidal produced by neutrophils that may produce inflammation and tissue damage) is due to the strained conformation of the 5-membered dithiolane ring, which is lost upon reduction to DHLA. In cells, LA is reduced to dihydrolipoic acid, which is generally regarded as the more bioactive form of LA and the form responsible for most of the antioxidant effects and for lowering the redox activities of unbound iron and copper. This theory has been challenged due to the high level of reactivity of the two free sulfhydryls, low intracellular concentrations of DHLA as well as the rapid methylation of one or both sulfhydryls, rapid side-chain oxidation to shorter metabolites and rapid efflux from the cell. Although both DHLA and LA have been found inside cells after administration, most intracellular DHLA probably exists as mixed disulfides with various cysteine residues from cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins. Recent findings suggest therapeutic and anti-aging effects are due to modulation of signal transduction and gene transcription, which improve the antioxidant status of the cell. However, this likely occurs via pro-oxidant mechanisms, not by radical scavenging or reducing effects. All the disulfide forms of LA (R/S-LA, RLA and SLA) can be reduced to DHLA although both tissue specific and stereoselective (preference for one enantiomer over the other) reductions have been reported in model systems. At least two cytosolic enzymes, glutathione reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (Trx1), and two mitochondrial enzymes, lipoamide dehydrogenase and thioredoxin reductase (Trx2), reduce LA. SLA is stereoselectively reduced by cytosolic GR whereas Trx1, Trx2 and lipoamide dehydrogenase stereoselectively reduce RLA. (R)-(+)-lipoic acid is enzymatically or chemically reduced to (R)-(-)-dihydrolipoic acid whereas (S)-(-)-lipoic acid is reduced to (S)-(+)-dihydrolipoic acid. Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) can also form intracellularly and extracellularly via non-enzymatic, thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. RLA may function in vivo like a B-vitamin and at higher doses like plant-derived nutrients, such as curcumin, sulforaphane, resveratrol, and other nutritional substances that induce phase II detoxification enzymes, thus acting as cytoprotective agents. This stress response indirectly improves the antioxidant capacity of the cell. The (S)-enantiomer of LA was shown to be toxic when administered to thiamine-deficient rats. Several studies have demonstrated that SLA either has lower activity than RLA or interferes with the specific effects of RLA by competitive inhibition. == Uses == R/S-LA and RLA are widely available as over-the-counter nutritional supplements in the United States in the form of capsules, tablets, and aqueous liquids, and have been marketed as antioxidants and pertaining to cellular glucose utilization for metabolic disorders and type 2 diabetes. Although the body can synthesize LA, it can also be absorbed from the diet. Dietary supplementation in doses from 200–600 mg is likely to provide up to 1000 times the amount available from a regular diet. Gastrointestinal absorption is variable and decreases with the use of food. It is therefore recommended that dietary LA be taken 30–60 minutes before or at least 120 minutes after a meal. Maximum blood levels of LA are achieved 30–60 minutes after dietary supplementation, and it is thought to be largely metabolized in the liver. In Germany, LA is approved as a drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy since 1966 and is available as a non-prescription pharmaceutical. == Clinical research == According to the American Cancer Society as of 2013, ""there is no reliable scientific evidence at this time that lipoic acid prevents the development or spread of cancer"". As of 2015, intravenously administered ALA is unapproved anywhere in the world except Germany for diabetic neuropathy, but has been proven reasonably safe and effective. As of 2012, there was no good evidence alpha lipoic acid helps people with mitochondrial disorders. A 2018 review recommended ALA as an anti-obesity supplement with low dosage (< 600 mg/day) for a short period (<10 weeks). == Other lipoic acids == β-lipoic acid is a thiosulfinate of α-lipoic acid == See also == Aminolevulinic acid == References == == External links == Media related to Lipoic acid at Wikimedia Commons",Lipoic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.15002676844596863), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.3856492842023727e-06), (' FOOD', -0.1802065521478653), (',', -0.00043138445471413434), (' MED', -0.1275845617055893), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.5911176204681396), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('ĠEND', -0.47419673204421997), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.00012385078298393637), ('ĠFOOD', -1.1801649634435307e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10022146254777908)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.8693714737892151), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.06199805438518524)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([lpi.oregonstate.edu](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/lipoic-acid?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid?utm_source=openai), [foodb.ca](https://foodb.ca/compound_ontology_term/3639061?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=304, start_index=42, title='Lipoic Acid | Linus Pauling Institute | Oregon State University', type='url_citation', url='https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/lipoic-acid?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=304, start_index=42, title='Lipoic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoic_acid?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=304, start_index=42, title='', type='url_citation', url='https://foodb.ca/compound_ontology_term/3639061?utm_source=openai')])"

54,"('Clarithromycin', 'Biaxin', 'Klaricid', 'Clarithromycine', 'Clathromycin')",Medical,"Clarithromycin, sold under the brand name Biaxin among others, is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections. This includes strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, H. pylori infection, and Lyme disease, among others. Clarithromycin can be taken by mouth as a tablet or liquid or can be infused intravenously. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and diarrhea. Severe allergic reactions are rare. Liver problems have been reported. It may cause harm if taken during pregnancy. It is in the macrolide class and works by slowing down bacterial protein synthesis. Clarithromycin resistance is already a major challenge to healthcare systems and such resistance is spreading, leading to recommendations to test the susceptibility of pathogenic organisms to the antibiotic before commencing clarithromycin therapy. Clarithromycin was developed in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Clarithromycin is available as a generic medication. It is made from erythromycin and is chemically known as 6-O-methylerythromycin. == Medical uses == === Antibiotic === Clarithromycin is primarily used to treat a number of bacterial infections including pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, and as an alternative to penicillin in strep throat. Other uses include cat scratch disease and other infections due to Bartonella, cryptosporidiosis, as a second line agent in Lyme disease and toxoplasmosis. It may also be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in those who cannot take penicillin. It is effective against upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections and helicobacter pylori infections associated with duodenal ulcers. ==== Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility ==== Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus parainfluenzae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Helicobacter Helicobacter pylori Mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex consisting of: Mycobacterium avium avium Mycobacterium intracellulare Other bacteria Chlamydia pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae Safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in treating clinical infections due to the following bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus (Groups C, F, G) Viridans group streptococci Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Pasteurella multocida Anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria Clostridium perfringens Peptococcus niger Cutibacterium acnes Anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus) === Idiopathic hypersomnia === Clarithromycin has been researched as a potential treatment for idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in adults, but the evidence is limited. A 2021 Cochrane study determined that the evidence is inadequate to definitively determine the efficacy of clarithromycin in the management of idiopathic hypersomnia. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2021 clinical practice guidelines conditionally suggested its use, especially for those who don't respond to other therapies. == Contraindications == Clarithromycin should not be taken by people who are allergic to other macrolides or inactive ingredients in the tablets, including microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, magnesium stearate, and povidone Clarithromycin should not be used by people with a history of cholestatic jaundice and/or liver dysfunction associated with prior clarithromycin use. Clarithromycin should not be used in the setting of hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) Use of clarithromycin with the following medications: cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, ergotamine, ticagrelor, ranolazine or dihydroergotamine is not recommended. It should not be used with colchicine in people with kidney or liver impairment. Concomitant use with cholesterol medications such as lovastatin or simvastatin. Hypersensitivity to clarithromycin or any component of the product, erythromycin, or any macrolide antibiotics. QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. == Side effects == The most common side effects are gastrointestinal: diarrhea (3%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting (6%). It also can cause headaches, insomnia, and abnormal liver function tests. Allergic reactions include rashes and anaphylaxis. Less common side effects (<1%) include extreme irritability, hallucinations (auditory and visual), dizziness/motion sickness, and alteration in senses of smell and taste, including a metallic taste. Dry mouth, panic attacks, and nightmares have also been reported, albeit less frequently. === Cardiac === In February 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety communication warning with respect to an increased risk for heart problems or death with the use of clarithromycin, and has recommended that alternative antibiotics be considered in those with heart disease. Clarithromycin can lead to a prolonged QT interval. In patients with long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications, this can increase risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. In one trial, the use of short-term clarithromycin treatment was correlated with an increased incidence of deaths classified as sudden cardiac deaths in stable coronary heart disease patients not using statins. === Liver and kidney === Clarithromycin has been known to cause jaundice, cirrhosis, and kidney problems, including kidney failure. Some case reports suspect it of causing liver disease. === Central nervous system === Common adverse effects of clarithromycin in the central nervous system include dizziness, headaches. Rarely, it can cause ototoxicity, delirium and mania. === Infection === A risk of oral candidiasis and vaginal candidiasis, due to the elimination of the yeast's natural bacterial competitors by the antibiotic, has also been noted. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnant women except in situations where no alternative therapy is appropriate. Clarithromycin can cause potential hazard to the fetus hence should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. For lactating mothers it is not known whether clarithromycin is excreted in human milk. == Interactions == Clarithromycin inhibits a liver enzyme, CYP3A4, involved in the metabolism of many other commonly prescribed drugs. Taking clarithromycin with other medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4 may lead to unexpected increases or decreases in drug levels. A few of the common interactions are listed below. === Colchicine === Clarithromycin has been observed to have a dangerous interaction with colchicine as the result of inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolism and P-glycoprotein transport. Combining these two drugs may lead to fatal colchicine toxicity, particularly in people with chronic kidney disease. === Statins === Taking clarithromycin concurrently with certain statins (a class of drugs used to reduce blood serum cholesterol levels) increases the risk of side effects, such as muscle aches and muscle break down (rhabdomyolysis). === Calcium channel blockers === Concurrent therapy with calcium channel blocker may increase risk of low blood pressure, kidney failure, and death, compared to pairing calcium channel blockers with azithromycin, a drug similar to clarithromycin but without CYP3A4 inhibition. Administration of clarithromycin in combination with verapamil have been observed to cause low blood pressure, low heart rate, and lactic acidosis. === Carbamazepine === Clarithromycin may double the level of carbamazepine in the body by reducing its clearance, which may lead to toxic symptoms of carbamazepine, such as double vision, loss of voluntary body movement, and nausea, as well as hyponatremia. === HIV medications === Depending on the combination of medications, clarithromycin therapy could be contraindicated, require changing doses of some medications, or be acceptable without dose adjustments. For example, clarithromycin may lead to decreased zidovudine concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Clarithromycin prevents bacteria from multiplying by acting as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It binds to 23S rRNA, a component of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting the translation of peptides. In addition to its antibiotic activity, clarithromycin has been found to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. In relation to this action, it may have wakefulness-promoting effects in people with hypersomnia. === Pharmacokinetics === Unlike erythromycin, clarithromycin is acid-stable, so can be taken orally without having to be protected from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, clarithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of clarithromycin are released; its concentration in the tissues can be over 10 times higher than in plasma. Highest concentrations are found in liver, lung tissue, and stool. ==== Metabolism ==== Clarithromycin has a fairly rapid first-pass metabolism in the liver. Its major metabolites include an inactive metabolite, N-desmethylclarithromycin, and an active metabolite, 14-(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin. Compared to clarithromycin, 14-(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin is less potent against mycobacterial tuberculosis and the Mycobacterium avium complex. Clarithromycin (20%-40%) and its active metabolite (10%-15%) are excreted in urine. Of all the drugs in its class, clarithromycin has the best bioavailability at 50%, which makes it amenable to oral administration. Its elimination half-life is about 3 to 4 hours with 250 mg administered every 12 h, but increased to 5 to 7 h with 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 h. With any of these dosing regimens, the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 3 to 4 days. == History == Clarithromycin was invented by researchers at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in 1980. The product emerged through efforts to develop a version of the antibiotic erythromycin that did not experience acid instability in the digestive tract, causing side effects, such as nausea and stomachache. Taisho filed for patent protection for the drug around 1980 and subsequently introduced a branded version of its drug, called Clarith, to the Japanese market in 1991. In 1985, Taisho partnered with the American company Abbott Laboratories for the international rights, and Abbott also gained FDA approval for Biaxin in October 1991. The drug went generic in Europe in 2004 and in the US in mid-2005. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Clarithromycin is available as a generic medication. In the United States, clarithromycin is available as immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, and granules for oral suspension. === Brand names === Clarithromycin is available under several brand names in many different countries, including Biaxin, Crixan, Claritron, Clarihexal, Clacid, Claritt, Clacee, Clarac, Clariwin, Claripen, Clarem, Claridar, Cloff, Fromilid, Infex, Kalixocin, Karicin, Klaricid, Klaridex, Klacid, Klaram, Klabax, Klerimed, MegaKlar, Monoclar, Resclar, Rithmo, Truclar, Vikrol and Zeclar. === Manufacturers === In the UK the drug product is manufactured in generic form by a number of manufacturers including Somex Pharma, Ranbaxy, Aptil and Sandoz. == Research == === Hypersomnolence === Clarithromycin has been studied in a phase 2 clinical trial in the treatment of central hypersomnolence (i.e., idiopathic hypersomnolence and narcolepsy without cataplexy). There was no apparent improvement on an objective measure of vigilance, but subjective sleepiness was reduced with the drug compared to placebo. It is thought to work for this use as a GABAA receptor negative allosteric modulator. == References == == External links == US patent 4331803, Watanabe Y, Morimoto S, Omura S, ""Novel erythromycin compounds"", issued 1981-05-19, assigned to Taisho Pharmaceutical",Klaricid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.226373367710039e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009254701435565948)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

56,"('Isoleucine', '(2s,3s)-2-amino-3-methylpentanoic acid', '(s)-isoleucine', '(s,s)-isoleucine', 'H-ile-oh')","Food, Medical","Isoleucine (symbol Ile or I) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a hydrocarbon side chain with a branch (a central carbon atom bound to three other carbon atoms). It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), branched-chain, aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it. Essential amino acids are necessary in the human diet. In plants isoleucine can be synthesized from threonine and methionine. In plants and bacteria, isoleucine is synthesized from a pyruvate employing leucine biosynthesis enzymes. It is encoded by the codons AUU, AUC, and AUA. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === In plants and microorganisms, isoleucine is synthesized from pyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate. This pathway is not present in humans. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include: Acetolactate synthase (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase) Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase Dihydroxyacid dehydratase Valine aminotransferase === Catabolism === Isoleucine is both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. After transamination with alpha-ketoglutarate, the carbon skeleton is oxidised and split into propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA, a TCA cycle intermediate which can be converted into oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (hence glucogenic). In mammals acetyl-CoA cannot be converted to carbohydrate but can be either fed into the TCA cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate to form citrate or used in the synthesis of ketone bodies (hence ketogenic) or fatty acids. === Metabolic diseases === The degradation of isoleucine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) Methylmalonic acidemia Propionic acidemia === Insulin resistance === Isoleucine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is associated with insulin resistance: higher levels of isoleucine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans. In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of isoleucine (with or without the other branched-chain amino acids) results in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity. Reduced dietary levels of isoleucine are required for the beneficial metabolic effects of a low protein diet. In humans, a protein restricted diet lowers blood levels of isoleucine and decreases fasting blood glucose levels. Mice fed a low isoleucine diet are leaner, live longer, and are less frail. In humans, higher dietary levels of isoleucine are associated with greater body mass index. == Functions and requirement == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine has set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For adults 19 years and older, 19 mg of isoleucine/kg body weight is required daily. Beside its biological role as a nutrient, isoleucine also participates in regulation of glucose metabolism. Isoleucine is an essential component of many proteins. As an essential amino acid, isoleucine must be ingested or protein production in the cell will be disrupted. Fetal hemoglobin is one of the many proteins that require isoleucine. Isoleucine is present in the gamma chain of fetal hemoglobin and must be present for the protein to form. Genetic diseases can change the consumption requirements of isoleucine. Amino acids cannot be stored in the body. Buildup of excess amino acids will cause a buildup of toxic molecules so, humans have many pathways to degrade each amino acid when the need for protein synthesis has been met. Mutations in isoleucine-degrading enzymes can lead to dangerous buildup of isoleucine and its toxic derivative. One example is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder that leaves people unable to breakdown isoleucine, valine, and leucine. People with MSUD manage their disease by a reduced intake of all three of those amino acids alongside drugs that help excrete built-up toxins. Many animals and plants are dietary sources of isoleucine as a component of proteins. Foods that have high amounts of isoleucine include eggs, soy protein, seaweed, turkey, chicken, lamb, cheese, and fish. == Synthesis == Routes to isoleucine are numerous. One common multistep procedure starts from 2-bromobutane and diethylmalonate. Synthetic isoleucine was first reported in 1905 by French chemists Bouveault and Locquin. == Discovery == German chemist Felix Ehrlich discovered isoleucine while studying the composition of beet-sugar molasses 1903. In 1907 Ehrlich carried out further studies on fibrin, egg albumin, gluten, and beef muscle in 1907. These studies verified the natural composition of isoleucine. Ehrlich published his own synthesis of isoleucine in 1908. == See also == Alloisoleucine, the diasteromer of isoleucine Low Isoleucine protein foods == References == == External links == Isoleucine degradation Isoleucine biosynthesis",Isoleucine,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.005653232801705599), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.05963747575879097), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.005244663450866938), ('ĠEND', -0.005289962515234947), ('OG', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029792536050081253)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0031777136027812958), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([periodical.knowde.com](https://periodical.knowde.com/isoleucine-in-food-and-nutrition/?utm_source=openai), [ewg.org](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/browse/ingredients/719947-ISOLEUCINE/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=226, start_index=21, title='Isoleucine in Food & Nutrition - An Essential Amino Acid - C6H13NO2', type='url_citation', url='https://periodical.knowde.com/isoleucine-in-food-and-nutrition/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=226, start_index=21, title='Products That Contain ISOLEUCINE || Skin Deep® Cosmetics Database | EWG', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/browse/ingredients/719947-ISOLEUCINE/?utm_source=openai')])"

Ipragliflozin, jointly developed by Astellas Pharma and Kotobuki Pharmaceutical, was approved in Japan on January 17, 2014, and in Russia on May 22, 2019. Ipragliflozin is a Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (gliflozin). These membrane proteins are on the cell surface and transfer glucose into the cells. SGLT2 is one subtype of SGLTs and plays a key role in the reuptake of glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidneys. Ipragliflozin reduces blood glucose levels by inhibiting the reuptake of glucose by selectively inhibiting SGLT2. == Clinical trials == The efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin were both observed in a Phase III study in monotherapy and clinical studies used in combination with other hypoglycemic agents (6 types) in Japan. One placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out at 18 different sites in Korea and 12 in Taiwan. Patients were above 20 and had type 2 diabetes for atlas 12 weeks. They were given an 8-week period to clear their systems of all other drugs (besides metformin). Patients received either 50 mg ipragliflozin or a placebo. The drugs were identical in all physical forms. The patients were prohibited from using any other anti diabetic drugs, other than metformin. The study ran for 24 weeks along with a 4-week follow-up period. The standard deviation in hemoglobin A1c were −0.94% and −0.47% in the ipragliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (between-group difference −0.46%, p <0.001). The changes in fasting plasma glucose and bodyweight were also significantly greater in the ipragliflozin group, with between-group differences of −14.1 mg/dL and −1.24 kg, respectively (both p <0.001). The most common adverse events that appeared were upper respiratory infections and urinary tract infections. From this it was concluded that ipragliflozin is both efficacious as well as safe. However, ipragliflozin is currently in Observational Case Control clinical trial to see the long-term (over three years) safety of using ipragliflozin. The estimated completion of this trial is October 2018. 18 October 2016: Astellas completes a clinical trial for Type-2 diabetes mellitus in Japan prior to October 2016 7 September 2016: Astellas Pharma plans a phase III trial for Type-1 diabetes mellitus (Combination therapy) in Japan 1 August 2016: Phase III clinical trials in type 1 diabetes mellitus (combination therapy) in Japan Ipragliflozin was also in development for type 2 diabetes mellitus in the U.S., Europe and other countries, and three phase II trials were completed in combination with metformin. This was since discontinued. == Commercialization == As of 2014, Suglat was the top reimbursed drug in Japan. Peak sales reached US$515 million with 800,000 and the cost per patient reached US$644 per year. In 2014, the market for selective SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan was around 9 billion yen. Suglat's share of this market was around 49%. In 2015, sales of Suglat grew 77.8% to 7.3 billion yen, following the availability of long-term prescriptions from May 2015. Suglat's share of the market for selective SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan was around 39%. The projected sales in 2016 is to jump all the way to 12.5 billion yen. == Marketing == Ipragliflozin was the first drug of its kind sold by any company in Japan. Therefore, Astellas will focus their marketing in order to maintain the top share of this market that it holds. Astellas has been building up post-marketing data in regard to the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin. By supplying information based on this data, Astellas aims to increase the market penetration of ipragliflozin in the Japanese market. In 2015, Astellas additionally launched Suglat in the Republic of Korea and Feburic in Thailand.: 50 == Intellectual Property == In May 2013, Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany applied for a Methods of Treatment, Pharmaceutical Compositions and uses thereof patent. This patent application included SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin. In April 2014, Boehringer Ingelheim applied for usage of SGLT2 inhibitors in equine animals. The usage of these inhibitors in an animal study allows for progression in the application in humans for more than just diabetes. The National Institute of Biological Science out of Beijing filed a similar patent in September 2015. In January 2016, the Dalian University of Technology filed a patent on the synthetic method of ipragliflozin.

58,"('Palbociclib (isethionate)', 'Pd 0332991 isethionate', 'Palbociclib', 'Ibrance', 'Pd 0332991')",Medical,"Palbociclib, sold under the brand name Ibrance among others, is a medication developed by Pfizer for the treatment of HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. It is a selective inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. Palbociclib was the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to be approved as a cancer therapy. == Mechanism of action == It is a selective inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. In the G1 phase of the cell cycle, mammalian cells must pass a checkpoint, known as the restriction point ""R"", in order to complete the cell cycle and divide. CDK4 and CDK6 complex with Cyclin D drive the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, which allows the cell to pass R and commit to division. Regulation of one or more proteins involved in this checkpoint is lost in many cancers. However, by inhibiting CDK4/6, palbociclib ensures that the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex cannot aid in phosphorylating Rb. This prevents the cell from passing R and exiting G1, and in turn from proceeding through the cell cycle. == Administration == Palbociclib is taken daily orally with food in a cycle of 21 days of active medication, followed by a week of abstinence. Currently, palbociclib is prescribed as a combination therapy with either letrozole or fulvestrant. Patients should also not consume CYP3A inhibitors or inducers while taking palbociclib. FDA information also cautions against consuming grapefruit products while taking palbociclib, in order to avoid negative interactions. == Approvals and indications == === HR+ breast cancer === The drug was reviewed and approved under the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) accelerated Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation programs on February 3, 2015, as a treatment (in combination with letrozole) for patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) advanced breast cancer. This was an accelerated approval. In March 2017, the FDA granted regular approval to palbociclib for hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer, in combination with an aromatase inhibitor. A phase III trial, PALOMA-2, was fully enrolled by February 2015 and reported positive results in April 2016. The results of PALOMA-2 trial, published in November 2016, showed significantly longer progression-free survival in patients on palbociclib in combination with letrozole, compared to patients on letrozole and placebo. Progression-free survival was assessed by radiologically-confirmed disease progression by RECIST criteria or death during the study. At the time of publication, there was insufficient data on overall survival, and a final analysis is planned after a total of 390 deaths occur per protocol and in agreement with regulatory agencies. Of note, it was noted that the addition of palbociclib caused higher rates of myelotoxic events in the study. The drug was approved for use in the European Union in November 2016 as a treatment for hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, either in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or, for women who have received prior endocrine therapy, in combination with fulvestrant. In pre- or perimenopausal women, a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist should also be given. In December 2017, palbociclib, was accepted for use by the NHS after going through the Scottish Medicines Consortium's process for medicines used to treat very rare and end-of-life breast cancer. == Adverse effects == A majority of patients taking palbociclib experience neutropenia, a condition where a patient has an abnormally low number of neutrophils. This side effect impacts the immune system, and is thus likely responsible for the second most common side effect, infection. Leukopenia and anemia are also frequent among patients taking palbociclib. More than 10% of patients also experience side effects such as fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, respiratory infection, headache, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, and decreased appetite. The FDA also indicates that patients should be vigilant to monitor themselves for any sign of pulmonary embolism. The FDA further cautions that women should be aware that the medication can have a harmful effect on a fetus, and thus should not be taken while pregnant. == Mechanisms of resistance == === Resistance to palbociclib === FDA- and EMA-approval for palbociclib hinges upon the clinical trials’ results regarding progression-free survival (PFS). However, though data has proven promising (one study had p-values very close to the significance threshold which, with further clinical trials, may be able to demonstrate statistical significance), there is as of 2019 no significant improvement evident in overall survival (OS) when taking palbociclib. For example, in the PALOMA-2 trial, more than 70% of patients who were treated with palbociclib and letrozole progressed by 40 months. This has impeded the drug's worldwide acceptance as economic analyses have not found palbociclib to be cost-effective. === De novo resistance === De novo resistance to palbociclib implicates a variety of targets both upstream and downstream of the CDK4/6 to Rb pathway. Overexpression of the transcription factor E2F2 is capable of promoting resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition more than just loss of Rb alone (the direct downstream target of CDK4/6). Palbociclib is less effective in patients whose breast cancer cells overexpress cyclin E1 or E2, and Brk (breast tumor-related kinase). Brk is an intracellular kinase that is overexpressed in 60% of breast cancers and whose amplification leads to increased phosphorylation of Y88 of the p27 protein, as well as increases the cyclin D and CDK4 activity, thereby rendering the cancer cells more resistant to palbociclib. A 2018 study found that mutations in a pathway completely unrelated to the CDK4/6-Rb axis are also implicated in resistance to palbociclib. Loss of the FAT1 tumor suppressor promoted resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors through the Hippo pathway, a signaling pathway known to function as a tumor suppressor. Previously, FAT1 had been suggested to be a tumor suppressor and oncogene, though never before explicitly linked to resistance. The team found that FAT1 suppressed cells required significantly higher doses of CDK4/6 inhibitors in order to block proliferation of breast cancer cells in vivo. === Resistance due to endocrine therapy === Palbociclib is indicated in HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer cells. Because CDK4/6 inhibition acts directly downstream of the endocrine therapy targets, cross-therapy resistance could possibly develop as a result of patient progression on hormone-therapy. In general, however, endocrine-resistant tumors are able to maintain sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition, with particular success witnessed with patients given combination therapy of palbociclib with endocrine therapy. For example, the PALOMA-3 trial which studied the benefit of palbociclib and fulvestrant vs. fulvestrant alone found that the combined treatment regimen improved PFS in both patients with an ESR1 mutation and those with ESR1 wildtype ctDNA. Such results indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors are effective irrespective of ESR1 mutation status, a marker that otherwise would reveal a patient to be endocrine-resistant. Certain manifestations of endocrine therapy resistance may further sensitize the breast cancer to CDK4/6 inhibitors. For example, deficiencies in mismatch repair caused by the MutL mutation in ER+ breast cancer evades CHK2-mediated inhibition of CDK4, thereby leading to endocrine resistance. CDK4/6 inhibitors, however, have been demonstrated to be highly effective in MutL-defective ER+ breast cancer cells, and MutL bears potential as a biomarker for identifying patients highly suitable for treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors. === Other mechanisms of resistance === Researchers at the Dana Farber Institute found that breast cancer cells that developed resistance to palbociclib were resensitized to the drug after a seven-day ""treatment holiday"". Scientists linked the initial development of resistance to an increase in expression of CDK6 (but not CDK4, the other target of palbociclib), with the specific mechanism of CDK6 upregulation originating from suppression of the TGF-β pathway via the miR-432-5p microRNA. Scientists made this discovery after noticing that, in the lab, all breast cancer cells in the dish were found to acquire resistance at a similar time, a phenomenon contrary to classical models of acquiring resistance in which one or two cells become resistant and then expand to encompass more of the tumor as they divide. These palbociclib-resistance cells also did not contain a particular mutation, but rather became resistant via and continued to spread this resistance to neighboring cells via exosomes. While the mechanism of this resistance has not yet been elucidated, it opens an avenue for further research into a completely novel method through which cancer cells acquire resistance. On the other hand, this suggests that patients which seemingly progress on palbociclib could benefit from longer-term treatment following a treatment holiday in which their tumors are ""reset"". There are a variety of means through which cancer cells become resistant to palbociclib, with mechanisms of resistance involving multiple targets and processes throughout the pathway in which palbociclib operates. Previous research estimates that breast cancer cells show adaptation against palbociclib as early as 72 hours post-treatment. Evidence for this was ""shown to be mediated by non-canonical activation of cyclin D1/CDK2 complexes, which in turn induced a recovery of cyclin E2 expression and [subsequent] S-phase entry despite CDK4/6 inhibition"" upstream of these two targets. Furthermore, it is estimated that approximately 10% of patients have primary resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors (resistance prior to drug therapy). For example, patients who display evidence of functional Rb loss at baseline are not likely to benefit from CDK4/6 inhibition, nor are patients who display baseline evidence of increased cyclin E1 expression, or a high CCNE1/RB ratio. == Clinical trials == === HR+ breast cancer === The PALOMA-3 trial announced in April 2015 that the addition of palbociclib was superior to fulvestrant alone for progression-free survival. In the phase II PALOMA-1 trial reported at the April 2014 annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole was shown to significantly slow the progression of advanced cancer (median progression-free survival increased from 10.2 months to 20.2 months), but was not shown to have a statistically significant effect on increasing patients' overall survival times. Pfizer announce on May 31, 2020, the results of a preplanned efficacy and futility analysis. The results indicate that, when used in combination with post-surgery endocrine therapy, it ""is unlikely to show a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival (iDFS)."" The trial was conducted on male and female patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative early stage breast cancer. === Active clinical trials === According to the NIH National Cancer Institute there are currently 39 active clinical trials testing palbociclib on its own or in combination with other medications. While a majority of these are exploring the further uses of palbociclib to treat breast cancer, other trials are investigating the potential applications of palbociclib to head and neck cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, recurring brain metastasis, squamous cell carcinoma, central nervous system tumors, and other solid tumor types. In December 2017, Pfizer announced that the PALOMA-2 trial, an ongoing phase III trial combining palbociclib with letrozole, showed a 44% reduction in risk of disease progression among trial subjects. The trial has also demonstrated greater than a year's improved median progression free survival for patients on the combined therapy (as compared to letrozole on its own). PALOMA-2 median patient follow-up time now exceeds three years, making it the longest traceable data for phase III study of a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Palbociclib is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials as a combination treatment with oral SERD’s for ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Studies include palbociclib plus G1 Therapeutic’s rintodestrant and Zentalis’s Zn-c5. == Drugs with a similar mechanism of action == Palbociclib has several direct competitors currently on the market or in clinical trials. In September 2017, abemaciclib, another selective CDK4/6 inhibitor owned and manufactured by Eli Lilly, was approved for HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced metastatic breast cancer both in combination with fulvestrant and as a monotherapy. In March 2017, the FDA also approved ribociclib, owned by Novartis, as a combination therapy with aromatase inhibitors for indications similar to those of palbociclib and ribociclib. Notably, ribociclib seems to also have an inhibitory effect on Cyclin D3/CDK6 activity. G1 Therapeutics also has a CDK4/6 inhibitor, trilaciclib, which is up for FDA approval (target decision date of February 15, 2021) for use in small cell lung cancer. == Society and culture == === Economics === Palbociclib (Ibrance) ""can be ordered through select"" specialty pharmacies and ""sells for $9,850 for 30 days or $118,200 for a year's supply before discounts."" According to a statement by the New York–based Pfizer the price ""is not the cost that most patients or payors pay"" since most prescriptions are dispensed through health plans, which negotiate discounts for medicines or get government-mandated price concessions. In the United States specialty pharmacies fill prescriptions for drugs that are usually high cost. Pfizer reported revenue of US$4.753 billion for Ibrance in 2023. ==== Resistance to cost ==== In February 2017, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom published a statement stating that the cost of Ibrance (approximately US$3700/28 days) did not make the added health benefits worth the cost. It was stated that with the side effects caused by Ibrance, it was not a cost-effective medication for NICE to endorse.

Herein, we first synthesized encequidar and demonstrated that it could inhibit the transport activity of P-gp, reduced doxorubicin (DOX) efflux, enhanced DOX cytotoxicity and promoted tumor-apoptosis in SW620/AD300 cells. Metabolomic analysis of cell samples was performedusing liquid chromatography Q-Exactive mass spectrometer, the results of metabolite enrichment analysis and pathway analysis showed that the combination of encequidar and DOX could: i) significantly affect the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) and reduce the energy supply required for P-gp to exert its transport activity; ii) affect the metabolism of glutathione, which is the main component of the anti-oxidative stress system, and reduce the ability of cells to resist oxidative stress; iii) increase the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhance ROS-induced cell damage and lipid peroxidation, which in turn restore the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to DOX. In conclusion, these results provide sufficient data support for the therapeutical application of the P-gp inhibitor encequidar to reverse MDR, and are of great significance to further understand the therapeutic advantages of encequidar in anti-tumor therapy and guide clinical rational drug use. Oraxol is an oral formulation of paclitaxel administered with a novel, minimally absorbed P-glycoprotein inhibitor encequidar (HM30181A). This phase Ib study was conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of Oraxol administered at a fixed dose for up to 5 consecutive days in patients with advanced malignancies. Part 1 of this study utilized a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design to determine the MTD of oral paclitaxel 270 mg plus oral encequidar 15 mg administered daily. Dose escalation was achieved by increasing the number of consecutive dosing days per week (from 2 to 5 days per week). Dosing occurred for 3 consecutive weeks out of a 4-week cycle. Part 2 treated additional patients at the MTD to determine tolerability and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Adverse events, tumor responses, and pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed. A total of 34 patients (n = 24 in Part 1, n = 10 in Part 2) received treatment. The MTD of Oraxol was determined to be 270 mg daily × 5 days per week per protocol definition and this was declared the RP2D. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, neutropenia, and nausea/vomiting. Hypersensitivity-type reactions were not observed. Of the 28 patients evaluable for response, 2 (7.1%) achieved partial response and 18 (64.3%) achieved stable disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed rapid absorption of paclitaxel when administered orally following encequidar. Paclitaxel daily exposure was comparable following 2-5 days dose levels. The oral administration of encequidar with paclitaxel was safe, achieved clinically relevant paclitaxel levels, and showed evidence of anti-tumor activity. Many chemotherapeutics, such as paclitaxel, are administered intravenously as they suffer from poor oral bioavailability, partly because of efflux mechanism of P-glycoprotein in the intestinal epithelium. To date, no drug has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that selectively blocks this efflux pump. We sought to identify a compound that selectively inhibits P-glycoprotein in the gastrointestinal mucosa with poor oral bioavailability, thus eliminating the issues such as bone marrow toxicity associated with systemic inhibition of P-glycoprotein.

Ornithine is abnormally accumulated in the body in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. The radical is ornithyl. == Role in urea cycle == L-Ornithine is one of the products of the action of the enzyme arginase on L-arginine, creating urea. Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen. Ornithine is recycled and, in a manner, is a catalyst. First, ammonia is converted into carbamoyl phosphate (H2NC(O)OPO2−3) by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine to form citrulline and phosphate (Pi). Another amino group is added from aspartate, producing arginine and denitrogenated fumarate. The resulting arginine (a guanidinium compound) is hydrolysed back to ornithine, producing urea. The amino groups of urea come from the ammonia and aspartate, and the nitrogen in ornithine remains intact. Ornithine is not an amino acid coded for by DNA, that is, not proteinogenic. However, in mammalian non-hepatic tissues, the main use of the urea cycle is in arginine biosynthesis, so, as an intermediate in metabolic processes, ornithine is quite important. == Other reactions == Ornithine, via the action of ornithine decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.17), is the starting point for the synthesis of polyamines such as putrescine. In bacteria, such as E. coli, ornithine can be synthesized from L-glutamate. == Research == === Exercise fatigue === L-Ornithine supplementation attenuated fatigue in subjects in a placebo-controlled study using a cycle ergometer. The results suggested that L-ornithine has an antifatigue effect in increasing the efficiency of energy consumption and promoting the excretion of ammonia. === Weightlifting supplement === Amino acid supplements, including L-ornithine, are frequently marketed to bodybuilders and weightlifters with claims for increasing levels of human growth hormone (HGH), muscle mass, and strength. A 1993 short 4-day clinical study reported that L-ornithine in combination with L-arginine and L-lysine at 2 g/d each did not increase HGH. A review from 2002 on the topic concluded ""The use of specific amino acids to stimulate GH release by athletes is not recommended."" === Cirrhosis === L-Ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA), a stable salt of ornithine and aspartic acid, has been used in the treatment of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. == See also == Bisorcic 3-Methylornithine == References == == External links == Ornithine mass Spectrum",Ornithine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.00011045700375689194), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00020377879263833165), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.3869336247444153), (' MED', -0.48093464970588684), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.025841107591986656), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -4.577531944960356e-05), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.00412838626652956), ('ĠFOOD', -0.31704095005989075), (',', -0.0789153054356575), ('ĠMED', -0.061578962951898575), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10023149102926254)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0015023599844425917), (' FOOD', -4.842555426876061e-06)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([foodcomex.org](https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000009?utm_source=openai), [upcfoodsearch.com](https://upcfoodsearch.com/food-ingredients/ornithine/?utm_source=openai), [creamscan.com](https://creamscan.com/ingredients/ornithine/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=295, start_index=33, title='FComEx: Ornithine (PC000009)', type='url_citation', url='https://foodcomex.org/foodcomex_compounds/PC000009?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=295, start_index=33, title='Ornithine - UPC Food Search', type='url_citation', url='https://upcfoodsearch.com/food-ingredients/ornithine/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=295, start_index=33, title='What is Ornithine?

62,"('Boldenone undecylenate', 'Ba 29038', 'Parenabol', 'Vebonol', 'Boldenone 10-undecenoate')",Medical,"Boldenone undecylenate, or boldenone undecenoate, sold under the brand names Equipoise and Parenabol among others, is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication which is used in veterinary medicine, mainly in horses. It was formerly used in humans as well. It is given by injection into muscle. Side effects of boldenone undecylenate include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has strong anabolic effects and moderate androgenic effects, weak estrogenic effects, and no risk of liver damage. Boldenone undecylenate is an androgen ester and a long-lasting prodrug of boldenone in the body. Boldenone undecylenate was introduced for medical use in the 1960s. In addition to its medical use, boldenone undecylenate is used to improve physique and performance. The drug is a controlled substance in the United States and its use is generally illicit. It remains marketed for veterinary use in Australia and the United States. == Uses == === Veterinary === Boldenone undecylenate is used in veterinary medicine, mainly in horses. === Clinical === Boldenone undecylenate was formerly used in clinical medicine in humans, but was discontinued. The drug is currently not approved by Food and Drug Administration. It is also classified as DEA Schedule III controlled substance. == Side effects == == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Boldenone undecylenate is a prodrug of boldenone, and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor. Boldenone has strong anabolic effects and moderate androgenic effects. It also has low estrogenic activity and has little or no progestogenic activity. In relation to the fact that it is not 17α-alkylated, boldenone and boldenone undecylenate have little or no risk of hepatotoxicity. === Pharmacokinetics === Boldenone undecylenate is a prodrug of boldenone. When administered via intramuscular injection, a depot is formed from which boldenone undecylenate is slowly released into the body and then transformed into boldenone. The drug possess a biological half-life of 14 days when administered by intramuscular injection. Boldenone is a substrate for 5α-reductase and may be converted by this enzyme into 1-testosterone (δ1-dihydrotestosterone, δ1-DHT, dihydroboldenone) in tissues that express it such as the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland. However, its affinity for this enzyme is said to be extremely low. == Chemistry == Boldenone undecylenate, or boldenone 17β-undec-10-enoate, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is the C17β undecylenate (undecenoate) ester of boldenone (δ1-testosterone, 1-dehydrotestosterone, or androsta-1,4-dien-17β-ol-3-one), which itself is the C1(2) dehydrogenated analogue of testosterone and a naturally occurring androgen found in the scent gland of Ilybius fenestratus (a species of aquatic beetle). Boldenone is the non-17α-alkylated variant of metandienone (17α-methyl-δ1-testosterone). An AAS related to boldenone undecylenate is quinbolone (δ1-testosterone 17β-cyclopentenyl enol ether). == History == Boldenone was reportedly patented by Ciba in 1949, and esters of the compound were developed by the company in the 1950s and 1960s. One such ester, boldenone undecylenate, was introduced for clinical use as an injectable AAS under the brand name Parenabol in the 1960s. However, it was discontinued for use in humans in the late 1970s. Squibb introduced boldenone undecylenate for veterinary use under the brand name Equipoise. The medication has been used much more widely in veterinary medicine, in which it has been used mainly in horses, and remains in use today. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Boldenone undecylenate is the generic name of the drug and its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, while boldenone undecenoate is its BANMTooltip British Approved Name. === Brand names === Boldenone undecylenate is or has been marketed under a number of brand names including Boldane, Equipoise, Parenabol, and Vebonol among others. === Availability === Boldenone undecylenate remains marketed for veterinary use in Australia and the United States. === Doping in sports === There are many known cases of doping in sports with boldenone undecylenate by professional athletes. == References ==",Vebonol,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0901472344994545), ('U', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.07714782655239105), ('ICAL', -3.6954811548639555e-06), (',', -0.029865430667996407), ('ĠINDU', -0.010297148488461971), ('ST', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('RI', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018278373405337334)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
63,"('Paroxetine (hydrochloride)', 'Paroxetine', 'Paxil', 'Paxil cr', 'Frosinor')",Medical,"Paroxetine, sold under the brand name Paxil among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It has also been used in the treatment of premature ejaculation, and hot flashes due to menopause. It is taken orally (by mouth). Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, trouble sleeping, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. It is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of the chemical serotonin by neurons in the brain. Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. In 2018, it was in the top 10 of most prescribed antidepressants in the United States. == Medical uses == Paroxetine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It is also occasionally used for agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and menopausal hot flashes. === Depression === A variety of meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of paroxetine in depression. They have variously concluded that paroxetine is superior or equivalent to placebo and that it is equivalent to other antidepressants. Despite this, there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any point in time. === Anxiety disorders === Paroxetine was the first antidepressant approved in the United States for the treatment of panic disorder. Several studies have concluded that paroxetine is superior to placebo in the treatment of panic disorder. Paroxetine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults and children. It is also beneficial for people with co-occurring social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. It appears to be similar to a number of other SSRIs. Paroxetine is used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparative efficacy of paroxetine is equivalent to that of clomipramine and venlafaxine. Paroxetine is also effective for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Paroxetine is approved for the treatment of PTSD in the United States, Japan, and Europe. In the United States, it is approved for short-term use. Paroxetine is also FDA-approved for generalized anxiety disorder. === Menopausal hot flashes === In 2013, low-dose paroxetine was approved in the US for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause. At the low dose used for menopausal hot flashes, side effects are similar to placebo and dose tapering is not required for discontinuation. === Fibromyalgia === Studies have also shown paroxetine ""appears to be well-tolerated and improve the overall symptomatology in patients with fibromyalgia"", but is less robust in helping with the pain involved. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndromes may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. Paroxetine shares many of the common adverse effects of SSRIs, including (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%) diarrhea 12% (8%) constipation 14% (9%) dry mouth 18% (12%) somnolence 23% (9%) insomnia 13% (6%) headache 18% (17%) hypomania 1% (0.3%) blurred vision 4% (1%) loss of appetite 6% (2%) nervousness 5% (3%) paraesthesia 4% (2%) dizziness 13% (6%) asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)) tremor 8% (2%) sweating 11% (2%) sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, but a higher incidence of anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain. Due to reports of adverse withdrawal reactions upon terminating treatment, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use at the European Medicines Agency recommends gradually reducing over several weeks or months if the decision to withdraw is made. See also Discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal). Mania or hypomania may occur in 1% of patients with depression and up to 12% of patients with bipolar disorder. This side effect can occur in individuals with no history of mania, but it may be more likely to occur in those with bipolar disorder or with a family history of mania. Paroxetine is described as a 'hepatoxic agent' and has been associated with hepatoxicity and jaundice. === Suicide === Like other antidepressants, paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in people under the age of 25. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 and found an increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. In 2015, a paper published in The BMJ that reanalysed the original case notes argued that in Study 329, assessing paroxetine and imipramine against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for paroxetine. === Sexual dysfunction === Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, anorgasmia, lack of vaginal lubrication, and erectile dysfunction, is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with paroxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is higher than 70%. Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional. === Pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including paroxetine) is associated with shorter duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g or 2.6 oz), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that for pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, paroxetine ""be avoided, if possible"", as it may be associated with increased risk of birth defects. Babies born to women who used paroxetine during the first trimester have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations, primarily ventricular and atrial septal defects. Unless the benefits of paroxetine justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to stopping or switching to another antidepressant. Paroxetine use during pregnancy is associated with about 1.5– to 1.7-fold increase in congenital birth defects, in particular, heart defects, cleft lip and palate, clubbed feet, or any birth defects. === Discontinuation syndrome === Many psychoactive medications can cause withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation from administration. Paroxetine has among the highest incidence rates and severity of withdrawal syndrome of any medication of its class. Common withdrawal symptoms for paroxetine include nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo; insomnia, nightmares, and vivid dreams; feelings of electricity in the body, as well as rebound depression and anxiety. A liquid formulation of paroxetine is available and allows a very gradual decrease of the dose, which may prevent discontinuation syndrome. Another recommendation is to temporarily switch to fluoxetine, which has a longer half-life and thus decreases the severity of discontinuation syndrome. In 2002, the U.S. FDA published a warning regarding ""severe"" discontinuation symptoms among those terminating paroxetine treatment, including paraesthesia, nightmares, and dizziness. The agency also warned of case reports describing agitation, sweating, and nausea. In connection with a Glaxo spokesperson's statement that withdrawal reactions occur only in 0.2% of patients and are ""mild and short-lived"", the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations said GSK had breached two of the federation's codes of practice. Paroxetine prescribing information posted at GlaxoSmithKline has been updated related to the occurrence of a discontinuation syndrome, including serious discontinuation symptoms. == Overdose == Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia, and seizures. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of paroxetine may be measured to monitor therapeutic administration, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Plasma paroxetine concentrations are generally in a range of 40–400 μg/L in persons receiving daily therapeutic doses and 200–2,000 μg/L in poisoned patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 1–4 mg/L in acute lethal overdose situations. Along with the other SSRIs, sertraline and fluoxetine, paroxetine is considered a low-risk drug in cases of overdose. == Interactions == Interactions with other drugs acting on the serotonin system or impairing the metabolism of serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reaction. Such reactions have been observed with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, but particularly with concurrent use of triptans, MAO inhibitors, antipsychotics, or other dopamine antagonists. The prescribing information states that paroxetine should ""not be used in combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI"", and should not be used in combination with pimozide, thioridazine, tryptophan, or warfarin. Paroxetine interacts with the following cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP2D6 for which it is both a substrate and a potent inhibitor. CYP2B6 (strong) inhibitor. CYP3A4 (weak) inhibitor. CYP1A2 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C9 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C19 (weak) inhibitor. Paroxetine has been shown to be an inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Paroxetine is the most potent and one of the most specific selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It also binds to the allosteric site of the serotonin transporter, similarly to escitalopram, though less potently so. Paroxetine also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine to a lesser extent (<50 nmol/L). Based on evidence from four weeks of administration in rats, the equivalent of 20 mg paroxetine taken once daily occupies approximately 88% of serotonin transporters in the prefrontal cortex. Paroxetine is a phenylpiperidine and might have some affinity for opioid receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Paroxetine is well-absorbed following oral administration. It has an absolute bioavailability of about 50%, with evidence of a saturable first pass effect. When taken orally, it achieves maximum concentration in about 6–10 hours and reaches steady-state in 7–14 days. Paroxetine exhibits significant interindividual variations in volume of distribution and clearance. Less than 2% of an oral dose is excreted in urine unchanged. Paroxetine is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2D6. == Society and culture == Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. GlaxoSmithKline has paid substantial fines, paid settlements in class-action lawsuits, and become the subject of several highly critical books about its marketing of paroxetine, in particular, the off-label marketing of paroxetine for children, the suppression of negative research results relating to its use in children, and allegations that it failed to warn consumers of substantial withdrawal effects associated with the use of the drug. === Marketing === In 2004, GSK agreed to settle charges of consumer fraud for $2.5 million. The legal discovery process also uncovered evidence of deliberate, systematic suppression of unfavorable Paxil research results. One of GSK's internal documents read, ""It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy [in children] had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine"". In 2012, the United States Department of Justice fined GlaxoSmithKline $3 billion for withholding data, unlawfully promoting use in those under 18, and preparing an article that misleadingly reported the effects of paroxetine in adolescents with depression following its clinical trial study 329. In February 2016, the UK Competition and Markets Authority imposed record fines of £45 million on companies that were found to have infringed European Union and UK Competition law by entering into agreements to delay the market entry of generic versions of the drug in the UK. GlaxoSmithKline received the bulk of the fines, being fined £37,600,757. Other companies that produce generics were issued fines which collectively total £7,384,146. UK public health services are likely to claim damages for being overcharged in the period where the generic versions of the drug were illegally blocked from the market, as the generics are over 70% less expensive. GlaxoSmithKline may also face actions from other generic manufacturers who incurred losses as a result of the anticompetitive conduct. In April 2016, appeals were lodged with the Competition Appeal Tribunal by the companies which were fined. GSK marketed paroxetine through television advertisements in the 1990s and 2000s. Commercials also aired for the CR version of the drug beginning in 2003. === Economics === In 2007, paroxetine was ranked 94th on the list of bestselling drugs, with over $1 billion in sales. In 2006, paroxetine was the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. retail market, with more than 19.7 million prescriptions. In 2007, sales had dropped slightly to 18.1 million but paroxetine remained the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. === Brand names === Brand names include Aropax, Paretin, Brisdelle, Deroxat, Paxil, Pexeva, Paxtine, Paxetin, Paroxat, Paraxyl, Sereupin, Daparox and Seroxat. == Research == Several studies have suggested that paroxetine can be used in the treatment of premature ejaculation. In particular, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was found to increase 6- to 13-fold, which was somewhat longer than the delay achieved by the treatment with other SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram). However, paroxetine taken acutely (""on demand"") 3–10 hours before coitus resulted only in a ""clinically irrelevant and sexually unsatisfactory"" 1.5-fold delay of ejaculation and was inferior to clomipramine, which induced a fourfold delay. There is also evidence that paroxetine may be effective in the treatment of compulsive gambling and hot flashes. Benefits of paroxetine prescription for diabetic neuropathy or chronic tension headache are uncertain. Although the evidence is conflicting, paroxetine may be effective for the treatment of dysthymia, a chronic disorder involving depressive symptoms for most days of the year. There is evidence to support that paroxetine selectively binds to and inhibits G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in mice with heart failure. Since GRK2 regulates the activity of the beta adrenergic receptor, which becomes desensitized in cases of heart failure, paroxetine (or a paroxetine derivative) could be used as a heart failure treatment in the future. Paroxetine has been identified as a potential disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug. == Veterinary use == Paroxetine may be useful in the treatment of canine or feline behavioral diagnoses and is effective in the treatment of social anxiety, depression, and agitation associated with depression. == Other organisms == Paroxetine is a common finding in wastewater. It is highly toxic to the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (syn. Raphidocelis subcapitata). It also is toxic to the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Alberca et al., 2016 found that paroxetine acts as a trypanocide against T. cruzi. Alberca et al., 2016 finds a leishmanicide effect. Alberca finds that paroxetine produces cell death of the promastigotes of L. infantum. The mechanism of action remains unknown. Various types of bacteria can break down paroxetine in the environment. These include, for example Pseudomonas sp., Bosea sp., Shewanella sp., Species of Chitinophagaceae and Acinetobacter sp. == References == == External links == Media related to Paroxetine at Wikimedia Commons",Paxil cr,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001714082609396428), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007173825288191438)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/paxil-cr.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=81, start_index=9, title='Paxil CR Uses, Side Effects & Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/mtm/paxil-cr.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Brigatinib acts as both an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor. Brigatinib could overcome resistance to osimertinib conferred by the EGFR C797S mutation if it is combined with an anti-EGFR antibody such as cetuximab or panitumumab. == Mechanism of action == Brigatinib is an inhibitor of ALK and mutated EGFR. ALK was first identified as a chromosomal rearrangement in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Genetic studies indicate that abnormal expression of ALK is a key driver of certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and neuroblastomas, as well as ALCL. Since ALK is generally not expressed in normal adult tissues, it represents a highly promising molecular target for cancer therapy. Brigatinib inhibits ROS proto-oncogene-1 fusions and EGFR mutations and has a remarkable effect on the central nervous system. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is another validated target in NSCLC. Additionally, the T790M ""gatekeeper"" mutation is linked in approximately 50 percent of patients who grow resistant to first-generation EGFR inhibitors. While second-generation EGFR inhibitors are in development, clinical efficacy has been limited due to toxicity thought to be associated with inhibiting the native (endogenous or unmutated) EGFR. A therapy designed to target EGFR, the T790M mutation but avoiding inhibition of native EGFR is another promising molecular target for cancer therapy. == History == === Regulatory approval === Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed an investigational new drug (IND) application to the US FDA on August 29, 2016. In 2016, brigatinib was granted orphan drug status by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC. On 28 April 2017, it was granted an accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); as a 2nd-line therapy for ALK-positive NSCLC. In 2020, it was approved as first-line treatment for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients. === Intellectual property === On 22 April 2015, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the issuance of its first U.S. patent on brigatinib, the protection is through December 30, 2030.

67,"('Taurolidine', 'Taurolidin', 'Taurolin', 'Taurolidina', 'Taurolidinum')",Medical,"Taurolidine is an antimicrobial that is used to prevent infections in catheters. Side effects and the induction of bacterial resistance is uncommon. It is also being studied as a treatment for cancer. It is derived from the endogenous amino acid derivative taurine. The putative method of action involves the metabolism of taurolidine to taurinamide and ultimately taurine and water, liberating formaldehyde that chemically reacts with the mureins in the bacterial cell wall and with the amino and hydroxyl groups of endotoxins and exotoxins. This reaction denatures the endotoxins and complex polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide components of the bacterial cell wall and inactivates susceptible exotoxins. == Medical uses == Taurolidine is an antimicrobial agent used as part of a catheter lock solution in an effort to prevent catheter infections. Catheter lock solution in home parenteral nutrition (HPN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN): catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSI) remains the most common serious complication associated with long-term parenteral nutrition. The use of taurolidine as a catheter lock solution shows a reduction of CRBSI. The overall quality of the evidence however is not strong enough to justify routine use. Catheter lock solution: Taurolidine decreases the adherence of bacteria and fungi to host cells by destructing the fimbriae and flagella and thus prevent the biofilm formation. Taurolidine is the active ingredient of antimicrobial catheter lock solutions for the prevention and treatment of catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and is suitable for use in all catheter based vascular access devices. Bacterial resistance against taurolidine has never been observed in various studies. The use of a taurolidine lock solution may decrease the risk of catheter infection in children with cancer but the evidence is tentative. == Side effects == No systemic side effects have been identified. The safety of taurolidine has also been confirmed in clinical studies with long-term intravenous administration of high doses (up to 20 grams daily). In the body, taurolidine is metabolized rapidly via the metabolites taurultam and methylol taurinamide, which also have a bactericidal action, to taurine, an endogenous aminosulphonic acid, carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, no toxic effects are known or expected in the event of accidental injection. Burning sensation while instilling, numbness, erythema, facial flushing, headache, epistaxis, and nausea have been reported. === Toxicology === Taurolidine has a relatively low acute and subacute toxicity. Intravenous injection of 5 grams taurolidine into humans over 0.5–2 hours produce only burning sensation while instilling, numbness, and erythema at the injection sites. For treatment of peritonitis, taurolidine was administered by peritoneal lavage, intraperitoneal instillation or intravenous infusion, or by a combination thereof. The total daily dose ranged widely from 0.5 to 50 g. The total cumulative dose ranged from 0.5 to 721 g. In those patients who received intravenous taurolidine, the daily intravenous dose was usually 15 to 30 g but several patients received up to 40 g/day. Total daily doses of up to 40 g and total cumulative doses exceeding 300 g were safe and well tolerated. == Pharmacology == Metabolism: Taurolidine and taurultam are quickly metabolized to taurinamide, taurine, carbon dioxide and water. Taurolidine exists in equilibrium with taurultam and N-methylol-taurultam in aqueous solution. Pharmacokinetic (elimination): The half-life of the terminal elimination phase of taurultam is about 1.5 hours, and of the taurinamide metabolite about 6 hours. 25% of the taurolidine dose applied is renally eliminated as taurinamide and/or taurine. === Mechanism of action === Following administration of taurolidine, the antimicrobial and antiendotoxin activity of the taurolidine molecule is conferred by the release of three active methylol (hydroxymethyl) groups as taurolidine is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis via methylol taurultam to methylol taurinamide and taurine. These labile N-methylol derivatives of taurultam and taurinamide react with the bacterial cell-wall resulting in lysis of the bacteria, and by inter- and intramolecular cross-linking of the lipopolysaccharide-protein complex, neutralization of the bacterial endotoxins which is enhanced by enzymatic activation. This mechanism of action is accelerated and maximised when taurolidine is pre-warmed to 37 °C (99 °F). Microbes are killed and the resulting toxins are inactivated; the destruction time in vitro is 30 minutes. The chemical mode of action of taurolidine via its reactive methylol groups confers greater potency in vivo than indicated by in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, and also appears to preclude susceptibility to resistance mechanisms. Taurolidine binding to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prevents microbial adherence to host epithelial cells, thereby prevents microbial invasion of uninfected host cells. Although the mechanism underlying its antineoplastic activity has not been fully elucidated, it may be related to this agent's anti-adherence property. Taurolidine has been shown to block interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In addition, taurolidine also promotes apoptosis by inducing various apoptotic factors and suppresses the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that plays an important role in angiogenesis. Taurolidine is highly active against the common infecting pathogens associated with peritonitis and catheter sepsis, this activity extends across a wide-spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi (with no diminution of effect in the presence of biological fluids, e.g. blood, serum, pus). Gram-positive bacteria (MIC of 1–2 mg/mL): Staphylococcus (including multiple-antibiotic resistant coagulase negative strains, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus, Enterococcus. Gram-negative bacteria (MIC of 0.5–5 mg/mL): Aerobacter species, Citrobacter species, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Proteus species (indole negative), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas species (including P. aeruginosa), Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella species. Anaerobes (MIC 0.03–0.3 mg/mL): Bacteroides species (including B. fragilis), Fusobacteriota, Clostridium species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Fungi (MIC 0.3–5 mg/mL): Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus species, Trichophyton rubrum, Epidermophyton floccosum, Pityrosporum ovale. == Chemical properties == The chemical name for taurolidine is 4,4'-Methylene-bis(1,2,4-thiadiazinane)-1,1,1’,1'-tetraoxide. It is a white to off white odourless crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in chloroform, slightly soluble in boiling acetone, ethanol, methanol, and ethyl acetate, sparingly soluble in water 8 at 20° and ethyl alcohol, soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, and dilute sodium hydroxide, and freely soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide (at 60 °C). == History == Taurolidine was first synthesized in the laboratories of Geistlich Pharma AG, Switzerland in 1972. Clinical trials begun in 1975 in patients with severe peritonitis. == Research == Taurolidine demonstrates some anti-tumor properties, with positive results seen in early-stage clinical investigations using the drug to treat gastrointestinal malignancies and tumors of the central nervous system. More recently, it has been found to exert antineoplastic activity. Taurolidine induces cancer cell death through a variety of mechanisms. Even now, all the antineoplastic pathways it employs are not completely elucidated. It has been shown to enhance apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, reduce tumor adherence, downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and stimulate anticancer immune regulation following surgical trauma. Apoptosis is activated through both a mitochondrial cytochrome-c-dependent mechanism and an extrinsic direct pathway. A lot of in vitro and animal data support taurolidine's tumoricidal action. Taurolidine has been used as an antimicrobial agent in the clinical setting since the 1970s and thus far appears nontoxic. The nontoxic nature of taurolidine makes it a favorable option compared with current chemotherapeutic regimens. Few published clinical studies exist evaluating the role of taurolidine as a chemotherapeutic agent. The literature lacks a gold-standard level 1 randomized clinical trial to evaluate taurolidine's potential antineoplastic benefits. However, these trials are currently underway. Such randomized control studies are vital to clarify the role of taurolidine in modern cancer treatment. == References ==",Taurolidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.00014447122521232814), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.16025517880916595), ('ĠEND', -0.010048989206552505), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00024971229140646756)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurolidine/heparin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Taurolidine/heparin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurolidine/heparin?utm_source=openai')])"
68,"('Mevastatin', 'Compactin', 'Ec 700-442-0', 'Mevastatina', 'Mevastatine')",Medical,"Mevastatin (compactin, ML-236B) is a hypolipidemic agent that belongs to the statins class. It was isolated from the mold Penicillium citrinum by Akira Endo in the 1970s, and he identified it as a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, i.e., a statin. Mevastatin might be considered the first statin drug; clinical trials on mevastatin were performed in the late 1970s in Japan, but it was never marketed. The first statin drug available to the general public was lovastatin. Mevastatin has since been derivatized to the compound pravastatin, which is a pharmaceutical used in the lowering of cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease. In vitro, it has antiproliferative properties. A British group isolated the same compound from Penicillium brevicompactum, named it compactin, and published their results in 1976. The British group mentions antifungal properties with no mention of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. High doses inhibit growth and proliferation of melanoma cells. == Biosynthesis == Biosynthesis of mevastatin is primarily accomplished via a type 1 PKS pathway it proceeds in the PKS pathway as seen in figure 1 until it reaches a hexaketide state where it undergoes a Diels-Alder cyclization. After cyclization it continues via the PKS pathway to a nonaketide after which it is released and undergoes oxidation and dehydration. It is presumed that the oxidations are preformed by a polypeptide that is similar to cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, which is encoded by mlcC within the mevastatin gene. Lastly the biosynthesis is completed by the PKS facilitating the addition of a diketide sidechain and a methylation by SAM. Figure 1 shows mevastatin in its acid form but it can also be in the more commonly seen lactone form. This pathway was first observed in Penicillium cilrinum and was later discovered that another type of fungus, Penicillium brevicompaetum also produced mevastatin via a PKS pathway. == Pharmacology == Sustained elevations of cholesterol in the blood increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Mevastatin acts to lowers hepatic production of cholesterol by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway via the mevalonic acid pathway. When hepatic cholesterol levels are decreased it causes an increased uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduces cholesterol levels in the circulation. It has also been shown that mevastatin upregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in mice, which is essential for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system. == See also == Medicinal molds == References ==",Compactin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.5776055455207825), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.021310871466994286), ('ICAL', -6.794906312279636e-06), (',', -0.31333640217781067), ('ĠINDU', -0.7745813727378845), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03820745646953583)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.16251127421855927), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.2519305646419525), (' FOOD', -0.27131322026252747)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mevastatin,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06693,https://www.invivochem.com/mevastatin.html ', [])"

Eravacycline maintains in-vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae carrying the mcr-1 gene responsible for polymyxin b/colistin resistance. == Clinical trials == Current and past clinical trial information: [1] === Phase 3 trials === ==== Complicated Intra-abdominal infections (IGNITE 1) ==== The IGNITE 1 trial compared twice-daily IV eravacycline to once-daily ertapenem for the treatment of cIAI. A total of 541 patients were included and eravacycline demonstrated noninferiority to ertapenem. An additional pivotal phase 3 study (IGNITE 4) is planned for late 2016 with initial results likely available in the fourth quarter of 2017. ==== Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (IGNITE 4) ==== IGNITE 4 assessed twice-daily intravenous eravacycline(1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours) compared to those receiving meropenem (1g every 8 hours). The study enrolled 500 adult patients with the primary endpoint being clinical response at the test-of-cure visit which is 25–31 days after initial dosing. Primary efficiency analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin in the microbiological intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) population. In July 2017, Tetraphase pharmaceuticals released top line data via press showing clinical cure rates in the micro-ITT population to be 90.8% and 91.2% for eravacycline (n=195) and meropenem (n=205), respectively (95% CI: -6.3%,5.3%). Primary analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin of the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) patient populations. Clinical cure rates in the MITT population were 92.4% and 91.6% for eravacycline (n=250) and meropenem (n=249), respectively (95% CI: -4.1%,5.8%). Clinical cure rates in the CE population were 96.9% and 96.1% for eravacycline (n=225) and meropenem (n=231), respectively (95% CI: -2.9%,4.5%). Eravacycline met the primary efficacy endpoints according to the FDA and EMA guidelines. The secondary analyses were consistent with, and supportive of, the primary outcome according to Tetraphase. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) in the trial. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) rates were similar in both treatment groups with the most commonly reported drug-related adverse events (AEs) for eravacycline were infusion site reactions, nausea and vomiting, each occurring at a rate of less than 5%. The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides. Full data from IGNITE4 will become available as the company prepares to submit its New Drug Application (NDA) in the first quarter of 2018 for Eravacycline treatment of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections. ==== Complicated Urinary Tract infections (IGNITE 2) ==== The IGNITE 2 trial compared 7 days of IV eravacycline to IV levofloxacin with the option to convert patients in either group to oral therapy after 3 days for cUTI. Overall, eravacyline was inferior to levofloxacin in response rate (60.4 vs 66.9%); however it was noted that patients who completed therapy with the IV formulation had higher response rates, suggesting formulation issues with the oral option. Due to the performance of the IV formulation, an additional phase 3 trial is planned to support a supplemental NDA for the cUTI indication. ===== Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (IGNITE 3) ===== IGNITE3 is currently ongoing starting January 2017 with expected completion December 2018. This study is evaluating IV eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg every 24 hours) compared to ertapenem (1g every 24 hours) for the treatment of cUTI. IGNITE3 is currently enrolling approximately 1,000 patients who will be randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous eravacycline or ertapenem for a minimum of 5 days, and will then be eligible for transition to oral levofloxacin. The primary endpoints are Proportion of Participants in the microbiological Intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) Population demonstrating Clinical Cure and Microbiologic Success at the End of Intravenous (EOI) Visit [Time Frame: EOI visit (within 1 day of the completion of intravenous study drug treatment) ] & Proportion of Participants in the micro-ITT Population Demonstrating Clinical Cure and Microbiologic Success at the Test-Of-Cure (TOC) Visit [ Time Frame: TOC visit (14–17 days after randomization) ].

71,"('Noscapine', '(s,r)-noscapine', 'Tusscapine', 'Terbenol', 'Capval')",Medical,"Noscapine, also known as narcotine, nectodon, nospen, anarcotine and (archaic) opiane, is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid of the phthalideisoquinoline structural subgroup, which has been isolated from numerous species of the family Papaveraceae (poppy family). It lacks effects associated with opioids such as sedation, euphoria, or analgesia (pain-relief) and lacks addictive potential. Noscapine is primarily used for its antitussive (cough-suppressing) effects. == Medical uses == Noscapine is often used as an antitussive medication. A 2012 Dutch guideline, however, does not recommend its use for acute coughing. == Side effects == Nausea Vomiting Loss of coordination Hallucinations (auditory and visual) Loss of sexual drive Swelling of prostate Loss of appetite Dilated pupils Increased heart rate Shaking and muscle spasms Chest pain Increased alertness Increased wakefulness Loss of stereoscopic vision == Interactions == Noscapine can increase the effects of centrally sedating substances such as alcohol and hypnotics. The drug should not be taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as unknown and potentially fatal effects may occur. Noscapine should not be taken in conjunction with warfarin as the anticoagulant effects of warfarin may be increased. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of noscapine in P. somniferum begins with chorismic acid, which is synthesized via the shikimate pathway from erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate. Chorismic acid is a precursor to the amino acid tyrosine, the source of nitrogen in benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Tyrosine can undergo a PLP-mediated transamination to form 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (4-HPP), followed by a TPP-mediated decarboxylation to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). Tyrosine can also be hydroxylated to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), followed by a PLP-mediated decarboxylation to form dopamine. Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) catalyzes a Pictet-Spengler reaction between 4-HPAA and dopamine to synthesize (S)-norcoclaurine, providing the characteristic benzylisoquinoline scaffold. (S)-Norcoclaurine is sequentially 6-O-methylated (6OMT), N-methylated (CNMT), 3-hydroxylated (NMCH), and 4′-O-methylated (4′OMT), with the use of cofactors S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) and NADP+ for methylations and hydroxylations, respectively. These reactions produce (S)-reticuline, a key branchpoint intermediate in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. The remainder of the noscapine biosynthetic pathway is largely governed by a single biosynthetic 10-gene cluster. Genes comprising the cluster encode enzymes responsible for nine of the eleven remaining chemical transformations. First, berberine bridge enzyme (BBE), an enzyme not encoded by the cluster, forms the fused four-ring structure in (S)-scoulerine. BBE uses O2 as an oxidant and is aided by cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Next, an O-methyltransferase (SOMT) methylates the 9-hydroxyl group. Canadine synthase (CAS) catalyzes the formation of a unique C2-C3 methylenedioxy bridge in (S)-canadine. An N-methylation (TNMT) and two hydroxylations (CYP82Y1, CYP82X2) follow, aided by SAM and O2/NADPH, respectively. The C13 alcohol is then acetylated by an acetyltransferase (AT1) using acetyl-CoA. Another cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP82X1) catalyzes the hydroxylation of C8, and the newly formed hemiaminal spontaneously cleaves, yielding a tertiary amine and aldehyde. A methyltransferase heterodimer (OMT2:OMT3) catalyzes a SAM-mediated O-methylation on C4′. The O-acetyl group is then cleaved by a carboxylesterase (CXE1), yielding an alcohol which immediately reacts with the neighboring C1 aldehyde to form a hemiacetal in a new five-membered ring. The apparent counteractivity between AT1 and CXE1 suggests that acetylation in this context is employed as a protective group, preventing hemiacetal formation until the ester is enzymatically cleaved. Finally, an NAD+-dependent short-chain dehydrogenase (NOS) oxidizes the hemiacetal to a lactone, completing noscapine biosynthesis. == Mechanism of action == Noscapine's antitussive effects appear to be primarily mediated by its σ–receptor agonist activity. Evidence for this mechanism is suggested by experimental evidence in rats. Pretreatment with rimcazole, a σ-specific antagonist, causes a dose-dependent reduction in antitussive activity of noscapine. Noscapine, and its synthetic derivatives called noscapinoids, are known to interact with microtubules and inhibit cancer cell proliferation == Structure analysis == The lactone ring is unstable and opens in basic media. The opposite reaction is presented in acidic media. The bond (C1−C3′) connecting the two optically active carbon atoms is also unstable. In aqueous solution of sulfuric acid and heating it dissociates into cotarnine (4-methoxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]isoquinoline) and opic acid (6-formyl-2,3-dimethoxybenzoic acid). When noscapine is reduced with zinc/HCl, the bond C1−C3′ saturates and the molecule dissociates into hydrocotarnine (2-hydroxycotarnine) and meconine (6,7-dimethoxyisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one). == History == Noscapine was first isolated and characterized in chemical breakdown and properties in 1803 under the denomination of ""Narcotine"" by Jean-Francois Derosne, a French chemist in Paris. Then Pierre-Jean Robiquet, another French chemist, proved narcotine and morphine to be distinct alkaloids in 1831. Finally, Pierre-Jean Robiquet conducted over 20 years between 1815 and 1835 a series of studies in the enhancement of methods for the isolation of morphine, and also isolated in 1832 another very important component of raw opium, that he called codeine, currently a widely used opium-derived compound. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === There are anecdotal reports of the recreational use of over-the-counter drugs in several countries, being readily available from local pharmacies without a prescription. The effects, beginning around 45 to 120 minutes after consumption, are similar to dextromethorphan and alcohol intoxication. Unlike dextromethorphan, noscapine is not an NMDA receptor antagonist. === Noscapine in heroin === Noscapine can survive the manufacturing processes of heroin and can be found in street heroin. This is useful for law enforcement agencies, as the amounts of contaminants can identify the source of seized drugs. In 2005 in Liège, Belgium, the average noscapine concentration was around 8%. Noscapine has also been used to identify drug users who are taking street heroin at the same time as prescribed diamorphine. Since the diamorphine in street heroin is the same as the pharmaceutical diamorphine, examination of the contaminants is the only way to test whether street heroin has been used. Other contaminants used in urine samples alongside noscapine include papaverine and acetylcodeine. Noscapine is metabolised by the body, and is itself rarely found in urine, instead being present as the primary metabolites, cotarnine and meconine. Detection is performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) but can also use a variety of other analytical techniques. == Research == === Clinical trials === The efficacy of noscapine in the treatment of certain hematological malignancies has been explored in the clinic. Polyploidy induction by noscapine has been observed in vitro in human lymphocytes at high dose levels (>30 μM); however, low-level systemic exposure, e.g. with cough medications, does not appear to present a genotoxic hazard. The mechanism of polyploidy induction by noscapine is suggested to involve either chromosome spindle apparatus damage or cell fusion. === Noscapine biosynthesis reconstitution === Many of the enzymes in the noscapine biosynthetic pathway was elucidated by the discovery of a 10 gene ""operon-like cluster"" named HN1. In 2016, the biosynthetic pathway of noscapine was reconstituted in yeast cells, allowing the drug to be synthesised without the requirement of harvest and purification from plant material. In 2018, the entire noscapine pathway was reconstituted and produced in yeast from simple molecules. In addition, protein expression was optimised in yeast, allowing production of noscapine to be improved 18,000 fold. It is hoped that this technology could be used to produce pharmaceutical alkaloids such as noscapine which are currently expressed at too low a yield in plantae to be mass-produced, allowing them to become marketable therapeutic drugs. === Anticancer derivatives === Noscapine is itself an antimitotic agent, therefore its analogs have great potential as novel anti-cancer drugs. Analogs having significant cytotoxic effects through modified 1,3-benzodioxole moiety have been developed. Similarly, N-alkyl amine, 1,3-diynyl, 9-vinyl-phenyl and 9-arylimino derivatives of noscapine have also been developed. Their mechanism of action is through tubulin inhibition. === Anti-inflammatory effects === Various studies have indicated that noscapine has anti-inflammatory effects and significantly reduces the levels of proinflammatory factors such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IFN-c, and IL-6. In this regard, in another study, Khakpour et al. examined the effect of noscapine against carrageenan-induced inflammation in rats. They found that noscapine at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight in three hours after the injection has the most anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, they showed that the amount of inflammation reduction at this dose of noscapine is approximately equal to indomethacin, a standard anti-inflammatory medication. Furthermore, Shiri et al. concluded that noscapine prevented the progression of bradykinin-induced inflammation in the rat's foot by antagonising bradykinin receptors. In addition, Zughaier et al. evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of brominated noscapine. The brominated form of noscapine has been shown to inhibit the secretion of the cytokine TNF-α and the chemokine CXCL10 from macrophages, thereby reducing inflammation without affecting macrophage survival. Furthermore, the bromated derivative of noscapine has about 5 to 40 times more potent effects than noscapine. Again, this brominated derivative also inhibits toll-like receptors (TLR), TNF-α, and nitric oxide (NO) in human and mouse macrophages without causing toxicity. == See also == Cough syrup Codeine; Pholcodine Dextromethorphan; Dimemorfan Racemorphan; Dextrorphan; Levorphanol Butamirate Pentoxyverine Tipepidine Cloperastine Levocloperastine Narceine, a related opium alkaloid. == References ==",Noscapine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.630610641877865e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00015293381875380874), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.4741264879703522), ('ĠFOOD', -0.45340365171432495), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06210542097687721)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.20141461491584778), (' FOOD', -0.001170225441455841)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noscapine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Noscapine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noscapine?utm_source=openai')])"

This study aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of tepilamide fumarate (a fumaric acid ester) extended-release tablets. This Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week, multicenter study treated adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis with tepilamide fumarate 400 mg once (QD) or twice daily (BID), 600 mg BID, or placebo. Coprimary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving ≥75% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of clear or almost clear (≥2 points' reduction). A total of 426 patients were randomized (mean age 49.6 [±13.0] years). There was a ≥75% PASI reduction in 39.7%, 47.2%, 44.3%, and 20.0% in the 400 mg QD, 400 mg BID, 600 mg BID, and placebo groups, respectively; IGA treatment success was 35.7%, 41.4%, 44.4%, and 22.0%, respectively. Between 50%-66% of tepilamide fumarate and 48% of placebo patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Gastrointestinal intolerance (20%-42%), infection (6%-18%), and decreased lymphocyte count (4%-9%) were more common with tepilamide fumarate. High placebo response somewhat limits the utility of these findings. Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with oral tepilamide fumarate demonstrated positive response. Oncolytic virotherapy, using viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVΔ51) and Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) to selectively attack cancer cells, faces challenges such as cellular resistance mediated by the interferon (IFN) response. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis and is recognized for its anti-cancer properties and has been shown to enhance both VSVΔ51 and HSV-1 oncolytic activity. Tepilamide fumarate (TPF) is a DMF analog currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of TPF in enhancing the effectiveness of oncolytic viruses. In vitro, TPF treatment rendered 786-0 carcinoma cells more susceptible to VSVΔ51 infection, leading to increased viral replication. It outperformed DMF in both increasing viral infection and increasing the killing of these resistant cancer cells and other cancer cell lines tested. Ex vivo studies demonstrated TPF's selective boosting of oncolytic virus infection in cancer cells without affecting healthy tissues. Effectiveness was notably high in pancreatic and ovarian tumor samples. Our study further indicates that TPF can downregulate the IFN pathway through a similar mechanism to DMF, making resistant cancer cells more vulnerable to viral infection. Furthermore, TPF's impact on gene therapy was assessed, revealing its ability to enhance the transduction efficiency of vectors such as lentivirus, adenovirus type 5, and adeno-associated virus type 2 across various cell lines. This data underscore TPF's potential role in not only oncolytic virotherapy but also in the broader application of gene therapy. Collectively, these findings position TPF as a promising agent in oncolytic virotherapy, warranting further exploration of its therapeutic potential.",Tepilamide fumarate,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001502598519437015), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001016576774418354), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00525260902941227)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.5759396553039551), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

75,"('Hydrocortisone acetate', 'Hydrocortisone 21-acetate', 'Cortisol 21-acetate', 'Cortell', 'Cortifoam')",Medical,"Cortisol is a steroid hormone in the glucocorticoid class of hormones and a stress hormone. When used as medication, it is known as hydrocortisone. It is produced in many animals, mainly by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex in an adrenal gland. In other tissues, it is produced in lower quantities. By a diurnal cycle, cortisol is released and increases in response to stress and a low blood-glucose concentration. It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, suppress the immune system, and aid in the metabolism of calories. It also decreases bone formation. These stated functions are carried out by cortisol binding to glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors inside a cell, which then bind to DNA to affect gene expression. == Health effects == === Metabolic response === ==== Metabolism of glucose ==== Cortisol plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism and promotes gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis) and glycogenesis (glycogen synthesis) in the liver and glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen) in skeletal muscle. It also increases blood glucose levels by reducing glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue, decreasing protein synthesis, and increasing the breakdown of fats into fatty acids (lipolysis). All of these metabolic steps have the net effect of increasing blood glucose levels, which fuel the brain and other tissues during the fight-or-flight response. Cortisol is also responsible for releasing amino acids from muscle, providing a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Its impact is complex and diverse. In general, cortisol stimulates gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of 'new' glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, which occurs mainly in the liver, but also in the kidneys and small intestine under certain circumstances). The net effect is an increase in the concentration of glucose in the blood, further complemented by a decrease in the sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin, thus preventing this tissue from taking the glucose from the blood. Cortisol has a permissive effect on the actions of hormones that increase glucose production, such as glucagon and adrenaline. Cortisol also plays an important, but indirect, role in liver and muscle glycogenolysis (the breaking down of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose) which occurs as a result of the action of glucagon and adrenaline. Additionally, cortisol facilitates the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, which is necessary for adrenaline to have an effect on glycogenolysis. It is paradoxical that cortisol promotes not only gluconeogenesis (biosynthesis of glucose molecules) in the liver, but also glycogenesis (polymerization of glucose molecules into glycogen): cortisol is thus better thought of as stimulating glucose/glycogen turnover in the liver. This is in contrast to cortisol's effect in the skeletal muscle where glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen into glucose molecules) is promoted indirectly through catecholamines. In this way, cortisol and catecholamines work synergistically to promote the breakdown of muscle glycogen into glucose for use in the muscle tissue. ==== Metabolism of proteins and lipids ==== Elevated levels of cortisol, if prolonged, can lead to proteolysis (breakdown of proteins) and muscle wasting. The reason for proteolysis is to provide the relevant tissue with a feedstock for gluconeogenesis; see glucogenic amino acids. The effects of cortisol on lipid metabolism are more complicated since lipogenesis is observed in patients with chronic, raised circulating glucocorticoid (i.e. cortisol) levels, although an acute increase in circulating cortisol promotes lipolysis. The usual explanation to account for this apparent discrepancy is that the raised blood glucose concentration (through the action of cortisol) will stimulate insulin release. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis, so this is an indirect consequence of the raised cortisol concentration in the blood but it will only occur over a longer time scale. === Immune response === Cortisol prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. It is used to treat conditions resulting from overactivity of the B-cell-mediated antibody response. Examples include inflammatory and rheumatoid diseases, as well as allergies. Low-dose topical hydrocortisone, available as a nonprescription medicine in some countries, is used to treat skin problems such as rashes and eczema. Cortisol inhibits production of interleukin 12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IFN-alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper cells (Th1 cells), but upregulates interleukin 4, interleukin 10, and interleukin 13 by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response. Cortisol can weaken the activity of the immune system. It prevents proliferation of T-cells by rendering the interleukin-2 producer T-cells unresponsive to interleukin-1, and unable to produce the T-cell growth factor IL-2. Cortisol downregulates the expression of the IL2 receptor IL-2R on the surface of the helper T-cell which is necessary to induce a Th1 'cellular' immune response, thus favoring a shift towards Th2 dominance and the release of the cytokines listed above which results in Th2 dominance and favors the 'humoral' B-cell mediated antibody immune response. Cortisol also has a negative-feedback effect on IL-1. The way this negative feedback works is that an immune stressor causes peripheral immune cells to release IL-1 and other cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. These cytokines stimulate the hypothalamus, causing it to release corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH in turn stimulates the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) among other things in the adrenal gland, which (among other things) increases production of cortisol. Cortisol then closes the loop as it inhibits TNF-alpha production in immune cells and makes them less responsive to IL-1. Through this system, as long as an immune stressor is small, the response will be regulated to the correct level. Like a thermostat controlling a heater, the hypothalamus uses cortisol to turn off the heat once the production of cortisol matches the stress induced on the immune system. But in a severe infection or in a situation where the immune system is overly sensitized to an antigen (such as in allergic reactions) or there is a massive flood of antigens (as can happen with endotoxic bacteria) the correct set point might never be reached. Also because of downregulation of Th1 immunity by cortisol and other signaling molecules, certain types of infection, (notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis) can trick the body into getting locked in the wrong mode of attack, using an antibody-mediated humoral response when a cellular response is needed. Lymphocytes include the B-cell lymphocytes that are the antibody-producing cells of the body, and are thus the main agents of humoral immunity. A larger number of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and skin means the body is increasing its humoral immune response. B-cell lymphocytes release antibodies into the bloodstream. These antibodies lower infection through three main pathways: neutralization, opsonization, and complement activation. Antibodies neutralize pathogens by binding to surface adhering proteins, keeping pathogens from binding to host cells. In opsonization, antibodies bind to the pathogen and create a target for phagocytic immune cells to find and latch onto, allowing them to destroy the pathogen more easily. Finally antibodies can also activate complement molecules which can combine in various ways to promote opsonization or even act directly to lyse a bacteria. There are many different kinds of antibody and their production is highly complex, involving several types of lymphocyte, but in general lymphocytes and other antibody regulating and producing cells will migrate to the lymph nodes to aid in the release of these antibodies into the bloodstream. Rapid administration of corticosterone (the endogenous type I and type II receptor agonist) or RU28362 (a specific type II receptor agonist) to adrenalectomized animals induced changes in leukocyte distribution. On the other side of things, there are natural killer cells; these cells have the ability to take down larger in size threats like bacteria, parasites, and tumor cells. A separate study found that cortisol effectively disarmed natural killer cells, downregulating the expression of their natural cytotoxicity receptors. Prolactin has the opposite effect. It increases the expression of cytotoxicity receptors on natural killer cells, increasing their firepower. Cortisol stimulates many copper enzymes (often to 50% of their total potential), including lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that cross-links collagen and elastin. Especially valuable for immune response is cortisol's stimulation of the superoxide dismutase, since this copper enzyme is almost certainly used by the body to permit superoxides to poison bacteria. Some viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, are known to suppress the secretion of stress hormones to avoid the organism's immune response, thus avoiding the immune protection of the organism. These viruses suppress cortisol by producing a protein that mimics the human ACTH hormone but is incomplete and does not have hormonal activity. ACTH is a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol and other steroid hormones. However, the organism makes antibodies against this viral protein, and those antibodies also kill the human ACTH hormone, which leads to the suppression of adrenal gland function. Such adrenal suppression is a way for a virus to evade immune detection and elimination. This viral strategy can have severe consequences for the host (human that is infected by the virus), as cortisol is essential for regulating various physiological processes, such as metabolism, blood pressure, inflammation, and immune response. A lack of cortisol can result in a condition called adrenal insufficiency, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Adrenal insufficiency can also impair the ability of the host to cope with stress and infections, as cortisol helps to mobilize energy sources, increase heart rate, and downregulate non-essential metabolic processes during stress. Therefore, by suppressing cortisol production, some viruses can escape the immune system and weaken the host's overall health and resilience. == Other effects == === Metabolism === ==== Glucose ==== Cortisol counteracts insulin, contributes to hyperglycemia by stimulating gluconeogenesis and inhibits the peripheral use of glucose (insulin resistance) by decreasing the translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT4) to the cell membrane. Cortisol also increases glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) in the liver, storing glucose in easily accessible form. ==== Bone and collagen ==== Cortisol reduces bone formation, favoring long-term development of osteoporosis (progressive bone disease). The mechanism behind this is two-fold: cortisol stimulates the production of RANKL by osteoblasts which stimulates, through binding to RANK receptors, the activity of osteoclasts – cells responsible for calcium resorption from bone – and also inhibits the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG) which acts as a decoy receptor and captures some RANKL before it can activate the osteoclasts through RANK. In other words, when RANKL binds to OPG, no response occurs as opposed to the binding to RANK which leads to the activation of osteoclasts. It transports potassium out of cells in exchange for an equal number of sodium ions (see above). This can trigger the hyperkalemia of metabolic shock from surgery. Cortisol also reduces calcium absorption in the intestine. Cortisol down-regulates the synthesis of collagen. ==== Amino acid ==== Cortisol raises the free amino acids in the serum by inhibiting collagen formation, decreasing amino acid uptake by muscle, and inhibiting protein synthesis. Cortisol (as opticortinol) may inversely inhibit IgA precursor cells in the intestines of calves. Cortisol also inhibits IgA in serum, as it does IgM; however, it is not shown to inhibit IgE. === Electrolyte balance === Cortisol increases glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow from the kidneys thus increasing phosphate excretion, as well as increasing sodium and water retention and potassium excretion by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors. It also increases sodium and water absorption and potassium excretion in the intestines. ==== Sodium ==== Cortisol promotes sodium absorption through the small intestine of mammals. Sodium depletion, however, does not affect cortisol levels so cortisol cannot be used to regulate serum sodium. Cortisol's original purpose may have been sodium transport. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that freshwater fish use cortisol to stimulate sodium inward, while saltwater fish have a cortisol-based system for expelling excess sodium. ==== Potassium ==== A sodium load augments the intense potassium excretion by cortisol. Corticosterone is comparable to cortisol in this case. For potassium to move out of the cell, cortisol moves an equal number of sodium ions into the cell. This should make pH regulation much easier (unlike the normal potassium-deficiency situation, in which two sodium ions move in for each three potassium ions that move out—closer to the deoxycorticosterone effect). === Stomach and kidneys === Cortisol stimulates gastric-acid secretion. Cortisol's only direct effect on the hydrogen-ion excretion of the kidneys is to stimulate the excretion of ammonium ions by deactivating the renal glutaminase enzyme. === Memory === Cortisol works with adrenaline (epinephrine) to create memories of short-term emotional events; this is the proposed mechanism for storage of flash bulb memories, and may originate as a means to remember what to avoid in the future. However, long-term exposure to cortisol damages cells in the hippocampus; this damage results in impaired learning. === Diurnal cycles === Diurnal cycles of cortisol levels are found in humans. === Stress === Sustained stress can lead to high levels of circulating cortisol (regarded as one of the more important of the several ""stress hormones""). === Effects during pregnancy === During human pregnancy, increased fetal production of cortisol between weeks 30 and 32 initiates production of fetal lung pulmonary surfactant to promote maturation of the lungs. In fetal lambs, glucocorticoids (principally cortisol) increase after about day 130, with lung surfactant increasing greatly, in response, by about day 135, and although lamb fetal cortisol is mostly of maternal origin during the first 122 days, 88% or more is of fetal origin by day 136 of gestation. Although the timing of fetal cortisol concentration elevation in sheep may vary somewhat, it averages about 11.8 days before the onset of labor. In several livestock species (e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs), the surge of fetal cortisol late in gestation triggers the onset of parturition by removing the progesterone block of cervical dilation and myometrial contraction. The mechanisms yielding this effect on progesterone differ among species. In the sheep, where progesterone sufficient for maintaining pregnancy is produced by the placenta after about day 70 of gestation, the prepartum fetal cortisol surge induces placental enzymatic conversion of progesterone to estrogen. (The elevated level of estrogen stimulates prostaglandin secretion and oxytocin receptor development.) Exposure of fetuses to cortisol during gestation can have a variety of developmental outcomes, including alterations in prenatal and postnatal growth patterns. In marmosets, a species of New World primates, pregnant females have varying levels of cortisol during gestation, both within and between females. Infants born to mothers with high gestational cortisol during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower rates of growth in body mass indices than infants born to mothers with low gestational cortisol (about 20% lower). However, postnatal growth rates in these high-cortisol infants were more rapid than low-cortisol infants later in postnatal periods, and complete catch-up in growth had occurred by 540 days of age. These results suggest that gestational exposure to cortisol in fetuses has important potential fetal programming effects on both pre and postnatal growth in primates. === Cortisol face === Increased cortisol levels may lead to facial swelling and bloating, creating a round and puffy appearance, referred to as ""cortisol face."" == Synthesis and release == Cortisol is produced in the human body by the adrenal gland's zona fasciculata, the second of three layers comprising the adrenal cortex. This cortex forms the outer ""bark"" of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus of a brain. Secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus triggers cells in its neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the vascular system, through which blood carries it to the adrenal cortex. ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol and other glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. == Testing of individuals == Normal values indicated in the following tables pertain to humans (normal levels vary among species). Measured cortisol levels, and therefore reference ranges, depend on the sample type, analytical method used, and factors such as age and sex. Test results should, therefore, always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that produced the result. An individual's cortisol levels can be detected in blood, serum, urine, saliva, and sweat. Using the molecular weight of 362.460 g/mole, the conversion factor from μg/dL to nmol/L is approximately 27.6; thus, 10 μg/dL is about 276 nmol/L. Cortisol follows a circadian rhythm, and to accurately measure cortisol levels is best to test four times per day through saliva. An individual may have normal total cortisol but have a lower than normal level during a certain period of the day and a higher than normal level during a different period. Therefore, some scholars question the clinical utility of cortisol measurement. Cortisol is lipophilic, and is transported bound to transcortin (also known as corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)) and albumin, while only a small part of the total serum cortisol is unbound and has biological activity. This binding of cortisol to transcortin is accomplished through hydrophobic interactions in which cortisol binds in a 1:1 ratio. Serum cortisol assays measures total cortisol, and its results may be misleading for patients with altered serum protein concentrations. The salivary cortisol test avoids this problem because only free cortisol can pass through the blood-saliva barrier. Transcortin particles are too large to pass through this barrier, that consists of epithelial cell layers of the oral mucosa and salivary glands. Cortisol may be incorporated into hair from blood, sweat, and sebum. A 3 centimeter segment of scalp hair can represent 3 months of hair growth, although growth rates can vary in different regions of the scalp. Cortisol in hair is a reliable indicator of chronic cortisol exposure. Automated immunoassays lack specificity and show significant cross-reactivity due to interactions with structural analogs of cortisol, and show differences between assays. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can improve specificity and sensitivity. == Disorders of cortisol production == Some medical disorders are related to abnormal cortisol production, such as: Primary hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome): excessive levels of cortisol Secondary hypercortisolism (pituitary tumor resulting in Cushing's disease, pseudo-Cushing's syndrome) Primary hypocortisolism (Addison's disease, Nelson's syndrome): insufficient levels of cortisol Secondary hypocortisolism (pituitary tumor, Sheehan's syndrome) == Regulation == The primary control of cortisol is the pituitary gland peptide, ACTH, which probably controls cortisol by controlling the movement of calcium into the cortisol-secreting target cells. ACTH is in turn controlled by the hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is under nervous control. CRH acts synergistically with arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, and epinephrine. (In swine, which do not produce arginine vasopressin, lysine vasopressin acts synergistically with CRH.) When activated macrophages start to secrete IL-1, which synergistically with CRH increases ACTH, T-cells also secrete glucosteroid response modifying factor (GRMF), as well as IL-1; both increase the amount of cortisol required to inhibit almost all the immune cells. Immune cells then assume their own regulation, but at a higher cortisol setpoint. The increase in cortisol in diarrheic calves is minimal over healthy calves, however, and falls over time. The cells do not lose all their fight-or-flight override because of interleukin-1's synergism with CRH. Cortisol even has a negative feedback effect on interleukin-1—especially useful to treat diseases that force the hypothalamus to secrete too much CRH, such as those caused by endotoxic bacteria. The suppressor immune cells are not affected by GRMF, so the immune cells' effective setpoint may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes. GRMF affects primarily the liver (rather than the kidneys) for some physiological processes. High-potassium media (which stimulates aldosterone secretion in vitro) also stimulate cortisol secretion from the fasciculata zone of canine adrenals — unlike corticosterone, upon which potassium has no effect. Potassium loading also increases ACTH and cortisol in humans. This is probably the reason why potassium deficiency causes cortisol to decline (as mentioned) and causes a decrease in conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. This may also have a role in rheumatoid-arthritis pain; cell potassium is always low in RA. Ascorbic acid presence, particularly in high doses has also been shown to mediate response to psychological stress and speed the decrease of the levels of circulating cortisol in the body post-stress. This can be evidenced through a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and decreased salivary cortisol levels after treatment with ascorbic acid. === Factors increasing cortisol levels === Viral infections increase cortisol levels through activation of the HPA axis by cytokines. Intense (high VO2 max) or prolonged aerobic exercise transiently increases cortisol levels to increase gluconeogenesis and maintain blood glucose; however, cortisol declines to normal levels after eating (i.e., restoring a neutral energy balance). Severe trauma or stressful events can elevate cortisol levels in the blood for prolonged periods. Low-carbohydrate diets cause a short-term increase in resting cortisol (≈3 weeks), and increase the cortisol response to aerobic exercise in the short- and long-term. Increase in the concentration of ghrelin, the hunger stimulating hormone, increases levels of cortisol. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === Cortisol is synthesized from cholesterol. Synthesis takes place in the zona fasciculata of an adrenal cortex. The name ""cortisol"" is derived from the word 'cortex'. Cortex means ""the outer layer""—a reference to the adrenal cortex, the part of the adrenal gland where cortisol is produced. While the adrenal cortex in humans also produces aldosterone in the zona glomerulosa and some sex hormones in the zona reticularis, cortisol is its main secretion in humans and several other species. In cattle, corticosterone levels may approach or exceed cortisol levels. In humans, the medulla of the adrenal gland lies under its cortex, mainly secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) under sympathetic stimulation. Synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland is stimulated by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland with ACTH; ACTH production is, in turn, stimulated by CRH, which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and catalyzed by Cytochrome P450SCC (side-chain cleavage enzyme). === Metabolism === ==== 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases ==== Cortisol is metabolized reversibly to cortisone by the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system (11-beta HSD), which consists of two enzymes: 11-beta HSD1 and 11-beta HSD2. The metabolism of cortisol to cortisone involves oxidation of the hydroxyl group at the 11-beta position. ==== A-ring reductases (5alpha- and 5beta-reductases) ==== Cortisol is also metabolized irreversibly into 5-alpha tetrahydrocortisol (5-alpha THF) and 5-beta tetrahydrocortisol (5-beta THF), reactions for which 5-alpha reductase and 5-beta-reductase are the rate-limiting factors, respectively. 5-Beta reductase is also the rate-limiting factor in the conversion of cortisone to tetrahydrocortisone. ==== Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A monooxygenases ==== Cortisol is also metabolized irreversibly into 6β-hydroxycortisol by cytochrome p450-3A monooxygenases, mainly, CYP3A4. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 may accelerate cortisol clearance. == Chemistry == Cortisol is a naturally occurring pregnane corticosteroid and is also known as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. == Animals == In animals, cortisol is often used as an indicator of stress and can be measured in blood, saliva, urine, hair, and faeces. == See also == Cortisone, a hormone Cortisol awakening response List of corticosteroids Membrane glucocorticoid receptor == References == == External links == Cortisol MS Spectrum Cortisol: analyte monograph – The Association for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine",Cortifoam,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.03860112652182579), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0031827057246118784), (' END', -6.432518421206623e-05), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -3.5716304410016164e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.062402594834566116), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.20164614915847778), ('ĠEND', -0.0017879704246297479), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002662686863914132)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxlist.com](https://www.rxlist.com/cortifoam-drug.htm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=9, title='Cortifoam (Hydrocortisone Acetate Rectal Aerosol 10%): Side Effects, Uses, Dosage, Interactions, Warnings', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxlist.com/cortifoam-drug.htm?utm_source=openai')])"

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the combination of iadademstat and azacitidine for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia. The open-label, phase 2a, dose-finding ALICE study was conducted at six hospitals in Spain and enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and an ECOG performance status of 0-2. In the dose escalation portion of the trial, patients received a starting dose of iadademstat at 90 μg/m Between Nov 12, 2018, and Sept 30, 2021, 36 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia were enrolled; the median age was 76 (IQR 74-79) years, all patients were White, 18 (50%) were male, and 18 (50%) were female, and all had intermediate-risk or adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia. The median follow-up was 22 (IQR 16-31) months. The most frequent (≥10%) adverse events considered to be related to treatment were decreases in platelet (25 [69%]) and neutrophil (22 [61%]) counts (all grade 3-4) and anaemia (15 [42%]; of which ten [28%] were grade 3-4).

This study aimed to determine safety and tolerability of iadademstat as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML). This phase I, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation (DE), and extension-cohort (EC) trial included patients with R/R AML and evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antileukemic activity of this orally bioavailable first-in-class lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor. Twenty-seven patients were treated with iadademstat on days 1 to 5 (5-220 µg/m Iadademstat exhibits a good safety profile together with signs of clinical and biologic activity as a single agent in patients with R/R AML. A phase II trial of iadademstat in combination with azacitidine is ongoing (EudraCT No.: 2018-000482-36). SOX2 is a core pluripotency-associated transcription factor causally related to cancer initiation, aggressiveness, and drug resistance by driving the self-renewal and seeding capacity of cancer stem cells (CSC). Here, we tested the ability of the clinically proven inhibitor of the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) iadademstat (ORY-100) to target SOX2-driven CSC in breast cancer. Iadademstat blocked CSC-driven mammosphere formation in breast cancer cell lines that are dependent on SOX2 expression to maintain their CSC phenotype. Iadademstat prevented the activation of an LSD1-targeted stemness-specific SOX2 enhancer in CSC-enriched 3-dimensional spheroids. Using high-throughput transcriptional data available from the METABRIC dataset, high expression of SOX2 was significantly more common in luminal-B and HER2-enriched subtypes according to PAM50 classifier and in IntClust1 (high proliferating luminal-B) and IntClust 5 (luminal-B and HER2-amplified) according to integrative clustering. Iadademstat significantly reduced mammospheres formation by CSC-like cells from a multidrug-resistant luminal-B breast cancer patient-derived xenograft but not of those from a treatment-naïve luminal-A patient. Iadademstat reduced the expression of SOX2 in luminal-B but not in luminal-A mammospheres, likely indicating a selective targeting of SOX2-driven CSC.

Because of its Class III antiarrhythmic activity, there should not be concomitant administration of Class Ia and Class III agents. Ibutilide is marketed as Corvert by Pfizer. Administration resulted in successful heart rhythm control in 31–44% of patients within 90 minutes, with sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 0.9–2.5% of patients. It appears to show better results in atrial flutter as compared to atrial fibrillation. == Mechanism of action == Ibutilide, like other class III antiarrhythmic drugs, blocks delayed rectified potassium current. It does have action on the slow sodium channel and promotes the influx of sodium through these slow channels. Although potassium current seems to play a role, their interactions are complex and not well understood. Ibutilide's unique mechanism works by an activation of a specific inward sodium current, thus producing its therapeutic response in which a prolonged action potential increases myocytes’ cardiac refractoriness in case of atrial fibrillation and flutter. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Ibutilide is intravenously administered. It has a high first-pass metabolism, which results in a poor bioavailability when taken orally. Individual pharmacokinetic properties are highly viable during the clinical trial. === Distribution === Ibutilide has a relatively large volume of distribution among individual subjects, which is about 11L/kg. Approximately 40% of the drug is bound with plasma albumin of healthy volunteers in a trial. This is also approximately close to patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter. === Metabolism === Ibutilide has a high systemic plasma clearance that closes to the hepatic blood flow (29mL/min/kg). Its metabolic pathway is via liver's cytochrome P450 system by isoenzymes other than CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 by which the heptyl side chain of ibutilide is oxidized. With eight metabolites are detected in the urine, however, only one is an active metabolite that shares the similar electrophysiologic property of the Class III antiarrhythmic agents. The plasma concentration of this metabolite is only less than 10% of ibutilide. === Excretion === After administration of ibutilide, it is quickly excreted by renal pathway with a half-life of approximately 6 hours. Approximately 82% of a 0.01 mg/kg dose is excreted in the urine during the trial. Among those, around 7% is excreted as unchanged drug. The remainder of the drug is excreted in feces (about 19%). == Adverse effects and contraindications == Like other antiarrhythmics, ibutilide can lead to abnormal heart rhythms due to its ability to prolong the QT interval, which can lead to the potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Consequently, the drug is contraindicated in patients that are likely to develop abnormal heart rhythms; this includes individuals who have previously experienced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, have a prolonged QT interval, sick sinus syndrome, or have recently had a myocardial infarction, among other conditions. == Patient Information == This medication will be given intravenously for your heart disease. You will have continuously ECG monitoring during the infusion and 4 hours after your infusion. Some of the minor side effects are headache and irregular heartbeat. If you experience chest pain and respiratory difficulties, you should report to your doctors immediately. == See also == Sematilide Risotilide == References ==",Corvert,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003840185818262398), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001957882894203067)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;\nhttps://www.pfizermedicalinformation.com/corvert/indications-usage,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibutilide ', [])"

Sensor 1 is based on ion-association Ns-TPB, sensor 2 used Ns-PT, sensor 3 comprises a mixture of (Ns-PT+Ns-TPB) and sensor 4 was constructed using (Ns-PT+β-CD). Solvent mediator 2-NPPE exhibited a proper behavior including Nernstian slope ranging from 61.5±0.5 to 64.5±0.5 mV per decade over the pH range of 3.8-10 for the four sensors. Linear responses of Ns within the concentration range 1.0×10(-7)-1.0×10(-2) mol/L were obtained. The response time is very short (≤10s) with a detection limit 6.3×10(-8) M. In flow injection analysis (FIA), sensor 3 shows a Nernstian slope value 75.5±0.5 mV per decade within the concentration range of 1×10(-6)-1×10(-2) mol/L and with a detection limit 7.5×10(-7) mol/L.

81,"('Vitamin bx', 'Vitamin h1', 'P-aminobenzoic acid', 'Para-aminobenzoic acid', 'P-carboxyaniline')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","4-Aminobenzoic acid (also known as para-aminobenzoic acid or PABA because the two functional groups are attached to the benzene ring across from one another in the para position) is an organic compound with the formula H2NC6H4CO2H. PABA is a white crystalline solid, although commercial samples can appear gray. It is slightly soluble in water. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with amino and carboxyl groups. The compound occurs extensively in the natural world. == Production and occurrence == In industry, PABA is prepared mainly by two routes: Reduction of 4-nitrobenzoic acid Hoffman degradation of the monoamide derived from terephthalic acid. Food sources of PABA include liver, brewer's yeast (and unfiltered beer), kidney, molasses, mushrooms, and whole grains. Other food sources of PABA include spinach, liver, and oat seeds. == Biology == === Biochemistry === PABA is an intermediate in the synthesis of folate by bacteria, plants, and fungi. Many bacteria, including those found in the human intestinal tract such as E. coli, generate PABA from chorismate by the combined action of the enzymes 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase. Plants produce PABA in their chloroplasts, and store it as a glucose ester (pABA-Glc) in their tissues. Humans lack the enzymes to convert PABA to folate and so require folate from dietary sources, such as green leafy vegetables. In humans, PABA is considered nonessential and, although it has been referred to historically as ""vitamin Bx"", is no longer recognized as a vitamin because the typical human gut microbiome generates PABA on its own. Sulfonamide drugs are structurally similar to PABA, and their antibacterial activity is due to their ability to interfere with the conversion of PABA to folate by the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. Thus, bacterial growth is limited through folate deficiency. === Medical use === The potassium salt is used as a drug against fibrotic skin disorders, such as Peyronie's disease, under the brand name Potaba. PABA is also occasionally used in pill form by sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome to treat its associated gastrointestinal symptoms, and in nutritional epidemiological studies to assess the completeness of 24-hour urine collection for the determination of urinary sodium, potassium, or nitrogen levels. PABA derivatives have also been proposed to function as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in diseases that cause deficient cholinergic systems, such as Alzheimer's Disease. === Nutritional supplement === Despite the lack of any recognized syndromes of PABA deficiency in humans, except for those who lack the colonic bacteria that generate PABA, many claims of benefit are made by commercial suppliers of PABA as a nutritional supplement. The benefit is claimed for fatigue, irritability, depression, weeping eczema (moist eczema), scleroderma (premature hardening of the skin), patchy pigment loss in the skin (vitiligo), and premature grey hair. == Commercial and industrial use == PABA finds use in the biomedical sector. Its derivatives are found as a structural component in 1.5% of a database of 12111 commercial drugs. Other uses include its conversion to specialty azo dyes and crosslinking agents. PABA is also used as a biodegradable pesticide, though its use is now limited due to evolution of new variants of bio-pesticides. Specifically, studies have shown that PABA photodegrades through an O2-mediated pathway in which PABA is oxidized by O2 via hydrogen abstraction and decarboxylation. In the past, PABA was widely used in sunscreens as a UV filter. It is a UVB absorber, meaning it can absorb wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm. while still allowing UVA wavelengths between 320-400 nm to pass through, producing a tan. The chemical structure of PABA, with the amino and carboxyl groups being para to each other, allows for easy electron delocalization, which reduces the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This makes it easier for the electrons in PABA to transition to a higher energy state upon absorbing light. Patented in 1943, PABA was one of the first active ingredients to be used in sunscreen. The first in vivo studies on mice showed that PABA reduced UV damage. In addition, it was shown to protect against skin tumors in rodents, as shown by a 1975 study ran by Dr. Diane Sekura Snyder and Dr. Marian May. However, animal and in vitro studies in the early 1980s suggested PABA might increase the risk of cellular UV damage. On the basis of these studies, as well as problems with allergies and clothing discoloration, PABA fell out of favor as a sunscreen. In 2008 it was banned as a sunscreen ingredient in the European Union and in 2019 the FDA proposed its limited use. However, water-insoluble PABA derivatives such as padimate O are currently used in some cosmetic products including mascara, concealer, and matte lipsticks. As of 2008, the advancement of new sunscreen is focused on developing a broad spectrum of active ingredients that provide consistent protection across all wavelengths, including UVA. Researchers are considering the PABA–TiO2 Hybrid Nanostructures that result from the method of aqueous in situ synthesis with PABA and TiO2. == Safety considerations == PABA is largely nontoxic; the median lethal dose of PABA in dogs (oral) is 2 g/kg. Allergic reactions, specifically Allergic Contact Dermatitis and Photocontact Dermatitis, to PABA can occur. It is formed in the metabolism of certain ester local anesthetics, and many allergic reactions to local anesthetics are the result of reactions to PABA. == References ==",Para-aminobenzoic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.3200092613697052), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.019867099821567535), (',', -3.128163257315464e-07), (' PERSONAL', -0.17981036007404327), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -5.872261317563243e-05), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.3586486876010895), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), (',', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.16681990027427673), (',', -0.001935396110638976), ('ĠINDU', -0.7255656719207764), ('ST', -7.486063259420916e-05), ('RI', -1.4305012882687151e-05), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.07893899083137512), ('ĠPERSON', -0.007056078873574734), ('AL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.4066597032069694e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.20172379910945892)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.5290961861610413), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.05501667037606239), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.5759406089782715), (' INDUSTR', -0.0019300628919154406), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL; https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/health-and-medicine/para-aminobenzoic-acid-pabas-therapeutic-uses,https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1004/para-aminobenzoic-acid-paba/,https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/vitamins/pages/paba.html ', [])"

83,"('Fimasartan', 'Br-a-657', 'Kanarb', 'Fimasartan [inn]', 'Fimasartan (inn)')",Medical,"Fimasartan is a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Through oral administration, fimasartan blocks angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 receptors), reducing pro-hypertensive actions of angiotensin II, such as systemic vasoconstriction and water retention by the kidneys. Concurrent administration of fimasartan with diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has shown to be safe in clinical trials. Fimasartan was approved for use in South Korea on September 9, 2010, and is available under the brand name Kanarb through Boryung Pharmaceuticals, who are presently seeking worldwide partnership. == Mechanism of action == Fimasartan acts on the kidney's rennin-angiotensin cascade, which begins when renin release from the kidney causes the breakdown of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) then catalyzes the reaction that forms angiotensin II, which acts on AT1 receptors on the blood vessels, heart, and kidneys. On blood vessels, the AT1 receptor is coupled to an intracellular pathway that causes smooth muscle contraction (vasoconstriction) of blood vessels. In blocking the AT1 receptor, fimasartan inhibits vasoconstriction, favouring vasodilation. At the kidney and adrenal gland, AT1 blockage and prevention of aldosterone formation increase excretion of water and salt by the kidneys, which decreases overall blood volume. At the heart, AT1 blockage decreases contractility and the stimulatory effects of the sympathetic nervous system. Collectively, fimasartain leads to a reduction in blood pressure and alleviation of hypertensive symptoms. ARBs like fimasartan have also shown to be protective against stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Fimasartan has been shown to reduce cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, remodelling, and unnecessary cell proliferation via blockage of AT1 activation conceivably through decreased Endothelin 1 production, a result of AT1 activation. Fimastartan can also block TGF-β1 production (also AT1 dependent), which contributes to fibrosis and ventricular damage post-infarct. After ARB administration, mice showed improved prognosis after a myocardial infarction, though further studies still need to be done to assess fimasartan's specific effects on decreasing cardiovascular damage. == Side effects == Side effects In clinical trials, fimasartan was well tolerated in all patients. However, higher dosing (360 mg/day) was accompanied by increased dizziness (most likely due to the momentary decrease in blood pressure) and headaches in a low number of patients. Other side effects such as diarrhea, syncope, and cold feet were also experienced in a low number of subjects, which all resolved without medical intervention. == Pharmacology == Fimasartan is rapidly absorbed and has minimal accumulation in the body 7 days after administration. Fimasartan possesses a half-life of 9 to 16 hours, appropriate for daily dosing. Fimasartan was found to be effective in fasted or fed states, with a variety of dosing regimens. In trials, the maximum effects of the drug occurred slightly after the maximum plasma concentration (T-max) was achieved, which occurs 30 minutes to 3 hours after dosing. Fimasartan was found mostly in unmetabolized form in the plasma and in bile excretions. Urinary elimination of the drug was low, at less than 3% 24 hours after administration, entailing that the fimasartan does not undergo renal excretion. == Society and culture == === Brand names === The drug is also available in Russia as Канарб (Kanarb).

The risk of triptan side effects is also in general low, according to a systematic review. Side effects include: sensations of warmth/heat, dizziness, drowsiness, tingling of the hands or feet, nausea, dry mouth and unsteadiness, chest pain/pressure, throat pain/pressure, unusually fast/slow/irregular pulse, and mental/mood changes. The tingling and heaviness and sensation of warmth/heat is characteristic of selective 5-HT1 agonists. == Mechanism of action == The causes of migraine are not clearly understood; however, the efficacy of naratriptans and other triptans is believed to be due to their activity as 5-HT (serotonin) agonists. The biological and pharmacokinetic profile of naratriptan differs significantly from sumatriptan. == Society and culture == In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved naratriptan on February 11, 1998.

Hence, it is under investigation for the treatment of glioblastoma, where it may act by inhibiting angiogenesis, and influencing tumor invasion and proliferation.

Due to its distinct pharmacological effects, it has been broadly applications in pharmaceuticals, health products, dietary supplements, and so on. Ginkgolide C (GC), a prominent extract of Ginkgo biloba, possesses potential in anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant efficacy. To determine whether GC mitigated the progressive degeneration of articular cartilage in a Monosodium Iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis (OA) rat model by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the specific underlying mechanisms. In vivo, an OA rat model was established by intra-articular injection of MIA. The protective effect of GC (10 mg/kg) on articular cartilage was evaluated. Application of ATDC5 cells to elucidate the mechanism of the protective effect of GC on articular cartilage. Specifically, the expression levels of molecules associated with cartilage ECM degrading enzymes, OS, ERS, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation were analyzed. In vivo, GC ameliorated MIA-induced OA rat joint pain, and exhibited remarkable anti-inflammatory and anti- ECM degradation effects via inhibition of the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, the release of inflammatory factors, and the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes in cartilage. Mechanically, GC inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by restraining ROS-mediated p-IRE1α and activating Nrf2/NQO1 signal path, thereby alleviating OA. The ROS scavenger NAC was as effective as GC in reducing ROS production and inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. GC have exerted chondroprotective effects by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been applied for thousands of years for the treatment of cardio-cerebral vascular diseases in China. It is written in Compendium of Materia Medica that Ginkgo has the property of ""dispersing poison"", which is now referred to as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. Ginkgolides are important active ingredients in Ginkgo biloba leaves and ginkgolide injection has been frequently applied in clinical practice for the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, few studies have explored the effect and mechanism of ginkgolide C (GC) with anti-inflammatory activity in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CI/RI). The present study aimed to demonstrate whether GC was capable of attenuating CI/RI. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effect of GC in CI/RI was explored around the CD40/NF-κB pathway. In vivo, middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was established in rats. The neuroprotective effect of GC was assessed by neurological scores, cerebral infarct rate, microvessel ultrastructure, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, brain edema, neutrophil infiltration, and levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and iNOS. In vitro, rat brain microvessel endothelial cells (rBMECs) were preincubated in GC before hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) culture. The cell viability, levels of CD40, ICAM-1, MMP-9, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and activation of NF-κB pathway were examined. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effect of GC was also investigated by silencing CD40 gene in rBMECs. GC attenuated CI/RI as demonstrated by decreasing neurological scores, reducing cerebral infarct rate, improving microvessel ultrastructural features, ameliorating BBB disruption, attenuating brain edema, inhibiting MPO activity, and downregulating levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and iNOS. Coherently, in rBMECs exposed to H/R GC enhanced cell viability and downregulated levels of ICAM-1, MMP-9, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Furthermore, GC suppressed CD40 overexpression and hindered translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus, phosphorylation of IκB-α, and activation of IKK-β in H/R rBMECs. However, GC failed to protect rBMECs from H/R-induced inflammatory impairments and suppress activation of NF-κB pathway when CD40 gene was silenced. GC attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammatory impairments by suppressing CD40/NF-κB pathway, which may provide an available therapeutic drug for CI/RI. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic dysregulation-related disorder that is generally characterized by lipid metabolism dysfunction and an excessive inflammatory response. Currently, there are no authorized pharmacological interventions specifically designed to manage NASH. It has been reported that Ginkgolide C exhibits anti-inflammatory effects and modulates lipid metabolism. However, the impact and function of Ginkgolide C in diet-induced NASH are unclear. In this study, mice were induced by a Western Diet (WD) with different doses of Ginkgolide C with or without Compound C (adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor). The effects of Ginkgolide C were evaluated by assessing liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, and AMPK expression. The results showed that Ginkgolide C significantly alleviated liver damage, steatosis, and fibrosis in the WD-induced mice. In addition, Ginkgolide C markedly improved insulin resistance and attenuated hepatic inflammation. Importantly, Ginkgolide C exerted protective effects by activating the AMPK signaling pathway, which was reversed by AMPK inhibition. Ginkgolide C alleviated NASH induced by WD in mice, potentially via activating the AMPK signaling pathway.",Ginkgolide c,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.00536122964695096), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.03804837539792061), (' FOOD', -0.0029021166265010834)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.004763682838529348), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), (',', -0.1602383255958557), ('ĠFOOD', -0.08127222955226898), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03805610164999962)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.20149189233779907)])","('FOOD; https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB015814 ', [])"

It does not cross the blood–brain barrier and consequently has few to no central effects. It is given by mouth, via intravenous injection, on the skin, and via inhalation. It is a synthetic quaternary ammonium compound. The cation, which is the active moiety, is called glycopyrronium (INN) or glycopyrrolate (USAN). The most common side effects include irritability, flushing, nasal congestion, reduced secretions in the airways, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and urinary retention. In September 2012, glycopyrronium was approved for medical use in the European Union. In June 2018, glycopyrronium was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat excessive underarm sweating, becoming the first drug developed specifically to reduce excessive sweating. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Glycopyrronium was first used in 1961 to treat peptic ulcers. Since 1975, intravenous glycopyrronium has been used before surgery to reduce salivary, tracheobronchial, and pharyngeal secretions. It is also used in conjunction with neostigmine, a neuromuscular blocking reversal agent, to prevent neostigmine's muscarinic effects such as bradycardia. It can be administered to raise the heart rate in reflex bradycardia as a result of a vasovagal reaction, which often will also increase the blood pressure. It is also used to reduce excessive saliva (sialorrhea), and to treat Ménière's disease. It has been used topically and orally to treat hyperhidrosis, in particular, gustatory hyperhidrosis and generalized hyperhidrosis. When inhaled, it is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Doses for inhalation are much lower than oral ones, so that swallowing a dose will not have an effect. == Side effects == Dry mouth, urinary retention, headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and blurry vision are possible side effects of the medication. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Glycopyrronium competitively blocks muscarinic receptors, thus inhibiting cholinergic transmission. === Pharmacokinetics === Glycopyrronium bromide affects the gastrointestinal tracts, liver and kidney but has a very limited effect on the brain and the central nervous system. In horse studies, after a single intravenous infusion, the observed tendencies of glycopyrronium followed a tri-exponential equation, by rapid disappearance from the blood followed by a prolonged terminal phase. Excretion was mainly in urine and in the form of an unchanged drug.

91,"('Cytisinicline', 'Cytisine', 'Sophorine', 'Baptitoxine', 'Cytiton')",Medical,"Cytisine, also known as baptitoxine, cytisinicline, or sophorine, is an alkaloid that occurs naturally in several plant genera, such as Laburnum and Cytisus of the family Fabaceae. It has been used medically to help with smoking cessation. It has been found effective in several randomized clinical trials, including in the United States and New Zealand, and is being investigated in additional trials in the United States and a non-inferiority trial in Australia in which it is being compared head-to-head with the smoking cessation aid varenicline (sold in the United States as Chantix). It has also been used entheogenically via mescalbeans by some Native American groups, historically in the Rio Grande Valley predating even peyote. == Sources == Cytisine is extracted from the seeds of Cytisus laburnum L. (Golden Rain acacia), and is found in several genera of the subfamily Faboideae of the family Fabaceae, including Laburnum, Anagyris, Thermopsis, Cytisus, Genista, Retama and Sophora. Cytisine is also present in Gymnocladus of the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. == Uses == === Smoking cessation === Cytisine has been available in post-Soviet states for more than 40 years as an aid to smoking cessation under the brand name Tabex from the Bulgarian pharmaceutical company Sopharma AD. In 1961, Bulgarian pharmacist Strashimir Ingilizov synthesized Tabex using the alkaloid Cytisine which was derived from the seeds of the yellow acacia (Cytisus laburnum), a European decorative shrub prevalent in Bulgaria and commonly referred to as ""golden rain"". It was first marketed in Bulgaria in 1964 and then became widely available in the Soviet Union. In Poland, it is sold under the brand name Desmoxan, and it is also available in Canada under the brand name Cravv. Its molecular structure has some similarity to that of nicotine, and it has similar pharmacological effects. Like the smoking cessation aid varenicline, cytisine is a partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Cytisine has a short half-life of 4.8 hours. As a result, the extract provides smokers with satisfaction similar to smoking a cigarette, alleviating the urge to smoke and reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, while also reducing the reward experience of any cigarettes smoked. In 2011, a randomized controlled trial with 740 patients found cytisine improved 12-month abstinence from nicotine from 2.4% with placebo to 8.4% with cytisine. A 2013 meta-analysis of eight studies demonstrated that cytisine has similar effectiveness to varenicline but with substantially lower side effects. A 2014 systematic review and economic evaluation concluded that cytisine was more likely to be cost-effective for smoking cessation than varenicline. === Recreational === Plants containing cytisine, including the scotch broom and mescalbean, have also been used recreationally. Positive effects are reported to include a nicotine-like intoxication. === Reagent for organic chemistry === (−)-Cytisine extracted from Laburnum anagyroides seeds was used as a starting material for the preparation of ""(+)- sparteine surrogate"", for the preparation of enantiomerically enriched lithium anions of opposite stereochemistry to those anions obtained from sparteine. == Toxicity == Cytisine has been found to interfere with breathing and cause death in test mice; LD50 i.v. in mice is about 2 mg/kg. Cytisine is also teratogenic. Māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) can contain amounts of cytisine that are lethal to most animals. The palila (Loxioides bailleui, a bird), Uresiphita polygonalis virescens and Cydia species (moths), and possibly sheep and goats are not affected by the toxin for various reasons, and consume māmane, or parts of it, as food. U. p. virescens caterpillars are possibly able to sequester the cytisine to give themselves protection from predation; they have aposematic coloration which would warn off potential predators. == References == == External links == ""Cytisinicline"".

This is due to its aggressive course, late diagnosis and its intrinsic drugs resistance. The complexity of the tumor, in terms of cell components and heterogeneity, has led to the approval of few therapies with limited efficacy. The study of the early stages of carcinogenesis provides the opportunity for the identification of actionable pathways that underpin therapeutic resistance. We analyzed 43 Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) (12 Low-grade and 31 High-grade) by Spatial Transcriptomics. Mouse and human pancreatic cancer organoids and T cells interaction platforms were established to test the role of mucins expression on T cells activity. Syngeneic mouse model of PDAC was used to explore the impact of mucins downregulation on standard therapy efficacy. Spatial transcriptomics showed that mucin O-glycosylation pathway is increased in the progression from low-grade to high-grade IPMN. We identified GCNT3, a master regulator of mucins expression, as an actionable target of this pathway by talniflumate. We showed that talniflumate impaired mucins expression increasing T cell activation and recognition using both mouse and human organoid interaction platforms. In vivo experiments showed that talniflumate was able to increase the efficacy of the chemotherapy by boosting immune infiltration. Finally, we demonstrated that combination of talniflumate, an anti-inflammatory drug, with chemotherapy effectively improves anti-tumor effect in PDAC.

Tocofersolan is also used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as an antioxidant. == References ==",Tocophersolan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.0001766040368238464), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -2.339278580620885e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.029755808413028717), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.004266090225428343), ('ICAL', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.00012063252506777644), ('ĠPERSON', -0.1361556202173233), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.0609570381348021e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2519640624523163)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.25192928314208984), (' PERSONAL', -0.2535926401615143), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocofersolan,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-149234/tocophersolan-vitamin-e-tpgs-oral/details,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27429423/ ', [])"
96,"('Carmofur', 'Mifurol', 'Yamaful', 'Carmofurum', 'Carmofur [inn:jan]')",Medical,"Carmofur (INN) or HCFU (1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil) is a pyrimidine analogue used as an antineoplastic agent. It is a derivative of fluorouracil, being a lipophilic-masked analog of 5-FU that can be administered orally. == Biology == Carmofur prodrug is ingested and taken up in the intestine, overcoming the problem of 5-FU degradation by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Once inside a cell, the carmofur prodrug is converted into 5-FU. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action of carmofur prodrug is traditionally thought to be the generation of 5–FU. However, carmofur is a highly potent acid ceramidase (AC) inhibitor. Ceramide influences cancer cell survival, growth and death. Inhibition of AC activity sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of antineoplastic agents and radiation. Carmofur, much more effective than temozolomide, has been reported as the small-molecule drug capable of killing adult and pediatric glioblastomas. == Medicinal uses == Product marketing for carmofur started in 1981. Carmofur has also been used as adjuvant chemotherapy for curatively resected colorectal cancer patients in China, Japan, and Finland for many years. Trials and meta-analyses have confirmed that the drug is effective on patients with this cancer type, extending their survival. Carmofur has been shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and is therefore a promising lead compound to develop new antiviral treatment for COVID-19. == Adverse effects == As fluorouracil, carmofur has been known to induce leukoencephalopathy, characterized by progressive damage to white matter in the brain with stroke-like symptoms. A clinical trial for small hepatocellular carcinoma was stopped prematurely because 56% of the treated patients had unacceptable side effects. Moreover, the treatment had no survival advantage for stage 1 and 2 cancer patients. This may be a reason why carmofur was never pursued for FDA-approval in the US. == Chemical synthesis == Ozaki et al. have reported a synthesis by treating 5-FU with phosgene and hexylamine. Xiong et al. reported an alternative approach for the synthesis of carmofur .

97,"('Doxorubicin (hydrochloride)', 'Hydroxydaunorubicin (hydrochloride)', 'Doxorubicin', 'Adriamycin', 'Doxil')",Medical,"Doxorubicin, sold under the brand name Adriamycin among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer. This includes breast cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is often used together with other chemotherapy agents. Doxorubicin is given by injection into a vein. Common side effects include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and inflammation of the mouth. Other serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage at the site of injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA. Doxorubicin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Versions that are pegylated and in liposomes are also available; however, they are more expensive. Doxorubicin was originally made from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius. == Medical uses == In the EU doxorubicin pegylated liposomal (as Caelyx) is indicated to treat breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. It is indicated to treat multiple myeloma in combination with bortezomib. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (as Myocet liposomal) is indicated to treat breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide. Doxorubicin is commonly used to treat some leukemias and lymphomas, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma as well as aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor), multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide). Its activity is inhibited by certain antioxidant plant extracts, for example Tragia volubilis aqueous extract. Doxil (see below) is used primarily for the treatment of ovarian cancer where the disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy, or for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. == Side effects == === Cardiotoxicity === The most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550 mg/m2, 18% when the dose is 551–600 mg/m2 and 36% when the dose exceeds 600 mg/m2. There are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy, including oxidative stress due to iron accumulation, downregulation of genes for contractile proteins, and p53-mediated apoptosis. Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy typically results in dilated cardiomyopathy, with all four cardiac chambers being enlarged. This results in both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Eventually, heart failure can result, which carries a 50% mortality rate. There is no effective treatment against established cardiomyopathy caused by the drug as of 2010. The drug dexrazoxane, which is an iron chelator may be used to decrease the risk of doxorubicin's cardiotoxicity in certain cases. === Other === Another common and potentially fatal complication of doxorubicin is typhlitis, an acute life-threatening inflammation of the bowel. Additionally, some people may develop palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), characterized by skin eruptions on the palms of the hand or soles of the feet, swelling, pain, and erythema. Due to these side effects and its red color, doxorubicin has earned the nickname ""red devil"" or ""red death."" Chemotherapy can cause reactivation of hepatitis B, and doxorubicin-containing regimens are no exception. Doxorubicin and several chemotherapeutic drugs (including cyclophosphamide) can cause a loss of skin pigmentation. === Liposomal formulations === There is a pegylated (polyethylene glycol coated) liposome-encapsulated form of doxorubicin, developed to treat Kaposi's sarcoma. The polyethylene glycol coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin. However, this also results in a side effect called palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome. Following administration of this form of doxorubicin, small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The result of this leakage is redness, tenderness, and peeling of the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful. In clinical testing at 50 mg/m2 dosing every four weeks, half of people developed hand-foot syndrome. The rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby limiting potential substitution. Substitution would be desirable because liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than unencapsulated doxorubicin. This liposome-encapsulated form is also approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma. A non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, called Myocet, is approved in the European Union and in Canada for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but it has not been approved by the FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of PPE. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA boxed warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval. == Biosynthesis == Doxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-hydroxylated version of daunorubicin, the immediate precursor of DXR in its biosynthetic pathway. Daunorubicin is more abundantly found as a natural product because it is produced by a number of different wild type strains of Streptomyces. In contrast, only one known non-wild type species, Streptomyces peucetius subspecies cesius ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin. This strain was created by Arcamone et al. in 1969 by mutating a strain producing daunorubicin, but not DXR, at least in detectable quantities. Subsequently, Hutchinson's group showed that under special environmental conditions, or by the introduction of genetic modifications, other strains of Streptomyces can produce doxorubicin. His group also cloned many of the genes required for DXR production, although not all of them have been fully characterized. In 1996, Strohl's group discovered, isolated and characterized dox A, the gene encoding the enzyme that converts daunorubicin into DXR. By 1999, they produced recombinant dox A, a cytochrome P450 oxidase, and found that it catalyzes multiple steps in DXR biosynthesis, including steps leading to daunorubicin. This was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicin-producing strains have the necessary genes to produce DXR, the much more therapeutically important of the two. Hutchinson's group went on to develop methods to improve the yield of DXR, from the fermentation process used in its commercial production, not only by introducing dox A encoding plasmids, but also by introducing mutations to deactivate enzymes that shunt DXR precursors to less useful products, for example baumycin-like glycosides. Some triple mutants, that also over-expressed dox A, were able to double the yield of DXR. This is of more than academic interest, because at that time DXR cost about $1.37 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225 kg per annum. More efficient production techniques have brought the price down to $1.1 million per kg for the nonliposomal formulation. Although DXR can be produced semi-synthetically from daunorubicin, the process involves electrophilic bromination and multiple steps, and the yield is poor. Since daunorubicin is produced by fermentation, it would be ideal if the bacteria could complete DXR synthesis more effectively. == Mechanism of action == Doxorubicin interacts with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits the progression of topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being released and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity. The planar aromatic chromophore portion of the molecule intercalates between two base pairs of the DNA, while the six-membered daunosamine sugar sits in the minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the intercalation site, as evidenced by several crystal structures. By intercalation, doxorubicin can also induce histone eviction from transcriptionally active chromatin. As a result, the DNA damage response, epigenome and transcriptome are deregulated in doxorubicin-exposed cells. == History == In the 1950s, an Italian research company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to find anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle. A new strain of Streptomyces peucetius, which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug was successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could lead to fatal cardiac toxicity. Researchers at Farmitalia soon discovered that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes in the structure of the compound. A strain of Streptomyces was mutated using N-nitroso-N-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention. Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin together can be thought of as prototype compounds for the anthracyclines. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin. By 1991, 553 of them had been evaluated in the screening program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2016 GPX-150 was granted orphan drug designation by US FDA. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 24 March 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Zolsketil pegylated liposomal, intended for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, advanced ovarian cancer, progressive multiple myeloma and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare S.L.U. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal is a hybrid medicine of Adriamycin. It contains the same active substance as Adriamycin, but is available in a pegylated liposomal formulation. Zolsketil pegylated liposomal was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2022. On 21 July 2022, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Celdoxome pegylated liposomal, intended for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, advanced ovarian cancer, progressive multiple myeloma and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. The applicant for this medicinal product is YES Pharmaceutical Development Services GmbH. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal is a hybrid medicine of Adriamycin which has been authorized in the EU since 24 October 1979. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal contains the same active substance as Adriamycin, but is available in a pegylated liposomal formulation. Celdoxome pegylated liposomal was approved for medical use in the European Union in September 2022. === Names === It is also known as hydroxydaunorubicin and hydroxydaunomycin. It is sold under a number of different brand names, including Adriamycin PFS, Adriamycin RDF, or Rubex. === Formulations === Doxorubicin is photosensitive, and containers are often covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it. Doxorubicin is also available in liposome-encapsulated forms as Doxil (pegylated form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, which are also given by intravenous injection. The FDA approved the first generic version of Doxil, made by Sun, in February 2013. == Research == Combination therapy experiments with sirolimus (rapamycin) and doxorubicin have shown promise in treating Akt-positive lymphomas in mice. Further, the release of photo-activated adriamycin with the aid of nanoporous optical antenna resulted in significant anti-cancer effect in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In 2006, animal research coupling a murine monoclonal antibody with doxorubicin created an immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice. === Antimalarial activity === There is some evidence for antimalarial activity for doxorubicin and similar compounds. In 2009, a compound similar in structure to doxorubicin was found to inhibit plasmepsin II, an enzyme unique to the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) later identified doxorubicin in a set of compounds that inhibit parasite growth. === Fluorescence === Doxorubicin is also known to be fluorescent. This has often been used to characterize doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened the possibility of using the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It is also known to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence. == References == == External links == Media related to Doxorubicin at Wikimedia Commons ""Doxorubicin"". Drug Information Portal.

98,"('Epirubicin (hydrochloride)', 'Epirubicin', 'Epiadriamycin', 'Epidoxorubicin', 'Ellence')",Medical,"Epirubicin is an anthracycline drug used for chemotherapy. It can be used in combination with other medications to treat breast cancer in patients who have had surgery to remove the tumor. It is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Ellence in the US and Pharmorubicin or Epirubicin Ebewe elsewhere. Similarly to other anthracyclines, epirubicin acts by intercalating DNA strands. Intercalation results in complex formation which inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. It also triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in mechanisms that lead to cell death. Binding to cell membranes and plasma proteins may be involved in the compound's cytotoxic effects. Epirubicin also generates free radicals that cause cell and DNA damage. Epirubicin is favoured over doxorubicin, the most popular anthracycline, in some chemotherapy regimens as it appears to cause fewer side-effects. Epirubicin has a different spatial orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 4' carbon of the sugar - it has the opposite chirality - which may account for its faster elimination and reduced toxicity. Epirubicin is primarily used against breast and ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and lymphomas. == Medical uses == === Adjuvant therapy === The aim of Epirubicin as adjuvanted therapy is to eradicate micro metastasis and prolong disease free survival. === Vs standard adjuvant therapy === The Standard adjuvant therapy is a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF). In comparison to this the Epirubicin therapy contains fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC). Three large randomized studies have directly compared the epirubicin-containing regimen fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) with CMF in the adjuvant setting. Trial one and two contained premenopausal node-positive women with breast cancer, Trial three pre- and postmenopausal women with node-positive or negative breast cancer. It was discovered that FEC is at least as effective as CMF in premenopausal women with node positive- or negative breast cancer and that FEC produced no additional benefit in terms of 5-year relapse-free or overall survival. === Dose response === Researchers discovered a benefit for epirubicin 100 mg (FEC 100) over epirubicin 50 mg (FEC 50). Patients with FEC100 treatment of the study were relapse-free and an overall survival rate at 5 years higher as in FEC 50 treatment. They also compared epirubicin 90 mg/m2 (EC 90) with epirubicin 120 mg/m2 (EC 120). After a mean follow up of 27 months elapse-free survival of patients who received EC 120 was significantly longer than that of patients who received EC 90. The combination of Epirubicin and tamoxifen lead to an increase survival in node-positive postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast tumours. === Advanced breast cancer === ==== First-line therapy ==== Epirubicin monotherapy was shown to be therapeutically equivalent to doxorubicin monotherapy in patients who had to receive previous chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. There are several Combination therapies: 1. FEC: fluorouracil + cyclophosphamide + epirubicin; 2. FAC: fluorouracil + cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin. The median survival rates markedly better than those achieved with epirubicin monotherapy. Additionally the FEC treatment seems to be less toxic. ==== Second-line therapy ==== Patients with advanced breast cancer who experience disease progression after first-line therapy may respond to subsequent chemotherapy regimens; however, response rates and durations are generally lower than those seen after initial treatment with these regimens (FEC and FAC). === Dose escalation === A reduced dose intensity leads to reduced response rates . Equimolar doses of epirubicin and doxorubicin have been shown to be therapeutically equivalent in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Additionally the administration of more dose intensive epirubicin-containing regimens to patients with metastatic breast cancer has been associated with improved response rates, but not increased overall survival. It is suggested that it is necessary to at least double the dose of chemotherapy to detect a clinically relevant effect. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The mechanism of action of epirubicin is similar to that of doxorubicin and other anthracycline drugs. The observed clinical differences between epirubicin and doxorubicin can be explained by the pharmacokinetic differences based on the different affinity to DNA and lipophilicity, as there is no indication that different mechanisms are involved in their activity. Epirubicin first forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs. (Pharmacia & Upjohn Company LLC, 1999) This inhibits replication and transcription and triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II. Epirubicin then stabilizes the topoisomerase II-DNA complex, resulting in irreversible DNA strand breakage, leading to cell death. Epirubicin is also capable of generating cytotoxic free radicals, which are very reactive against DNA, cell membranes and mitochondria. Epirubicin exhibits activity in all phases of the cell cycle, but maximal cell kill occurs during the S phase and G2 phase of the cell cycle. === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetic properties of epirubicin can be described by a 3-compartment model, with half-lives for the initial (alpha), intermediate (beta) and terminal (gamma) elimination phases of approximately 3 minutes, 1 hour and 30 hours, respectively. Only the latter differs substantially compared to doxorubicin, as the terminal elimination half-life of doxorubicin is estimated to be approximately 40-70% longer than that of epirubicin. The pharmacokinetics of epirubicin appear to be linear for doses in the range of 40 – 150 mg/m2. The volume of distribution of epirubicin is found to be high and variable (1 000- 1 500), but similar to those reported for doxorubicin. This indicates extensive distribution into the tissue. The total plasma clearance of epirubicin is approximately 45 to 50 L/h/m2, which is almost 2-fold higher than that of doxorubicin. Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve values (adjusted for dose) are 1.3 to 1.7 times higher for doxorubicin than epirubicin following single-dose intravenous administration. Epirubicin shows a 77% binding to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin, which is not affected by drug concentration. === Metabolism === Epirubicin is rapidly metabolized by the liver to relatively or totally inactive metabolites: epirubicinol, 2 glucuronides and 4 aglycones. As plasma levels of epirubicinol are lower than those of the unchanged drug and the metabolite has an in vitro cytotoxic activity 10% of that of epirubicin, it is unlikely to reach in vivo concentration sufficient for cytotoxicity. No significant toxicity has been reported for the other metabolites. Epirubicinol is the 13(S)-dihydro derivative formed via the reduction of the C-13 keto-group. Both the unchanged drug and epirubicinol can be conjugated with glucuronic acid, creating the 2 glucuronides. This glucuronidation pathway is unique to epirubicin metabolism in humans as epirubicin is the only anthracycline that serves as a substrate for beta-glucuronidation. This unique pathway might explain the better tolerability of this drug compared with doxorubicin. The 4 aglycones are formed by losing the amino sugar moiety through a hydrolytic process or redox process, creating the doxorubicin and doxorubicinol aglycones and 7-deoxy-doxorubicin and 7-deoxy-doxorubicinol aglycones, respectively. === Excretion === Epirubicin and its metabolites are primarily eliminated through biliary excretion. About 11 to 15% of the administered dose is eliminated as an unchanged drug, which makes up 6 to 7% of the excreted compounds, and metabolites. == Side effects == The most common side effects of the Epirubicin are alopecia, nausea/vomiting, cardiotoxicity, leukopenia, and stomatitis. Cardiotoxicity is a severe side effect and the exact pathway is still unknown. However, there is good evidence to suggest that cardiotoxicity is caused at least in part by the avid interaction of anthracyclines with iron, resulting in the formation of metal ion complexes. It was first observed in adult cancer patients as clinical congestive heart failure (CHF), characterized by pulmonary oedema, fluid overload, and effort intolerance, was initially reported in 1979 by Von Hoff et al. at 2.2% overall with a cumulative doxorubicin dose-dependent incidence of CHF of 3%, 7%, and 18% at 400, 550, and 700 mg/m2, respectively. There are a lot of adverse effects of epirubicin related with the dose-limiting. The major commun negative effects are fever, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. More than 50% of patients without a right prophylactic antiemetics therapy experience nausea and vomiting the first 24 h after administration. That fact occurs if the epirubicin dose is between 50 and 75 mg/m2 single doses. Reversible alopecia and local cutaneous reactions are important adverse effects too. Those could be related with radiation recall and local reactions such as cellulitis, which cause development of tissue necrosis and pain if extravasation damage occurs. Another major adverse effects are cumulative dose-related cardiotoxicity and acute dose-limiting haematotoxicity. This last is related to mucositis, inflammation and ulceration in mouth or mucous membranes. Finally, the most adverse effect is secondary leukemia produced by breast cancer treated with epirubicin, particularly in those cases in which the patient receives concomitant alkylating agent therapy. === Toxicity === Epirubicin's toxicity is according to the NCI-CTEP Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. In some studies, patient toxicity reviews were obtained by a diary with the important information before and after each cycle of chemotherapy and their consequences. Common toxicities are neutropenia (<1 × 109 cells/L) without any death related and in lesser mesures anemia and thrombocytopenia. The most acute dose-limiting toxicity of epirubicin is bone marrow suppression, irreversible cardiotoxicity such as an important chronic cumulative dose-limiting toxicity illness and myelosuppression. The last one is associated with leukopenia, the decrease in the number of leukocytes (white blood cells) in the blood. == Chemistry == Epirubicin is a 4'-epi-isomer of doxorubicin and a derivative of daunorubicin. As an anthracycline antibiotic it belongs to several chemical classes such as: aminoglycosides, tetracene quinones, p-quinones, primary alpha-hydroxy ketone and tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketones. Due to numerous ionisable groups, it has multiple pka (pKa1 = 9.17 (phenol); pKa2 = 9.93 (amine); pKa3 = 12.67 (hydroxyl)) and is soluble in a variety of solvents (DMSO 125 mg/mL; Ethanol 120 mg/mL; In water, 93 mg/L at 25 °C (est)). It has a melting point of 344.53 and a boiling point of 810.3±65.0 °C at 760 mmHg. Its shelf life (def. as the time it takes to degrade 10% from the initial concentration) has been documented as at least 14 and 180 days at 25 °C and 4 °C, respectively in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution in polypropylene syringes. === Synthesis === There are multiple ways of synthesizing epirubicin depending on which starting material is used as a precursor. ==== Daunorubicin ==== One pathway starts from Daunorubicin, a common byproduct found in fermentation, since it is relatively easily available and already structurally similar to the product (only requiring minor alterations). Firstly, the amine group is protected using trifluoroacetic acid to stop it from further reactions. Next the hydroxyl group needs to be changed from an equatorial position to an axial, this is achieved by firstly oxidizing an intermediate sulfoxy salt to a keto group (losing the optical center) followed by a stereo-specific reduction using sodium borohydride to give the hydroxide group in the axial position. Secondly, the focus shifts to carbon number 13 where it is necessary to add a hydroxide group which is achieved by bromination followed by a reaction with an alkali salt of formic acid and water to give the final product. There is an older variant of this pathway which involves first splitting the Daunorubicin, into daunomycin one and daunosamine methyl ether, using methanol. Analogous reactions are performed to get the two hydroxyl groups onto their positions and the rings are then recombined and the protecting groups released. The drawbacks are more chemicals are used and daunomycin one and daunosamine need to be separated first. ==== 13-daunorubicinol ==== The second pathway startsfrom 13-daunorubicinol (hydroxyl group on carbon 13 instead of Daunorubicin's keto group). Firstly, the amine group is protected using trifluoroacetic acid then both the hydroxyl groups at positions 4 and 13 are oxidized simultaneously to keto groups again using DMSO, but a different alkylating agent. The reduction to alcohol is performed with a derivative of a borohydride of an alkali metal with formula MHBL3, where M=Li, Na, K; L=AlkO, AlkCOO, ArCOO. The subsequent halogenation is performed with a complex halogenating agent where an H or a chain of up to 4 carbons is combined with Cl, I or Br. The final hydrolysis is analogous to the one in the first pathway. == Development history == The first trial of epirubicin in humans was published in 1980. Upjohn applied for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in node-positive breast cancer in 1984, but was turned down because of lack of data. In 1999 Pharmacia (who had by then merged with Upjohn) received FDA approval for the use of epirubicin as a component of adjuvant therapy in node-positive patients. Patent protection for epirubicin expired in August 2007. == References ==",Ellence,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.3708974620385561e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00033802041434682906)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; www.drugs.com/ellence.html ', [])"
99,"('Relugolix', 'Orgovyx', 'Relugolix [usan:inn]', 'Relugolix (jan/inn)', 'Relugolix(tak-385)')",Medical,"Relugolix, sold under the brand names Orgovyx and Relumina among others, is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH receptor antagonist) medication which is used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men and uterine fibroids in women. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of relugolix include menstrual abnormalities, hot flashes, excessive sweating, headache, and decreased bone mineral density. Relugolix is a GnRH antagonist, or an antagonist of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. Unlike most other GnRH modulators, but similarly to elagolix (brand name Orilissa), relugolix is a non-peptide, small-molecule compound and is orally active. It suppresses sex hormone levels to the postmenopausal or castrate range in both women and men. Relugolix was approved for use for the treatment of uterine fibroids in Japan in January 2019, and for the treatment of prostate cancer in the United States in December 2020. == Medical uses == Relugolix is approved in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom for the treatment of prostate cancer in men and in Japan for the treatment of uterine fibroids (uterine leiomyoma) in women. === Available forms === Relugolix is available in the form of 40 and 120 mg oral tablets. == Side effects == The main side effects of relugolix for uterine fibroids include abnormal uterine bleeding (24.6–48.6% vs. 6.3% for placebo), hot flashes (42.8–45.5% vs. 0% for placebo), heavy menstrual bleeding (12.1–49.3% vs. 9.4% for placebo), headache (12.3–15.2%), and excessive sweating (9.4–15.2% vs. 0% for placebo). In addition, decreased bone mineral density occurs with relugolix (21.7% decrease by week 12, 24.4% decrease by week 24). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Relugolix is a selective antagonist of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.12 nM. A dosage of relugolix of 40 mg once per day has been found to suppress estradiol levels to postmenopausal levels (<20 pg/mL) within 24 hours in premenopausal women. In the control group of women, estradiol levels fluctuated between 50 and 250 pg/mL. Estradiol levels have been found to return to normal concentrations within 4 weeks of discontinuation of relugolix in premenopausal women. The medication additionally suppresses levels of progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone in premenopausal women. Relugolix at a dosage of 40 mg or more once per day has been found to reduce testosterone levels to sustained castrate levels (<20 ng/dL) in men. It additionally suppresses luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in men. Lower doses of relugolix (<40 mg/day) are under investigation for achieving partial sex hormone suppression in the treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids. This is intended to reduce the incidence and severity of menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and decreased bone mineral density that are secondary to estrogen deficiency. === Pharmacokinetics === A single 40-mg oral dose of relugolix has been found to result in peak levels of relugolix of 29 ng/mL (47 nmol/L) after 1.5 hours. Steady-state levels are reached within 7 days with 40 mg/day relugolix administration. There is an approximate 2-fold accumulation of relugolix by 2 weeks of continuous administration. Food diminishes the oral bioavailability of relugolix by about 50%. Relugolix is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, which may have a limiting effect on its absorption and distribution. The plasma protein binding of relugolix is approximately 68 to 71% over a concentration range of 0.05 to 5 μg/mL. Relugolix is not a substrate for CYP3A4. The elimination half-life of relugolix is 36 to 65 hours across a dosage range of 20 to 180 mg/day. There is moderate to high interindividual variability in systemic exposure to relugolix. Relugolix is excreted mainly in feces (83%) and to a small degree in urine (4%). Only about 6% of a dose of relugolix is excreted unchanged. == Chemistry == Relugolix is a non-peptide, small-molecule compound, and is structurally distinct from GnRH analogues. It is an N-phenyl urea derivative. == History == Relugolix was first described in 2004. It superseded sufugolix (developmental code name TAK-013), which was developed by the same researchers. Relugolix was approved for the treatment of uterine fibroids in Japan in January 2019. It was the second orally active GnRH antagonist to be introduced for medical use, following elagolix (brand name Orilissa) in July 2018. Relugolix was approved for the treatment of prostate cancer in the United States on 18 December 2020. The FDA approved relugolix based on evidence from a clinical trial (NCT03085095) of 930 participants 48 to 97 years old with advanced prostate cancer. The trial was conducted at 155 sites in the United States, Canada, and countries in South America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. All participants in the trial had advanced prostate cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one relugolix tablet daily (on the first day they received three tables) or an active control (leuprolide acetate) which was given as an injection under the skin every three months. The participants and healthcare providers were aware of which treatment was being given. The treatment lasted for 48 weeks. The efficacy of relugolix was assessed by the percentage of participants who achieved and maintained low testosterone level equal to castration. == Society and culture == === Names === Relugolix is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It is also known by its former developmental code names RVT-601 and TAK-385. Relugolix is sold under the brand name Orgovyx for the treatment of prostate cancer and under the brand name Relumina for the treatment of uterine fibroids. Relugolix compounded with ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone is sold under the brand name Myfembree for the treatment of uterine fibroids. === Availability === Relugolix is available in the United States and in Japan. === Legal status === In February 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Orgovyx, intended for the treatment of prostate cancer. The applicant for this medicinal product is Myovant Sciences Ireland Limited. Relugolix was approved for medical use in the European Union in April 2022, and in the United Kingdom in July 2022 (although not available in NHS England until August 2024). == Research == Relugolix is under development for use in the treatment of endometriosis. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT03085095 for ""A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Relugolix in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer (HERO)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Orgovyx,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5629668016335927e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00021228920377325267)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/orgovyx.html,https://www.drugs.com/history/orgovyx.html,https://www.drugs.com/pro/orgovyx.html ', [])"
