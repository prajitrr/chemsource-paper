It is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of preterm labour. Retosiban has high affinity for the oxytocin receptor (Ki = 0.65 nM) and has greater than 1400-fold selectivity over the related vasopressin receptors == Mechanism of action == Retosiban is a competitive oxytocin receptor antagonist which blocks the oxytocin-mediated contraction of the uterine smooth muscle in the female uterus that occurs during the initiation of preterm labour. This has been used to prevent preterm labour and premature birth. == Pharmacology == Retosiban has been shown to be an effective tocolytic. By intravenous and oral administration it produces a dose-dependent decrease in oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in non-pregnant female rats. In late-term pregnant rats it significantly reduces spontaneous uterine contractions in a dose-dependent manner by intravenous administration. In humans retosiban prolongs pregnancy and reduces preterm birth. Intravenous administration of retosiban in women with spontaneous preterm labour was associated with a greater than 1-week increase in time to delivery compared with placebo, a significant reduction in preterm deliveries, a non-significant increase in uterine quiescence, and a favourable safety profile. The results demonstrate proof-of-concept in the treatment of threatened spontaneous preterm labour == Pharmacokinetics == The oral bioavailability of retosiban is in the order of 100% in the rat with a half life of 1.4 hours. It has low to moderate intrinsic clearance in microsomes from three pre-clinical species (rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey) and low intrinsic clearance in human microsomes. It has a good cytochrome P450 (Cyp450) profile with no significant inhibition, with IC50 > 100μM, low protein binding (<80%) and low predicted CNS penetration. == Physical and chemical properties == At physiological pH, retosiban exists in an uncharged state. It has good solubility (> 0.22 mg/ml), with a logd of 2.2. Retosiban consists of a central 2,5 diketopiperazine ring with an R-indanyl group at the 3 position and an R (S-secButyl) at the 6 position, both cis to each other, and with a R-2-methyl oxazole ring at the 7 position in the acyclic amide attached to the N1-position. Retosiban is the (3R, 6R, 7R)-isomer and is a sub-nanomolar (Ki = 0.65 nM) oxytocin receptor antagonist, while the (3R, 6R, 7S)-isomer where the stereochemistry in the amide side-chain at C-7 is inverted, is 10-fold less potent. Typically in this series of 2,5 diketopiperazine oxytocin antagonists the (3S, 6S, 7S) isomer is >500 less active than the (3R, 6R, 7R)-isomer. In addition to the 2,5 diketopiperazine essential core, retosiban also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An indanyl group at position 3 is the best choice in terms of oxytocin receptor antagonist potency, its replacement by phenethyl and benzyl groups led to a progressive weakening of activity. At C-3, a 4-carbon branched alkyl was shown to be preferred with R (S-secButyl) being the best; smaller alkyl groups result in reduced antagonist activity. The 2-methyl oxazole ring at the 7 position gives good aqueous solubility, low protein binding and minimal Cyp450 interaction. This structure–activity relationship (SAR) is supported by the crystal structure of the human oxytocin receptor in complex with retosiban, where the lipophilic indanyl substituent penetrates into a deep, mainly hydrophobic crevice at the bottom of the binding pocket, while the oxazol-morpholine amide moiety is closest to the extracellular surface. The oxazole ring is the most solvent-exposed substituent, and the morpholine ring has no direct interactions with the receptor. The 2,5-diketopiperazine core specifically interacts with the receptor through a polar interaction interface. == Synthesis == Retosiban is a cyclic dipeptide or 2,5-diketopiperazine and these are formed by cyclising the corresponding linear dipeptide. In the short lab-scale and highly stereoselective synthesis of Retosiban 8 the linear peptide 5 is formed by the four-component Ugi reaction of the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected R-indanylglycine 1, D-alloisoleucine methyl ester hydrochloride 2, 2-methyloxazole-4-carboxaldehyde 3 and 2-benzyloxyphenylisonitrile 4. Hydrogenation to remove the Cbz and benzyl protecting groups, enabled cyclization of the linear peptide 5 to occur to give the phenolic cyclic dipeptide 6. Hydrolysis of the phenolic amide, by reaction with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), followed addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid gave the acid 7 which was converted to the amide Retosiban 8 by activating the acid with the peptide coupling reagent PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) followed by the addition of morpholine. Although the linear peptide 5 and the cyclic dipeptide 6 are a mixture of diastereoisomers (7RS) at the exocyclic amide, the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of the activated phenolic amide caused epimerisation at the exocyclic position and yielded the acid 7 with the required (7R)-stereochemistry as the major product. == See also == Atosiban Barusiban Epelsiban L-368,899 L-371,257 == References ==",Retosiban,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.136476854910143e-05), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009654866298660636)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retosiban?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Retosiban', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retosiban?utm_source=openai')])"
2776,"('Cyclosporin a', 'Cyclosporine', 'Ciclosporin', 'Csa', 'Cyclosporine a')",Medical,"Ciclosporin, also spelled cyclosporine and cyclosporin, is a calcineurin inhibitor, used as an immunosuppressant medication. It is taken orally or intravenously for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, nephrotic syndrome, eczema, and in organ transplants to prevent rejection. It is also used as eye drops for keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes). Common side effects include high blood pressure, headache, kidney problems, increased hair growth, and vomiting. Other severe side effects include an increased risk of infection, liver problems, and an increased risk of lymphoma. Blood levels of the medication should be checked to decrease the risk of side effects. Use during pregnancy may result in preterm birth; however, ciclosporin does not appear to cause birth defects. Ciclosporin is believed to work by decreasing the function of lymphocytes. It does this by forming a complex with cyclophilin to block the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, which in turn decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines by T-lymphocytes. Ciclosporin was isolated in 1971 from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum and came into medical use in 1983. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 185th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Ciclosporin is indicated to treat and prevent graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplantation and to prevent rejection of kidney, heart, and liver transplants. It is also approved in the US for treating of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, persistent nummular keratitis following adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, and as eye drops for treating dry eyes caused by Sjögren's syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction. In addition to these indications, ciclosporin is also used in severe atopic dermatitis, It has been used in severe rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases. Ciclosporin has also been used in people with acute severe ulcerative colitis and hives that do not respond to treatment with steroids. == Side effects == Side effects of ciclosporin can include gum enlargement, increased hair growth, convulsions, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, increased cholesterol, trouble breathing, numbness and tingling (particularly of the lips), itchiness, high blood pressure, potassium retention (possibly leading to hyperkalemia), kidney and liver dysfunction, burning sensations at finger tips, and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections. Ciclosporin causes hypertension by inducing vasoconstriction in the kidneys and increasing sodium reabsorption. The increase in blood pressure can cause cardiovascular events; it is thus recommended that the lowest effective dose for people requiring long-term treatment be used. Ciclosporin use after a kidney transplantation is associated with increased levels of uric acid in the blood and, in some cases, gout. Ciclosporin is listed as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen (i.e. there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans), specifically leading to squamous cell skin cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Ciclosporin's main effect is to lower the activity of T-cells; it does so by inhibiting calcineurin in the calcineurin–phosphatase pathway and preventing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore from opening. Ciclosporin binds to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of lymphocytes, especially of T cells. This cyclosporin—cyclophilin complex inhibits calcineurin, which is normally responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin 2. In T-cells, activation of the T-cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium, which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin. Calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells), which moves to the T-cell nucleus and increases the transcription of genes for IL-2 and related cytokines. Ciclosporin, by preventing the dephosphorylation of NF-AT, leads to reduced effector T-cell function; it does not affect cytostatic activity. Ciclosporin also binds to the cyclophilin D protein that constitutes part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), thus preventing MPTP opening. The MPTP is found in the mitochondrial membrane of cardiac muscle cells. MPTP opening signifies a sudden change in the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability, allowing protons and other ions and solutes of a size up to ~1.5 kDa to go through the inner membrane. This change of permeability is considered a cellular catastrophe, leading to cell death. However, brief mitochondrial permeability transition pore openings play an essential physiological role in maintaining healthy mitochondrial homeostasis. Ciclosporin can induce a remission of proteinuria caused by such diseases as MCD and FSGS. Ciclosporin blocks the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of synaptopodin, a regulator of Rho GTPases in podocytes, thereby preserving the phosphorylation-dependent synaptopodin-14-3-3 beta interaction. Preservation of this interaction, in turn, protects synaptopodin from cathepsin L-mediated degradation. Altogether, the antiproteinuric effect of Ciclosporin results, at least in part, from the maintenance of synaptopodin protein abundance in podocytes, which, in turn, is sufficient to maintain the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and to safeguard against proteinuria. === Pharmacokinetics === Ciclosporin is a cyclic peptide of 11 amino acids; it contains a single D-amino acid, which is rarely encountered in nature. Unlike most peptides, ciclosporin is not synthesized by ribosomes. Ciclosporin is highly metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme in humans and animals after ingestion. The metabolites, which include cyclosporin B, C, D, E, H, and L, have less than 10% of ciclosporin's immunosuppressant activity and are associated with higher kidney toxicity. == Biosynthesis == Cyclosporin is synthesized by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. The enzyme contains an adenylation domain, a thiolation domain, a condensation domain, and an N-methyltransferase domain. The adenylation domain is responsible for substrate recognition and activation, whereas the thiolation domain covalently binds the adenylated amino acids to phosphopantetheine, and the condensation domain elongates the peptide chain. Cyclosporin synthetase substrates include L-valine, L-leucine, L-alanine, glycine, 2-aminobutyric acid, 4-methylthreonine, and D-alanine, which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process. With the adenylation domain, cyclosporin synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids, then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a thioester linkage. Some of the amino acid substrates become N-methylated by S-adenosyl methionine. The cyclization step releases cyclosporin from the enzyme. Amino acids such as D-Ala and butenyl-methyl-L-threonine (Bmt) indicate cyclosporin synthetase requires the action of other enzymes. The racemization of L-Ala to D-Ala by alanine racemase is pyridoxal phosphate-dependent. The formation of butenyl-methyl-L-threonine is performed by a Bmt polyketide synthase that uses acetate/malonate as its starting material. === Gene cluster === Tolypocladium inflatum, the species currently used for mass production of Cyclosporin, has the biosynthetic genes arranged into a 12-gene cluster. Of these 12 genes, SimA (Q09164) is the cyclosporin synthetase, SimB (CAA02484.1) is the alanine racemase, and SimG (similar to ATQ39432.1) is the polyketide synthase. These genes are associated with an active retrotransposon. Although these sequences are poorly-annotated on GenBank and other databases, 90% similar sequences can be found for the Cyclosporin-producing Beauveria felina (or Amphichorda ~). SimB has two paralogs in the same organism with different but overlapping functions thanks to their low specificity. == History == In 1970, new strains of fungi were isolated from soil samples taken from Norway and from Wisconsin in the US by employees of Sandoz (now Novartis) in Basel, Switzerland. Both strains produced a family of natural products called cyclosporins. Two related components that had antifungal activity were isolated from extracts from these fungi. The Norwegian strain, Tolypocladium inflatum Gams, was later used for the large scale fermentation of ciclosporin. The immunosuppressive effect of the natural product ciclosporin was discovered on 31 January 1972 in a screening test on immune suppression designed and implemented by Hartmann F. Stähelin at Sandoz. The chemical structure of cyclosporin was determined in 1976, also at Sandoz. The success of the drug candidate ciclosporin in preventing organ rejection was shown in kidney transplants by R.Y. Calne and colleagues at the University of Cambridge, and in liver transplants performed by Thomas Starzl at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. The first patient, on 9 March 1980, was a 28-year-old woman. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ciclosporin for clinical use in 1983. Thomas Starzl's 1992 memoir explains through the eyes of a transplant surgeon that ciclosporin was an epoch-making drug for solid organ allotransplantation. It greatly expanded the clinical applicability of such transplantation by substantially advancing the antirejection pharmacotherapy component. Put simply, the biggest limits of applying such transplantation more widely were not cost or surgical skill (as formidable as those are) but rather the problem of allograft rejection and the scarcity of donor organs. Ciclopsporin was a major advancement against the rejection part of the challenge. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In July 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Vevizye, intended for the treatment of dry eye disease. The applicant for this medicinal product is Novaliq GmbH. Vevizye was authorized for medical use in the European Union in September 2024. === Names === The natural product was named cyclosporin by the German-speaking scientists who first isolated it and cyclosporine when translated into English. Per International Nonproprietary Name (INN) guidelines for drugs, the y was replaced with i so that the INN for the medication is spelled ciclosporin. Ciclosporin is the INN and the British Approved Name (BAN), while cyclosporine is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and cyclosporin is a former BAN. === Available forms === Ciclosporin exhibits very poor solubility in water, and, as a consequence, suspension and emulsion forms of the medication have been developed for oral administration and for injection. Ciclosporin was originally brought to market by Sandoz (now Novartis), under the brand name Sandimmune, which is available as soft gelatin capsules, an oral solution, and a formulation for intravenous administration. These are all nonaqueous compositions. A newer microemulsion, orally-administered formulation, Neoral, is available as a solution and as soft gelatin capsules. Compositions of Neoral are designed to form microemulsions in contact with water. Generic ciclosporin preparations have been marketed under various brand names, including Cicloral (by Sandoz/Hexal), Gengraf (by Abbott) and Deximune (by Dexcel Pharma). Since 2002, a topical emulsion of ciclosporin for treating inflammation caused by keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) has been marketed under the brand name Restasis. Ikervis is a similar formulation with a concentration of 0.1%. Inhaled ciclosporin formulations are in clinical development, and include a solution in propylene glycol and liposome dispersions. == Research == === Neuroprotection === Ciclosporin is in a phase II/III (adaptive) clinical study in Europe to determine its ability to ameliorate neuronal cellular damage and reperfusion injury (phase III) in traumatic brain injury. This multi-center study is being organized by NeuroVive Pharma and the European Brain Injury Consortium using NeuroVive's formulation of ciclosporin called Neurostat (also known by its cardioprotection brand name of Ciclomulsion). This formulation uses a lipid emulsion base instead of cremophor and ethanol. NeuroSTAT was compared to Sandimmune in a phase I study and found to be bioequivalent. In this study, NeuroSTAT did not exhibit the anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions found in cremophor- and ethanol-based products. Ciclosporin has been investigated as a possible neuroprotective agent in conditions such as traumatic brain injury, and has been shown in animal experiments to reduce brain damage associated with injury. Ciclosporin blocks the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which has been found to cause much of the damage associated with head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Ciclosporin's neuroprotective properties were first discovered in the early 1990s when two researchers (Eskil Elmér and Hiroyuki Uchino) were conducting experiments in cell transplantation. An unintended finding was that cyclosporin A was strongly neuroprotective when it crossed the blood–brain barrier. This same process of mitochondrial destruction through the opening of the MPT pore is implicated in making traumatic brain injuries much worse. === Cardiac disease === Ciclosporin has been used experimentally to treat cardiac hypertrophy (an increase in cell volume). Inappropriate opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) manifests in ischemia (blood flow restriction to tissue) and reperfusion injury (damage occurring after ischemia when blood flow returns to tissue), after myocardial infarction (heart attack) and when mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase occur. The heart attempts to compensate for disease state by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ to increase the contractility cycling rates. Constitutively high levels of mitochondrial Ca2+ cause inappropriate MPTP opening leading to a decrease in the cardiac range of function, leading to cardiac hypertrophy as an attempt to compensate for the problem. Cyclosporin A has been shown to decrease cardiac hypertrophy by affecting cardiac myocytes in many ways. Cyclosporin A binds to cyclophilin D to block the opening of MPTP, and thus decreases the release of protein cytochrome C, which can cause programmed cell death. CypD is a protein within the MPTP that acts as a gate; binding by cyclosporin A decreases the amount of inappropriate opening of MPTP, which decreases the intramitochondrial Ca2+. Decreasing intramitochondrial Ca2+ allows for reversal of cardiac hypertrophy caused in the original cardiac response. Decreasing the release of cytochrome C caused decreased cell death during injury and disease. Cyclosporin A also inhibits the phosphatase calcineurin pathway (14). Inhibition of this pathway has been shown to decrease myocardial hypertrophy. == Veterinary use == The medication is approved in the United States for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. Unlike the human form of the medication, the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an immunomodulator and has fewer side effects than in humans. The benefits of using this product include the reduced need for concurrent therapies to bring the condition under control. It is available as an ophthalmic ointment for dogs called Optimmune, manufactured by Intervet, which is part of Merck. It is also used to treat sebaceous adenitis (immune response against the sebaceous glands), pemphigus foliaceus (autoimmune blistering skin disease), Inflammatory bowel disease, anal furunculosis (anal inflammatory disease), and myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disease). == References == == External links == Cyclosporine at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Ciclosporin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2159273865108844e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005575056420639157)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Ciclosporin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciclosporin?utm_source=openai')])"

Moreover sandal leaves contain γ-glutamyl derivative of the lachrymatory precursor of onion, γ-glutamyl-S-propenyl cysteine superoxide. This review summarizes the studies on the amino acids in sandal. Understanding the bioprocess limitations is critical for the efficient design of biocatalysts to facilitate process feasibility and improve process economics. In this study, a proline hydroxylation process with recombinant Escherichia coli expressing L-proline cis-4-hydroxylase (SmP4H) was investigated. The factors that influencing the metabolism of microbial hosts and process economics were focused on for the optimization of cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline (CHOP) production. In recombinant E. coli, SmP4H synthesis limitation was observed. After the optimization of expression system, CHOP production was improved in accordance with the enhanced SmP4H synthesis. Furthermore, the effects of the regulation of proline uptake and metabolism on whole-cell catalytic activity were investigated. The improved CHOP production by repressing putA gene responsible for L-proline degradation or overexpressing L-proline transporter putP on CHOP production suggested the important role of substrate uptake and metabolism on the whole-cell biocatalyst efficiency. Through genetically modifying these factors, the biocatalyst activity was significantly improved, and CHOP production was increased by twofold. Meanwhile, to further improve process economics, a two-strain coupling whole-cell system was established to supply co-substrate (α-ketoglutarate, α-KG) with a cheaper chemical L-glutamate as a starting material, and 13.5 g/L of CHOP was successfully produced. In this study, SmP4H expression, and L-proline uptake and degradation, were uncovered as the hurdles for microbial production of CHOP. Accordingly, the whole-cell biocatalysts were metabolically engineered for enhancing CHOP production. Meanwhile, a two-strain biotransformation system for CHOP biosynthesis was developed aiming at supplying α-KG more economically. Our work provided valuable insights into the design of recombinant microorganism to improve the biotransformation efficiency that catalyzed by Fe(II)/α-KG-dependent dioxygenase. Exposure of rats to high oxygen tensions causes increased collagen content of lungs and alveolar enlargement in 3-6 wk. We tested whether cis-hydroxyproline, a proline analogue that inhibits collagen synthesis, could prevent the collagen accumulation and alveolar enlargement. Rats were exposed to hyperoxia for 60 h and then to room air and hyperoxia for alternate 24-h periods for 11.5 d. Treated oxygen-exposed rats received 200 mg/kg cis-hydroxyproline twice daily over the 14-d exposure period. Control rats breathed room air. Examination of lungs on day 14 showed collagen content of oxygen-exposed lungs to be 48% greater than control (P < 0.05). The collagen content of the treated oxygen-exposed lungs was -12% of control (NS). Total lung volume was 16% greater than control in oxygen-exposed rats (P < 0.05) and 8% greater than control in treated oxygen-exposed rats (NS). Morphometric studies showed alveolar size was greater than control in oxygen-exposed rats (188+/-11 [SE] vs. 143+/-6 mumul [P < 0.05]). Oxygen-exposed, treated rats had a mean alveolar volume of 150+/-7 mumul. Lung pressure-volume curves were significantly shifted to the left of control in the oxygen-exposed rats, whereas the curves of the oxygen-exposed, treated group were identical to control. These data suggest that cis-hydroxyproline prevented the accumulation of collagen in the lungs in pulmonary oxygen toxicity. In addition, there was apparent protection from airspace dilatation and decreased lung elasticity, suggesting that alveolar enlargement after oxygen toxicity is linked to the deposition in lung tissue of new connective tissue fibers.",Cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.06721314042806625), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.014167862012982368), (' FOOD', -0.3874845802783966)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3068728744983673), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04899797588586807)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.2519422471523285), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([chemsrc.com](https://www.chemsrc.com/en/cas/618-27-9_760354.html?utm_source=openai), [foodb.ca](https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB030011?utm_source=openai), [hmdb.ca](https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0240251?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=230, start_index=6, title='cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline | CAS#:618-27-9 | Chemsrc', type='url_citation', url='https://www.chemsrc.com/en/cas/618-27-9_760354.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=230, start_index=6, title='Showing Compound cis 4-Hydroxyproline (FDB030011) - FooDB', type='url_citation', url='https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB030011?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=230, start_index=6, title='Human Metabolome Database: Showing metabocard for cis-4-Hydroxyproline (HMDB0240251)', type='url_citation', url='https://hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0240251?utm_source=openai')])"

2780,"('Hydroxyproline', 'Trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline', '(2s,4r)-4-hydroxypyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid', 'Trans-4-hydroxyproline', 'H-hyp-oh')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","(2S,4R)-4-Hydroxyproline, or L-hydroxyproline (C5H9O3N), is an amino acid, abbreviated as Hyp or O, e.g., in Protein Data Bank. == Structure and discovery == In 1902, Hermann Emil Fischer isolated hydroxyproline from hydrolyzed gelatin. In 1905, Hermann Leuchs synthesized a racemic mixture of 4-hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline differs from proline by the presence of a hydroxyl (OH) group attached to the gamma carbon atom. == Production and function == Hydroxyproline is produced by hydroxylation of the amino acid proline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase following protein synthesis (as a post-translational modification). The enzyme-catalyzed reaction takes place in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it is not directly incorporated into proteins, hydroxyproline comprises roughly 4% of all amino acids found in animal tissue, an amount greater than seven other amino acids that are translationally incorporated. === Animals === ==== Collagen ==== Hydroxyproline is a major component of the protein collagen, comprising roughly 13.5% of mammalian collagen. Hydroxyproline and proline play key roles for collagen stability. They permit the sharp twisting of the collagen helix. In the canonical collagen Xaa-Yaa-Gly triad (where Xaa and Yaa are any amino acid), a proline occupying the Yaa position is hydroxylated to give a Xaa-Hyp-Gly sequence. This modification of the proline residue increases the stability of the collagen triple helix. It was initially proposed that the stabilization was due to water molecules forming a hydrogen bonding network linking the prolyl hydroxyl groups and the main-chain carbonyl groups. It was subsequently shown that the increase in stability is primarily through stereoelectronic effects and that hydration of the hydroxyproline residues provides little or no additional stability. ==== Non-collagen ==== Hydroxyproline is found in few proteins other than collagen. For this reason, hydroxyproline content has been used as an indicator to determine collagen and/or gelatin amount. However, the mammalian proteins elastin and argonaute 2 have collagen-like domains in which hydroxyproline is formed. Some snail poisons, conotoxins, contain hydroxyproline, but lack collagen-like sequences. Hydroxylation of proline has been shown to be involved in targeting Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunit (HIF-1 alpha) for degradation by proteolysis. Under normoxia (normal oxygen conditions) EGLN1[1] protein hydroxylates the proline at the 564 position of HIF-1 alpha, which allows ubiquitylation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) and subsequent targeting for proteasome degradation. === Plants === Hydroxyproline rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) are also found in plant cell walls. These hydroxyprolines serve as the attachment points for glycan chains which are added as post-translational modifications. == Clinical significance == Proline hydroxylation requires ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The most obvious, first effects (gingival and hair problems) of absence of ascorbic acid in humans come from the resulting defect in hydroxylation of proline residues of collagen, with reduced stability of the collagen molecule, causing scurvy. Increased serum and urine levels of hydroxyproline have also been demonstrated in Paget's disease. Mass spectrometry analysis showed decreased amount of hydroxyproline post-translational modifications in non inflamed tissue from ulcerative colitis patients when compared to tissue from donors without the disease. == Other hydroxyprolines == Other hydroxyprolines also exist in nature. The most notable ones are 2,3-cis-, 3,4-trans-, and 3,4-dihydroxyproline, which occurs in diatom cell walls and are postulated to have a role in silica deposition. Hydroxyproline is also found in the walls of oomycetes, fungus-like protists related to diatoms.

2781,"('Methimazole',)",Medical,"Thiamazole, also known as methimazole, is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. This includes Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and thyrotoxic crisis. It is taken by mouth. Full effects may take a few weeks to occur. Common side effects include itchiness, hair loss, nausea, muscle pain, swelling, and abdominal pain. Severe side effects may include low blood cell counts, liver failure, and vasculitis. Use is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of congenital anomalies, but it may be used in the second trimester or third trimester. It may be used during breastfeeding. Those who developed significant side effects may also have problems with propylthiouracil. Thiamazole is a cyclic thiourea derivative that works by decreasing the production of thyroid hormones. Thiamazole was approved for medical use in the United States in 1950. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It is also available in Europe and Asia. In 2021, it was the 237th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Thiamazole is a drug used to treat hyperthyroidism such as in Graves' disease, a condition that occurs when the thyroid gland begins to produce an excess of thyroid hormone. The drug may also be taken before thyroid surgery to lower thyroid hormone levels and minimize the effects of thyroid manipulation. Additionally, thiamazole is used in the veterinary setting to treat hyperthyroidism in cats. == Adverse effects == It is important to monitor any symptoms of fever or sore throat while taking thiamazole; this could indicate the development of agranulocytosis, an uncommon but severe side effect resulting from a drop in the white blood cell count (to be specific, neutropenia, a deficiency of neutrophils). A complete blood count (CBC) with differential is performed to confirm the suspicion, in which case the drug is discontinued. Administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) may increase recovery. Other known side effects include: skin rash itching abnormal hair loss upset stomach vomiting loss of taste abnormal sensations (tingling, prickling, burning, tightness, and pulling) swelling joint and muscle pain drowsiness dizziness decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia) aplasia cutis congenita (prenatal exposure) thyroid gland enlargement (prenatal exposure) choanal atresia (prenatal exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy) acute pancreatitis == Interaction == Adverse effects may occur for individuals who: Take anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin), diabetes medications, digoxin (Lanoxin), theophylline (Theobid, Theo-Dur), and vitamins Have ever had any blood disease, such as decreased white blood cells (leukopenia), decreased platelets (thrombocytopenia) or aplastic anemia, or liver disease (hepatitis, jaundice) == Mechanism of action == Thiamazole inhibits the enzyme thyroperoxidase, which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I−) to iodine (I2), hypoiodous acid (HOI), and enzyme linked hypoiodate (EOI), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor thyroglobulin, a necessary step in the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). It does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transporter located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors such as perchlorate and thiocyanate. A study has shown that it modulates secretion of CXCL10. == Chemical properties == The cyclic thiourea derivative thiamazole is a white to matte brown crystalline powder with a characteristic odour. The boiling point is 280 °C (decomposition). Thiamazole is soluble in water, ethanol and chloroform, but hardly soluble in ether. Thiamazole acts as a free radical scavenger for radicals such as the hydroxyl radical (•OH) radical. It is used as free radical scavenger in organic chemistry. === Laboratory synthesis === Thiamazole has been known since 1889, when it was made by a two-stage process starting from 2,2-diethoxyethaneamine, which was reacted with methyl isothiocyanate. The product of this reaction was then cyclised in an acid-catalysed reaction to form thiamazole. === Manufacture === When the therapeutic potential of thiamazole was recognised in the late 1940s, a number of alternative routes were developed based, for example, on the use of 2-chloro-1,2-diethoxyethane as starting material, in a reaction with methylamine. The resulting intermediate can be treated with potassium thiocyanate in the presence of acid to give thiamazole. == History == Surgery was used to treat hyperthyroidism until the advent of drug therapies in the 1940s. In 1942, thiourea was used by Edwin B. Astwood to treat a patient with the condition. He later published evidence that thiouracil was more effective and began a search for analogues with higher potency and less toxicity. In 1949 he published his work on thiamazole which showed its superiority to previous therapies. The compound had been known since 1889, and was developed as a drug by Eli Lilly and Company under the trade name Tapazole. == Veterinary uses == Thiamazole is commonly used in cats to treat hyperthyroidism. Despite 20% of cats treated with thiamazole testing positive for antinuclear antibody lupus erythematosus and immune-mediated haemolytic anemia, neither condition is associated with thiamazole in cats. Hepatic toxicity also occurs in a small but notable amount of cats treated with thiamazole. In July 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Felanorm, the first generic methimazole oral solution for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in cats. Felanorm contains the same active ingredient (methimazole) as the approved brand name drug product, Felimazole Coated Tablets, which were first approved in May 2009. In addition, the FDA determined that Felanorm contains no inactive ingredients that may significantly affect the bioavailability of the active ingredient. Felanorm is sponsored by Norbrook Laboratories based in the United Kingdom. == References ==",Methimazole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.867782187531702e-06), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005241580307483673)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medlineplus.gov](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682464.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=98, start_index=9, title='Methimazole: MedlinePlus Drug Information', type='url_citation', url='https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682464.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is being developed by Takeda and Tobira Therapeutics. Cenicriviroc is an inhibitor of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors, allowing it to function as an entry inhibitor which prevents the virus from entering into a human cell. Inhibition of CCR2 may have an anti-inflammatory effect. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study to assess the antiviral activity, safety, and tolerability of cenicriviroc was conducted in 2010. HIV-infected patients taking cenicriviroc had significant reductions in viral load, with the effect persisting up to two weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Additional Phase II clinical trials are underway. Cenicriviroc is also in two separate clinical trials for COVID-19: the ACTIV-I trial run by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, where it is compared with a number of other immunomodulatory agents, and the Charité Trial of Cenicriviroc at the Charité Hospital in Berlin. As of 2 July 2021, both trials are recruiting participants, and are expected to complete in September 2021. Phase IIb data presented at the 20th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in March 2013 showed similar viral suppression rates of 76% for patients taking 100 mg cenicriviroc, 73% with 200 mg cenicriviroc, and 71% with efavirenz. Non-response rates were higher with cenicriviroc, however, largely due to greater drop-out of patients. A new tablet formulation with lower pill burden may improve adherence.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of Gln, Ala-Gln and Gly-Gln on mitochondrial respiration and protein turnover of enterocytes. Intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) were cultured for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-F12 Ham medium (DMEM-F12) containing 2.5 mM Gln, Ala-Gln or Gly-Gln. Results from 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and flow cytometry analysis indicated that there were no differences in proliferation between free Gln and Ala-Gln-treated cells, whereas Gly-Gln treatment inhibited the cell growth compared with Gln treatment. Significantly lower mRNA expressions of Sp1 and PepT1 were also observed in Gly-Gln-treated cells than that of Ala-Gln treatment. Ala-Gln treatment increased the basal respiration and ATP production, compared with free Gln and Gly-Gln treatments. There were no differences in protein turnover between free Gln and Ala-Gln-treated cells, but Gly-Gln treatment reduced protein synthesis and increased protein degradation. Ala-Gln treatment stimulated mTOR activation whereas Gly-Gln decreased mTOR phosphorylation and increased the UB protein expression compared with free Gln treatment. These results indicate that Ala-Gln has the very similar functional profile to free Gln in porcine enterocytes in vitro and can be substituted Gln as energy and protein sources in the gastrointestinal tract. Glycyl-glutamine (Gly-Gln; beta-endorphin(30-31)) is an endogenous dipeptide synthesized from beta-endorphin(1-31). Previous investigations have shown that Gly-Gln inhibits the cardiovascular and respiratory depression caused by morphine and beta-endorphin(1-31), but it does not interfere with opioid analgesia. In this study, we tested whether Gly-Gln administration would influence morphine-induced conditioned place preference, tolerance, dependence, or withdrawal. For place preference experiments, rats were conditioned with morphine sulfate (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) or saline on alternate days for 6 days and tested on day 7. Glycyl-glutamine (1-100 nmol i.c.v.) pretreatment inhibited acquisition of a conditioned place preference to morphine significantly. Glycyl-glutamine (100 nmol i.c.v.) also blocked expression of a pre-established morphine place preference, but it did not interfere with acquisition of a conditioned place preference to palatable food, and it did not produce place preference or aversion when given alone to morphine-naive animals. To induce antinociceptive tolerance, rats were treated with morphine (10 mg/kg i.p.) twice daily for 7 days, and morphine antinociception was evaluated with the tail-flick test. Glycyl-glutamine (100 nmol i.c.v.) pretreatment delayed the onset of morphine tolerance significantly and partially reversed pre-established tolerance. Morphine dependence and withdrawal were assessed by measuring naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms. Glycyl-glutamine inhibited the development of morphine dependence when given to rats twice daily immediately before they received morphine (10 mg/kg i.p.) and suppressed withdrawal symptoms of rats with subcutaneously implanted morphine pellets when administered 5 min before withdrawal was induced with naloxone. Glycyl-glutamine thus attenuates morphine-induced conditioned place preference, tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal without compromising morphine analgesia. It is reported that the proliferative response of lymphocytes is lowered in patients with solid tumors. Glutamine is a major nutrient for rapidly proliferating cells. Unlike glutamine itself, the dipeptide glycyl-glutamine as a source for glutamine is stable in aqueous solutions ex vivo. In order to evaluate the possible therapeutic role of glutamine in lymphocyte proliferation, we investigated its influence on lymphocytes of children with solid tumors before and after chemotherapy. Lymphocytes were collected from 21 children and adolescents suffering from solid tumors (before and after chemotherapy) and from healthy controls. Glutamine and glycyl-glutamine, respectively, were added to cell cultures at concentrations between zero and 1.0 mmol/l. ConA or SAC served as T- or B-cell mitogens, respectively. The lymphocyte proliferation in the healthy control group was similar in degree to lymphocyte proliferation seen in the patients with solid tumors, regardless of the mitogen used. No difference in the degree of lymphocyte proliferation before or after chemotherapy was seen with either source of glutamine. Specific subgroups of malignancies showed trends that differed from the overall findings, but these differences were not found to be statistically significant. Routine supplementation with glutamine in children with solid tumors to enhance lymphocyte function is not supported by the data gained from in vitro proliferation tests.",Glycyl-glutamine,PUBMED,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.25220388174057007), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -4.060365608893335e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0011708177626132965), (' MED', -0.0017150469357147813), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.7018882632255554), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -7.903263758635148e-05), ('ĠEND', -0.0032985585276037455), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04860527068376541)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.011049585416913033), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; https://lktlabs.com/product/glycylglutamine/,https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB111878 ', [])"

It is found on N-linked glycans on the mammalian, insect and plant cell surface. Fucose is the fundamental sub-unit of the seaweed polysaccharide fucoidan. The α(1→3) linked core of fucoidan is a suspected carbohydrate antigen for IgE-mediated allergy. Two structural features distinguish fucose from other six-carbon sugars present in mammals: the lack of a hydroxyl group on the carbon at the 6-position (C-6) (thereby making it a deoxy sugar) and the L-configuration. It is equivalent to 6-deoxy-L-galactose. In the fucose-containing glycan structures, fucosylated glycans, fucose can exist as a terminal modification or serve as an attachment point for adding other sugars. In human N-linked glycans, fucose is most commonly linked α-1,6 to the reducing terminal β-N-acetylglucosamine. However, fucose at the non-reducing termini linked α-1,2 to galactose forms the H antigen, the substructure of the A and B blood group antigens. Fucose is released from fucose-containing polymers by an enzyme called α-fucosidase found in lysosomes. L-Fucose has several potential applications in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements Fucosylation of antibodies has been established to reduce binding to the Fc receptor of Natural Killer cells and thereby reduce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

It can be classified as either a methyl-pentose or a 6-deoxy-hexose. Rhamnose predominantly occurs in nature in its L-form as L-rhamnose (6-deoxy-L-mannose). This is unusual, since most of the naturally occurring sugars are in D-form. Exceptions are the methyl pentoses L-fucose and L-rhamnose and the pentose L-arabinose. However, examples of naturally-occurring D-rhamnose are found in some species of bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Helicobacter pylori. Rhamnose can be isolated from buckthorn (Rhamnus), poison sumac, and plants in the genus Uncaria. Rhamnose is also produced by microalgae belonging to class Bacillariophyceae (diatoms). Rhamnose is commonly bound to other sugars in nature. It is a common glycone component of glycosides from many plants. Rhamnose is also a component of the outer cell membrane of acid-fast bacteria in the Mycobacterium genus, which includes the organism that causes tuberculosis. Natural antibodies against L-rhamnose are present in human serum, and the majority of people seem to possess IgM, IgG or both of these types of immunoglobulins capable of binding this glycan. An interesting particularity of rhamnose is the presence of formaldehyde production when reacted with periodates in the vicinal diol cleavage reaction, that makes it very useful to remove excess periodate in glycerol or other vicinal diol analysis, that would otherwise give colored blank issues. == See also == Galactose binding lectin domain, despite the name, often binds rhamnose Alpha-L-rhamnosidase Disaccharides: Rutinose, rhamnose-glucose Neohesperidose, rhamnose-glucose Robinose, rhamnose-galactose Polysaccharides: Gellan gum -glucose-glucuronic acid-glucose-rhamnose- Welan gum Glycosides: Category:Rhamnosides Echinacoside Rhamnolipid Verbascoside == References == == Further reading == Watanabe, K; Takesue, S (1975).

2787,"('Venlafaxine (hydrochloride)', 'Wy 45030 hydrochloride', 'Venlafaxine', 'Elafax', 'D,l-venlafaxine')",Medical,"Venlafaxine, sold under the brand name Effexor among others, is an antidepressant medication of the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Studies have shown that venlafaxine improves post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a recommended first-line treatment. It may also be used for chronic neuropathic pain. It is taken orally (swallowed by mouth). It is also available as the salt venlafaxine besylate (venlafaxine benzenesulfonate monohydrate) in an extended-release formulation (Venbysi XR). Common side effects include loss of appetite, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, sweating, insomnia, drowsiness and sexual problems. Severe side effects include an increased risk of suicide, mania, and serotonin syndrome. Antidepressant withdrawal syndrome may occur if stopped. A meta-analysis of randomized trials in depression found an increased rate of serious adverse events, particularly sexual dysfunction and anorexia, and several non-serious adverse effects, including nervousness, asthenia, and tremor. There are concerns that use during the later part of pregnancy can harm the baby. Venlafaxine's mechanism of action is not entirely clear, but it seems to be related to the potentiation of the activity of some neurotransmitters in the brain. Venlafaxine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1993. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 44th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Venlafaxine is used primarily for the treatment of depression, general anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, and vasomotor symptoms. Venlafaxine has been used off label for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and migraine prevention. It may work on pain via effects on the opioid receptor. It has also been found to reduce the severity of 'hot flashes' in menopausal women and men on hormonal therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer. Due to its action on both the serotoninergic and adrenergic systems, venlafaxine is also used as a treatment to reduce episodes of cataplexy, a form of muscle weakness, in patients with the sleep disorder narcolepsy. Some open-label and three double-blind studies have suggested the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Clinical trials have found possible efficacy in those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Case reports, open trials and blinded comparisons with established medications have suggested the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder. === Depression === A comparative meta-analysis of 21 major antidepressants found that venlafaxine, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants, although the quality of many comparisons was assessed as low or very low. Venlafaxine was similar in efficacy to the atypical antidepressant bupropion; however, the remission rate was lower for venlafaxine. In a double-blind study, patients who did not respond to an SSRI were switched to either venlafaxine or another SSRI (citalopram); similar improvement was observed in both groups. Studies have not established its efficacy for use in pediatric populations. In children and adolescents with depression, venlafaxine increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or attempts. Higher doses (e.g., 225 mg and 375 mg per day) of venlafaxine are more effective than lower doses (e.g., 75 mg per day) but also cause more side effects. Studies have shown that the extended-release is superior to the immediate-release form of venlafaxine. A 2017 meta-analysis has showed that the efficacy of venlafaxine is not correlated with baseline severity of depression. In other words, regardless of how severe a person's depression is at treatment initiation, the efficacy of venlafaxine remains consistent and is not influenced by the severity of depression at the start of treatment. == Contraindications == Venlafaxine is not recommended in patients hypersensitive to it, nor should it be taken by anyone who is allergic to the inactive ingredients, which include gelatin, cellulose, ethylcellulose, iron oxide, titanium dioxide and hypromellose. It should not be used in conjunction with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it can cause potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. Venlafaxine might interact with tramadol or other opioids, as well as trazodone, so caution is needed while mixing multiple serotonergic agents together. == Adverse effects == Venlafaxine can increase eye pressure, so those with glaucoma may require more frequent eye checks. A 2017 meta-analysis estimated venlafaxine discontinuation rate due to adverse effects to be 9.4%. === Suicide === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including venlafaxine, to carry a black box warning with a generic warning about a possible suicide risk. A 2014 meta-analysis of 21 clinical trials of venlafaxine for the treatment of depression in adults found that compared to placebo, venlafaxine reduced the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. A study conducted in Finland followed more than 15,000 patients for 3.4 years. Venlafaxine increased suicide risk by 60% (statistically significant), as compared to no treatment. At the same time, fluoxetine (Prozac) halved the suicide risk. In a study sponsored by Wyeth, which produces and markets venlafaxine, the data on more than 200,000 cases were obtained from the UK general practice research database. At baseline, patients prescribed venlafaxine had a greater number of risk factors for suicide (such as prior suicide attempts) than patients treated with other anti-depressants. The patients taking venlafaxine had a significantly higher risk of suicide than the ones on fluoxetine or citalopram (Celexa). After adjusting for known risk factors, venlafaxine was associated with an increased risk of suicide relative to fluoxetine and dothiepin which was not statistically significant. A statistically significant greater risk for attempted suicide remained after adjustment, but the authors concluded that it could be due to residual confounding. An analysis of clinical trials by the FDA statisticians showed the incidence of suicidal behaviour among the adults on venlafaxine to be not significantly different from fluoxetine or placebo. Venlafaxine is contraindicated in children, adolescents, and young adults. In children and adolescents with depression, venlafaxine increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or attempts. === Serotonin syndrome === The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome (also classified as ""serotonin toxicity"") may occur with venlafaxine treatment, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, including but not limited to SSRIs and SNRIs, many hallucinogens such as tryptamines and phenethylamines (e.g., LSD/LSA, DMT, MDMA, mescaline), dextromethorphan (DXM), tramadol, tapentadol, pethidine (meperidine) and triptans and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Venlafaxine-induced serotonin syndrome has also been reported when venlafaxine has been taken in isolation in overdose. An abortive serotonin syndrome state, in which some but not all of the symptoms of the full serotonin syndrome are present, has been reported with venlafaxine at mid-range dosages (150 mg per day). A case of a patient with serotonin syndrome induced by low-dose venlafaxine (37.5 mg per day) has also been reported. === Pregnancy === There are few well-controlled studies of venlafaxine in pregnant women. A study released in May 2010 by the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests use of venlafaxine doubles the risk of miscarriage. Consequently, venlafaxine should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. A large case-control study done as part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and published in 2012 found a significant association between venlafaxine use during pregnancy and several birth defects including anencephaly, cleft palate, septal heart defects and coarctation of the aorta. Prospective studies have not shown any statistically significant congenital malformations. There have, however, been some reports of self-limiting effects on newborn infants. As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), these effects are generally short-lived, lasting only 3 to 5 days, and rarely resulting in severe complications. === Bipolar disorder === According to the ISBD Task Force report on antidepressant use in bipolar disorder, during the course of treatment for depression with those suffering from bipolar I and II, venlafaxine ""appears to carry a particularly high risk of inducing pathologically elevated states of mood and behavior."" Because venlafaxine appears to be more likely than SSRIs and bupropion to induce mania and mixed episodes in these patients, provider discretion is advised through ""carefully evaluating individual clinical cases and circumstances."" === Liver injury === A rare but serious side effect of venlafaxine is liver injury. It appears to affect both male and female patients with a median age of 44. Cessation of venlafaxine is one of the appropriate measures of management. While the mechanism of venlafaxine-related liver injury remains unclear, findings suggest that it may be related to a CYP2D6 polymorphism. === Overdose === Most patients overdosing with venlafaxine develop only mild symptoms. Plasma venlafaxine concentrations in overdose survivors have ranged from 6 to 24 mg/L, while postmortem blood levels in fatalities are often in the 10–90 mg/L range. Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcome compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products, but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants. Healthcare professionals are advised to prescribe Effexor and Effexor XR in the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management to reduce the risk of overdose. It is usually reserved as a second-line treatment for depression due to a combination of its superior efficacy to the first-line treatments like fluoxetine, paroxetine and citalopram and greater frequency of side effects like nausea, headache, insomnia, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, sexual dysfunction, sweating and nervousness. There is no specific antidote for venlafaxine, and management is generally supportive, providing treatment for the immediate symptoms. Administration of activated charcoal can prevent absorption of the drug. Monitoring of cardiac rhythm and vital signs is indicated. Seizures are managed with benzodiazepines or other anticonvulsants. Forced diuresis, hemodialysis, exchange transfusion, or hemoperfusion are unlikely to be of benefit in hastening the removal of venlafaxine, due to the drug's high volume of distribution. === Withdrawal syndrome === People stopping venlafaxine commonly experience SSRI withdrawal symptoms such as dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sensation of electric shocks (commonly called ""brain zaps""), and sleep disturbance. Venlafaxine has a higher rate of moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms relative to other antidepressants (similar to the SSRI paroxetine). The higher risk and increased severity of withdrawal symptoms relative to other antidepressants may be related to the short half-life of venlafaxine and its active metabolite. After stopping venlafaxine, the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine decrease, leading to the hypothesis that the withdrawal symptoms could result from an overly rapid reduction of neurotransmitter levels. === Other === In rare cases, drug-induced akathisia can occur after use in some people. Venlafaxine should be used with caution in hypertensive patients. Venlafaxine must be discontinued if significant hypertension persists. It can also have undesirable cardiovascular effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Venlafaxine is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has also been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). It is described as 'synthetic phenethylamine bicyclic derivative with antidepressant activity'. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin and norepinephrine. Additionally, in high doses, it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine. The frontal cortex largely lacks dopamine transporters; therefore venlafaxine can increase dopamine neurotransmission in this part of the brain. Venlafaxine selectively inhibits the serotonin transporter at lower doses, but at a dose of 225 mg per day it additionally blocks the norepinephrine transporter (NET), as measured by the intravenous tyramine pressor test. Venlafaxine indirectly affects opioid receptors as well as the α2-adrenergic receptor, and was shown to increase pain threshold in mice. These benefits with respect to pain were reversed with naloxone, an opioid antagonist, thus supporting an opioid mechanism. === Pharmacokinetics === Venlafaxine is well absorbed, with at least 92% of an oral dose being absorbed into systemic circulation. It is extensively metabolized in the liver via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme to desvenlafaxine (O-desmethylvenlafaxine, now marketed as a separate medication named Pristiq), which is just as potent an SNRI as the parent compound, meaning that the differences in metabolism between extensive and poor metabolisers are not clinically important in terms of efficacy. Side effects, however, are reported to be more severe in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and its metabolite are attained in the blood within 3 days. Therapeutic effects are usually achieved within 3 to 4 weeks. No accumulation of venlafaxine has been observed during chronic administration in healthy subjects. The primary route of excretion of venlafaxine and its metabolites is via the kidneys. The half-life of venlafaxine is relatively short, so patients are directed to adhere to a strict medication routine, avoiding missing a dose. Even a single missed dose can result in withdrawal symptoms. Venlafaxine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which pumps it out of the brain. The gene encoding P-gp, ABCB1, has the SNP rs2032583, with alleles C and T. The majority of people (about 70% of Europeans and 90% of East Asians) have the TT variant. A 2007 study found that carriers of at least one C allele (variant CC or CT) are 7.72 times more likely than non-carriers to achieve remission after 4 weeks of treatment with amitriptyline, citalopram, paroxetine or venlafaxine (all P-gp substrates). The study included patients with mood disorders other than major depression, such as bipolar II; the ratio is 9.4 if these other disorders are excluded. At the 6-week mark, 75% of C-carriers had remitted, compared to only 38% of non-carriers. == Chemistry == The IUPAC name of venlafaxine is 1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4 methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol, though it is sometimes referred to as (±)-1-[a-[a-(dimethylamino)methyl]-p-methoxybenzyl]cyclohexanol. It consists of two enantiomers present in equal quantities (termed a racemic mixture), both of which have the empirical formula of C17H27NO2. It is usually sold as a mixture of the respective hydrochloride salts, (R/S)-1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4 methoxyphenyl)ethyl]cyclohexanol hydrochloride, C17H28ClNO2, which is a white to off-white crystalline solid. Venlafaxine is structurally and pharmacologically related to the atypical opioid analgesic tramadol, and more distantly to the newly released opioid tapentadol, but not to any of the conventional antidepressant drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, MAOIs, or RIMAs. Venlafaxine extended-release is chemically the same as normal venlafaxine. The extended-release (controlled release) version distributes the release of the drug into the gastrointestinal tract over a longer period than normal venlafaxine. This results in a lower peak plasma concentration. Studies have shown that the extended-release formula has a lower incidence of nausea as a side effect, resulting in better compliance. === Interactions === Venlafaxine should be taken with caution when using St John's wort. Venlafaxine may lower the seizure threshold, and coadministration with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as bupropion and tramadol should be done with caution and at low doses. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === Venlafaxine can be abused as a recreational drug, with damages that can manifest within a month. === Brand names === Venlafaxine was originally marketed as Effexor in most of the world; generic venlafaxine has been available since around 2008 and extended-release venlafaxine has been available since around 2010. Venlafaxine is sold under many brand names worldwide. In some countries, Effexor is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == Veterinary uses == Veterinary overdose in dogs is very well treated by Cyproheptadine HCl.: 1371 Venlafaxine is highly toxic to Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta phytoplankton. Cats are drawn to the smell of venlafaxine and tend to ingest the pills, which is highly toxic to them. == References == == Further reading ==",Elafax,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6240566083070007e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.007320130243897438), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005255929194390774)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.029750484973192215)])","('MEDICAL; ([gador.com.ar](https://www.gador.com.ar/productos/elafax-xr/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Elafax® XR - Gador', type='url_citation', url='https://www.gador.com.ar/productos/elafax-xr/?utm_source=openai')])"
2788,"('Karenitecin', 'Cositecan', 'Karenitecin (cositecan)', 'Cositecan;bnp 1350', 'Karenitecin (tn)')",Medical," This review covers the preclinical and clinical activity of the novel camptothecin analog, karenitecin, in melanoma. While the camptothecins are widely used antitumor agents that inhibit topoisomerase I, their utility is limited by instability, high interpatient variability and the development of drug resistance. Karenitecin was rationally designed to overcome these limitations. The authors review the data on karenitecin in preclinical models and in clinical trials in melanoma using studies published in Medline and reports presented at AACR and ASCO. Karenitecin shows activity in melanoma, both as a single agent and in combination. In adverse prognostic factor melanoma, karenitecin showed prolonged disease stabilization in 34% of patients. Because preclinical studies suggested a synergistic interaction between karenitecin and HDAC inhibitors, a schedule-specific combination Phase I-II trial of valproic acid and karenitecin was carried out in heavily pretreated melanoma patients which showed a benefit rate in 47% patients with acceptable toxicity. The treatment for melanoma is in rapid transition and genomic profiling is now an integral part, and hence the optimal use of karenitecin in melanoma should be re-evaluated with regard to specific mutational status. The poor prognosis of malignant glioma patients highlights the need to develop low toxicity, tumor specific agents with the ability to synergize with proven efficacious treatment modalities, e.g., ionizing irradiation. This paper investigates the potential of BNP1350 (karenitecin), a topoisomerase I-targeting anticancer agent, and flavopridol a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor as radiosensitizers at clinically relevant doses in glioblastoma cell lines. A clonogenic survival and apoptosis assays were performed to test the effect of karenitecin (0.1 nM to 10 nM), flavopridol, (50 nM to 500 nM), radiation (1 Gy to 5.5 Gy) and a combination of radiation and karenitecin or radiation and flavopridol on the glioma cell lines T986 and M059K. Cells were stained for cyclins B and D using antibodies followed by flow cytometry. Propidium Iodide staining was used to reveal the various phases of the cell cycle; cyclin staining in the G0/G1 and G2/M phase of the cell cycle was estimated as the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) after subtracting the MFI recorded by the isotype controls. Results demonstrated that in irradiated cells, pretreatment with karenitecin induced apoptosis, a transient arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and increased the expression of cyclin B1. Flavopridol treatment also induced apoptosis and a transient block in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The combined effects of karenitecin and flavopridol displayed synergistic effects. The unique radiosensitizing activity of orally administrable karenitecin and flavopridol is consistent with continued investigation of these compounds preclinically, as well as in the clinical setting. Camptothecins contain a lactone ring that is necessary for antitumor activity, and hydrolysis of the lactone ring yields an inactive carboxylate species. Human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) are clinically significant plasma proteins thought to have important roles in camptothecin lactone stability. Herein, we examined the effect(s) of HSA and AGP on the lactone stability of Karenitecin, a novel, highly lipophilic camptothecin analog, currently at the phase 3 clinical testing stage. An AGP-immobilized protein column was used to develop HPLC methods to evaluate the effect(s) of physiologically relevant HSA and AGP concentrations on the lactone/carboxylate ratio and hydrolysis kinetics of Karenitecin, camptothecin (CPT), and topotecan (TPT). Physiologically relevant concentrations of HSA and AGP substantially slowed Karenitecin lactone hydrolysis. AGP was notably more effective at protecting the Karenitecin lactone from hydrolysis than HSA was in promoting hydrolysis. Additionally, AGP reversed the hydrolysis of partially hydrolyzed Karenitecin lactone. In contrast, HSA and AGP had minimal effects on hydrolysis of the TPT lactone, while the AGP/HSA solutions dramatically accelerated hydrolysis of the CPT lactone. AGP strongly enhances the lactone stability of Karenitecin. Since Karenitecin is highly protein-bound in human plasma and exhibits greater lactone stability, relative to other camptothecins, in patient plasma samples, this newly identified role of AGP in promoting lactone stability may have important implications for the design of more effective anticancer agents within the Karentecin™ and camptothecin classes.",Karenitecin,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00023600654094479978), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006729676853865385)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18577560/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15837755/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21985236/ ', [])"
2789,"('Allantoin', 'Glyoxyldiureide', 'Allantol', 'Cordianine', 'Glyoxyldiureid')","Endogenous, Medical, Personal Care","Allantoin is a chemical compound with formula C4H6N4O3. It is also called 5-ureidohydantoin or glyoxyldiureide. It is a diureide of glyoxylic acid. Allantoin is a major metabolic intermediate in most organisms including animals, plants and bacteria, though not humans. It is produced from uric acid, which itself is a degradation product of nucleic acids, by action of urate oxidase (uricase). Allantoin also occurs as a natural mineral compound (IMA symbol Aan). == History == Allantoin was first isolated in 1800 by the Italian physician Michele Francesco Buniva (1761–1834) and the French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, who mistakenly believed it to be present in the amniotic fluid. In 1821, the French chemist Jean Louis Lassaigne found it in the fluid of the allantois; he called it ""l'acide allantoique"". In 1837, the German chemists Friedrich Wöhler and Justus Liebig synthesized it from uric acid and renamed it ""allantoïn"". == Animals == Named after the allantois (an amniote embryonic excretory organ in which it concentrates during development in most mammals except humans and other hominids), it is a product of oxidation of uric acid by purine catabolism. After birth, it is the predominant means by which nitrogenous waste is excreted in the urine of these animals. In humans and other higher apes, the metabolic pathway for conversion of uric acid to allantoin is not present, so the former is excreted. Recombinant rasburicase is sometimes used as a drug to catalyze this metabolic conversion in patients. In fish, allantoin is broken down further (into ammonia) before excretion. Allantoin has been shown to improve insulin resistance when administered to rats and to increase lifespan when administered to the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. == Bacteria == In bacteria, purines and their derivatives (such as allantoin) are used as secondary sources of nitrogen under nutrient-limiting conditions. Their degradation yields ammonia, which can then be utilized. For instance, Bacillus subtilis is able to utilize allantoin as its sole nitrogen source. Mutants in the B. subtilis pucI gene were unable to grow on allantoin, indicating that it encodes an allantoin transporter. In Streptomyces coelicolor, allantoinase (EC 3.5.2.5) and allantoicase (EC 3.5.3.4) are essential for allantoin metabolism. In this species the catabolism of allantoin, and the subsequent release of ammonium, inhibits antibiotic production (Streptomyces species synthesize about half of all known antibiotics of microbial origin). == Applications == Allantoin is present in botanical extracts of the comfrey plant and in the urine of most mammals. Chemically synthesized bulk allantoin, which is chemically equivalent to natural allantoin, is safe, non-toxic, compatible with cosmetic raw materials and meets CTFA and JSCI requirements. Over 10,000 patents reference allantoin. === Cosmetics === Manufacturers may use allantoin as an ingredient in over-the-counter cosmetics. === Pharmaceuticals === It is frequently present in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other oral hygiene products, in shampoos, lipsticks, anti-acne products, sun care products, and clarifying lotions, various cosmetic lotions and creams, and other cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. === Biomarker of oxidative stress === Since uric acid is the end product of the purine metabolism in humans, only non-enzymatic processes with reactive oxygen species will give rise to allantoin, which is thus a suitable biomarker to measure oxidative stress in chronic illnesses and senescence. == See also == Imidazolidinyl urea and diazolidinyl urea, are antimicrobial condensation products of allantoin with formaldehyde. == References == == External links == E. coli Allantoinase (AllB) in Uniprot (P77671) GMD MS Spectrum",Glyoxyldiureide,WIKIPEDIA,"('PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('PERSON', -0.4475635588169098), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.023248042911291122), (' MED', -0.1338089555501938), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.7757170796394348), ('DU', -3.9457496313843876e-05), ('ST', -1.6689160474925302e-05), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.005410788580775261), ('ĠPERSON', -0.5284994840621948), ('AL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ĠCARE', -4.768370445162873e-07), (',', -0.12696301937103271), ('ĠMED', -0.3135334253311157), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2520078122615814)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0054361699149012566)])","('PERSONAL CARE; ([medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/glyoxyldiureide?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allantoin?utm_source=openai), [cosmacon.de](https://www.cosmacon.de/en/glyoxyldiureide/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=300, start_index=15, title='Glyoxyldiureide | definition of glyoxyldiureide by Medical dictionary', type='url_citation', url='https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/glyoxyldiureide?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=300, start_index=15, title='Allantoin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allantoin?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=300, start_index=15, title='Glyoxyldiureide - Allantoin - 5-Ureidohydantoin - Cosmacon', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cosmacon.de/en/glyoxyldiureide/?utm_source=openai')])"
2790,"('Lauric acid', 'N-dodecanoic acid', 'Dodecylic acid', 'Vulvic acid', 'Laurostearic acid')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Lauric acid, systematically dodecanoic acid, is a saturated fatty acid with a 12-carbon atom chain, thus having many properties of medium-chain fatty acids. It is a bright white, powdery solid with a faint odor of bay oil or soap. The salts and esters of lauric acid are known as laurates. == Occurrence == Lauric acid, as a component of triglycerides, comprises about half of the fatty-acid content in coconut milk, coconut oil, laurel oil, and palm kernel oil (not to be confused with palm oil). Oils with high levels of lauric acid are known as lauric oils. Otherwise, it is relatively uncommon. It is also found in human breast milk (6.2% of total fat), cow's milk (2.9%), and goat's milk (3.1%). === In various plants === The palm tree Attalea speciosa, a species popularly known in Brazil as babassu – 50% in babassu oil Attalea cohune, the cohune palm (also rain tree, American oil palm, corozo palm or manaca palm) – 46.5% in cohune oil Astrocaryum murumuru (Arecaceae) a palm native to the Amazon – 47.5% in ""murumuru butter"" Coconut oil 49% Pycnanthus kombo (African nutmeg) Virola surinamensis (wild nutmeg) 7.8–11.5% Peach palm seed 10.4% Betel nut 9% Date palm seed 0.56–5.4% Macadamia nut 0.072–1.1% Plum 0.35–0.38% Watermelon seed 0.33% Viburnum opulus 0.24-0.33% Citrullus lanatus (egusi melon) Pumpkin flower 205 ppm, pumpkin seed 472 ppm === Insect === Black soldier fly Hermetia illucens 30–50 mg/100 mg fat. == Uses == Like many other fatty acids, lauric acid is inexpensive, has a long shelf-life, is nontoxic, and is safe to handle. It is used mainly for the production of soaps and cosmetics. For these purposes, lauric acid is reacted with sodium hydroxide to give sodium laurate, which is a soap. Most commonly, sodium laurate is obtained by saponification of various oils, such as coconut oil. These precursors give mixtures of sodium laurate and other soaps. Lauric acid is a precursor to dilauroyl peroxide, a commercial initiator of polymerizations. == Production and reactions == Lauric acid is mainly isolated from natural sources. Its reactions are representative of those of similar long chain, saturated fatty acids. It can be converted to the symmetrical fatty ketone called laurone (O=C(C11H23)2). It transesterifies with vinyl acetate. Treatment with sulfur trioxide gives the α-sulfonic acid. == Nutritional and medical aspects == Although 95% of medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed through the portal vein, only 25–30% of lauric acid is absorbed through it. Lauric acid induces apoptosis in cancer and promotes the proliferation of normal cells by maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Lauric acid increases total serum lipoproteins more than many other fatty acids, but mostly high-density lipoprotein (HDL). As a result, lauric acid has been characterized as having ""a more favorable effect on total HDL than any other fatty acid [examined], either saturated or unsaturated"". In general, a lower total/HDL serum lipoprotein ratio correlates with a decrease in atherosclerotic incidence. Nonetheless, an extensive meta-analysis on foods affecting the total LDL/serum lipoprotein ratio found in 2003 that the net effects of lauric acid on coronary artery disease outcomes remained uncertain. A 2016 review of coconut oil (which is nearly half lauric acid) was similarly inconclusive about the effects on cardiovascular disease incidence. == References == == Further reading == Berner, Louise A.

2791,"('Danazol', 'Danocrine', 'Chronogyn', 'Winobanin', 'Danol')",Medical,"Danazol, sold as Danocrine and other brand names, is a medication used in the treatment of endometriosis, fibrocystic breast disease, hereditary angioedema and other conditions. It is taken by mouth. The use of danazol is limited by masculinizing side effects such as acne, excessive hair growth, and voice deepening. Danazol has a complex mechanism of action, and is characterized as a weak androgen and anabolic steroid, a weak progestogen, a weak antigonadotropin, a weak steroidogenesis inhibitor, and a functional antiestrogen. Danazol was discovered in 1963 and was introduced for medical use in 1971. Due to their improved side-effect profiles, particularly their lack of masculinizing side effects, danazol has largely been replaced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH analogues) in the treatment of endometriosis. == Medical uses == Danazol is used primarily in the treatment of endometriosis. It has also been used – mostly off-label – for other indications, namely in the management of menorrhagia, fibrocystic breast disease, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, premenstrual syndrome, breast pain, and hereditary angioedema. Although not currently a standard treatment for menorrhagia, danazol demonstrated significant relief in young women with menorrhagia in a study, and, because of a lack of a significant adverse effects, it was proposed as an alternative treatment. Danazol appears to be useful in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. === Available forms === Danazol comes in the form of 50, 100, and 200 mg oral capsules. It is taken at a dose of 50 to 400 mg two or three times per day, for a total of 100 to 800 mg per day depending on the indication. == Contraindications == Danazol is contraindicated during pregnancy because it has the potential to virilize female fetuses. Women taking danazol should practice effective contraception to prevent pregnancy if sexually active. Since danazol is metabolized by the liver, it cannot be used by patients with liver disease, and in patients receiving long-term therapy, liver function must be monitored on a periodic basis. == Side effects == Androgenic side effects are of concern, as some women taking danazol may experience unwanted hair growth (hirsutism), acne, irreversible deepening of the voice, or adverse blood lipid profiles. In addition, breast atrophy and decreased breast size may occur. The drug may also cause hot flashes, elevation of liver enzymes, and mood changes. The use of danazol for endometriosis has been linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Patients with endometriosis have specific risk factors for ovarian cancer, so this may not apply for other uses. Danazol, like most other anabolic steroids, has been linked with an increased risk of liver tumors. These are generally benign. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Danazol possesses a complex pharmacology, with multiple mechanisms of action. These include direct binding to and activation of sex hormone receptors, direct inhibition of enzymes involved in steroidogenesis, and direct binding to and occupation of steroid hormone carrier proteins and consequent displacement of steroid hormones from these proteins. The drug is characterized as a weak androgen and anabolic, a weak progestogen, a weak antigonadotropin, a weak steroidogenesis inhibitor, and a functional antiestrogen. ==== Modulation of steroid hormone receptors ==== Danazol is described as a possessing high affinity for the androgen receptor (AR), moderate affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and poor affinity for the estrogen receptor (ER). As an androgen, danazol is described as weak, being about 200-fold less potent than testosterone in bioassays. The drug can act as both an agonist and antagonist of the PR depending on the bioassay, indicating that it could be regarded as a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM). Although the affinity and efficacy of danazol itself at the PR are relatively low, ethisterone, one of the major metabolites of danazol, is described as a weak progestogen (and has been employed clinically as a progestogen), and this presumably serves to increase the in vivo progestogenic activity of danazol. The activity of danazol at the ER is considered to be minimal, although at very high concentrations the drug can act significantly as an ER agonist. Danazol is considered to act significantly as an agonist of the GR, and, thus, as a glucocorticoid. In accordance, it can suppress the immune system at sufficient dosages. ==== Inhibition of steroidogenesis enzymes ==== Danazol has been found to act as an inhibitor, to varying extents, of a variety of steroidogenic enzymes, including cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-4 isomerase, 17α-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, and 11β-hydroxylase. It has also been found to be a weak inhibitor of steroid sulfatase (Ki = 2.3–8.2 μM), the enzyme that converts DHEA-STooltip dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate into DHEATooltip dehydroepiandrosterone and estrone sulfate into estrone (which can then respectively be transformed into estrone (with androstenedione as an intermediate) and estradiol), though another study reported its inhibition to be potent and potentially clinically relevant. Although in contradiction with the above data, another study found that danazol weakly inhibited aromatase as well, with 44% inhibition at a concentration of 10 μM. In accordance with its steroidogenesis inhibition, clinical studies have demonstrated that danazol directly and markedly inhibits adrenal, ovarian, and testicular steroidogenesis in vivo. The enzymatic production of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone have all specifically been found to be inhibited. For reference, circulating concentrations of danazol are in the range of 2 μM at a dosage of 600 mg/day in women. ==== Occupation and downregulation of carrier proteins ==== Danazol is known to bind to two steroid hormone carrier proteins: sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which binds androgens and estrogens; and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), which binds progesterone and cortisol. Binding of danazol to SHBG is considered to be more important clinically. By occupying SHBG and CBG, danazol increases the ratio of free to plasma protein-bound testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol. The table to the right shows the difference in testosterone levels in premenopausal women treated with danazol. As can be seen, the percentage of free testosterone is tripled in women being treated with danazol. The ability of danazol to increase free testosterone levels suggests that a portion of its weak androgenic effects are mediated indirectly by facilitating the activity of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone through the displacement of them from SHBG. In addition to binding to and occupying SHBG however, danazol also decreases the hepatic production of SHBG and therefore SHBG levels, and so downregulation of SHBG may be involved as well. Danazol likely decreases hepatic production of SHBG by reducing estrogenic and increasing androgenic activity in the liver (as androgens and estrogens decrease and increase, respectively, hepatic SHBG synthesis). In accordance with the notion that suppression of SHBG is involved in the androgenic effects of danazol, the drug has synergistic rather than additive androgenic effects in combination with testosterone in bioassays (which is most likely secondary to the increased free testosterone levels). It is noteworthy that 2-hydroxymethylethisterone, a major metabolite of danazol, circulates at concentrations 5–10 times greater than those of danazol and is twice as potent as danazol in displacing testosterone from SHBG. As such, most of the occupation of SHBG by danazol may actually be due to this metabolite. ==== Antigonadotropic activity ==== Via its weak progestogenic and androgenic activity, through activation of the PR and AR in the pituitary gland, danazol produces antigonadotropic effects. Although its does not significantly affect basal luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in premenopausal women (and hence does not profoundly suppress gonadotropin or sex hormone levels like other, stronger antigonadotropins do), the drug prevents the mid-cycle surge in the levels of these hormones during the menstrual cycle. By doing this, it suppresses increases in estrogen and progesterone levels at this time and prevents ovulation. ==== Mechanism of action in endometriosis ==== Because danazol reduces estrogen production and levels, it has functional antiestrogenic properties. The combination of its antiestrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic or antiprogestogenic actions cause atrophy of the endometrium, which alleviates the symptoms of endometriosis. ==== Effects in men ==== In men, danazol has been found to inhibit gonadotropin secretion and markedly decrease testosterone levels, likely due to its actions as a steroidogenesis inhibitor and antigonadotropin. However, even at the highest dosage assessed (800 mg/day), spermatogenesis remained unaffected. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of danazol is low. In addition, circulating levels of danazol do not increase proportionally with increasing doses, indicating that there is a saturation of bioavailability. With single-dose administration, it has been found that a 4-fold increase in dosage of danazol increased peak levels only by 1.3- and 2.2-fold and area-under-the-curve levels by 1.6- and 2.5-fold in the fasted and fed states, respectively. Similar findings were observed for chronic administration. Intake of danazol with food (>30 grams of fat) has been found to increase the bioavailability and peak levels of danazol by 3- to 4-fold with a single dose and by 2- to 2.5-fold with chronic administration. Following administration of danazol, peak concentrations occur after 2 to 8 hours, with a median of 4 hours. Steady-state levels of danazol are achieved after 6 days of twice-daily administration. Danazol is lipophilic and can partition into cell membranes, which indicates that it is likely to distribute deeply into tissue compartments. The volume of distribution of danazol is 3.4 L. Danazol is known to be plasma protein bound to albumin, SHBG, and CBG. Danazol is metabolized in the liver by enzymes such as CYP3A4. Its elimination half-life has varied across studies, but has been found to be 3 to 10 hours after a single dose and 24 to 26 hours with repeated administration. The major metabolites of danazol are 2-hydroxymethylethisterone (also known as 2-hydroxymethyldanazol; formed by CYP3A4 and described as inactive) and ethisterone (a progestogen and androgen), and other, minor metabolites include δ2-hydroxymethylethisterone, 6β-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethylethisterone, and δ1-6β-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethylethisterone. At least 10 different metabolites have been identified. Danazol is eliminated in urine and feces, with the two primary metabolites in urine being 2-hydroxymethylethisterone and ethisterone. == Chemistry == Danazol, also known as 2,3-isoxazol-17α-ethynyltestosterone or as 17α-ethynyl-17β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-[2,3-d]isoxazole, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone and ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone). It is specifically the derivative of ethisterone where the C3 ketone is replaced with a 2,3-isoxazole moiety (i.e., an isoxazole ring is fused to the A ring at the C2 and C3 positions). Ethisterone is a weak progestin with weak androgenic activity. == History == Danazol was synthesized in 1963 by a team of scientists at Sterling Winthrop in Rensselaer, New York by a team that included Helmutt Neumann, Gordon Potts, W.T. Ryan, and Frederik W. Stonner. It was approved by the U.S.Tooltip United States Food and Drug Administration in 1971 as the first drug in the country to specifically treat endometriosis. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Danazol is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It is also known by its developmental code name WIN-17757. === Brand names === Danazol is or has been marketed under many brand names throughout the world including Anargil, Azol, Benzol, Bonzol, Cyclolady, Cyclomen, Danal, Danalol, Danamet, Danamin, Danasin, Danatrol, Danazant, Danazol, Danocrine, Danodiol, Danogen, Danokrin, Danol, Danonice, Danoval, Danzol, Dogalact (veterinary), Dorink, Dzol, Ectopal, Elle, Gonablok, Gong Fu Yi Kang, Gynadom, Kodazol, Kupdina, Ladogal, Lozana, Mastodanatrol, Nazol, Norciden, Vabon, and Winobanin. === Availability === Danazol is available in the United States, Europe, and widely elsewhere throughout the world. == Research == Danazol has been studied in the treatment of breast cancer in women, but produced relatively low response rates of about 15 to 20%. Low-dose danazol has been investigated in the treatment of diabetic macular edema in a phase III clinical trial. A 2016 phase I/II prospective study orally administered 800 mg per day to 27 patients with telomere diseases. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 20% reduction in the annual rate of telomere attrition measured. Toxic effects formed the primary safety endpoint. The study was halted early, after telomere attrition was reduced in all 12 patients who could be evaluated. 12 of 27 patients achieved the primary efficacy end point, 11 of whom increased telomere length at 24 months. Hematologic responses (secondary efficacy endpoint) occurred in 10 of 12 patients who could be evaluated at 24 months. Elevated liver-enzyme levels and muscle cramps (known adverse effects) of grade 2 or less occurred in 41% and 33% of the patients, respectively. == References == == Further reading ==",Chronogyn,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.4378848391061183e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0048079355619847775), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008738728240132332)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/estradiol-and-dienogest-oral-route/description/drg-20074271,https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/21807/,https://minclinic.eu/drugs/drugs_eng/C/Chronogyn.html ', [])"

Endogenous circulating hormone levels may help stimulate cancer progression and limit the effectiveness of anticancer therapy, though clinical data remain inconclusive. The capacity of thyroid hormones to modulate angiogenesis is mediated through non-canonical mechanisms initiated at the cell surface receptor integrin αvβ3. This integrin is predominantly expressed on tumour cells, proliferating endothelial cells and tumour stroma-associated cells, emphasising its potential relevance in angiogenesis and tumour biology. Thyroid hormone/integrin αvβ3 signalling results in the activation of intracellular pathways that are commonly associated with angiogenesis and are mediated through classical pro-angiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor. The naturally occurring T4 analogue tetrac blocks the pro-angiogenic actions of thyroid hormones at the integrin receptor, in addition to agonist-independent anti-angiogenic effects. Tetrac reduces endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation through a reduction in the transcription of vascular growth factors/growth factor receptors, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, pro-angiogenic cytokines and a number of other pro-angiogenic genes, while at the same time stimulating the expression of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors. It further modulates vascular growth factor activity by disrupting the crosstalk between integrin αvβ3 and adjacent growth factor receptors. Moreover, tetrac disrupts thyroid hormone-stimulated tumour recruitment, differentiation and the pro-angiogenic signalling of tumour stroma-associated mesenchymal stem cells. Tetrac affects tumour-associated angiogenesis via multiple mechanisms and interferes with other cancer cell survival pathways. In conjunction with its low toxicity and high tissue selectivity, tetrac is a promising candidate for clinical application. Integrin αvβ3 is generously expressed by cancer cells and rapidly dividing endothelial cells. The principal ligands of the integrin are extracellular matrix proteins, but we have described a cell surface small molecule receptor on αvβ3 that specifically binds thyroid hormone and thyroid hormone analogs. From this receptor, thyroid hormone (l-thyroxine, T4; 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine, T3) and tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) regulate expression of specific genes by a mechanism that is initiated non-genomically. At the integrin, T4 and T3 at physiological concentrations are pro-angiogenic by multiple mechanisms that include gene expression, and T4 supports tumor cell proliferation. Tetrac blocks the transcriptional activities directed by T4 and T3 at αvβ3, but, independently of T4 and T3, tetrac modulates transcription of cancer cell genes that are important to cell survival pathways, control of the cell cycle, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell export of chemotherapeutic agents, and repair of double-strand DNA breaks. We have covalently bound tetrac to a 200 nm biodegradable nanoparticle that prohibits cell entry of tetrac and limits its action to the hormone receptor on the extracellular domain of plasma membrane αvβ3. This reformulation has greater potency than unmodified tetrac at the integrin and affects a broader range of cancer-relevant genes. In addition to these actions on intra-cellular kinase-mediated regulation of gene expression, hormone analogs at αvβ3 have additional effects on intra-cellular protein-trafficking (cytosol compartment to nucleus), nucleoprotein phosphorylation, and generation of nuclear coactivator complexes that are relevant to traditional genomic actions of T3. Thus, previously unrecognized cell surface-initiated actions of thyroid hormone and tetrac formulations at αvβ3 offer opportunities to regulate angiogenesis and multiple aspects of cancer cell behavior.",Tetrac,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00016206118743866682), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.12717697024345398), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3869136869907379)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.693147599697113)])","('INFO; ', [])"
2793,"('Ribose 5-phosphate (disodium)', 'Ribose-5-phosphate', 'Ribose 5-monophosphate', 'Ribose phosphate', 'Ribose 5-(dihydrogen phosphate)')","Endogenous, Medical","Ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) is both a product and an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. The last step of the oxidative reactions in the pentose phosphate pathway is the production of ribulose 5-phosphate. Depending on the body's state, ribulose 5-phosphate can reversibly isomerize to ribose 5-phosphate. Ribulose 5-phosphate can alternatively undergo a series of isomerizations as well as transaldolations and transketolations that result in the production of other pentose phosphates as well as fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (both intermediates in glycolysis). The enzyme ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase converts ribose-5-phosphate into phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. == Structure == R5P consists of a five-carbon sugar, ribose, and a phosphate group at the five-position carbon. It can exist in open chain form or in furanose form. The furanose form is most commonly referred to as ribose 5-phosphoric acid. == Biosynthesis == The formation of R5P is highly dependent on the cell growth and the need for NADPH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), R5P, and ATP (Adenosine triphosphate). Formation of each molecule is controlled by the flow of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) in two different metabolic pathways: the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis. The relationship between the two pathways can be examined through different metabolic situations. === Pentose phosphate pathway === R5P is produced in the pentose phosphate pathway in all organisms. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a metabolic pathway that runs parallel to glycolysis. It is a crucial source for NADPH generation for reductive biosynthesis (e.g. fatty acid synthesis) and pentose sugars. The pathway consists of two phases: an oxidative phase that generates NADPH and a non-oxidative phase that involves the interconversion of sugars. In the oxidative phase of PPP, two molecules of NADP+ are reduced to NADPH through the conversion of G6P to ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P). In the non-oxidative of PPP, Ru5P can be converted to R5P through ribose-5-phosphate isomerase enzyme catalysis. When demand for NADPH and R5P is balanced, G6P forms one Ru5P molecule through the PPP, generating two NADPH molecules and one R5P molecule. === Glycolysis === When more R5P is needed than NADPH, R5P can be formed through glycolytic intermediates. Glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) during glycolysis. Transketolase and transaldolase convert two molecules of F6P and one molecule of G3P to three molecules of R5P. During rapid cell growth, higher quantities of R5P and NADPH are needed for nucleotide and fatty acid synthesis, respectively. Glycolytic intermediates can be diverted toward the non-oxidative phase of PPP by the expression of the gene for pyruvate kinase isozyme, PKM. PKM creates a bottleneck in the glycolytic pathway, allowing intermediates to be utilized by the PPP to synthesize NADPH and R5P. This process is further enabled by triosephosphate isomerase inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate, the PKM substrate. == Function == R5P and its derivatives serve as precursors to many biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, ATP, coenzyme A, FAD (Flavin adenine dinucleotide), and histidine. === Nucleotide biosynthesis === Nucleotides serve as the building blocks for nucleic acids, DNA and RNA. They are composed of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and at least one phosphate group. Nucleotides contain either a purine or a pyrimidine nitrogenous base. All intermediates in purine biosynthesis are constructed on a R5P ""scaffold"". R5P also serves as an important precursor to pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis. During nucleotide biosynthesis, R5P undergoes activation by ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase (PRPS1) to form phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). Formation of PRPP is essential for both the de novo synthesis of purines and for the purine salvage pathway. The de novo synthesis pathway begins with the activation of R5P to PRPP, which is later catalyzed to become phosphoribosylamine, a nucleotide precursor. During the purine salvage pathway, phosphoribosyltransferases add PRPP to bases. PRPP also plays an important role in pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis. During the fifth step of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, PRPP covalently links to orotate at the one-position carbon on the ribose unit. The reaction is catalyzed by orotate phosphoriboseyltransferase (PRPP transferase), yielding orotidine monophosphate (OMP). === Histidine biosynthesis === Histidine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized de novo in humans. Like nucleotides, biosynthesis of histidine is initiated by the conversion of R5P to PRPP. The step of histidine biosynthesis is the condensation of ATP and PRPP by ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase, the rate determining enzyme. Histidine biosynthesis is carefully regulated by feedback inhibition/ === Other functions === R5P can be converted to adenosine diphosphate ribose, which binds and activates the TRPM2 ion channel. The reaction is catalyzed by ribose-5-phosphate adenylyltransferase == Disease relevance == Diseases have been linked to R5P imbalances in cells. Cancers and tumors show upregulated production of R5P correlated to increased RNA and DNA synthesis. Ribose 5-phosphate isomerase deficiency, the rarest disease in the world, is also linked to an imbalance of R5P. Although the molecular pathology of the disease is poorly understood, hypotheses included decreased RNA synthesis. Another disease linked to R5P is gout. Higher levels of G6P lead to a buildup of glycolytic intermediates, that are diverted to R5P production. R5P converts to PRPP, which forces an overproduction of purines, leading to uric acid build up. Accumulation of PRPP is found in Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome. The build up is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which leads to decreased nucleotide synthesis and an increase of uric acid production. Superactivity in PRPS1, the enzyme that catalyzes the R5P to PRPP, has also been linked to gout, as well as neurodevelopmental impairment and sensorineural deafness. == References ==",Ribose phosphate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -9.014684110297821e-06), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -4.572941179503687e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.002242314163595438), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.7165990357170813e-05), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02978258579969406)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Two isogenes encoding CMK (GbCMK1 and GbCMK2) were cloned and characterized from Ginkgo biloba. The activities of both isozymes were confirmed by complementation assay using Escherichia coli NMW29, a ychB knock-out mutant. The transcript profiles of GbCMKs in the radicles and the cotyledons of the cultured Ginkgo biloba embryos demonstrated that the transcript levels of GbCMK1 were similar in both organs, whereas that of GbCMK2 was predominantly high in the ginkgolide-synthesizing radicles. Selective increases in the transcript abundance of GbCMK2 in the radicles, induced by light and methyl jasmonate treatments, were observed. These differential induction patterns of the transcripts imply GbCMK1 and GbCMK2 respectively have high correlations with the primary and the secondary metabolisms. The transit peptides of both isozymes delivered the fused green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the chloroplast in the Arabidopsis and the Nicotiana transient expression systems; interestingly, the transit peptide of GbCMK1 delivered the GFP protein into the cytosol and the nucleus in addition to the chloroplasts.

2796,"('Miltefosine', 'Hepc', 'Hexadecyl phosphocholine', 'Hexadecylphosphocholine', 'Miltex')",Medical,"Miltefosine, sold under the trade name Impavido among others, is a medication mainly used to treat leishmaniasis and free-living amoeba infections such as Naegleria fowleri and Balamuthia mandrillaris. This includes the three forms of leishmaniasis: cutaneous, visceral and mucosal. It may be used with liposomal amphotericin B or paromomycin. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, headaches, and decreased kidney function. More severe side effects may include Stevens–Johnson syndrome or low blood platelets. Use during pregnancy appears to cause harm to the baby and use during breastfeeding is not recommended. How it works is not entirely clear. Miltefosine was first made in the early 1980s and studied as a treatment for cancer. A few years later it was found to be useful for leishmaniasis and was approved for this use in 2002 in India. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Leishmaniasis === Miltefosine is primarily used for the treatment of visceral and New World cutaneous leishmaniasis, and is undergoing clinical trials for this use in several countries. This drug is now listed as a core medication for the treatment of leishmaniasis under the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. Several medical agents have some efficacy against visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis, however, a 2005 survey concluded that miltefosine is the only effective oral treatment for both forms of leishmaniasis. === Amoeba infections === Miltefosine has been used successfully in some cases of the very rare, but highly lethal, brain infection by the amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, acquired through water entering the nose during a plunge in contaminated water. It has orphan drug status in the United States for acanthamoeba keratitis and primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Miltefosine is listed as pregnancy category D by the FDA. This means there is evidence-based adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans of harm to the human fetus. Despite this evidence, the potential benefits of miltefosine may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. A pregnancy test should be done prior to starting treatment. Effective birth control should be used while on miltefosine and 5 months after discontinuation of treatment. Its use during breast feeding is most likely unsafe. == Contraindications == Miltefosine is contraindicated in individuals who have a hypersensitivity to this medication, pregnant women, and people who have the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. It is embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits, and teratogenic in rats but not in rabbits. It is therefore contraindicated for use during pregnancy, and contraception is required beyond the end of treatment in women of child-bearing age. == Side effects == Common side effects from miltefosine treatment are nausea and vomiting, which occur in 60% of people. Other common side effects are dizziness, headache, and daytime sleepiness. Serious side effects include rash, diarrhea, and arthritis. The side effects are more severe in women and young children. The overall effects are quite mild and easily reversed. == Mechanism of action == Miltefosine primarily acts on Leishmania by affecting the species's promastigote and amastigote stages. Miltefosine exerts its activity by interacting with lipids, inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase and causing apoptosis-like cell death. This may affect membrane integrity and mitochondrial function of the parasite. == History == === Cancer === While initially studied as a cancer medication, due to side effects it was never used for this purpose. Phospholipid group alkylphosphocholine were known since the early 1980s, particularly in terms of their binding affinity with cobra venom. In 1987 the phospholipids were found to be potent toxins on leukemic cell culture. Initial in vivo investigation on the antineoplastic activity showed positive result, but then only at high dosage and at high toxicity. At the same time in Germany, Hansjörg Eibl, at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, and Clemens Unger, at the University of Göttingen, demonstrated that the antineoplastic activity of the phospholipid analogue miltefosine (at the time known as hexadecylphosphocholine) was indeed tumour-specific. It was highly effective against methylnitrosourea-induced mammary carcinoma, but less so on transplantable mammary carcinomas and autochthonous benzo(a)pyrene-induced sarcomas, and relatively inactive on Walker 256 carcinosarcoma and autochthonous acetoxymethylmethylnitrosamine-induced colonic tumors of rats. It was subsequently found that miltefosine was structurally unique among lipids having anticancer property in that it lacks the glycerol group, is highly selective on cell types and acts through different mechanism. === Leishmaniasis === In the same year as the discovery of the anticancer property, miltefosine was reported by S. L. Croft and his team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having antileishmanial effect as well. The compound was effective against Leishmania donovani amastigotes in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages at a dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day in a five-day course. However, priority was given to the development of the compound for cutaneous metastases of breast cancer. In 1992 a new research was reported in which the compound was highly effective in mouse against different life cycle stages of different Leishmania species, and in fact, more potent than the conventional sodium stibogluconate therapy by a factor of more than 600. Results of the first clinical trial in humans were reported from Indian patients with chronic leishmaniasis with high degree of success and safety. This promising development promulgated a unique public–private partnership collaboration between ASTA Medica (later Zentaris GmbH), the World Health Organization (WHO) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, and the Government of India. Eventually, several successful Phase II and III trials led to the approval of miltefosine in 2002 as the first and only oral drug for leishmaniasis. === Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba === In 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended miltefosine for the treatment of free-living amoeba infections such as granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, two fatal protozoal diseases. Historically, only four survivors have been recorded out of 138 confirmed infections in North America. One American survived the infection in 1978 and one individual from Mexico in 2003. In 2013, two children survived and recovered from primary amoebic meningoencephalitis after treatment with miltefosine. In 2016 after treatment that included miltefosine, another child became the fourth person in the United States to survive Naegleria fowleri infection. == Society and culture == === Availability === Since 2017 Miltefosine is commercially available in the United States through Profounda. Previously one could only get it from the CDC for emergency use under an expanded access IND protocol for treatment of free-living amoeba (FLA) infections: primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis caused by Balamuthia mandrillaris and Acanthamoeba species. Miltefosine is almost exclusively produced by Profounda, a private pharmaceutical company. === Economics === In the developing world a course of treatment costs US$65 to $150. In the developed world treatment may be 10 to 50 times greater. == Further research == It is active against some bacteria and fungi, as well as human trematode Schistosoma mansoni and the snail that spreads it Biomphalaria alexandrina. === Antiprotozoal and antifungal activities === Miltefosine is being investigated by researchers interested in finding treatments for infections which have become resistant to existing drugs. Animal and in vitro studies suggest it may have broad anti-protozoal and anti-fungal properties: Animal studies suggest miltefosine may also be effective against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas' disease. Several studies have found the drug to be effective against types of fungus: Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida, Aspergillus and Fusarium. A 2006 in vitro study found that miltefosine is effective against metronidazole-resistant variants of Trichomonas vaginalis, a sexually transmitted protozoal disease. Cetrimonium bromide, a compound related to miltefosine, was demonstrated in 2007 to exhibit potent in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum. An in vitro test in 2006 showed that miltefosine is effective against the deadly protozoan pathogens, Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Acanthamoeba. However, later in vitro and animal model experiments showed that it is not as potent as other drugs, such as chlorpromazine and diminazene aceturate (Berenil). In 2013, there were reports of failure of miltefosine in the treatment of leishmaniasis. Although drug resistance was suspected, studies in 2014 reported that miltefosine is not so effective in children, most probably related to a lack of drug exposure in children. Moverover, males appeared to have a higher probability of relapse as well. A 2012 in vitro study found that miltefosine had promising activity against Candida albicans biofilms. === Anti-HIV activity === Miltefosine targets HIV infected macrophages, which play a role in vivo as long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs. The HIV protein Tat activates pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway in primary human macrophages. Miltefosine acts by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway, thus removing the infected macrophages from circulation, without affecting healthy cells. It significantly reduces replication of HIV-1 in cocultures of human dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+ T cells, which is due to a rapid secretion of soluble factors and is associated with induction of type-I interferon (IFN) in the human cells. == References == == External links == ""Miltefosine"".

It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sedation, indigestion, nausea, and insomnia. At higher dosages, there is an increased risk for restlessness and movement problems. Serious side effects are valid for all atypical antipsychotics and may include the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, as well as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, an increased risk of suicide, angioedema, and high blood sugar levels. Although lurasidone is less likely to cause high blood sugar levels in most patients, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome may occur. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, it may increase the risk of dying. Use during pregnancy is of unclear safety. Lurasidone was first approved for medical use in the United States in 2010. In 2013, it was approved in Canada and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat bipolar depression, either as monotherapy or adjunctively with lithium or valproate. It has no effect on manic symptoms and is more potent for treating major depressive disorder or depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Generic versions were approved in the United States in 2019, and became available in 2023. In 2021, it was the 193rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Lurasidone is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In bipolar disorder, it has been studied both as a monotherapy and adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproate. The European Medicines Agency approved lurasidone for the treatment of schizophrenia for people aged 13 years and older, but not for bipolar disorder. In the United States, it is used to treat schizophrenia for people aged 13 years and older, as well as depressive episodes of bipolar disorder age 10 and over as a monotherapy, and in conjunction with lithium or valproate in adults. In July 2013, lurasidone received approval for bipolar I depression. In June 2020, lurasidone was approved in Japan, eight years after its first approval in the United States. In Japan it is approved for bipolar depression and schizophrenia. Few available atypical antipsychotics are known to possess antidepressant efficacy in bipolar disorder (with the notable exceptions being cariprazine, quetiapine, olanzapine and possibly asenapine) as a monotherapy, even though the majority of atypical antipsychotics are known to possess significant antimanic activity, which is yet to be clearly demonstrated for lurasidone. In the early post approval period lurasidone-treated patients with bipolar disorder were retrospectively found to have more complex clinical profiles, comorbidities, and prior treatment history compared to patients initiated with other atypical antipsychotics. The study authors suggest this may be due to ""the overall clinical profile of lurasidone, the role perceived for lurasidone in the therapeutic armamentarium by practitioners, and the recent introduction of lurasidone into clinical practice during the study period."" Lurasidone is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior disorders in older adults with dementia. == Contraindications == Lurasidone is contraindicated in individuals who are taking strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 (ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, levodropropizine, etc.) or inducers (carbamazepine, St. John's wort, phenytoin, rifampicin etc.). The use of lurasidone in pregnant women has not been studied and is not recommended; in animal studies, no risks have been found. Excretion in breast milk is also unknown; lurasidone is not recommended for breastfeeding women. In the United States, it is not indicated for use in children. The enzyme CYP3A4 is involved in the digestion of drugs. Inhibitors such as grapefruit juice block its function resulting in too much drug in the body. == Side effects == Side effects are generally similar to other antipsychotics. The drug has a relatively well tolerated side effect profile, with low propensity for QTc interval changes, weight gain and lipid-related adverse effects. In a 2013 meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs, it was found to produce the second least (after haloperidol) weight gain, the least QT interval prolongation, the fourth most extrapyramidal side effects (after haloperidol, zotepine and chlorpromazine), and the sixth least sedation (after paliperidone, sertindole, amisulpride, iloperidone and aripiprazole). As with other atypical neuroleptics, lurasidone should be used with caution in the elderly because it puts them at an increased risk for a stroke or transient ischemic attack; however, these risks are not likely to be greater than those associated with antipsychotics of other classes. Similarly, lurasidone should not be used to treat dementia-related psychosis, as evidence has shown increased mortality with antipsychotic use. Weight gain is reported in up to 15 and 16 percent of users. Other possible side effects include vomiting, akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism, somnolence, dizziness, sedation and nausea. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. == Interactions == Blood plasma concentrations may be increased when combined with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, and voriconazole) possibly leading to more side effects. This has been clinically verified for ketoconazole, which increases lurasidone exposure by a factor of 9, and is also expected for other 3A4 inhibitors such as grapefruit juice. Co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers like rifampicin, carbamazepine or St. John's wort can reduce plasma levels of lurasidone and its active metabolite, and consequently decrease the effects of the drug. For rifampicin, the reduction was sixfold in a study. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Lurasidone [(3aR,4S,7R,7aS)-2-{(1R,2R)-2-[4-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3-yl) piperazin-1-ylmethyl]-cyclohexylmethyl}-hexahydro-4,7-methano-2Hisoindole-1,3-dione hydrochloride] ] is an azapirone derivative and acts as an antagonist of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, and the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT7 receptors, and the α2C-adrenergic receptor, and as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. It has moderate-affinity antagonism at α2C-adrenergic receptors; low to very low-affinity antagonism at α1A-adrenergic α2A-adrenergic receptors. It has only low and likely clinically unimportant affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, which may underlie its low propensity for appetite stimulation and weight gain. The drug also has negligible affinity for the histamine H1 receptor and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and hence has no antihistamine or anticholinergic effects. Drowsiness (somnolence) side effect is not explained by its antagonist activity to histamine. The relationship between dose and D2 receptor occupancy levels were 41–43% for 10 mg, 51–55% for 20 mg, 63–67% for 40 mg, 77–84% for 60 mg, and 73–79% for 80 mg. === Pharmacokinetics === Lurasidone is taken by mouth and has an estimated absorption rate of 9 to 19%. Studies have shown that when lurasidone is taken with food, absorption increases about twofold. Peak blood plasma concentrations are reached after one to three hours. About 99% of the circulating substance are bound to plasma proteins. Efficacy data for lurasidone have been evaluated for doses of 20 mg to 120 mg daily. Lurasidone is extensively metabolised by CYP3A4 leading to contraindication of both strong inhibitors as well as strong inducers of this enzyme, but has negligible affinity to other cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is transported by P-glycoprotein and ABCG2 and also inhibits these carrier proteins in vitro. It also inhibits the solute carrier protein SLC22A1, but no other relevant transporters. Main metabolism pathways are oxidative N-dealkylation between the piperazine and cyclohexane rings, hydroxylation of the norbornane ring, and S-oxidation.:59 Other pathways are hydroxylation of the cyclohexane ring and reductive cleavage of the isothiazole ring followed by S-methylation. The two relevant active metabolites are the norbornane hydroxylation products called ID-14283 and ID-14326, the former reaching pharmacologically relevant blood plasma concentrations. The two major inactive metabolites are the N-dealkylation products (the carboxylic acid ID-20219 and the piperazine ID-11614), and a norbornane hydroxylated derivative of ID-20219 (ID-20220). Of lurasidone and its metabolites circulating in the blood, the native drug makes up 11%, the main active metabolite 4%, and the inactive carboxylic acids 24% and 11%, respectively. Several dozen metabolites have been identified altogether.:59–61 Biological half-life is given as 18 hours or 20 to 40 hours in different sources. 80% or 67% of a radiolabelled dose was recovered from the feces, and 9% or 19% from the urine. == History == Lurasidone was first synthesised circa 2003. Lurasidone is a structural analogue of ziprasidone. Lurasidone shows a very close pharmacological profile and has been synthesized similarly to ziprasidone. Lurasidone is chemically similar to perospirone (also a chemical analogue of ziprasidone), as well as risperidone, paliperidone and iloperidone. It has approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating schizophrenia since 2010, and for treating depressive episodes in adults with bipolar I disorder since 2013. == Society and culture == === Cost === In Canada, as of 2014, lurasidone is generally more expensive than risperidone and quetiapine but less expensive than aripiprazole. In the United States, because a number of doses have the same price per tablet, pill splitting has been used to decrease costs. In 2019, generic versions were approved in the United States; however, they only became available in 2023 due to drug patents. === Brand names === In India, this drug is available under the brand names of Atlura, Lurace, Lurafic, Luramax (Sun Pharma), Lurasid, Lurastar, Latuda, Lurata and additionally as Alsiva, Emsidon, Lurakem, Luratrend, Tablura, and Unisidon. === Regulatory approval === Lurasidone was approved in the United States for the treatment of schizophrenia in October 2010 and for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in June 2013. It received regulatory approval in the United Kingdom in September 2014. In October 2014, NHS Scotland advised use of lurasidone for schizophrenic adults who have not seen improvements with previous antipsychotics due to problems that arise from weight gain or changes in metabolic pathways when taking other medications. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion for it in January 2014, and it was approved for medical use by the EMA in March 2014. It was launched in Canada for the treatment of schizophrenia in September 2012, Health Canada giving their Summary Basis of Decision (SBD) as favourable on 15 October 2012. The European Commission has granted a marketing authorization for once-daily oral lurasidone for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. It is approved for use in the EU. Generic versions of lurasidone were approved for use in the United States in January 2019 and became available in 2023. == References == == External links == ""FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA urges caution about withholding opioid addiction medications from patients taking benzodiazepines or CNS depressants: careful medication management can reduce risks"".

For this reason, we focused on the syntheses and cytotoxic evaluation of derivatives obtained from gypsogenin, hederagenin, and madecassic acid, cytotoxicity increased-by and large-from the parent compounds to their acetates. Another increase in cytotoxicity was observed for the acetylated amides (phenyl, benzyl, piperazinyl, and homopiperazinyl), but a superior cytotoxicity was observed for the corresponding rhodamine B conjugates derived from the (homo)-piperazinyl amides. In particular, a madecassic acid homopiperazinyl rhodamine B conjugate  The imbalance between Th17 and Treg cells substantially contributes to the intestinal immune disturbance and subsequent tissue injury in ulcerative colitis. The triterpenoid-rich fraction of Centella asiatica was able to ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice. Here we explored its active ingredient and underlying mechanism with a focus on restoring the Th17/Treg balance. The four main triterpenoids occurring in C. asiatica were shown to attenuate colitis in mice by oral administration. The most effective ingredient madecassoside lost anti-colitis effect when applied topically in the colon, and madecassic acid was recognized to be the active form of madecassoside. Oral administration of madecassic acid decreased the percentage of Th17 cells and downregulated the expression of RORγt, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21 and IL-22 and increased the percentage of Treg cells and the expression of Foxp3 and IL-10 in the colons of mice with colitis, but it did not affect Th1 and Th2 cells. Under Th17-polarizing conditions, madecassic acid downregulated ACC1 expression and enhanced the shift of Th17 cells toward Treg cells, but it did not affect the differentiation of Treg cells under Treg-polarizing conditions. Both compound C and AMPK siRNA inhibited the madecassic acid-mediated downregulation of ACC1 expression and shift of Th17 cells to Treg cells under Th17-polarizing conditions. GW9662, T0070907 and PPARγ siRNA blocked the effect of madecassic acid on AMPK activation, ACC1 expression and shift of Th17 cells to Treg cells. Furthermore, madecassic acid was identified as a PPARγ agonist, as it promoted PPARγ transactivation. The correlation between activation of PPARγ and AMPK, downregulation of ACC1 expression, restoration of Th17/Treg balance and attenuation of colitis by madecassic acid was validated in mice with DSS-induced colitis. In conclusion, madecassic acid was the active form of madecassoside in ameliorating colitis by restoring the Th17/Treg balance via regulating the PPARγ/AMPK/ACC1 pathway. Anti-diabetic effects of madecassic acid (MEA) and rotundic acid (RA) were examined. MEA or RA at 0.05% or 0.1% was supplied to diabetic mice for six weeks. The intake of MEA, not RA, dose-dependently lowered plasma glucose level and increased plasma insulin level. MEA, not RA, intake dose-dependently reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and fibrinogen level; as well as restored antithrombin-III and protein C activities in plasma of diabetic mice. MEA or RA intake decreased triglyceride and cholesterol levels in plasma and liver. Histological data agreed that MEA or RA intake lowered hepatic lipid droplets, determined by ORO stain. MEA intake dose-dependently declined reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized glutathione levels, increased glutathione content and maintained the activity of glutathione reductase and catalase in the heart and kidneys of diabetic mice. MEA intake dose-dependently reduced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in the heart and kidneys of diabetic mice. RA intake at 0.1% declined cardiac and renal levels of these inflammatory factors. These data indicated that MEA improved glycemic control and hemostatic imbalance, lowered lipid accumulation, and attenuated oxidative and inflammatory stress in diabetic mice.

2800,"('Estriol', 'Oestriol', 'Trihydroxyestrin', 'Estratriol', 'Ovestin')","Endogenous, Medical","Estriol (E3), sold under the brand name Ovestin among others, is an estrogen medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone which is used in menopausal hormone therapy. It is also used in veterinary medicine as Incurin to treat urinary incontinence due to estrogen deficiency in dogs. The medication is taken by mouth in the form of tablets, as a cream that is applied to the skin, as a cream or pessary that is applied in the vagina, and by injection into muscle. Estriol is well-tolerated and produces relatively few adverse effects. Side effects may include breast tenderness, vaginal discomfort and discharge, and endometrial hyperplasia. Estriol is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. It is an atypical and relatively weak estrogen, with much lower potency than estradiol. When present continuously at adequate concentrations however, estriol produces full estrogenic effects similarly to estradiol. Estriol was first discovered in 1930, and was introduced for medical use shortly thereafter. Estriol esters such as estriol succinate are also used. Although it is less commonly employed than other estrogens like estradiol and conjugated estrogens, estriol is widely available for medical use in Europe and elsewhere throughout the world. == Medical uses == Estriol is used in menopausal hormone therapy to treat menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, vulvovaginal atrophy, and dyspareunia (difficult or painful sexual intercourse). The benefits of estriol on bone mineral density and osteoporosis prevention have been inconsistent and are less clear. Estriol has been found to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and other urogenital symptoms. A combination of estriol and lactobacilli as a dual estrogen and probiotic has been marketed for the treatment of vaginal atrophy and urinary tract infections. === Available forms (except USA) === Estriol is available in oral tablet, vaginal cream, and vaginal suppository forms. It is also available over-the-counter or from compounding pharmacies in the form of topical creams. The medication is available both as estriol and in the form of estriol ester prodrugs such as estriol succinate, estriol acetate benzoate, and estriol tripropionate, as well as the polymeric ester prodrug polyestriol phosphate. Estriol was originally marketed in the 1930s in the form of oral capsules containing 0.06, 0.12, or 0.24 mg estriol under the brand names Theelol (Parke-Davis) and Estriol (Lilly, Abbott). Subsequently, many decades later, oral tablets containing 0.35, 1, or 2 mg estriol were introduced under brand names such as Gynäsan, Hormomed, Ovestin, and Ovo-Vinces. == Contraindications == General contraindications of estrogens include breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and others. In animals, estriol is contraindicated during pregnancy and in ferrets. == Side effects == Estriol is well-tolerated and produces relatively few adverse effects. Breast tenderness may sometimes occur as a side effect of estriol. Local reactions with vaginal estriol such as discomfort (irritation, burning, itching) and discharge may occur. Estriol may produce endometrial hyperplasia similarly to estradiol and other estrogens, and hence should be combined with a progestogen in women with intact uteruses to prevent this risk. However, it appears that typical clinical dosages of vaginal estriol are not associated with an important risk of endometrial proliferation or hyperplasia. As such, combination with a progestogen may not be needed in the case of vaginal estriol. Some studies suggest that this may also be true for oral estriol. However, dosage and frequency of administration, as well as meal consumption, may be determining factors as to whether or not estriol produces endometrial proliferation. == Overdose == Estrogens and other steroids are relatively safe in acute overdose. Estriol has been assessed in single oral doses of up to 75 mg. General symptoms of estrogen overdose in humans may include nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding, and reversible feminization. While there are no known studies describing the acute toxicity of estrogen overdose in dogs, this species is known to be more sensitive to the toxic effects of estrogens than humans and other animals. The most serious short-term adverse effect of estrogens in dogs is bone marrow suppression and consequent pancytopenia, which can be life-threatening. == Interactions == Interactions with estriol might be expected to be similar to those of estradiol. No interactions with estriol have been reported in animals. However, it should not be used in combination with other drugs that suppress bone marrow production in dogs. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Estriol is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), ERα and ERβ. In terms of relative binding affinities (RBA) for the ERs compared to estradiol, it was found in one study to possess 11 to 14% of the RBA for the human ERα and 18 to 21% of the RBA for the human ERβ. Its relative transactivational capacities at the ERs compared to estradiol were 11% at ERα and 17% at ERβ. In addition to being a ligand of the classical nuclear ERs, estriol is an antagonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a membrane estrogen receptor (mER), at high concentrations (~1,000–10,000 μM). This is in contrast to estradiol, which is an agonist of this receptor. Like other estrogens, estriol does not importantly interact with other steroid hormone receptors. Estriol is a much less potent estrogen than is estradiol, and is somewhat weak and atypical in its properties. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. With clinical use, estriol is said to be weakly estrogenic in certain tissues, such as the liver and endometrium, but produces pronounced and full estrogenic responses in the vaginal epithelium. The medication has been found to reduce hot flashes, improve vaginal atrophy, reverse the postmenopausal decline in skin thickness and collagen content, suppress gonadotropin secretion, and produce proliferation of breast epithelium. Conversely, estriol does not consistently affect bone resorption or fracture risk, does not seem to increase breast density, and, at oral doses of 2 to 4 mg/day, does not affect liver proteins, lipid metabolism, or hemostatic parameters. Additionally, vaginal estriol does not appear to produce endometrial proliferation or increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, and some studies have found this to be the case for oral estriol as well. On the other hand, it appears that estriol may be able to stimulate the growth of active breast cancer. In rodents, estriol induces mammary gland development similar to that with estrone. By the oral route in women, estriol has approximately 30% of the potency of estradiol in terms of hot flashes relief and suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, and about 20% of the potency of estradiol on stimulation of liver production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. A study of ovulation inhibition by estrogens in women found that prevention of ovulation occurred with 5 mg/day oral estriol in only 1 of 7 cycles. Due to its differing effects from those of estradiol, estriol may be considered a safer estrogen in certain regards. The weak and atypical estrogenicity of estriol is thought to be related to its short duration in the body and hence the fact that it stays bound to the ER for a relatively short amount of time. Whereas estradiol remains bound to the ER for 6 to 24 hours with a single short-acting injection, estriol dissociates from the receptor much more rapidly and stays bound for only 1 to 6 hours. As a result, estriol can only induce estrogenic effects which require short-term interaction with the ERs. Induction of endometrial mitoses requires the ligand to remain bound for at least 9 to 12 hours, and this is thought to be responsible for the lack of endometrial proliferation with estriol in many studies. If estriol is delivered more continuously than a single administration per day however, for instance if it is given as a subcutaneous pellet, as a depot injection, or in multiple doses two or three times per day, this results in more sustained exposure to estriol and full estrogenic responses equivalent to those of estradiol occur. For these reasons, estriol has been described as a ""short-acting"" estrogen and it has been said that descriptors like ""weak"" and ""impeded"" are inaccurate. Consumption of food after oral administration of estriol also results in more prolonged exposure to estriol, due to enterohepatic recycling and resurgences in estriol levels. As such, if avoidance of endometrial hyperplasia or other full estrogenic effects is intended, it may be preferable to take estriol in a single dose, as low as possible, once per day at night before bedtime. Although estriol is an estrogen, it has also been reported to have mixed agonist–antagonist or partial agonist activity at the ERs. On its own, it is said to be weakly estrogenic, but in the presence of estradiol, it has been found to be antiestrogenic. However, this is again due to the fact that estriol is a ""short-acting"" estrogen. If estriol is present continuously with estradiol, it shows no antagonism of estradiol. The co-administration of estriol with estradiol has been found not to influence the effects of the latter in women, including neither enhancing nor antagonizing the effects of estradiol. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Estriol has significant bioavailability, but its potency is limited by rapid metabolism and excretion and its relatively weak estrogenic activity. With oral administration, during first-pass metabolism, a considerable portion of estriol is conjugated via sulfation into estriol sulfate and rapidly excreted. Only about 10 to 20% of a dose of estriol remains in the circulation, and of this, only about 1 to 2% is present in its active, unconjugated form. Peak levels of estriol occur about 1 to 3 hours after an oral dose. Similarly to the case of progesterone, taking oral estriol with food greatly enhances its absorption. In addition, due to enterohepatic recycling, consuming a meal 4 hours after taking oral estriol can produce a second peak in estriol levels. Dosages of oral estriol of 4 to 10 mg have been found to result in a fairly large range of maximal estriol levels of 80 to 340 pg/mL. After a single oral dose of 8 mg estriol in postmenopausal women, maximal levels of 65 pg/mL estriol and 60 ng/mL estriol conjugates were produced within an hour. With continued daily administration, this increased to peak levels of 130 pg/mL estriol, whereas maximal levels of estriol conjugates remained at 60 ng/mL. Levels of estriol rapidly decreased to low levels following occurrence of peak levels. Consumption of a meal 4 hours after taking an oral dose of 8 mg estriol during continuous daily administration resulted in a second estriol peak 2 hours later of 120 pg/mL, with estriol levels declining slowly thereafter to about 25 pg/mL after 24 hours. The bioavailability of estriol is markedly increased with vaginal administration compared to oral administration. The relative bioavailability of oral estriol was found to be about 10% of that of vaginal estriol. In accordance, a single dose of 8 mg oral estriol and of 0.5 mg vaginal estriol have been found to produce similar circulating concentrations of estriol. It has been said that 0.5 to 1 mg vaginal estriol may be equivalent in clinical effect to 8 to 12 mg oral estriol. The high bioavailability of vaginal estriol is due to rapid absorption and low metabolism in atrophic vaginal mucosa. Vaginal estriol at typical clinical dosages results both in high local concentrations of estriol in the vagina and in systemic action. Vaginal administration of low doses of 30 μg estriol and of higher doses of 0.5 and 1 mg estriol have been found to produce equivalent local effects in the vagina and improvement of vaginal symptoms, suggesting that a saturation of estrogenic effect of vaginal estriol has been reached in the vagina by a dose of only 30 μg estriol. In contrast to higher doses of vaginal estriol however, 30 μg/day estriol is not associated with systemic effects. Similarly, the use of 0.5 mg vaginal estriol twice a week instead of daily has been said to largely attenuate the systemic effects of estriol. Whereas oral estriol results in high levels of estriol conjugates which greatly exceed those of unconjugated estriol, vaginal estriol has been found to produce levels of unconjugated estriol and estriol conjugates that are similar. The absorption of estrogens by the skin is described as low for estriol, moderate for estradiol, and high for estrone. This is related to the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecules; the more hydroxyl groups, the lower the skin permeability. This may account for the relative lack of use of transdermal or topical estriol. Rectal administration of estriol has been assessed in one study. Administration of a rectal suppository containing 100 mg estriol resulted in estriol levels in pregnant women at term increasing by about 53%. Estriol levels at term are normally between 5,000 and 20,000 pg/mL, which suggests that estriol levels may have increased following the suppository by about 5,000 to 10,000 pg/mL (precise levels were not provided). Estriol succinate is an ester prodrug of estriol which is used medically via oral and vaginal routes similarly. In estriol succinate, two of the hydroxyl groups of estriol, those at the C16α and C17β positions, are esterified with succinic acid. As such, when adjusted for differences in molecular weight, a dose of 2 mg estriol succinate is equivalent to 1.18 mg unconjugated estriol. Unlike other estrogen esters, such as estradiol valerate, estriol succinate is hydrolyzed almost not at all in the intestinal mucosa when taken orally, and in relation to this, is absorbed more slowly than is estriol. Consequently, oral estriol succinate is a longer-acting form of estriol than oral estriol. Instead of in the gastrointestinal tract, oral estriol succinate is cleaved into estriol mainly in the liver. After a single 8 mg oral dose of estriol succinate, maximum levels of circulating estriol of 40 pg/mL are attained within 12 hours, and this increases up to 80 pg/mL with continued daily administration. ==== Distribution ==== Similarly to estradiol, but unlike estrone, estriol is accumulated in target tissues. The plasma protein binding of estriol is approximately 92%, with about 91% bound to albumin, 1% bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 8% free or unbound. Estriol has very low affinity for SHBG, with only about 0.3% of the affinity of testosterone for this protein (or about 0.6% of that of estradiol). Relative to estradiol, which is about 98% plasma protein-bound, a significantly greater fraction of estriol is unbound in the circulation and hence available for biological activity (2% relative to 8%, respectively). This appears to account for the greater than expected biological activity of estriol relative to estradiol when considering its affinities for the estrogen receptors. ==== Metabolism ==== Estriol is metabolized extensively via conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Glucuronidation of estriol takes place mainly in the intestinal mucosa, while sulfation occurs in the liver. More minor amounts of estriol can be oxidized and hydroxylated at various positions. One such reaction is transformation into 16α-hydroxyestrone. Estriol is an end-product of phase I estrogen metabolism and cannot be converted into estradiol or estrone. The main metabolites of estriol are estrogen conjugates, including estriol sulfates, estriol glucuronides, and mixed estriol sulfate/glucuronide conjugates. 16α-Hydroxyestrone is known to occur as a metabolite of estriol as well. The biological half-life of oral estriol has been reported to be in the range of 5 to 10 hours. The elimination half-life of estriol following an intramuscular injection of 1 mg estriol has been found to be 1.5 to 5.3 hours. The blood half-life of unconjugated estriol has been reported to be 20 minutes. The metabolic clearance rate of estriol is approximately 1,110 L/day/m2, which is about twice that of estradiol. Hence, estriol is eliminated from the body more rapidly than is estradiol. Enterohepatic recycling may extend the duration of oral estriol. A single 1 to 2 mg dose of estriol in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a duration of about 3 or 4 days. Estriol esters such as estriol dipropionate and estriol dihexanoate, when administered via intramuscular injection in an oil solution, have been found to maintain elevated levels of estriol for much longer amounts of time than oral or vaginal estriol, in the range of days to months. These two estriol esters have not been marketed, but estriol acetate benzoate and estriol tripropionate are medically used estriol esters which are given via depot intramuscular injection and are long-acting similarly. Polyestriol phosphate is an ester of estriol in the form of a polymer, and has a very long duration of action. ==== Excretion ==== Estriol is excreted more than 95% in urine. This is due to the fact that estriol conjugates in the colon are completely hydrolyzed via bacterial enzymes and in turn estriol in this part of the body is reabsorbed into the body. The main urinary metabolites of exogenous estriol administered via intravenous injection in baboons have been found to be estriol 16α-glucuronide (65.8%), estriol 3-glucuronide (14.2%), estriol 3-sulfate (13.4%), and estriol 3-sulfate 16α-glucuronide (5.1%). The metabolism and excretion of estriol in these animals closely resembled that which has been observed in humans. == Chemistry == Estriol, also known as 16α-hydroxyestradiol or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,16α,17β-triol, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid with double bonds between the C1 and C2, C3 and C4, and C5 and C10 positions and hydroxyl groups at the C3, C16α, and C17β positions. The name estriol and the abbreviation E3 were derived from the chemical terms estrin (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and triol (three hydroxyl groups). === Analogues === A variety of analogues of estriol are known, including both naturally occurring isomers and synthetic substituted derivatives and esters. 16β-Epiestriol (epiestriol), 17α-epiestriol, and 16β,17α-epiestriol are isomers of estriol that are endogenous weak estrogens. Mytatrienediol (16α-methyl-16β-epiestriol 3-methyl ether) is a synthetic derivative of 16β-epiestriol that was never marketed. Estriol acetate benzoate, estriol succinate, and estriol tripropionate are synthetic estriol esters that have been marketed for medical use, whereas estriol dihexanoate, estriol dipropionate, and estriol triacetate have not been introduced. Quinestradol is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of estriol and has also been marketed. Polyestriol phosphate, an ester of estriol in the form of a polymer, has been marketed previously as well. These esters, ethers, and polymers are prodrugs of estriol. Ethinylestriol and nilestriol are synthetic C17α ethynylated derivatives of estriol. Ethinylestriol has not been marketed, but nilestriol, which is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinylestriol and a prodrug of it, has been. Estetrol (E4), also known as 15α-hydroxyestriol, is a naturally occurring analogue of estriol with an additional hydroxyl group, at the C15α position. It is closely related to estriol and has similar but non-identical pharmacological properties. Like estriol, estetrol is a relatively weak and atypical estrogen. Estetrol is under development for potential clinical use for a variety of indications, such as menopausal hormone therapy and hormonal birth control. == History == Estriol was discovered in 1930. Subsequently, it was introduced for medical use in oral and transdermal formulations under brand names such as Estriol, Oestrosalve, Theelol, and Tridestrin. In addition, conjugated estriol, containing mainly estriol glucuronide, was marketed in the 1930s, under the brand names Emmenin and Progynon. They were the first orally active estrogen preparations to be introduced in medicine. In contrast to estrone, free estriol was never introduced for use by intramuscular injection. Estriol continues to be used medically today, widely throughout the world and in a variety of different formulations and brand names. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Estriol is the generic name of estriol in American English and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It is pronounced ESS-TREE-ohl. Estriolo is the name of estriol in Italian and estriolum is its name in Latin, whereas its name remains unchanged as estriol in Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German. Oestriol, in which the ""O"" is silent, was the former BANTooltip British Approved Name of estriol and its name in British English, but the spelling was eventually changed to estriol. === Brand names === Estriol is or has been marketed under a variety of brand names throughout the world, including Aacifemine, Colpogyn, Elinol, Estriel, Estriol, Estriosalbe, Estrokad, Evalon, Gydrelle, Gynäsan, Gynest, Gynoflor (in combination with lactobacilli), Incurin (veterinary), Klimax-E, OeKolp, Oestro-Gynaedron, Orgestriol, Ortho-Gynest, Ovesterin, Ovestin, Ovestinon, Ovestrion, Ovo-Vinces, Pausanol, Physiogine, Sinapause, Synapause, Synapause-E, Trophicrème, Vago-Med, Vacidox, and Xapro. Estriol succinate has been marketed under the brand names Blissel, Evalon, Gelistrol, Hemostyptanon, Orgastyptin, Ovestin, Pausan, Sinapause, Styptanon, Synapsa, Synapasa, Synapausa, and Synapause. Estriol diacetate benzoate has been marketed under the brand name Holin-Depot and estriol tripropionate has been marketed under the brand name Estriel. Polyestriol phosphate has been marketed under the brand names Gynäsan, Klimadurin, and Triodurin. Emmenin and Progynon were estriol products marketed in the 1930s which were manufactured from the urine of pregnant women and contained estriol conjugates, primarily estriol glucuronide. Estriol for multiple sclerosis had the tentative brand name Trimesta but did not complete development and was never marketed. === Availability === Estriol is marketed widely throughout the world, including in Europe, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere. The medication is also available in some countries in the form of estriol succinate, an ester prodrug of estriol. Estriol and its esters are not approved for use in the United States or Canada, although estriol has been produced and sold by compounding pharmacies in North America for use as a component of bioidentical hormone therapy. In addition, topical creams containing estriol are not regulated in the United States and are available over-the-counter in this country. == Research == Estriol may have immunomodulatory effects and has been of investigational interest in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and a number of other conditions. Estriol succinate was under development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis in the United States and worldwide, and reached phase II clinical trials for this indication, but development was discontinued due to insufficient effectiveness. It had the tentative brand name Trimesta. == Veterinary use == Estriol is used in veterinary medicine, under the brand name Incurin, in the treatment of urinary incontinence due to estrogen deficiency in dogs. Certain estrogens, like estradiol, can cause bone marrow suppression in dogs, which can be fatal, but estriol appears to pose less or possibly no risk. == References == == Further reading ==",Ovestin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0790666937828064), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.25205880403518677), (' END', -0.005040202289819717), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.0001641377166379243), ('ICAL', -1.4305104514278355e-06), (',', -0.01417532004415989), ('ĠEND', -0.0007645544828847051), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009461931767873466)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estriol_%28medication%29,https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt/vaginal-oestrogen/about-vaginal-oestrogen/ ', [])"
2801,"('Naphthalene-1-acetic acid', 'Transplantone', 'Phyomone', 'Planofix', 'Alpha-naphthylacetic acid')",Medical,"1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) is an organic compound with the formula C10H7CH2CO2H. This colorless solid is soluble in organic solvents. It features a carboxylmethyl group (CH2CO2H) linked to the ""1-position"" of naphthalene. == Use and regulation == NAA is a synthetic plant hormone in the auxin family and is an ingredient in many commercial horticultural products; it is a rooting agent and used for the vegetative propagation of plants from stem and leaf cuttings. It is also used for plant tissue culture. The hormone NAA does not occur naturally, and, like all auxins, is toxic to plants at high concentrations. In the United States, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), products containing NAA require registration with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as pesticides. == Use and analysis == NAA is widely used in agriculture for various purposes. It is considered to be only slightly toxic but when at higher concentrations it can be toxic to animals. This was shown when tested on rats via oral ingestion at 1000–5900 mg/kg. NAA has been shown to greatly increase cellulose fiber formation in plants when paired with another phytohormone called gibberellic acid. Because it is in the auxin family it has also been understood to prevent premature dropping and thinning of fruits from stems. It is applied after blossom fertilization. Increased amounts can actually have negative effects however, and cause growth inhibition to the development of plant crops. It has been used on many different crops including apples, olives, oranges, potatoes, and various other hanging fruits. In order for it to obtain its desired effects it must be applied in concentrations ranging from 20–100 μg/mL. NAA present in the environment undergoes oxidation reactions with hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals. Radical reactions of NAA were studied using pulse radiolysis technique. Hydroxyl adduct radical was formed as the intermediate during the reaction of hydroxyl radical with NAA. The intermediate naphthyl methyl radical was formed during the reaction of sulfate radical anion with NAA. In micropropagation of various plants, NAA is typically added to a medium containing nutrients essential to the plants' survival. It is added to help induce root formation in various plant types. It can also be applied by spraying it onto plants and which is typical in agricultural use. It is prohibited in many areas to use it in high concentrations due to the health concerns towards humans and other animals. NAA can be detected by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). == Derivative uses == RSD 1000 [169191-56-4] == See also == 1-Naphthaleneacetamide Micropropagation Tissue culture Indole-3-butyric acid - Another chemical used as a plant rooting agent. == References ==",Naphthalene-1-acetic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.015149884857237339), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16029508411884308)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.0004307884373702109), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Naphthaleneacetic_acid,https://www.haz-map.com/Agents/3438,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01750 ', [])"

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of domatinostat (histone deacetylase inhibitor) plus avelumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) in patients with previously treated inoperable, advanced/metastatic MMRp OGA and CRC. Eligible patients were evaluated in a multicentre, open-label dose escalation/dose expansion phase II trial. In the escalation phase, patients received escalating doses of domatinostat [100 mg once daily (OD), 200 mg OD, 200 mg twice daily (BD)] orally for 14 days followed by continuous dosing plus avelumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously 2-weekly (2qw) to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). The trial expansion phase evaluated the best objective response rate (ORR) during 6 months by RECIST version 1.1 using a Simon two-stage optimal design with 2/9 and 1/10 responses required to proceed to stage 2 in the OGA and CRC cohorts, respectively. Patients (n = 40) were registered between February 2019 and October 2021. Patients in the dose escalation phase (n = 12) were evaluated to confirm the RP2D of domatinostat 200 mg BD plus avelumab 10 mg/kg. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Twenty-one patients were treated at the RP2D, 19 (9 OGA and 10 CRC) were assessable for the best ORR; 2 patients with CRC did not receive combination treatment and were not assessable for the primary endpoint analysis. Six patients were evaluated in the dose escalation and expansion phases. In the OGA cohort, the best ORR was 22.2% (95% one-sided confidence interval lower bound 4.1) and the median duration of disease control was 11.3 months (range 9.9-12.7 months). No responses were observed in the CRC cohort. No treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were reported at the RP2D. Responses in the OGA cohort met the criteria to expand to stage 2 of recruitment with an acceptable safety profile. There was insufficient signal in the CRC cohort to progress to stage 2. NCT03812796 (registered 23 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents an unmet clinical need due to the very poor prognosis and the lack of effective therapy. Here we investigated the potential of domatinostat (4SC-202), a new class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, currently in clinical development, to sensitize PDAC to first line standard gemcitabine (G)/taxol (T) doublet chemotherapy treatment. Synergistic anti-tumor effect of the combined treatment was assessed in PANC1, ASPC1 and PANC28 PDAC cell lines in vitro as well as on tumor spheroids and microtissues, by evaluating combination index (CI), apoptosis, clonogenic capability. The data were confirmed in vivo xenograft models of PANC28 and PANC1 cells in athymic mice. Cancer stem cells (CSC) targeting was studied by mRNA and protein expression of CSC markers, by limiting dilution assay, and by flow cytometric and immunofluorescent evaluation of CSC mitochondrial and cellular oxidative stress. Mechanistic role of forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and downstream targets was evaluated in FOXM1-overexpressing PDAC cells. We showed that domatinostat sensitized in vitro and in vivo models of PDAC to chemotherapeutics commonly used in PDAC patients management and particularly to GT doublet, by targeting CSC compartment through the induction of mitochondrial and cellular oxidative stress. Mechanistically, we showed that domatinostat hampers the expression and function of FOXM1, a transcription factor playing a crucial role in stemness, oxidative stress modulation and DNA repair. Domatinostat reduced FOXM1 protein levels by downregulating mRNA expression and inducing proteasome-mediated protein degradation thus preventing nuclear translocation correlated with a reduction of FOXM1 target genes. Furthermore, by overexpressing FOXM1 in PDAC cells we significantly reduced domatinostat-inducing oxidative mitochondrial and cellular stress and abolished GT sensitization, both in adherent and spheroid cells, confirming FOXM1 crucial role in the mechanisms described. Finally, we found a correlation of FOXM1 expression with poor progression free survival in PDAC chemotherapy-treated patients. Overall, we suggest a novel therapeutic strategy based on domatinostat to improve efficacy and to overcome resistance of commonly used chemotherapeutics in PDAC that warrant further clinical evaluation. The efficacy of PD-(L)1 blockade depends on the composition of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and is generally higher in tumors with pre-existing cytotoxic T cells (CTL) than in those with low CTL numbers. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of patients with pre-existing immunity fail to respond, indicating a therapeutic potential for combining PD-(L)1 blockade with additional immunomodulatory agents in both CTL-high and -low immune phenotypes. Here, we evaluated domatinostat (4SC-202), a class I-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, for its effect on the TIME and its antitumoral efficacy using syngeneic mouse models with CTL-high or CTL-low tumors. Domatinostat was evaluated in PD-1 blockade-insensitive CTL-low (CT26) and CTL-high (C38) syngeneic models alone and in combination with different immune-inhibitory and -stimulatory approaches. Effects on the immunophenotype were assessed via flow cytometry and RNA-seq analyses. The changes in RNA-seq-based immune signatures determined in a murine setting were investigated in patient samples from the first-dose cohort of the SENSITIZE trial (NCT03278665) evaluating domatinostat combined with pembrolizumab in advanced-stage melanoma patients refractory/nonresponding to PD-1 blockade. Domatinostat increased the expression of antigen-presenting machinery (APM) genes and MHC class I and II molecules, along with CTL infiltration, in tumors of both immune phenotypes. In combination with PD-(L)1 blockade, domatinostat augmented antitumor effects substantially above the effects of single-agent therapies, displaying greater benefit in tumors with pre-existing CTLs. In this setting, the combination of domatinostat with agonistic anti-4-1BB or both PD-1 and LAG3 blockade further increased the antitumor efficacy. In CTL-low tumors, domatinostat enhanced the expression of genes known to reinforce immune responses against tumors. Specifically, domatinostat increased the expression of Ifng and genes associated with responses to pembrolizumab and nivolumab. Clinically, these findings were confirmed in patients with advanced melanoma treated with domatinostat for 14 days, who demonstrated elevated expression of APM and MHC genes, the IFNG gene, and the IFN-γ and pembrolizumab response signatures in individual tumor samples. In summary, these data suggest a promising potential of domatinostat in combination with immunotherapy to improve the outcome of refractory cancer patients.",Domatinostat,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003116837178822607), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006729795131832361)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([4sc.com](https://www.4sc.com/news/4sc-ag-discontinuation-domatinostat-program-2/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=108, start_index=6, title='4SC AG – Discontinuation Domatinostat Program - 4SC AG', type='url_citation', url='https://www.4sc.com/news/4sc-ag-discontinuation-domatinostat-program-2/?utm_source=openai')])"
2803,"('Medroxyprogesterone acetate', 'Medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate', 'Farlutin', 'Provera', 'Metigestrona')",Medical,"Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), also known as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) in injectable form and sold under the brand name Depo-Provera among others, is a hormonal medication of the progestin type. It is used as a method of birth control and as a part of menopausal hormone therapy. It is also used to treat endometriosis, abnormal uterine bleeding, paraphilia, and certain types of cancer. The medication is available both alone and in combination with an estrogen. It is taken by mouth, used under the tongue, or by injection into a muscle or fat. Common side effects include menstrual disturbances such as absence of periods, abdominal pain, and headaches. More serious side effects include bone loss, blood clots, allergic reactions, and liver problems. Use is not recommended during pregnancy as it may harm the baby. MPA is an artificial progestogen, and as such activates the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progesterone. It also has androgenic activity and weak glucocorticoid activity. Due to its progestogenic activity, MPA decreases the body's release of gonadotropins and can suppress sex hormone levels. It works as a form of birth control by preventing ovulation. MPA was discovered in 1956 and was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. MPA is the most widely used progestin in menopausal hormone therapy and in progestogen-only birth control. DMPA is approved for use as a form of long-acting birth control in more than 100 countries. In 2022, it was the 276th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == The most common use of MPA is in the form of DMPA as a long-acting progestogen-only injectable contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women. It is an extremely effective contraceptive when used with relatively high doses to prevent ovulation. MPA is also used in combination with an estrogen in menopausal hormone therapy in postmenopausal women to treat and prevent menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal atrophy, and osteoporosis. It is used in menopausal hormone therapy specifically to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer that would otherwise be induced by prolonged unopposed estrogen therapy in women with intact uteruses. In addition to contraception and menopausal hormone therapy, MPA is used in the treatment of gynecological and menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, and endometriosis. Along with other progestins, MPA was developed to allow for oral progestogen therapy, as progesterone (the progestogen hormone made by the human body) could not be taken orally for many decades before the process of micronization was developed and became feasible in terms of pharmaceutical manufacturing. DMPA reduces sex drive in men and is used as a form of chemical castration to control inappropriate or unwanted sexual behavior in those with paraphilias or hypersexuality, including in convicted sex offenders. DMPA has also been used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, as a palliative appetite stimulant for cancer patients, and at high doses (800 mg per day) to treat certain hormone-dependent cancers including endometrial cancer, renal cancer, and breast cancer. MPA has also been prescribed in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women due to its progestogenic and functional antiandrogenic effects. It has been used to delay puberty in children with precocious puberty but is not satisfactory for this purpose as it is not able to completely suppress puberty (specifically, it does not fully halt skeletal maturation and hence does not sufficiently resolve the reduced height at adulthood). DMPA at high doses has been reported to be definitively effective in the treatment of hirsutism as well. Though not used as a treatment for epilepsy, MPA has been found to reduce the frequency of seizures and does not interact with antiepileptic medications. MPA does not interfere with blood clotting and appears to improve blood parameters for women with sickle cell anemia. Similarly, MPA does not appear to affect liver metabolism, and may improve primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis. Women taking MPA may experience spotting shortly after starting the medication but is not usually serious enough to require medical intervention. With longer use amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) can occur as can irregular menstruation which is a major source of dissatisfaction, though both can result in improvements with iron deficiency and risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and often do not result in discontinuation of the medication. === Birth control === DMPA, under brand names such as Depo-Provera and Depo-SubQ Provera 104, is used in hormonal birth control as a long-lasting progestogen-only injectable contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women. It is given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection and forms a long-lasting depot, from which it is slowly released over a period of several months. It takes one week to take effect if given after the first five days of the period cycle, and is effective immediately if given during the first five days of the period cycle. Estimates of first-year failure rates are about 0.3%. ==== Effectiveness ==== Trussell's estimated perfect use first-year failure rate for DMPA as the average of failure rates in seven clinical trials at 0.3%. It was considered perfect use because the clinical trials measured efficacy during actual use of DMPA defined as being no longer than 14 or 15 weeks after an injection (i.e., no more than 1 or 2 weeks late for a next injection). Prior to 2004, Trussell's typical use failure rate for DMPA was the same as his perfect use failure rate: 0.3%. DMPA estimated typical use first-year failure rate = 0.3% in: Contraceptive Technology, 16th revised edition (1994) Contraceptive Technology, 17th revised edition (1998) Adopted in 1998 by the FDA for its current Uniform Contraceptive Labeling guidance In 2004, using the 1995 NSFG failure rate, Trussell increased (by 10 times) his typical use failure rate for DMPA from 0.3% to 3%. DMPA estimated typical use first-year failure rate = 3% in: Contraceptive Technology, 18th revised edition (2004) Contraceptive Technology, 19th revised edition (2007) Trussell did not use 1995 NSFG failure rates as typical use failure rates for the other two then newly available long-acting contraceptives, the Norplant implant (2.3%) and the ParaGard copper T 380A IUD (3.7%), which were (as with DMPA) an order of magnitude higher than in clinical trials. Since Norplant and ParaGard allow no scope for user error, their much higher 1995 NSFG failure rates were attributed by Trussell to contraceptive overreporting at the time of a conception leading to a live birth. ==== Advantages ==== DMPA has a number of advantages and benefits: Highly effective at preventing pregnancy. Injected every 12 weeks. The only continuing action is to book subsequent follow-up injections every twelve weeks, and to monitor side effects to ensure that they do not require medical attention. No estrogen. No increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Minimal drug interactions (compared to other hormonal contraceptives). Decreased risk of endometrial cancer. DMPA reduces the risk of endometrial cancer by 80%. The reduced risk of endometrial cancer in DMPA users is thought to be due to both the direct anti-proliferative effect of progestogen on the endometrium and the indirect reduction of estrogen levels by suppression of ovarian follicular development. Decreased risk of iron deficiency anemia, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and ectopic pregnancy. Decreased symptoms of endometriosis. Decreased incidence of primary dysmenorrhea, ovulation pain, and functional ovarian cysts. Decreased incidence of seizures in women with epilepsy. Additionally, unlike most other hormonal contraceptives, DMPA's contraceptive effectiveness is not affected by enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. Decreased incidence and severity of sickle cell crises in women with sickle-cell disease. The United Kingdom Department of Health has actively promoted Long Acting Reversible Contraceptive use since 2008, particularly for young people; following on from the October 2005 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines. Giving advice on these methods of contraception has been included in the 2009 Quality and Outcomes Framework ""good practice"" for primary care. === Comparison === Proponents of bioidentical hormone therapy believe that progesterone offers fewer side effects and improved quality of life compared to MPA. The evidence for this view has been questioned; MPA is better absorbed when taken by mouth, with a much longer elimination half-life leading to more stable blood levels though it may lead to greater breast tenderness and more sporadic vaginal bleeding. The two compounds do not differentiate in their ability to suppress endometrial hyperplasia, nor does either increase the risk of pulmonary embolism. The two medications have not been adequately compared in direct tests to clear conclusions about safety and superiority. === Available forms === MPA is available alone in the form of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg oral tablets, as a 150 mg/mL (1 mL) or 400 mg/mL (2.5 mL) microcrystalline aqueous suspension for intramuscular injection, and as a 104 mg (0.65 mL of 160 mg/mL) microcrystalline aqueous suspension for subcutaneous injection. It has also been marketed in the form of 100, 200, 250, 400, and 500 mg oral tablets; 500 and 1,000 mg oral suspensions; and as a 50 mg/mL microcrystalline aqueous suspension for intramuscular injection. A 100 mg/mL microcrystalline aqueous suspension for intramuscular injection was previously available as well. In addition to single-drug formulations, MPA is available in the form of oral tablets in combination with conjugated estrogens (CEEs), estradiol, and estradiol valerate for use in menopausal hormone therapy, and is available in combination with estradiol cypionate in a microcrystalline aqueous suspension as a combined injectable contraceptive. Depo-Provera is the brand name for a 150 mg microcrystalline aqueous suspension of DMPA that is administered by intramuscular injection. The shot must be injected into thigh, buttock, or deltoid muscle four times a year (every 11 to 13 weeks), and provides pregnancy protection instantaneously after the first injection. Depo-subQ Provera 104 is a variation of the original intramuscular DMPA that is instead a 104 mg microcrystalline dose in aqueous suspension administered by subcutaneous injection. It contains 69% of the MPA found in the original intramuscular DMPA formulation. It can be injected using a smaller injection needle inserting the medication just below the skin, instead of into the muscle, in either the abdomen or thigh. This subcutaneous injection claims to reduce the side effects of DMPA while still maintaining all the same benefits of the original intramuscular DMPA. == Contraindications == MPA is not usually recommended because of unacceptable health risk or because it is not indicated in the following cases: Conditions where the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using DMPA: Multiple risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease Current deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus Migraine headache with aura while using DMPA Before evaluation of unexplained vaginal bleeding suspected of being a serious condition A history of breast cancer and no evidence of current disease for five years Active liver disease: (acute viral hepatitis, severe decompensated cirrhosis, benign or malignant liver tumours) Conditions of concern for estrogen deficiency and reduced HDL levels theoretically increasing cardiovascular risk: Hypertension with vascular disease Current and history of ischemic heart disease History of stroke Diabetes for over 20 years or with nephropathy/retinopathy/neuropathy or vascular disease Conditions which represent an unacceptable health risk if DMPA is used: Current or recent breast cancer (a hormonally sensitive tumour) Conditions where use is not indicated and should not be initiated: Pregnancy MPA is not recommended for use prior to menarche or before or during recovery from surgery. == Side effects == In women, the most common adverse effects of MPA are acne, changes in menstrual flow, drowsiness, and can cause birth defects if taken by pregnant women. Other common side effects include breast tenderness, increased facial hair, decreased scalp hair, difficulty falling or remaining asleep, stomach pain, and weight loss or gain. Lowered libido has been reported as a side effect of MPA in women. DMPA can affect menstrual bleeding. After a year of use, 55% of women experience amenorrhea (missed periods); after two years, the rate rises to 68%. In the first months of use ""irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, or, rarely, heavy or continuous bleeding"" was reported. MPA does not appear to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Data on weight gain with DMPA likewise are inconsistent. At high doses for the treatment of breast cancer, MPA can cause weight gain and can worsen diabetes mellitus and edema (particularly of the face). Adverse effects peak at five weeks, and are reduced with lower doses. Less frequent effects may include thrombosis (though it is not clear if this is truly a risk, it cannot be ruled out), painful urination, headache, nausea, and vomiting. When used as a form of androgen deprivation therapy in men, more frequent complaints include reduced libido, impotence, reduced ejaculate volume, and within three days, chemical castration. At extremely high doses (used to treat cancer, not for contraception) MPA may cause adrenal suppression and may interfere with carbohydrate metabolism, but does not cause diabetes. When used as a form of injected birth control, there is a delayed return of fertility. The average return to fertility is 9 to 10 months after the last injection, taking longer for overweight or obese women. By 18 months after the last injection, fertility is the same as that in former users of other contraceptive methods. Fetuses exposed to progestogens have demonstrated higher rates of genital abnormalities, low birth weight, and increased ectopic pregnancy particularly when MPA is used as an injected form of long-term birth control. A study of accidental pregnancies among poor women in Thailand found that infants who had been exposed to DMPA during pregnancy had a higher risk of low birth weight and an 80% greater-than-usual chance of dying in the first year of life. === Mood changes === There have been concerns about a possible risk of depression and mood changes with progestins like MPA, and this has led to reluctance of some clinicians and women to use them. However, contrary to widely-held beliefs, most research suggests that progestins do not cause adverse psychological effects such as depression or anxiety. A 2018 systematic review of the relationship between progestin-based contraception and depression included three large studies of DMPA and reported no association between DMPA and depression. According to a 2003 review of DMPA, the majority of published clinical studies indicate that DMPA is not associated with depression, and the overall data support the notion that the medication does not significantly affect mood. In the largest study to have assessed the relationship between MPA and depression to date, in which over 3,900 women were treated with DMPA for up to 7 years, the incidence of depression was infrequent at 1.5% and the discontinuation rate due to depression was 0.5%. This study did not include baseline data on depression, and due to the incidence of depression in the study, the FDA required package labeling for DMPA stating that women with depression should be observed carefully and that DMPA should be discontinued if depression recurs. A subsequent study of 495 women treated with DMPA over the course of 1 year found that the mean depression score slightly decreased in the whole group of continuing users from 7.4 to 6.7 (by 9.5%) and decreased in the quintile of that group with the highest depression scores at baseline from 15.4 to 9.5 (by 38%). Based on the results of this study and others, a consensus began emerging that DMPA does not in fact increase the risk of depression nor worsen the severity of pre-existing depression. Similarly to the case of DMPA for hormonal contraception, the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a study of 2,763 postmenopausal women treated with 0.625 mg/day oral CEEs plus 2.5 mg/day oral MPA or placebo for 36 months as a method of menopausal hormone therapy, found no change in depressive symptoms. However, some small studies have reported that progestins like MPA might counteract beneficial effects of estrogens against depression. === Long-term effects === The Women's Health Initiative investigated the use of a combination of oral CEEs and MPA compared to placebo. The study was prematurely terminated when previously unexpected risks were discovered, specifically the finding that though the all-cause mortality was not affected by the hormone therapy, the benefits of menopausal hormone therapy (reduced risk of hip fracture, colorectal and endometrial cancer and all other causes of death) were offset by increased risk of coronary heart disease, breast cancer, strokes and pulmonary embolism. When combined with CEEs, MPA has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, dementia, and thrombus in the eye. In combination with estrogens in general, MPA may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, with a stronger association when used by postmenopausal women also taking CEEs. It was because of these unexpected interactions that the Women's Health Initiative study was ended early due to the extra risks of menopausal hormone therapy, resulting in a dramatic decrease in both new and renewal prescriptions for hormone therapy. Long-term studies of users of DMPA have found slight or no increased overall risk of breast cancer. However, the study population did show a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (DMPA use in the last four years) under age 35, similar to that seen with the use of combined oral contraceptive pills. ==== Blood clots ==== DMPA has been associated in multiple studies with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) when used as a form of progestogen-only birth control in premenopausal women. The increase in incidence of VTE ranges from 2.2-fold to 3.6-fold. Elevated risk of VTE with DMPA is unexpected, as DMPA has little or no effect on coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, and progestogens by themselves normally do not increase the risk of thrombosis. It has been argued that the higher incidence with DMPA has reflected preferential prescription of DMPA to women considered to be at an increased risk of VTE. Alternatively, it is possible that MPA may be an exception among progestins in terms of VTE risk. A 2018 meta-analysis reported that MPA was associated with a 2.8-fold higher risk of VTE than other progestins. It is possible that the glucocorticoid activity of MPA may increase the risk of VTE. ==== Bone density ==== DMPA may cause reduced bone density in premenopausal women and in men when used without an estrogen, particularly at high doses, though this appears to be reversible to a normal level even after years of use. On 17 November 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration put a black box warning on the label, indicating that there were potential adverse effects of loss of bone mineral density. While it causes temporary bone loss, most women fully regain their bone density after discontinuing use. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the use not be restricted. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that the potential adverse effects on BMD be balanced against the known negative effects of unintended pregnancy using other birth control methods or no method, particularly among adolescents. Three studies have suggested that bone loss is reversible after the discontinuation of DMPA. Other studies have suggested that the effect of DMPA use on postmenopausal bone density is minimal, perhaps because DMPA users experience less bone loss at menopause. Use after peak bone mass is associated with increased bone turnover but no decrease in bone mineral density. The FDA recommends that DMPA not be used for longer than two years, unless there is no viable alternative method of contraception, due to concerns over bone loss. However, a 2008 Committee Opinion from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises healthcare providers that concerns about bone mineral density loss should neither prevent the prescription of or continuation of DMPA beyond two years of use. === HIV risk === There is uncertainty regarding the risk of HIV acquisition among DMPA users; some observational studies suggest an increased risk of HIV acquisition among women using DMPA, while others do not. The World Health Organization issued statements in February 2012 and July 2014 saying the data did not warrant changing their recommendation of no restriction – Medical Eligibility for Contraception (MEC) category 1 – on the use of DMPA in women at high risk for HIV. Two meta-analyses of observational studies in sub-Saharan Africa were published in January 2015. They found a 1.4- to 1.5-fold increase risk of HIV acquisition for DMPA users relative to no hormonal contraceptive use. In January 2015, the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists issued a statement reaffirming that there is no reason to advise against use of DMPA in the United Kingdom even for women at 'high risk' of HIV infection. A systematic review and meta-analysis of risk of HIV infection in DMPA users published in fall of 2015 stated that ""the epidemiological and biological evidence now make a compelling case that DMPA adds significantly to the risk of male-to-female HIV transmission."" In 2019, a randomized controlled trial found no significant association between DMPA use and HIV. == Breastfeeding == MPA may be used by breastfeeding mothers. Heavy bleeding is possible if given in the immediate postpartum time and is best delayed until six weeks after birth. It may be used within five days if not breast feeding. While a study showed ""no significant difference in birth weights or incidence of birth defects"" and ""no significant alternation of immunity to infectious disease caused by breast milk containing DMPA"", a subgroup of babies whose mothers started DMPA at two days postpartum had a 75% higher incidence of doctor visits for infectious diseases during their first year of life. A larger study with longer follow-up concluded that ""use of DMPA during pregnancy or breastfeeding does not adversely affect the long-term growth and development of children"". This study also noted that ""children with DMPA exposure during pregnancy and lactation had an increased risk of suboptimal growth in height,"" but that ""after adjustment for socioeconomic factors by multiple logistic regression, there was no increased risk of impaired growth among the DMPA-exposed children."" The study also noted that effects of DMPA exposure on puberty require further study, as so few children over the age of 10 were observed. == Overdose == MPA has been studied at ""massive"" dosages of up to 5,000 mg per day orally and 2,000 mg per day via intramuscular injection, without major tolerability or safety issues described. Overdose is not described in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product labels for injected MPA (Depo-Provera or Depo-SubQ Provera 104). In the FDA product label for oral MPA (Provera), it is stated that overdose of an estrogen and progestin may cause nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness, dizziness, abdominal pain, drowsiness, fatigue, and withdrawal bleeding. According to the label, treatment of overdose should consist of discontinuation of MPA therapy and symptomatic care. == Interactions == MPA increases the risk of breast cancer, dementia, and thrombus when used in combination with CEEs to treat menopausal symptoms. When used as a contraceptive, MPA does not generally interact with other medications. The combination of MPA with aminoglutethimide to treat metastases from breast cancer has been associated with an increase in depression. St John's wort may decrease the effectiveness of MPA as a contraceptive due to acceleration of its metabolism. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === MPA acts as an agonist of the progesterone, androgen, and glucocorticoid receptors (PR, AR, and GR, respectively), activating these receptors with EC50 values of approximately 0.01 nM, 1 nM, and 10 nM, respectively. It has negligible affinity for the estrogen receptor. The medication has relatively high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor, but in spite of this, it has no mineralocorticoid or antimineralocorticoid activity. The intrinsic activities of MPA in activating the PR and the AR have been reported to be at least equivalent to those of progesterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), respectively, indicating that it is a full agonist of these receptors. ==== Progestogenic activity ==== MPA is a potent agonist of the progesterone receptor with similar affinity and efficacy relative to progesterone. While both MPA and its deacetylated analogue medroxyprogesterone bind to and agonize the PR, MPA has approximately 100-fold higher binding affinity and transactivation potency in comparison. As such, unlike MPA, medroxyprogesterone is not used clinically, though it has seen some use in veterinary medicine. The oral dosage of MPA required to inhibit ovulation (i.e., the effective contraceptive dosage) is 10 mg/day, whereas 5 mg/day was not sufficient to inhibit ovulation in all women. In accordance, the dosage of MPA used in oral contraceptives in the past was 10 mg per tablet. For comparison to MPA, the dosage of progesterone required to inhibit ovulation is 300 mg/day, whereas that of the 19-nortestosterone derivatives norethisterone and norethisterone acetate is only 0.4 to 0.5 mg/day. The mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives like DMPA depends on the progestogen activity and dose. High-dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as DMPA, inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as their primary mechanism of action. The progestogen decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation. A secondary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of sperm penetration by changes in the cervical mucus. Inhibition of ovarian function during DMPA use causes the endometrium to become thin and atrophic. These changes in the endometrium could, theoretically, prevent implantation. However, because DMPA is highly effective in inhibiting ovulation and sperm penetration, the possibility of fertilization is negligible. No available data support prevention of implantation as a mechanism of action of DMPA. ==== Antigonadotropic and anticorticotropic effects ==== MPA suppresses the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axes at sufficient dosages, resulting decreased levels of gonadotropins, androgens, estrogens, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol, as well as levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). There is evidence that the suppressive effects of MPA on the HPG axis are mediated by activation of both the PR and the AR in the pituitary gland. Due to its effects on androgen levels, MPA can produce strong functional antiandrogenic effects, and is used in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions such as precocious puberty in boys and hypersexuality in men. In addition, since the medication suppresses estrogen levels as well, MPA can produce strong functional antiestrogenic effects similarly, and has been used to treat estrogen-dependent conditions such as precocious puberty in girls and endometriosis in women. Due to low estrogen levels, the use of MPA without an estrogen poses a risk of decreased bone mineral density and other symptoms of estrogen deficiency. Oral MPA has been found to suppress testosterone levels in men by about 30% (from 831 ng/dL to 585 ng/dL) at a dosage of 20 mg/day, by about 45–75% (average 60%; to 150–400 ng/dL) at a dosage of 60 mg/day, and by about 70–75% (from 832 to 862 ng/dL to 214 to 251 ng/dL) at a dosage of 100 mg/day. Dosages of oral MPA of 2.5 to 30 mg/day in combination with estrogens have been used to help suppress testosterone levels in transgender women. One study of injectable MPA in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia reported that a single 150 mg dose suppressed testosterone levels into the defined male castrate range (<58 ng/dL) within 7 days and that castration levels of testosterone were maintained for 3 months. Very high doses of intramuscular MPA of 150 to 500 mg per week (but up to 900 mg per week) have similarly been reported to suppress testosterone levels to less than 100 ng/dL. The typical initial dose of intramuscular MPA for testosterone suppression in men with paraphilias is 400 or 500 mg per week. ==== Androgenic activity ==== MPA is a potent full agonist of the AR. Its activation of the AR may play an important and major role in its antigonadotropic effects and in its beneficial effects against breast cancer. However, although MPA may produce androgenic side effects such as acne and hirsutism in some women,. In fact, likely due to its suppressive actions on androgen levels, it has been reported that MPA is generally highly effective in improving pre-existing symptoms of hirsutism in women with the condition. However, MPA has been seen to cause androgenic effects in children with precocious puberty. The reason for the general lack of virilizing effects with MPA, despite it binding to and activating the AR with high affinity and this action potentially playing an important role in many of its physiological and therapeutic effects, is not entirely clear. However, MPA has been found to interact with the AR differently compared to other agonists of the receptor such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The result of this difference appears to be that MPA binds to the AR with a similar affinity and intrinsic activity to that of DHT, but requires about 100-fold higher concentrations for a comparable induction of gene transcription, while at the same time not antagonizing the transcriptional activity of normal androgens like DHT at any concentration. Thus, this may explain the low propensity of MPA for producing androgenic side effects. MPA shows weak androgenic effects on liver protein synthesis, similarly to other weakly androgenic progestins like megestrol acetate and 19-nortestosterone derivatives. While it does not antagonize estrogen-induced increases in levels of triglycerides and HDL cholesterol, DMPA every other week may decrease levels of HDL cholesterol. In addition, MPA has been found to suppress sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production by the liver. At a dosage of 10 mg/day oral MPA, it has been found to decrease circulating SHBG levels by 14–18% in women taking 4 mg/day oral estradiol valerate. Conversely, in a study that combined 2.5 mg/day oral MPA with various oral estrogens, no influence of MPA on estrogen-induced increases in SHBG levels was discerned. In another, higher-dose study, SHBG levels were lower by 59% in a group of women treated with 50 mg/day oral MPA alone relative to an untreated control group of women. In massive-dose studies of oral or injectable MPA (e.g., 500–1,000 mg/day), the medication decreased SHBG levels by about 80%. Unlike the related steroids megestrol acetate and cyproterone acetate, MPA is not an antagonist of the AR and does not have direct antiandrogenic activity. As such, although MPA is sometimes described as an antiandrogen, it is not a ""true"" antiandrogen (i.e., AR antagonist). ==== Glucocorticoid activity ==== As an agonist of the GR, MPA has glucocorticoid activity, and as a result can cause symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, steroid diabetes, and adrenal insufficiency at sufficiently high doses. It has been suggested that the glucocorticoid activity of MPA may contribute to bone loss. The glucocorticoid activity of MPA may also result in an upregulation of the thrombin receptor in blood vessel walls, which may contribute to procoagulant effects of MPA and risk of venous thromboembolism and atherosclerosis. The relative glucocorticoid activity of MPA is among the highest of the clinically used progestins. ==== Steroidogenesis inhibition ==== MPA has been found to act as a competitive inhibitor of rat 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD). This enzyme is essential for the transformation of progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, and DHT into inhibitory neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone, THDOCTooltip tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, and 3α-androstanediol, respectively. MPA has been described as very potent in its inhibition of rat 3α-HSD, with an IC50 of 0.2 μM and a Ki (in rat testicular homogenates) of 0.42 μM. However, inhibition of 3α-HSD by MPA does not appear to have been confirmed using human proteins yet, and the concentrations required with rat proteins are far above typical human therapeutic concentrations. MPA has been identified as a competitive inhibitor of human 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ5-4 isomerase II (3β-HSD II). This enzyme is essential for the biosynthesis of sex steroids and corticosteroids. The Ki of MPA for inhibition of 3β-HSD II is 3.0 μM, and this concentration is reportedly near the circulating levels of the medication that are achieved by very high therapeutic dosages of MPA of 5 to 20 mg/kg/day (dosages of 300 to 1,200 mg/day for a 60 kg (132 lb) person). Aside from 3β-HSD II, other human steroidogenic enzymes, including cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc/CYP11A1) and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), were not found to be inhibited by MPA. MPA has been found to be effective in the treatment of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty and in breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high dosages, and inhibition of 3β-HSD II could be responsible for its effectiveness in these conditions. ==== GABAA receptor allosteric modulation ==== Progesterone, via transformation into neurosteroids such as 5α-dihydroprogesterone, 5β-dihydroprogesterone, allopregnanolone, and pregnanolone (catalyzed by the enzymes 5α- and 5β-reductase and 3α- and 3β-HSD), is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and is associated with a variety of effects mediated by this property including dizziness, sedation, hypnotic states, mood changes, anxiolysis, and cognitive/memory impairment, as well as effectiveness as an anticonvulsant in the treatment of catamenial epilepsy. It has also been found to produce anesthesia via this action in animals when administered at sufficiently high dosages. MPA was found to significantly reduce seizure incidence when added to existing anticonvulsant regimens in 11 of 14 women with uncontrolled epilepsy, and has also been reported to induce anesthesia in animals, raising the possibility that it might modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to progesterone. MPA shares some of the same metabolic routes of progesterone and, analogously, can be transformed into metabolites such as 5α-dihydro-MPA (DHMPA) and 3α,5α-tetrahydro-MPA (THMPA). However, unlike the reduced metabolites of progesterone, DHMPA and THMPA have been found not to modulate the GABAA receptor. Conversely, unlike progesterone, MPA itself actually modulates the GABAA receptor, although notably not at the neurosteroid binding site. However, rather than act as a potentiator of the receptor, MPA appears to act as a negative allosteric modulator. Whereas the reduced metabolites of progesterone enhance binding of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam to the GABAA receptor in vitro, MPA can partially inhibit the binding of flunitrazepam by up to 40% with half-maximal inhibition at 1 μM. However, the concentrations of MPA required for inhibition are high relative to therapeutic concentrations, and hence, this action is probably of little or no clinical relevance. The lack of potentiation of the GABAA receptor by MPA or its metabolites is surprising in consideration of the apparent anticonvulsant and anesthetic effects of MPA described above, and they remain unexplained. Clinical studies using massive dosages of up to 5,000 mg/day oral MPA and 2,000 mg/day intramuscular MPA for 30 days in women with advanced breast cancer have reported ""no relevant side effects"", which suggests that MPA has no meaningful direct action on the GABAA receptor in humans even at extremely high dosages. ==== Appetite stimulation ==== Although MPA and the closely related medication megestrol acetate are effective appetite stimulants at very high dosages, the mechanism of action of their beneficial effects on appetite is not entirely clear. However, glucocorticoid, cytokine, and possibly anabolic-related mechanisms are all thought to possibly be involved, and a number of downstream changes have been implicated, including stimulation of the release of neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus, modulation of calcium channels in the ventromedial hypothalamus, and inhibition of the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, actions that have all been linked to an increase in appetite. ==== Other activity ==== MPA weakly stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins are also active in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone, dydrogesterone, and other progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone in clinical studies. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Surprisingly few studies have been conducted on the pharmacokinetics of MPA at postmenopausal replacement dosages. The bioavailability of MPA with oral administration is approximately 100%. A single oral dose of 10 mg MPA has been found to result in peak MPA levels of 1.2 to 5.2 ng/mL within 2 hours of administration using radioimmunoassay. Following this, levels of MPA decreased to 0.09 to 0.35 ng/mL 12 hours post-administration. In another study, peak levels of MPA were 3.4 to 4.4 ng/mL within 1 to 4 hours of administration of 10 mg oral MPA using radioimmunoassay. Subsequently, MPA levels fell to 0.3 to 0.6 ng/mL 24 hours after administration. In a third study, MPA levels were 4.2 to 4.4 ng/mL after an oral dose of 5 mg MPA and 6.0 ng/mL after an oral dose of 10 mg MPA, both using radioimmunoassay as well. Treatment of postmenopausal women with 2.5 or 5 mg/day MPA in combination with estradiol valerate for two weeks has been found to rapidly increase circulating MPA levels, with steady-state concentrations achieved after three days and peak concentrations occurring 1.5 to 2 hours after ingestion. With 2.5 mg/day MPA, levels of the medication were 0.3 ng/mL (0.8 nmol/L) in women under 60 years of age and 0.45 ng/mL (1.2 nmol/L) in women 65 years of age or over, and with 5 mg/day MPA, levels were 0.6 ng/mL (1.6 nmol/L) in women under 60 years of age and in women 65 years of age or over. Hence, area-under-curve levels of the medication were 1.6 to 1.8 times higher in those who were 65 years of age or older relative to those who were 60 years of age or younger. As such, levels of MPA have been found to vary with age, and MPA may have an increased risk of side effects in elderly postmenopausal women. This study assessed MPA levels using liquid-chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), a more accurate method of blood determinations. Oral MPA tablets can be administered sublingually instead of orally. Rectal administration of MPA has also been studied. With intramuscular administration of 150 mg microcrystalline MPA in aqueous suspension, the medication is detectable in the circulation within 30 minutes, serum concentrations vary but generally plateau at 1.0 ng/mL (2.6 nmol/L) for 3 months. Following this, there is a gradual decline in MPA levels, and the medication can be detected in the circulation for as long as 6 to 9 months post-injection. The particle size of MPA crystals significantly influences its rate of absorption into the body from the local tissue depot when used as a microcrystalline aqueous suspension via intramuscular injection. Smaller crystals dissolve faster and are absorbed more rapidly, resulting in a shorter duration of action. Particle sizes can differ between different formulations of MPA, potentially influencing clinical efficacy and tolerability. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of MPA is 88%. It is weakly bound to albumin and is not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin. ==== Metabolism ==== The elimination half-life of MPA via oral administration has been reported as both 11.6 to 16.6 hours and 33 hours, whereas the elimination half-lives with intramuscular and subcutaneous injection of microcrystalline MPA in aqueous suspension are 50 and 40 days, respectively. The metabolism of MPA is mainly via hydroxylation, including at positions C6β, C21, C2β, and C1β, mediated primarily via CYP3A4, but 3- and 5-dihydro and 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of MPA are also formed. Deacetylation of MPA and its metabolites (into, e.g., medroxyprogesterone) has been observed to occur in non-human primate research to a substantial extent as well (30 to 70%). MPA and/or its metabolites are also metabolized via conjugation. The C6α methyl and C17α acetoxy groups of MPA make it more resistant to metabolism and allow for greater bioavailability than oral progesterone. ==== Elimination ==== MPA is eliminated 20 to 50% in urine and 5 to 10% in feces following intravenous administration. Less than 3% of a dose is excreted in unconjugated form. ==== Level–effect relationships ==== With intramuscular administration, the high levels of MPA in the blood inhibit luteinizing hormone and ovulation for several months, with an accompanying decrease in serum progesterone to below 0.4 ng/mL. Ovulation resumes when once blood levels of MPA fall below 0.1 ng/mL. Serum estradiol remains at approximately 50 pg/mL for approximately four months post-injection (with a range of 10–92 pg/mL after several years of use), rising once MPA levels fall below 0.5 ng/mL. Hot flashes are rare while MPA is found at significant blood levels in the body, and the vaginal lining remains moist and creased. The endometrium undergoes atrophy, with small, straight glands and a stroma that is decidualized. Cervical mucus remains viscous. Because of its steady blood levels over the long term and multiple effects that prevent fertilization, MPA is a very effective means of birth control. ==== Time–concentration curves ==== == Chemistry == MPA is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. Specifically, it is the 17α-acetate ester of medroxyprogesterone or the 6α-methylated analogue of hydroxyprogesterone acetate. MPA is known chemically as 6α-methyl-17α-acetoxyprogesterone or as 6α-methyl-17α-acetoxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, and its generic name is a contraction of 6α-methyl-17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate. MPA is closely related to other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, as well as to medrogestone and nomegestrol acetate. 9α-fluoromedroxyprogesterone acetate (FMPA), the C9α fluoro analogue of MPA and an angiogenesis inhibitor with two orders of magnitude greater potency in comparison to MPA, was investigated for the potential treatment of cancers but was never marketed. == History == MPA was independently discovered in 1956 by Syntex and the Upjohn Company. It was first introduced on 18 June 1959 by Upjohn in the United States under the brand name Provera (2.5, 5, and 10 mg tablets) for the treatment of amenorrhea, metrorrhagia, and recurrent miscarriage. An intramuscular formulation of MPA, now known as DMPA (400 mg/mL MPA), was also introduced, under the brand name brand name Depo-Provera, in 1960 in the U.S. for the treatment of endometrial and renal cancer. MPA in combination with ethinylestradiol was introduced in 1964 by Upjohn in the U.S. under the brand name Provest (10 mg MPA and 50 μg ethinylestradiol tablets) as an oral contraceptive, but this formulation was discontinued in 1970. This formulation was marketed by Upjohn outside of the U.S. under the brand names Provestral and Provestrol, while Cyclo-Farlutal (or Ciclofarlutal) and Nogest-S were formulations available outside of the U.S. with a different dosage (5 mg MPA and 50 or 75 μg ethinylestradiol tablets). Following its development in the late 1950s, DMPA was first assessed in clinical trials for use as an injectable contraceptive in 1963. Upjohn sought FDATooltip Food and Drug Administration approval of intramuscular DMPA as a long-acting contraceptive under the brand name Depo-Provera (150 mg/mL MPA) in 1967, but the application was rejected. However, this formulation was successfully introduced in countries outside of the United States for the first time in 1969, and was available in over 90 countries worldwide by 1992. Upjohn attempted to gain FDA approval of DMPA as a contraceptive again in 1978, and yet again in 1983, but both applications failed similarly to the 1967 application. However, in 1992, the medication was finally approved by the FDA, under the brand name Depo-Provera, for use in contraception. A subcutaneous formulation of DMPA was introduced in the United States as a contraceptive under the brand name Depo-SubQ Provera 104 (104 mg/0.65 mL MPA) in December 2004, and subsequently was also approved for the treatment of endometriosis-related pelvic pain. MPA has also been marketed widely throughout the world under numerous other brand names such as Farlutal, Perlutex, and Gestapuran, among others. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Medroxyprogesterone acetate is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip INN, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip BANM, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while medrossiprogesterone is the DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana and médroxyprogestérone the DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française of its free alcohol form. It is also known as 6α-methyl-17α-acetoxyprogesterone (MAP) or 6α-methyl-17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate. === Brand names === MPA is marketed under a large number of brand names throughout the world. Its most major brand names are Provera as oral tablets and Depo-Provera as an aqueous suspension for intramuscular injection. A formulation of MPA as an aqueous suspension for subcutaneous injection is also available in the United States under the brand name Depo-SubQ Provera 104. Other brand names of MPA formulated alone include Farlutal and Sayana for clinical use and Depo-Promone, Perlutex, Promone-E, and Veramix for veterinary use. In addition to single-drug formulations, MPA is marketed in combination with the estrogens CEEs, estradiol, and estradiol valerate. Brand names of MPA in combination with CEEs as oral tablets in different countries include Prempro, Premphase, Premique, Premia, and Premelle. Brand names of MPA in combination with estradiol as oral tablets include Indivina and Tridestra. === Availability === Oral MPA and DMPA are widely available throughout the world. Oral MPA is available both alone and in combination with the estrogens CEEs, estradiol, and estradiol valerate. DMPA is registered for use as a form of birth control in more than 100 countries worldwide. The combination of injected MPA and estradiol cypionate is approved for use as a form of birth control in 18 countries. ==== United States ==== As of November 2016, MPA is available in the United States in the following formulations: Oral pills: Amen, Curretab, Cycrin, Provera – 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg Aqueous suspension for intramuscular injection: Depo-Provera – 150 mg/mL (for contraception), 400 mg/mL (for cancer) Aqueous suspension for subcutaneous injection: Depo-SubQ Provera 104 – 104 mg/0.65 mL (for contraception) It is also available in combination with an estrogen in the following formulations: Oral pills: CEEs and MPA (Prempro, Prempro (Premarin, Cycrin), Premphase (Premarin, Cycrin 14/14), Premphase 14/14, Prempro/Premphase) – 0.3 mg / 1.5 mg; 0.45 mg / 1.5 mg; 0.625 mg / 2.5 mg; 0.625 mg / 5 mg While the following formulations have been discontinued: Oral pills: ethinylestradiol and MPA (Provest) – 50 μg / 10 mg Aqueous suspension for intramuscular injection: estradiol cypionate and MPA (Lunelle) – 5 mg / 25 mg (for contraception) The state of Louisiana permits sex offenders to be given MPA. === Generation === Progestins in birth control pills are sometimes grouped by generation. While the 19-nortestosterone progestins are consistently grouped into generations, the pregnane progestins that are or have been used in birth control pills are typically omitted from such classifications or are grouped simply as ""miscellaneous"" or ""pregnanes"". In any case, based on its date of introduction in such formulations of 1964, MPA could be considered a ""first-generation"" progestin. === Controversy === ==== Outside the United States ==== In 1994, when DMPA was approved in India, India's Economic and Political Weekly reported that ""The FDA finally licensed the drug in 1990 in response to concerns about the population explosion in the third world and the reluctance of third world governments to license a drug not licensed in its originating country."" Some scientists and women's groups in India continue to oppose DMPA. In 2016, India introduced DMPA depo-medroxyprogesterone IM preparation in the public health system. The Canadian Coalition on Depo-Provera, a coalition of women's health professional and advocacy groups, opposed the approval of DMPA in Canada. Since the approval of DMPA in Canada in 1997, a $700 million class-action lawsuit has been filed against Pfizer by users of DMPA who developed osteoporosis. In response, Pfizer argued that it had met its obligation to disclose and discuss the risks of DMPA with the Canadian medical community. Clinical trials for this medication regarding women in Zimbabwe were controversial with regard to human rights abuses and Medical Experimentation in Africa. A controversy erupted in Israel when the government was accused of giving DMPA to Ethiopian immigrants without their consent. Some women claimed they were told it was a vaccination. The Israeli government denied the accusations but instructed the four health maintenance organizations to stop administering DMPA injections to women ""if there is the slightest doubt that they have not understood the implications of the treatment"". ==== United States ==== There was a long, controversial history regarding the approval of DMPA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The original manufacturer, Upjohn, applied repeatedly for approval. FDA advisory committees unanimously recommended approval in 1973, 1975 and 1992, as did the FDA's professional medical staff, but the FDA repeatedly denied approval. Ultimately, on 29 October 1992, the FDA approved DMPA for birth control, which had by then been used by over 30 million women since 1969 and was approved and being used by nearly 9 million women in more than 90 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden, Thailand, New Zealand and Indonesia. Points in the controversy included: Animal testing for carcinogenicity – DMPA caused breast cancer tumors in dogs. Critics of the study claimed that dogs are more sensitive to artificial progesterone, and that the doses were too high to extrapolate to humans. The FDA pointed out that all substances carcinogenic to humans are carcinogenic to animals as well, and that if a substance is not carcinogenic it does not register as a carcinogen at high doses. Levels of DMPA which caused malignant mammary tumors in dogs were equivalent to 25 times the amount of the normal luteal phase progesterone level for dogs. This is lower than the pregnancy level of progesterone for dogs, and is species-specific.DMPA caused endometrial cancer in monkeys – 2 of 12 monkeys tested, the first ever recorded cases of endometrial cancer in rhesus monkeys. However, subsequent studies have shown that in humans, DMPA reduces the risk of endometrial cancer by approximately 80%.Speaking in comparative terms regarding animal studies of carcinogenicity for medications, a member of the FDA's Bureau of Drugs testified at an agency DMPA hearing, ""...Animal data for this drug is more worrisome than any other drug we know of that is to be given to well people."" Cervical cancer in Upjohn/NCI studies. Cervical cancer was found to be increased as high as 9-fold in the first human studies recorded by the manufacturer and the National Cancer Institute. However, numerous larger subsequent studies have shown that DMPA use does not increase the risk of cervical cancer. Coercion and lack of informed consent. Testing or use of DMPA was focused almost exclusively on women in developing countries and poor women in the United States, raising serious questions about coercion and lack of informed consent, particularly for the illiterate and for mentally disabled people, who in some reported cases were given DMPA long-term for reasons of ""menstrual hygiene"", although they were not sexually active. Atlanta/Grady Study – Upjohn studied the effect of DMPA for 11 years in Atlanta, mostly on black women who were receiving public assistance, but did not file any of the required follow-up reports with the FDA. Investigators who eventually visited noted that the studies were disorganized. ""They found that data collection was questionable, consent forms and protocol were absent; that those women whose consent had been obtained at all were not told of possible side effects. Women whose known medical conditions indicated that use of DMPA would endanger their health were given the shot. Several of the women in the study died; some of cancer, but some for other reasons, such as suicide due to depression. Over half the 13,000 women in the study were lost to followup due to sloppy record keeping."" Consequently, no data from this study was usable. WHO Review – In 1992, the WHO presented a review of DMPA in four developing countries to the FDA. The National Women's Health Network and other women's organizations testified at the hearing that the WHO was not objective, as the WHO had already distributed DMPA in developing countries. DMPA was approved for use in United States on the basis of the WHO review of previously submitted evidence from countries such as Thailand, evidence which the FDA had deemed insufficient and too poorly designed for assessment of cancer risk at a prior hearing. The Alan Guttmacher Institute has speculated that United States approval of DMPA may increase its availability and acceptability in developing countries. In 1995, several women's health groups asked the FDA to put a moratorium on DMPA, and to institute standardized informed consent forms. == Research == DMPA was studied by Upjohn for use as a progestogen-only injectable contraceptive in women at a dose of 50 mg once a month but produced poor cycle control and was not marketed for this use at this dosage. A combination of DMPA and polyestradiol phosphate, an estrogen and long-lasting prodrug of estradiol, was studied in women as a combined injectable contraceptive for use by intramuscular injection once every three months. High-dose oral and intramuscular MPA monotherapy has been studied in the treatment of prostate cancer but was found to be inferior to monotherapy with cyproterone acetate or diethylstilbestrol. High-dose oral MPA has been studied in combination with diethylstilbestrol and CEEs as an addition to high-dose estrogen therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer in men, but was not found to provide better effectiveness than diethylstilbestrol alone. DMPA has been studied for use as a potential male hormonal contraceptive in combination with the androgens/anabolic steroids testosterone and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) in men. However, it was never approved for this indication. MPA was investigated by InKine Pharmaceutical, Salix Pharmaceuticals, and the University of Pennsylvania as a potential anti-inflammatory medication for the treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Crohn's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and ulcerative colitis, but did not complete clinical development and was never approved for these indications. It was formulated as an oral medication at very high dosages, and was thought to inhibit the signaling of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, with a mechanism of action that was said to be similar to that of corticosteroids. The formulation of MPA had the tentative brand names Colirest and Hematrol for these indications. MPA has been found to be effective in the treatment of manic symptoms in women with bipolar disorder. == Veterinary use == MPA has been used to reduce aggression and spraying in male cats. It may be particularly useful for controlling such behaviors in neutered male cats. The medication can be administered in cats as an injection once per month. == See also == Conjugated estrogens/medroxyprogesterone acetate Estradiol/medroxyprogesterone acetate Estradiol cypionate/medroxyprogesterone acetate Polyestradiol phosphate/medroxyprogesterone acetate == References ==",Metigestrona,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0033976484555751085), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0015887507470324636), ('ICAL', -1.5020257706055418e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023258375003933907)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.4740770161151886)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The thymic hormone thymopoietin blocks neuromuscular transmission and was proposed (Goldstein, 1974) as a modulator of synaptic conductivity. 2. The cholinergic-induced inactivation of nicotinic receptor reconstituted into asolectin lipid vesicles was studied in the presence and in the absence of thymopentin, a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to positions 32-36 of thymopoietin. 3. The present data show that thymopentin accelerates desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, supporting the aforementioned physiological role proposed for thymopoietin. 4. They also suggest that the hormone itself and/or a yet unidentified hormine-derived peptide fragment may act as an endogenous ligand for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor desensitization. The effects of thymopentin (TP-5) on the cholinergic agonist-induced inactivation of function (desensitization) of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) were explored using two systems, 1) Torpedo californica electroplax nAchR reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and 2) T. californica nAChR expressed, in Xenopus laevis oocytes, from in vitro synthesized RNA transcripts. The pentapeptide did not modify the equilibrium binding of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin, but toxin rate binding assays in the presence of the cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine (Carb) revealed that it shortened the time course of the Carb-induced nAchR transition to the high affinity, desensitized state. Thymopentin (but not thymosins alpha 1 and beta 4) accelerated the slow inactivation of nAchR-mediated 86Rb+ influx, as measured by the first-order decrease in the Carb-induced 86Rb+ transport into the reconstituted vesicles. The decay of the acetylcholine-induced current from Torpedo receptor expressed in oocytes was also accelerated by TP-5. The pentapeptide had no ion channel-blocking or agonist activity of its own and exhibited a requirement for Ca2+ to express its effects. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that TP-5 has a direct effect on the nAChR, resembling that of noncompetitive blockers, as opposed to an indirect mechanism of action via the activation of specific metabolic pathways.",Arg-lys-asp-val-tyr,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006840641610324383), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.39370667934417725), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0190917756408453)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Pyroxamide (suberoyl-3-aminopyridineamide hydroxamic acid) is a new member of this class of compounds that is currently under development as an anticancer agent. We investigated the activity of pyroxamide as an inducer of differentiation and/or apoptosis in transformed cells. Pyroxamide, at micromolar concentrations, induced terminal differentiation in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and caused growth inhibition by cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in MEL, prostate carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, and neuroblastoma cells. Administration of pyroxamide (100 or 200 mg/kg/day) to nude mice at doses that caused little evident toxicity significantly suppressed the growth of s.c. CWR22 prostate cancer xenografts.

2808,"('Midodrine (hydrochloride)', '(¬±)-midodrine (hydrochloride)', 'Midodrine', 'Midodrin', 'Midodrina')",Medical,"Midodrine, sold under the brand names ProAmatine and Orvaten among others, is an antihypotensive medication used to treat orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when standing) and urinary incontinence. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of midodrine include hypertension (high blood pressure), paresthesia, itching, goosebumps, chills, urinary urgency, urinary retention, and urinary frequency. Midodrine is a prodrug of its active metabolite desglymidodrine. This metabolite acts as a selective agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor. This in turn results in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Midodrine was discovered by 1971 and was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1996. == Medical uses == Midodrine is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. It can reduce dizziness and faints by about a third, but can be limited by troublesome goose bumps, skin itch, gastrointestinal discomfort, chills, elevated blood pressure while lying down, and urinary retention. A meta-analysis of clinical trials of midodrine or droxidopa in patients with low blood pressure when standing found that midodrine increased standing blood pressure more than droxidopa but that midodrine but not droxidopa increased the risk of high blood pressure when lying down. Small studies have also shown that midodrine can be used to prevent excessive drops in blood pressure in people requiring dialysis. Midodrine has been used in the complications of cirrhosis. It is also used with octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome; the proposed mechanism is constriction of splanchnic vessels and dilation of renal vasculature. Studies have not been sufficiently well conducted to show a clear place for midodrine. Midodrine is used off-label to increase blood pressure in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) where increased transduction of venous alpha 1 adrenergic receptors increases venous return. === Available forms === Midodrine is available in the form of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg oral tablets. == Contraindications == Midodrine is contraindicated in patients with severe organic heart disease, acute kidney disease, urinary retention, pheochromocytoma or thyrotoxicosis. Midodrine should not be used in patients with persistent and excessive supine hypertension. == Side effects == Headache, feeling of pressure or fullness in the head, vasodilation or flushing face, scalp tingling, confusion or thinking abnormality, dry mouth, anxiety, and rash, among others. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Midodrine is a prodrug which forms the active metabolite, desglymidodrine, which is an α1-adrenergic receptor agonist and exerts its actions via activation of α1-adrenergic receptors of the arteriolar and venous vasculature, producing an increase in vascular tone and elevation of blood pressure. Desglymidodrine does not stimulate cardiac β-adrenergic receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral administration, midodrine is rapidly absorbed. The plasma levels of the prodrug peak after about half an hour, and decline with a half-life of approximately 25 minutes, while the metabolite reaches peak blood concentrations about 1 to 2 hours after a dose of midodrine and has a half-life of about 3 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of midodrine (measured as desglymidodrine) is 93%. Midodrine and desglymidodrine diffuse poorly across the blood–brain barrier and are therefore peripherally selective and are not associated with effects in the central nervous system. Neither midodrine nor desglymidodrine are substrates of monoamine oxidase. == Chemistry == Midodrine, also known as 3,6-dimethoxy-β-hydroxy-N-aminoethanonyl-2-phenylethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine derivative. Midodrine is an odorless, white, crystalline powder, soluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol. Midodrine's experimental log P is -0.5 and its predicted log P ranges from -0.49 to -0.95. The predicted log P of its active metabolite desglymidodrine ranges from -0.01 to 0.15. === Stereochemistry === Midodrine contains a stereocenter and consists of two enantiomers, making it a racemate; i.e., a 1:1 mixture of (R)- and (S)-forms: === Synthesis === Acylation of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene with chloroacetyl chloride gives the chloroketone 2. The halogen is then converted to the amine 3 by any set of standard schemes, and the ketone reduced to an alcohol with borohydride (4). Acylation of the amino group in this last intermediate with chloroacetyl chloride affords the amide 5. The halogen is then displaced with azide and the resulting product 6 reduced catalytically to the glycinamide, midodrine (7). == History == Midodrine was discovered by 1971. It was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996 for the treatment of dysautonomia and orthostatic hypotension. In August 2010, the FDA proposed withdrawing this approval because the manufacturer, Shire plc, failed to complete required studies after the medicine reached the market. In September 2010, the FDA reversed its decision to remove midodrine from the market and allowed it to remain available to patients while Shire plc collected further data regarding the efficacy and safety of the drug. Shire announced on September 22, 2011, that it was withdrawing completely from supplying midodrine. Midodrine remains available as a generic drug. == Society and culture == === Names === Midodrine is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana is midodrina. In the case of the hydrochloride salt, its generic name is midodrine hydrochloride and this is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. The drug is also known by its developmental code names ST-1085 and TS-701.

In June 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted an EU filing application for tasimelteon and in July 2015, the drug was approved in the European Union for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder in totally blind adults, but not in the case of non-24 in sighted people. The most common side effects include headache, somnolence, nausea (feeling sick) and dizziness. == Medical uses == In the United States, tasimelteon capsules are indicated for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder (Non-24) in adults and for the treatment of nighttime sleep disturbances in Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS) in people sixteen years of age and older. Tasimelteon oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of nighttime sleep disturbances in SMS in children from 3 to 15 years of age. In the European Union, tasimelteon capsules are indicated for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder (Non-24) in totally blind adults. The capsule and liquid suspension forms of tasimelteon are not interchangeable. Tasimelteon is a selective agonist for the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, similar to other members of the melatonin receptor agonist class of which ramelteon (2005), melatonin (2007), and agomelatine (2009) were the first approved. As a treatment for N24HSWD, as with melatonin or other melatonin derivatives, the patient may experience improved sleep timing while taking the drug. Reversion to baseline sleep performance occurs within a month of discontinuation. == Development == Tasimelteon (previously known as BMS-214,778) was developed for the treatment of insomnia and other sleep disorders. A phase II trial on circadian rhythm sleep disorders was concluded in March 2005. A phase III insomnia trial was conducted in 2006. A second phase III trial on insomnia, this time concerning primary insomnia, was completed in June 2008. In 2010, the FDA granted orphan drug status to tasimelteon, then regarded as an investigational medication, for use in totally blind adults with N24HSWD. (Through mechanisms such as easing the approval process and extending exclusivity periods, orphan drug status encourages development of drugs for rare conditions that otherwise might lack sufficient commercial incentive.) On completion of Phase III trials, interpretations of the clinical trials by the research team concluded that the drug may have therapeutic potential for transient insomnia in circadian rhythm sleep disorders. A year-long (2011–2012) study at Harvard tested the use of tasimelteon in blind subjects with non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. The drug has not been tested in children nor in any non-blind people. == FDA approval == In May 2013, Vanda Pharmaceuticals submitted a New Drug Application to the Food and Drug Administration for tasimelteon for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder in totally blind people. It was approved by the FDA on January 31, 2014, under the brand name Hetlioz. In the opinion of Public Citizen, an advocacy group, the FDA erroneously allowed it to be labelled without stating that it is only approved for use by totally blind people. However, FDA updated its press release on Oct. 2, 2014 to clarify the approved use of Hetlioz, which includes both sighted and blind individuals.

It has never been marketed or used outside clinical trials. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Avasimibe is a potent activator of the pregnane X receptor and, consequently, an indirect inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, as well as a potent inhibitor of several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19; its spectrum of CYP induction and inhibition is similar to that of rifampicin. === Pharmacokinetics === Avasimibe is better absorbed when taken with food, especially with a high-fat meal, as reflected by increases in its peak serum concentration and AUC. == History == Avasimibe was the result of a rational drug design process carried out at Parke-Davis in the early 1990s which sought to obtain orally bioavailable, water-soluble ACAT inhibitors; all such inhibitors known at the time were lipophilic and poorly absorbed when taken by mouth. This process yielded several compounds with potential, including one (designated PD 138142-15) with good solubility in water and remarkable efficacy in animal studies, but it was chemically unstable and degraded rapidly, especially in acidic environments. (Undesirable CYP450 induction was first noted at this time, in PD 138142-15 and its degradation products.) Chemical modification of PD 138142-15 and retrosynthetic analysis found that avasimibe (then codenamed CI-1011) could be easily manufactured from commercially available starting compounds, and once its efficacy was demonstrated in vitro and in rat studies, it was selected for further development. After additional safety and preclinical efficacy studies in animals, phase I clinical trials in humans began in 1997, first for hyperlipidemia (June) and subsequently for atherosclerosis (December). Phase II trials for both indications followed in 1998, and phase III trials in 2001. In October 2003, clinical development of avasimibe was discontinued. Later research discredited the concept of ACAT inhibition as a treatment for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis, and interest in these compounds as a class waned accordingly. == Research == Since the termination of its development as an antilipidemic agent, there has been renewed interest in potential repurposing of avasimibe as an antitumor drug and to prevent or treat bacterial infections by decreasing bacterial virulence. As of 2022, these potential indications remain in preclinical research. == References ==",Avasimibe,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0002108118060277775)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008898589294403791), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0620092935860157)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avasimibe,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11427213/,https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/824a651ca0bc41d3a3d79c65f5515183 ', [])"

It is available in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, and was approved for sale in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 30, 2007. == Medical uses == Lanreotide is used in the treatment of acromegaly, due to both pituitary and non-pituitary growth hormone-secreting tumors, and the management of symptoms caused by neuroendocrine tumors, particularly carcinoid tumors and VIPomas. In the United States and Canada, lanreotide is only indicated for the treatment of acromegaly. In the United Kingdom, it is also indicated in the treatment of thyrotrophic adenoma, a rare tumor of the pituitary gland which secretes TSH. Lanreotide also shows activity against non-endocrine tumors, and, along with other somatostatin analogues, is being studied as a possible general antitumor agent. In December 2014, the US FDA approved lanreotide for the treatment of people with unresectable, well or moderately differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). It is used for polycystic liver disease. It has also been shown that it reduces the volume by 264mls on average. == Side effects == The main side effects of lanreotide treatment are mild to moderate pain at the injection site and gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Isolated cases of gallstone formation have been associated with use of lanreotide, particularly over long periods of time. == Pharmacology == Lanreotide is a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, a naturally occurring inhibitory hormone which blocks the release of several other hormones, including growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin and glucagon. Lanreotide binds to the same receptors as somatostatin, although with higher affinity to peripheral receptors, and has similar activity. However, while somatostatin is quickly broken down in the body (within minutes), lanreotide has a much longer half-life, and produces far more prolonged effects. == Formulations == Lanreotide is available in two formulations: a sustained release formulation (sold under the trade name 'Somatuline LA'), which is injected intramuscularly every ten or fourteen days, and an extended release formulation (UK trade name 'Somatuline Autogel', or 'Somatuline Depot' in the US), which is administered subcutaneously once a month. == Self-assembling properties == Lanreotide has been shown to spontaneously self-assemble into monodisperse nanotubes of 24.4 nm diameter and has been thereafter used as a fruitful and versatile model system in several biophysical studies. == References ==",Lanreotide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.07287787614041e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002714027068577707)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanreotide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='Lanreotide', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanreotide?utm_source=openai')])"

It is also included in combination medications, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, tezacaftor/ivacaftor, and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor which are used to treat people with cystic fibrosis. Ivacaftor was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and is the first medication that treats the underlying cause rather than the symptoms of the disease. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2012. It is one of the most expensive drugs, costing over US$300,000 per year, which has led to criticism of the high cost. The combination drug lumacaftor/ivacaftor was approved by the FDA in July 2015. Cystic fibrosis is caused by any one of several defects in the CFTR protein, which regulates fluid flow within cells and affects the components of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. One such defect is the G551D mutation, in which the amino acid glycine (G) in position 551 is replaced with aspartic acid (D). G551D is characterized by a dysfunctional CFTR protein on the cell surface. In the case of G551D, the protein is trafficked to the correct area, the epithelial cell surface, but once there the protein cannot transport chloride through the channel. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, improves the transport of chloride through the ion channel by binding to the channels directly to induce a non-conventional mode of gating which in turn increases the probability that the channel is open. == Medical uses == Ivacaftor is used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in people having one of several specific mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein: E56K, G178R, S549R, K1060T, G1244E, P67L, E193K, G551D, A1067T, S1251N, R74W, L206W, G551S, G1069R, S1255P, D110E, R347H, D579G, R1070Q, D1270N, D110H, R352Q, S945L, R1070W, G1349D, R117C, A455E, S977F, F1074L, R117H, S549N, F1052V, D1152H. Ivacaftor is also included in a combination product, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, in a single pill, which is used to treat people with cystic fibrosis who have the F508del mutation in CFTR. Ivacaftor is also included in the combination product tezacaftor/ivacaftor with ivacaftor sold as Symdeko and as Symkevi. Symdeko is indicated to treat people aged six and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in CFTR. Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged twelve years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and have one of the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272 26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. Ivacaftor is available in a combination product with elexacaftor and tezacaftor called Trikafta for the treatment of people with cystic fibrosis who have the F508del mutation or other mutations. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients who received ivacaftor in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase III studies were abdominal pain (15.6% versus 12.5% on placebo), diarrhoea (12.8% versus 9.6% on placebo), dizziness (9.2% versus 1.0% on placebo), rash (12.8% versus 6.7% on placebo), upper respiratory tract reactions (including upper respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion, pharyngeal erythema, oropharyngeal pain, rhinitis, sinus congestion, and nasopharyngitis) (63.3% versus 50.0% on placebo), headache (23.9% versus 16.3% on placebo) and bacteria in sputum (7.3% versus 3.8% on placebo). One patient in the ivacaftor group reported a serious adverse reaction: abdominal pain. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ivacaftor is a ""potentiator"" of CFTR, meaning it increases the probability that the defective channel will be open and allow chloride ions pass through the channel pore. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Distribution ==== Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells. ==== Biotransformation ==== Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active. ==== Elimination ==== Following oral administration, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for approximately 65% of total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (±SD) of CL/F for the 150 mg dose was 17.3 (8.4) L/h in healthy subjects at steady state. == History == Ivacaftor was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and is the first medication that treats the underlying cause rather than the symptoms of the disease. == Society and culture == === Legal status === The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ivacaftor in January 2012, Soon afterwards so too did the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Canada and across some European countries. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was approved by the FDA in July 2015, under breakthrough therapy status and under a priority review. === Economics === It is one of the most expensive drugs, costing over US$300,000 per year, which has led to criticism of the high cost. The cost of ivacaftor is US$311,000 per year, roughly similar to the price of other medications for extremely rare diseases. In the first nine months of its second year on the market (2014), ivacaftor sales were $339M, representing 54% of Vertex's product sales revenue. During the same period, total drug development expenses were $458M, most of which was spent on cystic fibrosis-related research. An editorial in JAMA called the price of ivacaftor ""exorbitant"", citing the support by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in its development and the contribution made by fundamental scientific research performed by the National Institutes of Health and relied upon by Vertex in its cystic fibrosis drug discovery programs. The company responded in an email that ""while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."" The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare for people with cystic fibrosis, provided $150 million of the funding for the development for ivacaftor in exchange for royalty rights in the event that the medication was successfully developed and commercialized. In 2014, the Foundation sold these royalty rights for $3.3 billion. The Foundation has stated that it intends to spend these funds in support of further research. Vertex said it would make the medication available free to patients in the United States with no insurance and a household income of under $150,000. In 2012, 24 US doctors and researchers involved in the development of the medication wrote to Vertex to protest the price of the medication, which had been set at about $300,000 per year. In the UK, the company provided the medication free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000 —well above the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence thresholds. The medication was not covered under the Ontario Drug Benefit plan until June 2014, when the Government of Ontario and the manufacturer negotiated for what ""Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews had called a ""fair price"" for taxpayers"". The negotiations took 16 months and it was estimated that around 20 Ontarians required the medication at the time. The province of Alberta began covering the medication in July 2014, and in September the province of Saskatchewan became the third province to include it in its provincial medication plan. Delay in agreement on a price for Vertex to charge national health plans led to patient group protests in Wales, England, and Australia. As of March 2016, the combination medication Orkambi cost $259,000 a year in the United States. == Research == The clinical trials used in the regulatory approval of ivacaftor are described here. === G551D mutation === Of the approximately 70,000 cases of cystic fibrosis worldwide, 4% (~3,000) are due to a mutation called G551D. The safety and efficacy of ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients with this mutation was examined in two clinical trials. The first trial was performed in adults having baseline respiratory function (FEV1) between 32% and 98% of normal for persons of similar age, height, and weight. The baseline average was 64%. Improvement in FEV1 was rapid and sustained. At the end of 48 weeks, people treated with ivacaftor had on average an absolute increase in FEV1 of 10.4%, vs. a decline of 0.2% in the placebo group. Pulmonary exacerbations were reduced by about half in the ivacaftor group relative to the placebo group. In a second trial conducted in children age six to 11, the average improvement in FEV1 was an absolute increase of 12.5% in the ivacaftor group at 48 weeks, compared to a very slight decline in the placebo group. === Other mutations === A third clinical trial examined the efficacy of ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis due to G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R mutations. This trial, which included 39 people of age greater than six years, used a crossover design. The people in the trial had FEV1 averaging 78% of normal at baseline. The people in the trial were randomized to receive either ivacaftor or placebo for eight weeks. This was followed by a four to eight week washout period, then each group received the opposite treatment from what it received in the first part of the trial. At week 8, the people on treatment with ivacaftor experienced an average absolute improvement in FEV1 of 13.8%, but there was a strong dependence of the efficacy on the exact mutation that a patient had. The detailed data for different mutation types is shown in the U.S. package insert. == References == == External links == ""Ivacaftor"". Drug Information Portal. U.S. National Library of Medicine.

2818,"('Mildronate', 'Meldonium', 'Quaterin', 'Kvaterin', 'Meldonium [inn]')",Medical,"Meldonium (INN; trade name Mildronate, among others) is a pharmaceutical developed in 1970 by Ivars Kalviņš at the USSR Latvia Institute of Organic Synthesis. It is now manufactured by the Latvian pharmaceutical company Grindeks and various generic producers. Primarily distributed in Eastern Europe, meldonium is used as an anti-ischemia medication. Meldonium is prescribed for cardiovascular, neurological, and metabolic conditions due to its anti-ischaemic and cardioprotective effects, achieved by inhibiting β-oxidation and activating glycolysis. Athletes have used meldonium to enhance recovery and (controversially) performance, though these claims lack robust scientific support. Since 1 January 2016, meldonium has been listed as a banned substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). It functions as a metabolic modulator, altering enzymatic reactions in the body. While some athletes, including Maria Sharapova, used meldonium before its ban, its effectiveness as a performance enhancer remains controversial. Numerous athletes have since been suspended or disqualified for its use. == Medical uses == Meldonium, also known as Mildronate in Eastern Europe is primarily used for treating cardiovascular and neurological conditions. It is prescribed for heart-related issues such as angina pectoris, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. In some countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, meldonium is used to treat problems with brain circulation and has been reported to elevate mood and improve motor symptoms, dizziness, and nausea. === Available forms === Meldonium is available in various pharmaceutical forms to suit different medical needs and administration routes. The most common form is oral capsules, typically containing 250 mg or 500 mg of the active ingredient. For more rapid onset of action or in cases where oral administration is not feasible, meldonium is also produced as a solution for injection. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The mechanism of action of meldonium is to act as a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor, presumably by inhibiting enzymes in the carnitine biosynthesis pathway such as γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase. Although initial reports suggested meldonium is a non-competitive and non-hydroxylatable analogue of gamma-butyrobetaine; further studies have identified that meldonium is a substrate for gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase. X-ray crystallographic and in vitro biochemical studies suggest that meldonium binds to the substrate pocket of γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase and acts as an alternative substrate, and therefore a competitive inhibitor. Normally, this enzyme's action on its substrates γ-butyrobetaine and 2-oxoglutarate gives, in the presence of the further substrate oxygen, the products L-carnitine, succinate, and carbon dioxide; in the presence of this alternate substrate, the reaction yields malonic acid semialdehyde, formaldehyde (akin to the action of histone demethylases), dimethylamine, and (1-methylimidazolidin-4-yl)acetic acid, ""an unexpected product with an additional carbon-carbon bond resulting from N-demethylation coupled to oxidative rearrangement, likely via an unusual radical mechanism."" The unusual mechanism is thought likely to involve a Steven's type rearrangement. Meldonium's inhibition of γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase gives a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 62 micromolar, which other study authors have described as ""potent."" Meldonium is an example of an inhibitor that acts as a non-peptidyl substrate mimic. === Biochemistry === To ensure a continuous guarantee of energy supply, the cell's energy-producing mitochondria oxidise considerable amounts of fat along with glucose. Carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol of the cell into the mitochondrion and is therefore essential for fatty acid oxidation (known as beta oxidation). Carnitine is mainly absorbed from the diet, but can be formed through biosynthesis. To produce carnitine, lysine residues are methylated to trimethyllysine. Four enzymes are involved in the conversion of trimethyllysine and its intermediate forms into the final product of carnitine. The last of these 4 enzymes is gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase (GBB), which hydroxylates butyrobetaine into carnitine. The main cardioprotective effects of meldonium are mediated by the inhibition of GBB. By subsequently inhibiting carnitine biosynthesis, fatty acid transport is reduced and the accumulation of cytotoxic intermediate products of fatty acid beta-oxidation in ischemic tissues to produce energy is prevented, therefore blocking this oxygen-consuming process. Treatment with meldonium may shift the myocardial energy metabolism from fatty acid oxidation to the more favorable oxidation of glucose, or glycolysis, under conditions where oxygen is limited. In fatty acid metabolism, long chain fatty acids in the cytosol cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane because they are negatively charged. The process in which they move into the mitochondria is called the carnitine shuttle. Long chain FA are first activated via esterification with coenzyme A to produce a fatty acid-coA complex which can then cross the external mitochondrial border. The co-A is then exchanged with carnitine (via the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I) to produce a fatty acid-carnitine complex. This complex is then transported through the inner mitochondrial membrane via a transporter protein called carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. Once inside, carnitine is liberated (catalysed by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase II) and transported back outside so the process can occur again. Acylcarnitines like palmitoylcarnitine are produced as intermediate products of the carnitine shuttle. In the mitochondria themselves, meldonium also competitively inhibits the carnitine shuttle protein SLC22A5. This results in reduced transportation and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria (this burden is shifted more to peroxisomes). The final effect is a decreased risk of mitochondrial injury from fatty acid oxidation and a reduction of the production of acylcarnitines, which has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance. == Chemistry == The chemical name of meldonium is 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydraziniumyl) propionate. It is a structural analogue of γ-butyrobetaine, with an amino group replacing the C-4 methylene of γ-butyrobetaine. γ-Butyrobetaine is a precursor in the biosynthesis of carnitine. Meldonium is a white crystalline powder, with a melting point of 87 °C (189 °F). == Society and culture == === Doping === Meldonium was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of banned substances effective 1 January 2016 because of evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance. It was on the 2015 WADA's list of drugs to be monitored. A high prevalence of meldonium use by athletes in sport was demonstrated by the laboratory findings at the Baku 2015 European Games. 13 medallists or competition winners were taking meldonium at the time of the Baku Games. Meldonium use was detected in athletes competing in 15 of the 21 sports during the Games. Most of the athletes taking meldonium withheld the information of their use from anti-doping authorities by not declaring it on their doping control forms as they should have. Only 23 of the 662 (3.5%) athletes tested declared the personal use of meldonium. However, 66 of the total 762 (8.7%) of athlete urine samples analysed during the Games and during pre-competition tested positive for meldonium. WADA classes the drug as a metabolic modulator, just as it does insulin. Metabolic modulators are classified as S4 substances according to the WADA banned substances list. These substances have the ability to modify how some hormones accelerate or slow down different enzymatic reactions in the body. In this way, these modulators can block the body's conversion of testosterone into oestrogen, which is necessary for females. On 13 April 2016 it was reported that WADA had issued updated guidelines allowing less than 1 microgram per milliliter of meldonium for tests done before 1 March 2016. The agency cited that ""preliminary tests showed that it could take weeks or months for the drug to leave the body"". ==== Affected athletes ==== On 7 March 2016, former world number one tennis player Maria Sharapova announced that she had failed a drug test in Australia due to the detection of meldonium. She said that she had been taking the drug for ten years for various health issues, and had not noticed that it had been banned. On 8 June 2016, she was suspended from playing tennis for two years by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), which was reduced to 15 months by Court of Arbitration for Sport after appeal. Earlier the same year (March 7), Russian ice dancer Ekaterina Bobrova announced that she had also tested positive for meldonium at the 2016 European Figure Skating Championships. Bobrova said she was shocked about the test result, because she had been made aware of meldonium's addition to the banned list, and had been careful to avoid products containing banned substances. In May 2016, Russian professional boxer Alexander Povetkin—a former two-time World Boxing Association (WBA) Heavyweight Champion—tested positive for meldonium. This was discovered just a week prior to his mandatory title match against World Boxing Council (WBC) Heavyweight Champion, Deontay Wilder. As a result, the match—scheduled to take place in Russia—was postponed indefinitely by the WBC. Other athletes who are provisionally banned for using meldonium include UFC flyweight Liliya Shakirova, Ethiopian-Swedish middle-distance runner Abeba Aregawi, Ethiopian long-distance runner Endeshaw Negesse, Russian cyclist Eduard Vorganov, and Ukrainian biathletes Olga Abramova and Artem Tyshchenko. The Ice Hockey Federation of Russia replaced the Russia men's national under-18 ice hockey team with an under-17 team for the 2016 IIHF World U18 Championships after players on the original roster tested positive for meldonium. More than 170 failed tests by athletes were identified in a relatively brief period after the ban on meldonium was imposed on 1 January 2016. Many of the early cases were dropped when athletes claimed that they had ceased use in 2015. Notable athletes with positive samples include: In addition it was reported that five Georgian wrestlers and a German wrestler had tested positive for the drug although no further names were released. On 25 March 2016 the Fédération Internationale de Sambo confirmed that four wrestlers under their governance (two from Russia and two from other countries) had recorded positive tests for the drug. ==== Debates ==== A December 2015 study in the journal Drug Testing and Analysis argued that meldonium ""demonstrates an increase in endurance performance of athletes, improved rehabilitation after exercise, protection against stress, and enhanced activation of central nervous system (CNS) functions"". However the study itself presents no evidence for this claim, though it cited other studies that show performance enhancing effects, and focuses instead on describing two approaches for the reliable identification of meldonium. The manufacturer, Grindeks, said in a statement that it did not believe meldonium's use should be banned for athletes. It said the drug worked mainly by reducing damage to cells that can be caused by certain byproducts of carnitine. Meldonium ""is used to prevent death of ischemic cells and not to increase performance of normal cells"", the statement said. ""Meldonium cannot improve athletic performance, but it can stop tissue damage in the case of ischemia"", the lack of blood flow to an area of the body. The drug was invented in the mid-1970s at the Institute of Organic Synthesis of the Latvian SSR Academy of Sciences by Ivars Kalviņš. Kalviņš criticized the ban, saying that WADA had not presented scientific proof that the drug can be used for doping. According to him, meldonium does not enhance athletic performance in any way, and was rather used by athletes to prevent damage to the heart and muscles caused by lack of oxygen during high-intensity exercise. He contended that not allowing athletes to take care of their health was a violation of their human rights, and that the decision aimed to remove Eastern European athletes from competitions and his drug from the pharmaceutical market. Liene Kozlovska, the former head of the anti-doping department of the Latvian sports medicine center, rejected claims that the ban is in violation of athletes' rights, saying that meldonium is dangerous in high doses, and should only be used under medical supervision to treat genuine health conditions. She also speculated that Russian athletes may not have received adequate warnings that the drug was banned – due to the suspension of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in late 2015. Forbes reported that anesthesiology professor Michael Joyner, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who studies how humans respond to physical and mental stress during exercise and other activities, told them that ""Evidence is lacking for many compounds believed to enhance athletic performance. Its use has a sort of urban legend element and there is not much out there that it is clearly that effective. I would be shocked if this stuff [meldonium] had an effect greater than caffeine or creatine (a natural substance that, when taken as a supplement, is thought to enhance muscle mass)."" Ford Vox, a U.S.-based physician specializing in rehabilitation medicine and a journalist reported ""there's not much scientific support for its use as an athletic enhancer"". Don Catlin, a long-time anti-doping expert and the scientific director of the Banned Substances Control Group (BSCG) said ""There's really no evidence that there's any performance enhancement from meldonium – Zero percent"". === Approval status === Meldonium, which is not approved by the FDA in the United States, is registered and prescribed in Latvia, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Moldova, Lithuania, Albania, and Kyrgyzstan. === Economics === Meldonium is manufactured by Grindeks, a Latvian pharmaceutical company, with offices in thirteen Eastern European countries as a treatment for heart conditions. The company identifies it as one of their main products. It had sales of 65 million euros in 2013. == See also == List of Russian drugs == References ==",Meldonium,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.682172998902388e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16023507714271545)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.3868713676929474), (' INDUSTR', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meldonium?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Meldonium', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meldonium?utm_source=openai')])"

It also known by the generic name talfirastide (development name TXA127). In 1988, Santos et al demonstrated that angiotensin (1-7) was a main product of the incubation of angiotensin I with brain micropunch biopsies and Schiavone et al reported the first biological effect of this heptapeptide. Benter et al were the first to report that Ang-(1-7) behaves in a way opposite to that of Ang II and that intavenous administration of Ang-(1-7) produces blood pressure lowering effects by activating its own receptor Angiotensin (1-7) is a vasodilator agent affecting cardiovascular organs, such as heart, blood vessels and kidneys, with functions frequently opposed to those attributed to the major effector component of the RAS, angiotensin II (Ang II). == Synthesis == The polypeptide Ang I can be converted into Ang (1-7) by the actions of neprilysin (NEP) and thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) enzymes. Also, Ang II can be hydrolyzed into Ang (1-7) through the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Ang (1-7) binds and activates the G-protein coupled receptor Mas receptor leading to opposite effects of those of Ang II. === Possible pathways === Action of neprilysin on angiotensin I or angiotensin II. Action of prolyl endopeptidase on angiotensin I. Action of ACE on angiotensin 1-9. Action of neprilysin on angiotensin 1-9. Action of ACE2 on angiotensin II. == Effects == Ang (1-7) has been shown to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. It helps protect cardiomyocytes of spontaneously hypertensive rats by increasing the expression of endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase enzymes, augmenting production of nitric oxide. == Pharmacological interactions == Ang (1-7) contributes to the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor type 1 antagonists. == Clinical trials == Talfirastide has been tested in people with COVID-19 and stroke. == References ==",Angiotensin (1-7),WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.5760796666145325), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -9.088346359931165e-07), (' MED', -3.8889261304575484e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.5301021337509155), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -7.939023635117337e-05), ('ĠEND', -3.4927710657939315e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004430027911439538)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.004078997299075127), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.03804171830415726), (' MED', -0.0005530327325686812), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_%281-7%29 ', [])"
2820,"('Nitrendipine', 'Bayotensin', 'Baypress', 'Nidrel', 'Nitrendipinum')",Medical,"Nitrendipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It is used in the treatment of primary (essential) hypertension to decrease blood pressure and can reduce the cardiotoxicity of cocaine. It was patented in 1971 and approved for medical use in 1985. == Medical uses == Nitrendipine is given to hypertensive individuals in 20 mg oral tablets every day. This amount is effective in reducing blood pressure by 15–20% within 1–2 hours of administration. With long-term treatments, the dosage may rise to as much as 40 mg/day; in elderly individuals, a lower dosage of up to 5 mg/day may be equally effective (this reduction in drug amount is attributed to decreased liver function or “first pass” metabolism). Once digested, nitrendipine is absorbed into the blood and binds to plasma proteins. The majority (98%) is bound to plasma proteins and 70-80% of its inactive polar metabolites are also bound to plasma proteins. Following hepatic metabolism, 80% of the 20 mg dose can be recovered in the first 96 hours as inactive polar metabolites. The specific volume of distribution of the drug is 2-6 L/kg. In terms of drug half-life, nitrendipine has a half-life of 12–24 hours. The reported side effects include: headache, flushing, edema and palpitations. These side effects can all be attributed to the vasodilation effect of this drug. == Mechanism of action == Once nitrendipine is ingested, it is absorbed by the gut and metabolized by the liver before it goes into the systemic circulation and reaches the cells of the smooth muscles and cardiac muscle cells. It binds more effectively with L-type calcium channels in smooth muscle cells because of its lower resting membrane potential. The nitrendipine diffuses into the membrane and binds to its high affinity binding site on the inactivated L-type calcium channel that's located in between each of the 4 intermembrane components of the α1 subunit. The exact mechanism of action of nitrendipine is unknown, but it is believed to have important tyrosine and threonine residues in its binding pocket and its binding interferes with the voltage sensor and gating mechanism of the channel. Thought to have a domain-interface model of binding. In hypertension, the binding of nitrendipine causes a decrease in the probability of open L-type calcium channels and reduces the influx of calcium. The reduced levels of calcium prevent smooth muscle contraction within these muscle cells. Prevention of muscle contraction enables smooth muscle dilation. Dilation of the vasculature reduces total peripheral resistance, which decreases the workload on the heart and prevents scarring of the heart or heart failure. Nitrendipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid. == Stereochemistry == Nitrendipine contains a stereocenter and can exist as either of two enantiomers. The pharmaceutical drug is a racemate, an equal mixture of (R)- and the (S)-forms. == References ==",Nidrel,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.030765878036618233), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.007068744860589504)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
2821,"('Niacin', 'Nicotinic acid', 'Vitamin b3', 'Pyridine-3-carboxylic acid', 'Wampocap')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Nicotinic acid, or niacin, is an organic compound and a vitamer of vitamin B3, an essential human nutrient. It is produced by plants and animals from the amino acid tryptophan. Nicotinic acid is also a prescription medication. Amounts far in excess of the recommended dietary intake for vitamin functions will lower blood triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and raise blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, often referred to as ""good"" cholesterol). There are two forms: immediate-release and sustained-release nicotinic acid. Initial prescription amounts are 500 mg/day, increased over time until a therapeutic effect is achieved. Immediate-release doses can be as high as 3,000 mg/day; sustained-release as high as 2,000 mg/day. Despite the proven lipid changes, nicotinic acid has not been found useful for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already prescribed a statin drug. A 2010 review had concluded that nicotinic acid was effective as a mono-therapy, but a 2017 review incorporating twice as many trials concluded that prescription nicotinic acid, while affecting lipid levels, did not reduce all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarctions, nor fatal or non-fatal strokes. Prescription nicotinic acid was shown to cause hepatotoxicity and increase risk of type 2 diabetes. nicotinic acid prescriptions in the U.S. had peaked in 2009 at 9.4 million, declining to 800 thousand by 2020. Nicotinic acid has the formula C6H5NO2 and belongs to the group of the pyridinecarboxylic acids. As the precursor for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, it is involved in DNA repair. == Definition == The term ""niacin"" was originally coined from ""nicotinic acid vitamin"", with the goal of distancing the nutrient from nicotine from tobacco. As a result, it originally referred to the nutritional entity of vitamin B3. However, in American English, the term has also come to mean ""nicotinic acid"" in the context of high-dose use as a prescription medicine. In other varieties of English, the medicine is only ever called ""nicotinic acid"". The term ""nicotinic acid"" unambiguously refers to the substance and the prescription medicine containing it, which treats elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. When used as a drug, daily doses range from 500 to 3,000 mg/day. High-dose nicotinamide does not have this medicinal effect. Vitamin B3 has several vitamers that can act in place of each other, including nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. It is precursor of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). These compounds are coenzymes for many dehydrogenases, participating in many hydrogen transfer processes. NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Vitamin intake recommendations made by several countries are that intakes of 14–18 mg/day are sufficient to meet the needs of healthy adults. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are both used for prevention and treatment of pellagra, a disease caused by lack of the vitamin. == As a dietary supplement == In the United States, nicotinic acid is sold as a non-prescription dietary supplement with a range of 100 to 1000 mg per serving. These products often have a Structure/Function health claim allowed by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA). An example would be ""Supports a healthy blood lipid profile."" The American Heart Association strongly advises against the substitution of dietary supplement nicotinic acid for prescription nicotinic acid because of potentially serious side effects, which means that nicotinic acid should only be used under the supervision of a health care professional, and because manufacture of dietary supplement nicotinic acid is not as well-regulated by the FDA as prescription nicotinic acid. More than 30 mg nicotinic acid consumed as a dietary supplement can cause skin flushing. Face, arms and chest skin turns a reddish color because of vasodilation of small subcutaneous blood vessels, accompanied by sensations of heat, tingling and itching. These signs and symptoms are typically transient, lasting minutes to hours; they are considered unpleasant rather than toxic. == As lipid-modifying medication == Prescription nicotinic acid, commonly labeled as niacin in the United States, is available in immediate-release and slow-release formulations. It is used to treat primary hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia. It is used either as a monotherapy or in combination with other lipid-modifying drugs. Dosages start at 500 mg/day and are often gradually increased to as high as 3000 mg/day for immediate release or 2000 mg/day for slow release (also referred to as sustained release) to achieve the targeted lipid changes (lower LDL-C and triglycerides, and higher HDL-C). Prescriptions in the US peaked in 2009, at 9.4 million and had declined to 800 thousand by 2020. Systematic reviews found no effect of prescription nicotinic acid on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarctions, nor fatal or non-fatal strokes despite raising HDL cholesterol in patients already taking statins. Reported side effects include an increased risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes. === Mechanisms === Nicotinic acid reduces synthesis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), lipoprotein(a) and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The lipid-therapeutic effects of nicotinic acid are partly mediated through the activation of G protein-coupled receptors, including hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2)and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3 (HCA3), which are highly expressed in body fat. HCA2 and HCA3 inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and thus suppress the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from body fat, reducing their availability to the liver to synthesize the blood-circulating lipids in question. A decrease in free fatty acids also suppresses liver expression of apolipoprotein C3 and PPARg coactivator-1b, thus increasing VLDL-C turnover and reducing its production. Nicotinic acid also directly inhibits the action of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) a key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis. The mechanism behind nicotinic acid increasing HDL-C is not totally understood, but seems to occur in various ways. Nicotinic acid increases apolipoprotein A1 levels by inhibiting the breakdown of this protein, which is a component of HDL particles. It also inhibits HDL-C hepatic uptake by suppressing production of the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) gene. It stimulates the ABCA1 transporter in monocytes and macrophages and upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, resulting in reverse cholesterol transport. === Combined with statins === Extended release nicotinic acid was combined with lovastatin (Advicor), and with simvastatin (Simcor), as prescription drug combinations. The combination niacin/lovastatin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. The combination niacin/simvastatin was approved by the FDA in 2008. Subsequently, large outcome trials using these nicotinic acid and statin therapies were unable to demonstrate incremental benefit of nicotinic acid beyond statin therapy alone. The FDA withdrew approval of both drugs in 2016. The reason given: ""Based on the collective evidence from several large cardiovascular outcome trials, the Agency has concluded that the totality of the scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in triglyceride levels and/or increase in HDL-cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events."" The drug company discontinued the drugs. === Contraindications === Prescription immediate release (Niacor) and extended release (Niaspan) nicotinic acid are contraindicated for people with either active or a history of liver disease because both, but especially Niaspan, have been associated with instances of serious, on occasion fatal, liver failure. Both products are contraindicated for people with existing peptic ulcer disease, or other bleeding problems because nicotinic acid lowers platelet count and interferes with blood clotting. Both products are also contraindicated for women who are pregnant or expecting to become pregnant because safety during pregnancy has not been evaluated in human trials. These products are contraindicated for women who are lactating because it is known that nicotinic acid is excreted into human milk, but the amount and potential for adverse effects in the nursing infant are not known. Women are advised to either not nurse their child or discontinue the drug. High-dose nicotinic acid has not been tested or approved for use in children under 16 years. === Adverse effects === The most common adverse effects of medicinal nicotinic acid (500–3000 mg) are flushing (e.g., warmth, redness, itching or tingling) of the face, neck and chest, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, pruritus and rash. These can be minimized by initiating therapy at low dosages, increasing dosage gradually, and avoiding administration on an empty stomach. The acute adverse effects of high-dose nicotinic acid therapy (1–3 grams per day) – which is commonly used in the treatment of hyperlipidemias – can further include hypotension, fatigue, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, heartburn, blurred or impaired vision, and macular edema. With long-term use, the adverse effects of high-dose nicotinic acid therapy (750 mg per day) also include liver failure (associated with fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite), hepatitis, and acute liver failure; these hepatotoxic effects of nicotinic acid occur more often when extended-release dosage forms are used. The long-term use of nicotinic acid at greater than or equal to 2 grams per day also significantly increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, diabetes, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. ==== Flushing ==== Flushing – a short-term dilatation of skin arterioles, causing reddish skin color – usually lasts for about 15 to 30 minutes, although sometimes can persist for weeks. Typically, the face is affected, but the reaction can extend to neck and upper chest. The cause is blood vessel dilation due to elevation in prostaglandin GD2 (PGD2) and serotonin. Flushing was often thought to involve histamine, but histamine has been shown not to be involved in the reaction. Flushing is sometimes accompanied by a prickly or itching sensation, in particular, in areas covered by clothing. Prevention of flushing requires altering or blocking the prostaglandin-mediated pathway. Aspirin taken half an hour before the nicotinic acid prevents flushing, as does ibuprofen. Taking nicotinic acid with meals also helps reduce this side effect. Acquired tolerance will also help reduce flushing; after several weeks of a consistent dose, most people no longer experience flushing. Slow- or ""sustained""-release forms of nicotinic acid have been developed to lessen these side effects. Nicotinamide and inositol nicotinate can be used as no-flush forms of vitamin B3, however the efficacy of the latter is dubious. ==== Liver damage ==== Nicotinic acid in medicinal doses can cause modest elevations in serum transaminase and unconjugated bilirubin, both biomarkers of liver injury. The increases usually resolve even when drug intake is continued. However, less commonly, the sustained release form of the drug can lead to serious hepatotoxicity, with onset in days to weeks. Early symptoms of serious liver damage include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, followed by jaundice and pruritus. The mechanism is thought to be a direct toxicity of elevated serum niacin. Lowering dose or switching to the immediate release form can resolve symptoms. In rare instances the injury is severe, and progresses to liver failure. ==== Diabetes ==== The high doses of nicotinic acid used to treat hyperlipidemia have been shown to elevate fasting blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes. Long-term nicotinic acid therapy was also associated with an increase in the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes. ==== Other adverse effects ==== High doses of nicotinic acid can also cause niacin maculopathy, a thickening of the macula and retina, which leads to blurred vision and blindness. This maculopathy is reversible after niacin intake ceases. Niaspan, the slow-release product, has been associated with a reduction in platelet content and a modest increase in prothrombin time. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Activating HCA2 has effects other than lowering serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations: antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, improved endothelial function and plaque stability, all of which counter development and progression of atherosclerosis. Nicotinic acid inhibits cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Niacin produces a rise in serum unconjugated bilirubin in normal individuals and in those with Gilbert's Syndrome. However, in the Gilbert's Syndrome, the rise in bilirubin is higher and clearance is delayed longer than in normal people. One test used to aid in diagnosing Gilbert's Syndrome involves intravenous administration of nicotinic acid (niacin) in a dose of 50 mg over a period of 30 seconds. === Pharmacokinetics === Both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine. Absorption is facilitated by sodium-dependent diffusion, and at higher intakes, via passive diffusion. Unlike some other vitamins, the percent absorbed does not decrease with increasing dose, so that even at amounts of 3-4 grams, absorption is nearly complete. With a one gram dose, peak plasma concentrations of 15 to 30 μg/mL are reached within 30 to 60 minutes. Approximately 88% of an oral pharmacologic dose is eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged nicotinic acid or nicotinuric acid, its primary metabolite. The plasma elimination half-life of nicotinic acid ranges from 20 to 45 minutes. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are both converted into the coenzyme NAD. NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation in the presence of the enzyme NAD+ kinase. High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency. In the liver, nicotinamide is converted to storage nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). As needed, liver NAD is hydrolyzed to nicotinamide and nicotinic acid for transport to tissues, there reconverted to NAD to serve as an enzyme cofactor. Excess nicotinic acid is methylated in the liver to N1-methylnicotinamide (NMN) and excreted in urine as such or as the oxidized metabolites N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N1-Methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (2PY and 4PY). Decreased urinary content of these metabolites is a measure of niacin deficiency. == Production == === Biosynthesis === In addition to absorbing niacin from diet, nicotinic acid can be synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan, a five-step process with the penultimate compound being quinolinic acid (see figure). Some bacteria and plants utilize aspartic acid in a pathway that also goes to quinolinic acid. For humans, the efficiency of conversion is estimated as requiring 60 mg of tryptophan to make 1 mg of niacin. Riboflavin, vitamin B6 and iron are required for the process. Pellagra is a consequence of a corn-dominant diet because the niacin in corn is poorly bioavailable and corn proteins are low in tryptophan compared to wheat and rice proteins. === Industrial synthesis === Nicotinic acid was first synthesized in 1867 by oxidative degradation of nicotine with potassium chromate and sulfuric acid — this is the origin of the name. Nicotinic acid is prepared by hydrolysis of nicotinonitrile, which, as described above, is generated by oxidation of 3-picoline. Oxidation can be effected by air, but ammoxidation is more efficient. In the latter process, nicotinonitrile is produced by ammoxidation of 3-methylpyridine. Nitrile hydratase is then used to catalyze nicotinonitrile to nicotinamide, which can be sold directly or converted to nicotinic acid. Alternatively, ammonia, acetic acid and paraldehyde are used to make 5-ethyl-2-methyl-pyridine, which is then oxidized to nicotinic acid. New ""greener"" catalysts are being tested using manganese-substituted aluminophosphates that use acetyl peroxyborate as non-corrosive oxidant, avoiding producing nitrogen oxides as do traditional ammoxidations. The demand for commercial production includes for animal feed and for food fortification meant for human consumption. According to Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, worldwide 31,000 tons of nicotinamide were sold in 2014. === Climate impact === The production of nicotinic acid creates nitrous oxide as a by-product, which is a potent greenhouse gas. In 2018, it was discovered that a nicotinic acid factory in Visp, Switzerland, was responsible for around one percent of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Eventually, catalytic scrubbing technology that eliminates most of the emissions was installed in 2021. == Chemistry == This colorless, water-soluble solid is a derivative of pyridine, with a carboxyl group (COOH) at the 3-position. Other forms of vitamin B3 include the corresponding amide nicotinamide, where the carboxyl group has been replaced by a carboxamide group (CONH2). == Preparations == Prescription products can be immediate release (Niacor, 500 mg tablets) or extended release (Niaspan, 500 and 1000 mg tablets). Niaspan has a film coating that delays release of the nicotinic acid, resulting in an absorption over a period of 8–12 hours. This reduces vasodilation and flushing side effects, but increases the risk of hepatotoxicity compared to the immediate release drug. Prescription nicotinic acid preparations in combination with statin drugs (discontinued) are described above. A combination of niacin and laropiprant had been approved for use in Europe and marketed as Tredaptive. Laropiprant is a prostaglandin D2 binding drug shown to reduce niacin-induced vasodilation and flushing side effects. A clinical trial showed no additional efficacy of Tredaptive in lowering cholesterol when used together with other statin drugs, but did show an increase in other side effects. The study resulted in the withdrawal of Tredaptive from the international market. == History == Niacin as a chemical compound was first described by chemist Hugo Weidel in 1873 in his studies of nicotine, but that predated by many years the concept of food components other than protein, fat and carbohydrates that were essential for life. Vitamin nomenclature was initially alphabetical, with Elmer McCollum calling these fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Over time, eight chemically distinct, water-soluble B vitamins were isolated and numbered, with niacin as vitamin B3. Corn (maize) became a staple food in the southeast United States and in parts of Europe. A disease that was characterized by dermatitis of sunlight-exposed skin was described in Spain in 1735 by Gaspar Casal. He attributed the cause to poor diet. In northern Italy it was named ""pellagra"" from the Lombard language (agra = holly-like or serum-like; pell = skin). In time, the disease was more closely linked specifically to corn. In the US, Joseph Goldberger was assigned to study pellagra by the Surgeon General of the United States. His studies confirmed a corn-based diet as the culprit, but he did not identify the root cause. Nicotinic acid was extracted from liver by biochemist Conrad Elvehjem in 1937. He later identified the active ingredient, referring to it as ""pellagra-preventing factor"" and the ""anti-blacktongue factor."" It was also referred to as ""vitamin PP"", ""vitamin P-P"" and ""PP-factor"", all derived from the term ""pellagra-preventive factor"". In the late 1930s, studies by Tom Douglas Spies, Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper confirmed that nicotinic acid cured pellagra in humans. The prevalence of the disease was greatly reduced as a result. Nicotinic acid was initially synthesized by oxidizing nicotine with potassium chromate and sulfuric acid. Hence, in 1942, when flour enrichment with nicotinic acid began, a headline in the popular press said ""Tobacco in Your Bread."" In response, the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association approved of the Food and Nutrition Board's new names niacin and niacin amide for use primarily by non-scientists. It was thought appropriate to choose a name to dissociate nicotinic acid from nicotine, to avoid the perception that vitamins or niacin-rich food contains nicotine, or that cigarettes contain vitamins. The resulting name niacin was derived from nicotinic acid + vitamin. Carpenter found in 1951, that niacin in corn is biologically unavailable, and can be released only in very alkaline lime water of pH 11. This explains why a Latin-American culture that used alkali-treated cornmeal to make tortilla was not at risk for niacin deficiency. The modern explanation is that alkali treatment enhances the bioavailability of tryptophan, not directly for any form of the vitamin.: §5.2 In 1955, Altschul and colleagues described large amounts of nicotinic acid as having a lipid-lowering property. As such, niacin is the oldest known lipid-lowering drug. Lovastatin, the first 'statin' drug, was first marketed in 1987. == Notes == == References ==",Wampocap,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.32203036546707153), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -2.45848218582978e-06), (' END', -0.18044015765190125), ('OG', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ENO', -3.15441757265944e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -9.686778503237292e-05), (' FOOD', -4.1557283111615106e-05), (',', -0.014178205281496048), (' INDUSTR', -0.0010424555512145162), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.08389659225940704), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3249013125896454)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death found in various diseases. Our study aims to investigate the role of ferroptosis and the protective mechanism of Ginsenoside Re in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. In the present study, we treated rats for five days with Ginsenoside Re, then established the myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury rat model to detect molecular implications in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion regulation and to determine the underlying mechanism. This study identifies the mechanism behind ginsenoside Re's effect on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and its regulation of ferroptosis through miR-144-3p. Ginsenoside Re significantly reduced cardiac damage caused by ferroptosis during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and glutathione decline. To determine how Ginsenoside Re regulated ferroptosis, we isolated exosomes from VEGFR2 We demonstrated that ginsenoside Re attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion induced ferroptosis via miR-144-3p/SLC7A11. Ginsenoside Re is a protopanaxatriol-type saponin extracted from the berry, leaf, stem, flower bud, and root of  Myocardial fibrosis (MF) is an advanced pathological manifestation of many cardiovascular diseases, which can induce heart failure and malignant arrhythmias. However, the current treatment of MF lacks specific drugs. Ginsenoside Re has anti-MF effect in rat, but its mechanism is still not clear. Therefore, we investigated the anti-MF effect of ginsenoside Re by constructing mouse acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model and AngⅡ induced cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) model. The anti-MF effect of miR-489 was investigated by transfection of miR-489 mimic and inhibitor in CFs. Effect of ginsenoside Re on MF and its related mechanisms were investigated by ultrasonographic, ELISA, histopathologic staining, transwell test, immunofluorescence, Western blot and qPCR in the mouse model of AMI and the AngⅡ-induced CFs model. MiR-489 decreased the expression of α-SMA, collagenⅠ, collagen Ⅲ and myd88, and inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 in normal CFs and CFs treated with AngⅡ. Ginsenoside Re could improve cardiac function, inhibit collagen deposition and CFs migration, promote the transcription of miR-489, and reduce the expression of myd88 and the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. MiR-489 can effectively inhibit the pathological process of MF, and the mechanism is at least partly related to the regulation of myd88/NF-κB pathway. Ginsenoside Re can ameliorate AMI and AngⅡ induced MF, and the mechanism is at least partially related to the regulation of miR-489/myd88/NF-κB signaling pathway.

2825,"('Acetylcysteine', 'N-acetylcysteine', 'N-acetyl-l-cysteine', 'Mercapturic acid', 'Acetadote')","Food, Medical","N-acetylcysteine, also known as Acetylcysteine and NAC, is a medication that is used to treat paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose and to loosen thick mucus in individuals with chronic bronchopulmonary disorders, such as pneumonia and bronchitis. It has been used to treat lactobezoar in infants. It can be taken intravenously, orally (swallowed by mouth), or inhaled as a mist by use of a nebulizer. It is also sometimes used as a dietary supplement. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting when taken orally. The skin may occasionally become red and itchy with any route of administration. A non-immune type of anaphylaxis may also occur. It appears to be safe in pregnancy. For paracetamol overdose, it works by increasing the level of glutathione, an antioxidant that can neutralize the toxic breakdown products of paracetamol. When inhaled, it acts as a mucolytic by decreasing the thickness of mucus. Acetylcysteine was initially patented in 1960 and came into medical use in 1968. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. The sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine are more easily oxidized than the other amino acids. == Uses == === Medical uses === ==== Paracetamol overdose antidote ==== Intravenous and oral formulations of acetylcysteine are available for the treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. When paracetamol is taken in large quantities, a minor metabolite called N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) accumulates within the body. It is normally conjugated by glutathione, but when taken in excess, the body's glutathione reserves are not sufficient to deactivate the toxic NAPQI. This metabolite is then free to react with key hepatic enzymes, thereby damaging liver cells. This may lead to severe liver damage and even death by acute liver failure. In the treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose, acetylcysteine acts to maintain or replenish depleted glutathione reserves in the liver and enhance non-toxic metabolism of acetaminophen. These actions serve to protect liver cells from NAPQI toxicity. It is most effective in preventing or lessening hepatic injury when administered within 8–10 hours after overdose. Research suggests that the rate of liver toxicity is approximately 3% when acetylcysteine is administered within 10 hours of overdose. Although IV and oral acetylcysteine are equally effective for this indication, oral administration is generally poorly tolerated due to the higher dosing required to overcome its low oral bioavailability, its foul taste and odor, and a higher incidence of adverse effects when taken orally, particularly nausea and vomiting. Prior pharmacokinetic studies of acetylcysteine did not consider acetylation as a reason for the low bioavailability of acetylcysteine. Oral acetylcysteine is identical in bioavailability to cysteine precursors. However, 3% to 6% of people given intravenous acetylcysteine show a severe, anaphylaxis-like allergic reaction, which may include extreme breathing difficulty (due to bronchospasm), a decrease in blood pressure, rash, angioedema, and sometimes also nausea and vomiting. Repeated doses of intravenous acetylcysteine will cause these allergic reactions to progressively worsen in these people. Several studies have found this anaphylaxis-like reaction to occur more often in people given intravenous acetylcysteine despite serum levels of paracetamol not high enough to be considered toxic. ==== Mucolytic agent ==== Acetylcysteine exhibits mucolytic properties, meaning it reduces the viscosity and adhesiveness of mucus. This therapeutic effect is achieved through the cleavage of disulfide bonds within mucoproteins (strongly cross-linked mucins), thereby decreasing the mucus viscosity and facilitating its clearance from the respiratory tract. This mechanism is particularly beneficial in conditions characterized by excessive or thickened mucus, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, rhinitis or sinusitis. Acetylcysteine can be administered as a part of a complex molecule, Thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteine, which also contains thiamphenicol, an antibiotic. ===== Lungs ===== Inhaled acetylcysteine has been used for mucolytic therapy in addition to other therapies in respiratory conditions with excessive and/or thick mucus production. It is also used post-operatively, as a diagnostic aid, and in tracheotomy care. It may be considered ineffective in cystic fibrosis. A 2013 Cochrane review in cystic fibrosis found no evidence of benefit. Acetylcysteine is used in the treatment of obstructive lung disease as an adjuvant treatment. === Other uses === Acetylcysteine has been used to complex palladium, to help it dissolve in water. This helps to remove palladium from drugs or precursors synthesized by palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. N-acetylcysteine can be used to protect the liver. ==== Microbiological use ==== Acetylcysteine can be used in Petroff's method of liquefaction and decontamination of sputum, in preparation for recovery of mycobacterium. It also displays significant antiviral activity against influenza A viruses. Acetylcysteine has bactericidal properties and breaks down bacterial biofilms of clinically relevant pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. == Side effects == The most commonly reported adverse effects for IV formulations of acetylcysteine are rash, urticaria, and itchiness. Adverse effects for inhalational formulations of acetylcysteine include nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, fever, rhinorrhea, drowsiness, clamminess, chest tightness, and bronchoconstriction. Although infrequent, bronchospasm has been reported to occur unpredictably in some patients. Adverse effects for oral formulations of acetylcysteine have been reported to include nausea, vomiting, rash, and fever. Large doses in a mouse model showed that acetylcysteine could potentially cause damage to the heart and lungs. They found that acetylcysteine was metabolized to S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (SNOAC), which increased blood pressure in the lungs and right ventricle of the heart (pulmonary artery hypertension) in mice treated with acetylcysteine. The effect was similar to that observed following a 3-week exposure to an oxygen-deprived environment (chronic hypoxia). The authors also found that SNOAC induced a hypoxia-like response in the expression of several important genes both in vitro and in vivo. The implications of these findings for long-term treatment with acetylcysteine have not yet been investigated. The dose used by Palmer and colleagues was dramatically higher than that used in humans, the equivalent of about 20 grams per day. In humans, much lower dosages (600 mg per day) have been observed to counteract some age-related decline in the hypoxic ventilatory response as tested by inducing prolonged hypoxia. Although N-acetylcysteine prevented liver damage in mice when taken before alcohol, when taken four hours after alcohol it made liver damage worse in a dose-dependent fashion. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Acetylcysteine serves as a prodrug to L-cysteine, a precursor to the biologic antioxidant glutathione. Hence administration of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores. Glutathione, along with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), have been found to bind to the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their γ-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators. At millimolar concentrations, they may also modulate the redox state of the NMDA receptor complex. In addition, glutathione has been found to bind to and activate ionotropic receptors that are different from any other excitatory amino acid receptor, and which may constitute glutathione receptors, potentially making it a neurotransmitter. As such, since N-acetylcysteine is a prodrug of glutathione, it may modulate all of the aforementioned receptors as well. Glutathione also modulates the NMDA receptor by acting at the redox site. L-cysteine also serves as a precursor to cystine, which in turn serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter on astrocytes; hence there is increasing glutamate release into the extracellular space. This glutamate in turn acts on mGluR2/3 receptors, and at higher doses of acetylcysteine, mGluR5. Acetylcysteine may have other biological functions in the brain, such as the modulation of dopamine release and the reduction in inflammatory cytokine formation possibly via inhibiting NF-κB and modulating cytokine synthesis. These properties, along with the reduction of oxidative stress and the re-establishment of glutamatergic balance, would lead to an increase in growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the regulation of neuronal cell death through B-cell lymphoma 2 expression (BLC-2). === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of acetylcysteine is relatively low due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the gut wall and liver. It ranges between 6% and 10%. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine bypasses the first-pass metabolism, resulting in higher bioavailability compared to oral administration. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine ensures nearly 100% bioavailability as it directly enters the bloodstream. Acetylcysteine is extensively liver metabolized, CYP450 minimal, urine excretion is 22–30% with a half-life of 5.6 hours in adults and 11 hours in newborns. Acetylcysteine is the N-acetyl derivative of the amino acid L-cysteine, and is a precursor in the formation of the antioxidant glutathione in the body. The thiol (sulfhydryl) group confers antioxidant effects and is able to reduce free radicals. == Chemistry == Pure acetylcysteine is in a solid state at room temperature, appearing as a white crystalline powder or granules. The solid form of acetylcysteine is stable under normal conditions, but it can undergo oxidation if exposed to air or moisture over time, leading to the formation of its dimeric form, diacetylcysteine, which can have different properties. Acetylcysteine is highly hygroscopic, i.e., it absorbs moisture if exposed to open air. Acetylcysteine can sometimes appear as a light yellow cast powder instead of pure white due to oxidation. The sulfur-containing amino acids, like cysteine, are more easily oxidized than other amino acids. When exposed to air or moisture, acetylcysteine can oxidize, leading to a slight yellowish tint. Acetylcysteine in a form of a white or white with light yellow cast powder has a pKa of 9.5 at 30 °C. N-acetyl-L-cysteine is soluble in water and alcohol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and ether. Acetylcysteine is highly soluble in water: it dissolves readily in water, forming a clear solution. The pH of a maximum-saturated acetylcysteine solution typically ranges between 6.0 and 7.5, depending on temperature, purity of the compound, presence of other ions (that can affect the pH by interacting with acetylcysteine or altering the overall ionic strength of the solution), thus on the concentration of acetylcysteine itself: higher concentrations of acetylcysteine can lead to a lower pH due to the increased presence of the acetylcysteine molecule itself. This range of pH between 6.0 and 7.5 ensures that the solution is neither too acidic nor too alkaline, making it suitable for various medical applications. Aqueous solutions of acetylcysteine are compatible with 0.9% sodium chloride solution; compatibility with 5% and 10% glucose solutions is also good. As for the sunlight stability, acetylcysteine in dry powder form is relatively stable and does not degrade quickly when exposed to sunlight, but when dissolved in aqueous solution, acetylcysteine can degrade when exposed to sunlight, especially if the solution is not stored in a dark, cool place. Besides that, acetylcysteine in aqueous solution can undergo hydrolysis, leading to the breakdown of the amide bond in the molecule. Still, aqueous solutions of acetylcysteine are generally stable when stored properly: the solutions should be kept in tightly sealed containers and stored at controlled room temperature to prolong the stability. == Society and culture == Acetylcysteine was first studied as a drug in 1963. Amazon removed acetylcysteine for sale in the US in 2021, due to claims by the FDA of it being classified as a drug rather than a supplement. In April 2022, the FDA released draft guidance on FDA's policy regarding products labeled as dietary supplements that contain N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Amazon subsequently re-listed NAC products as of August 2022. == Research == While many antioxidants have been researched to treat a large number of diseases by reducing the negative effect of oxidative stress, acetylcysteine is one of the few that has yielded promising results, and is currently already approved for the treatment of paracetamol overdose. In mouse mdx models of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, treatment with 1–2% acetylcysteine in drinking water significantly reduces muscle damage and improves strength. It is being studied in conditions such as autism, where cysteine and related sulfur amino acids may be depleted due to multifactorial dysfunction of methylation pathways involved in methionine catabolism. Animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischaemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated to reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events. Research on acetylcysteine usage seems to show a positive efficiency in treating androgenetic alopecia (male baldness), with or without adjacent treatments such as the use of topical minoxidil solution. Research on mouse models also shows that acetylcysteine could be ""used as an efficient and safe therapeutic option for hair loss induced by chemotherapy"". It has been suggested that acetylcysteine may help people with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease by increasing levels of glutathione allowing faster breakdown of salicylates, although there is no evidence that it is of benefit. Small studies have shown acetylcysteine to be of benefit to people with blepharitis. It has been shown to reduce ocular soreness caused by Sjögren's syndrome. Research has found that acetylcysteine may have otoprotective properties and could potentially be useful for preventing hearing loss and tinnitus in some cases. A 2011 study showed that N-acetylcysteine may protect the human cochlea from subclinical hearing loss caused by loud noises such as impulse noise. In animal models, it reduced age-related hearing loss. It has been shown effective in the treatment of Unverricht-Lundborg disease in an open trial in four patients. A marked decrease in myoclonus and some normalization of somatosensory evoked potentials with acetylcysteine treatment has been documented. Addiction to certain addictive drugs (including cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and nicotine) is correlated with a persistent reduction in the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc); the reduced expression of EAAT2 in this region is implicated in addictive drug-seeking behavior. In particular, the long-term dysregulation of glutamate neurotransmission in the NAcc of long-term, drug-dependent users is associated with an increase in vulnerability to relapse after re-exposure to the addictive drug or its associated drug cues. Drugs that help to normalize the expression of EAAT2 in this region, such as N-acetylcysteine, have been proposed as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of addiction to cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, and other drugs. It has been tested for the reduction of hangover symptoms, though the overall results indicate very limited efficacy. A double-blind placebo controlled trial of 262 patients has shown NAC treatment was well-tolerated and resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of influenza-like episodes, severity, and length of time confined to bed. === Kidney and bladder === N-acetylcysteine has been widely believed to prevent adverse effects of long term Ketamine use on the bladder and kidneys, and there is growing body of evidence to support this. Evidence for the benefit of acetylcysteine to prevent radiocontrast induced kidney disease is mixed. Acetylcysteine has been used for cyclophosphamide-induced haemorrhagic cystitis, although mesna is generally preferred due to the ability of acetylcysteine to diminish the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide. === Psychiatry === Acetylcysteine has been studied for major psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Tentative evidence exists for N-acetylcysteine also in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific drug addictions (cocaine), drug-induced neuropathy, trichotillomania, excoriation disorder, and a certain form of epilepsy (progressive myoclonic). Preliminary evidence showed efficacy in anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and mild traumatic brain injury although confirmatory studies are required. Tentative evidence also supports use in cannabis use disorder. It is also being studied for use as a treatment of body-focused repetitive behavior. ==== Addiction ==== Evidence to date does not support the efficacy for N-acetylcysteine in treating addictions to gambling, methamphetamine, or nicotine. Based upon limited evidence, NAC appears to normalize glutamate neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens and other brain structures, in part by upregulating the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), a.k.a. glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1), in individuals with addiction. While NAC has been demonstrated to modulate glutamate neurotransmission in adult humans who are addicted to cocaine, NAC does not appear to modulate glutamate neurotransmission in healthy adult humans. NAC has been hypothesized to exert beneficial effects through its modulation of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission as well as its antioxidant properties. ==== Bipolar disorder ==== In bipolar disorder, N-acetylcysteine has been repurposed as an augmentation strategy for depressive episodes in light of the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Nonetheless, meta-analytic evidence shows that add-on N-acetylcysteine was more effective than placebo only in reducing depression scales scores (low quality evidence), without positive effects on response and remission outcomes, limiting its possible role in clinical practice to date. === COVID-19 === Acetylcysteine has been studied as a possible treatment for COVID-19, but has not improved patient outcomes by common measures. A combination of guanfacine and N-acetylcysteine has been found to lift the ""brain fog"" of eight patients with long COVID, according to researchers, but the results are inconclusive and have not been confirmed by other studies. A combination of glycine and N-acetylcysteine is suspected to have potential to safely replenish depleted glutathione levels in COVID-19 patients. == External links == Media related to Acetylcysteine at Wikimedia Commons == References ==",Acetadote,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.2200749754119897e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -2.288792165927589e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), (',', -0.1602431982755661), ('ĠFOOD', -0.008865755051374435), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006757265888154507)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/acetadote.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=78, start_index=9, title='Acetadote: Side Effects, Dosage & Uses - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/acetadote.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Elevated glutathione may be responsible for inhibiting covalent binding but above-normal concentrations have never been demonstrated in vivo after N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment or separated adequately from other possible hepatoprotective actions including direct reduction of the toxic acetaminophen metabolite by the antidote. This led us to compare the conventional L-isomer of the antidote to its nonphysiologic stereoisomer, N-acetyl-D-cysteine, because the latter should be capable of reducing the toxic metabolite but not of stimulating glutathione biosynthesis. Oral coadministration of N-acetyl-D-cysteine (1200 mg/kg), however, failed in preventing the elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase activity, in decreasing hepatocellular necrosis, in interdicting covalent binding of the toxic metabolite to hepatocellular proteins and in preventing the depletion of liver glutathione caused by 500 mg/kg of acetaminophen. N-acetyl-L-cysteine succeeded in decreasing these measures of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity while driving liver glutathione concentrations 2-3 fold above control values. The L-isomer also increased urinary excretion of glutathione-derived acetaminophen metabolites whereas the D-isomer increased only acetaminophen sulfate excretion and reversed the customary predominance of acetaminophen cysteine over the mercapturic acid conjugate. Liver uptake of N-acetyl-D-cysteine was reflected in organ concentrations 7-fold higher than noted for the L-isomer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 1. A new model of tolerance to the hypotensive effect of organic nitrates has been developed in the rat. 2. The fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in response to bolus doses of sodium nitroprusside (NP) (4 micrograms kg-1) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (10 micrograms kg-1) was recorded both before and after a 60 min infusion of either 0.9% saline, NP (20 micrograms kg-1 min-1) or GTN (40 micrograms kg-1 min-1). 3. The hypotensive effects of NP or GTN were unchanged following saline infusion, but were reduced in both cases by approximately 40% following the infusion of NP. 4. Infusion of GTN for 60 min virtually abolished the hypotensive effect of a GTN bolus (i.e. nitrate tolerance), whilst the effect of a NP bolus was reduced only to a similar extent (30%) as after an infusion of NP. This latter effect is attributed to a degree of non-specific cross-tolerance between GTN and NP. 5. Co-treatment of a group of rats with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (L-NAC) prevented the development of nitrate tolerance, confirming the role of thiols in this phenomenon, whereas N-acetyl-D-cysteine (D-NAC) did not. 6. The stereospecificity in the effect of NAC in preventing this specific tolerance to GTN suggests that the interaction between GTN and NAC and/or cysteine involves an enzyme-dependent step. 7. NAC was unable to prevent the non-specific cross-tolerance to NP which followed infusion of GTN, suggesting that the mechanism does not directly involve NAC and/or cysteine.",N-acetyl-d-cysteine,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.02058054879307747)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5046705007553101), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008877452462911606)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6562654/,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1018.html,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine ', [])"

In anaesthetised dogs ZM 241385 (i.v.) was 140-fold more potent in attenuating vasodilator responses to exogenous adenosine in the constant flow perfused hind limb than the bradycardic effects. In pithed rats in which blood pressure was supported by angiotensin II infusion, ZM 241385 (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) did not inhibit the hypotensive or bradycardic effects of the A3/A1 receptor agonist N(6)-2-(4-amino-3-iodophenyl)ethyladenosine (APNEA). In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, ZM 241385 (3-10 mg kg-1, p.o.) selectively attenuated the mean arterial blood pressure response produced by exogenous adenosine. No inhibition of the bradycardic effects of adenosine was observed following these doses of ZM 241385. The results indicate that ZM 241385 can be used to evaluate the role of adenosine A2A receptors in the action of adenosine in vivo. 4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl¿1,2,4¿-triazolo¿2,3a¿-¿1,3, 5¿triazin-5-yl-amino]ethyl)phenol (ZM 241385) has been used as an antagonist of adenosine A(2A) receptors, exhibiting high selectivity over adenosine A(1) receptors. We now report that ZM 241385 (10-50 nM) attenuated the inhibitory action of N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (10 nM) and R(-)-N(6)-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA, 20 nM), two selective adenosine A(1) receptor agonists, on hippocampal population spike amplitude. This effect is unlikely to be a direct antagonism of adenosine A(1) receptor since the K(i) of ZM 241385 to displace [3H]PIA (2 nM) binding, from hippocampal membranes ranged from 0.8 to 1.9 microM. These results question the usefulness of ZM 241385 to define adenosine A(2A) receptors actions in functional studies. 1. This paper describes the in vitro pharmacology of ZM 241385 (4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl) [1,2,4]-triazolo[2,3-a][1,3,5]triazin- 5-yl amino]ethyl) phenol), a novel non-xanthine adenosine receptor antagonist with selectivity for the A2a receptor subtype. 2. ZM 241385 had high affinity for A2a receptors. In rat phaeochromocytoma cell membranes, ZM 241385 displaced binding of tritiated 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) with a pIC50 of 9.52, (95% confidence limits, c.l., 9.02-10.02). In guinea-pig isolated Langendorff hearts, ZM 241385 antagonized vasodilatation of the coronary bed produced by 2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO) and 2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl) phenethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS21680) with pA2 values of 8.57 (c.l., 8.45-8.68) and 9.02 (c.l., 8.79-9.24) respectively. 3. ZM 241385 had low potency at A2b receptors and antagonized the relaxant effects of adenosine in the guinea-pig aorta with a pA2 of 7.06, (c.l., 6.92-7.19). 4. ZM 241385 had a low affinity at A1 receptors. In rat cerebral cortex membranes it displaced tritiated R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) with a pIC50 of 5.69 (c.l., 5.57-5.81). ZM 241385 antagonized the bradycardic action of 2-CADO in guinea-pig atria with a pA2 of 5.95 (c.l., 5.72-6.18). 5. ZM 241385 had low affinity for A3 receptors. At cloned rat A3 receptors expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells, it displaced iodinated aminobenzyl-5'-N-methylcarboxamido adenosine (AB-MECA) with a pIC50 of 3.82 (c.l., 3.67-4.06). 6. ZM 241385 had no significant additional pharmacological effects on the isolated tissues used in these studies at concentrations three orders of magnitude greater than those which block A2a receptors. At 10 microM it displayed only minor inhibition of the bradycardic effects in guinea-pig atria to some concentrations of carbachol. At 10 microM, ZM 241385 had a small inhibitory effect on relaxant effects of isoprenaline in guinea-pig aortae but no effect on sodium nitrite-induced relaxation. ZM 241385(100 microM) was without effect on phenylephrine-induced tone in guinea-pig aortae.7. ZM 241385 (10 microM) had no inhibitory effect on rat hepatocyte phosphodiesterase types I, II, III and IV but caused a small inhibition of the calcium calmodulin-activated type I enzyme.8.

It is used as an abortive medication, blocking a migraine attack which is already in progress. Eletriptan is marketed and manufactured by Pfizer Inc. == Approval and availability == Eletriptan was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2002, for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. It is available only by prescription in the United States, Canada and Australia. It is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine. It is available in 20 mg and 40 mg strengths. But unfortunately for unknown reasons this product is hardly available in Germany if at all. Eletriptan was covered by U.S. Patent no. 5545644 and U.S. Patent no. 6110940; both now expired. == Mechanism of action == Eletriptan is believed to reduce swelling of the blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the head pain of a migraine attack. Eletriptan blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of symptoms by eletriptan. Eletriptan is a serotonin receptor agonist, specifically an agonist of certain 5-HT1 family receptors. Eletriptan binds with high affinity to the 5-HT[1B, 1D, 1F] receptors. It has a modest affinity to the 5-HT[1A, 1E, 2B, 7] receptors, and little to no affinity at the 5-HT[2A, 2C, 3, 4, 5A, 6] receptors. Eletriptan has no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at adrenergic α1, α2, or β; dopaminergic D1 or D2; muscarinic; or opioid receptors. Eletriptan could be efficiently co-administered with nitric oxide synthase (NOS's) inhibitors for the treatment of NOS-dependent diseases (US patent US 2007/0254940). Two theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT1 receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT1 receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on the arteriovenous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which is correlated with the relief of migraine headache. The other hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT1 receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. == Side effects == Common side effects include hypertension, tachycardia, headache, dizziness, drowsiness and symptoms similar to angina pectoris. Severe allergic reactions are rare. == Contraindications == Eletriptan is contraindicated in patients with various diseases of the heart and circulatory system, such as angina pectoris, severe hypertension, and heart failure, as well as in patients that have had a stroke or heart attack. This is due to the unusual side effect of coronary vasoconstriction due to serotonin 5HT1B antagonism, which can precipitate a heart attack in those already at risk. It is also contraindicated in severe renal or hepatic impairment due to its extensive liver metabolism through CYP3A4. == Interactions == Strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as erythromycin and ketoconazole, significantly increase blood plasma concentration of eletriptan and should be separated by at least 72 hours. Ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, add to the drug's hypertensive effect and should be separated by at least 24 hours. == Additional chemical names == Merck Index: 3-[[(2R)-1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl]methyl]-5-[2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethyl]-1H-indole 5-[2-(benzenesulfonyl)ethyl]-3-(1-methylpyrrolidin-2(R)-ylmethyl)-1H-indole (R)-5-[2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethyl]-3-[(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-1H-indole == Society and culture == === Brand names === It is sold in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom under the brand name Relpax, and in several other countries under the brand name Relert.

It is taken once per week to once per month by mouth. == Medical uses == Quinestrol has been used as the estrogen component in menopausal hormone therapy and in combined hormonal birth control. It has also occasionally been used in the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer, as well as to suppress lactation. On its own as an estrogen, quinestrol was taken once per week by mouth. As a combined birth control pill, it was used together with quingestanol acetate and was taken once per month by mouth. == Pharmacology == Quinestrol is a prodrug of ethinylestradiol (EE), with no estrogenic activity of its own. It is taken orally and has prolonged activity following a single dose, with a very long biological half-life of more than 120 hours (5 days) due to enhanced lipophilicity and storage in fat. Because of its much longer half-life, quinestrol is two to three times as potent as EE. Also because of its long half-life, quinestrol can be taken once a week or once a month. Following administration, quinestrol is absorbed via the lymphatic system, is stored in adipose tissue, and is gradually released from adipose tissue. == Chemistry == Quinestrol, also known as ethinylestradiol 3-cyclopentyl ether (EE2CPE), is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is an estrogen ether, specifically the C3 cyclopentyl ether of ethinylestradiol (17α-ethynylestradiol). Closely related estrogens include mestranol (ethinylestradiol 3-methyl ether) and ethinylestradiol sulfonate (EES; Turisteron; ethinylestradiol 3-isopropylsulfonate). == History == Quinestrol was developed and introduced for medical use in the 1960s. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Quinestrol is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, and BANTooltip British Approved Name. It is also known by its former developmental code name W-3566. === Brand names === Quinestrol has been marketed under brand names including Agalacto-Quilea, Basaquines, Eston, Estrovis, Estrovister, Plestrovis, Qui-Lea, Soluna, and Yueketing, among others. === Availability === Quinestrol was marketed as Estrovis in the United States by Parke-Davis and as Qui-Lea in Argentina, but is reportedly not currently marketed. However, it does appear to still be available as an oral contraceptive in combination with progestins in Argentina and China. One tablet form available in China consists of 6 mg levonorgestrel and 3 mg quinestrol; it is used as a prescription ""long-term"" oral contraceptive, with one dose taken each month. It is sold under various brand names including Yuèkětíng (Chinese: 悦可婷) and Àiyuè (Chinese: 艾悦). A version with the racemic norgestrel in place of levonorgestrel also appears to be available. == Veterinary use == === Rodents === The Chinese levonorgestrel/quinestrol 2:1 formula is known as EP-1 in veterinary practice. It is known to have some organ-specific effects on the Mongolian gerbil as measured by receptor mRNA expression.

2830,"('Dinoprost (tromethamine salt)', 'Prostaglandin f2œ± (tromethamine salt)', 'Prostaglandin f2œ± tham', 'Dinoprost', 'Prostaglandin f2alpha')","Endogenous, Medical","Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α in prostanoid nomenclature), pharmaceutically termed dinoprost, is a naturally occurring prostaglandin used in medicine to induce labor and as an abortifacient. Prostaglandins are lipids throughout the entire body that have a hormone-like function. In pregnancy, PGF2α is medically used to sustain contracture and provoke myometrial ischemia to accelerate labor and prevent significant blood loss in labor. Additionally, PGF2α has been linked to being naturally involved in the process of labor. It has been seen that there are higher levels of PGF2α in maternal fluid during labor when compared to at term. This signifies that there is likely a biological use and significance to the production and secretion of PGF2α in labor. Prostaglandin is also used to treat uterine infections in domestic animals. In domestic mammals, it is produced by the uterus when stimulated by oxytocin, in the event that there has been no implantation during the luteal phase. It acts on the corpus luteum to cause luteolysis, forming a corpus albicans and stopping the production of progesterone. Action of PGF2α is dependent on the number of receptors on the corpus luteum membrane. The PGF2α isoform 8-iso-PGF2α was found in significantly increased amounts in patients with endometriosis, thus being a potential causative link in endometriosis-associated oxidative stress. == Mechanism of action == PGF2α acts by binding to the prostaglandin F2α receptor. It is released in response to an increase in oxytocin levels in the uterus, and stimulates both luteolytic activity and the release of oxytocin. Because PGF2α is linked with an increase in uterine oxytocin levels, there is evidence that PGF2α and oxytocin form a positive feedback loop to facilitate the degradation of the corpus luteum. PGF2α and oxytocin also inhibit the production of progesterone, a hormone that facilitates corpus luteum development. Conversely, higher progesterone levels inhibit production of PGF2α and oxytocin, as the effects of the hormones are in opposition to each other. This is directly exhibited following ovulation when there is a spike of progesterone levels, and then as progesterone levels decrease, PGF2α levels will peak. == Pharmaceutical Use == When injected into the body or amniotic sac, PGF2α can either induce labor or cause an abortion depending on the concentration used. In small doses (1–4 mg/day), PGF2α acts to stimulate uterine muscle contractions, which aids in the birth process. However, during the first trimester and in higher concentrations (40 mg/day), PGF2α can cause an abortion by degrading the corpus luteum, which normally acts to maintain pregnancy via the production of progesterone. Since the fetus is not viable outside the womb by this time, the lack of progesterone leads to the shedding of the uterine lining and the death of the fetus. However, this process is not fully understood. == Pyometra and uterine infections == Lutalyse is used for the treatment of pyometra in domestic dogs and cats. The drug is also administered to dairy cows in order to reduce uterine infections. == Synthesis == === Industrial Synthesis === In 2012 a concise and highly stereoselective total synthesis of PGF2α was described. The synthesis requires only seven steps, a huge improvement on the original 17-steps synthesis of Corey and Cheng, and uses 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran as a starting reagent, with S-proline as an asymmetric catalyst. In 2019, a more effective and stereoselective synthesis was described. The synthesis requires 5 steps to get to the intermediate which then undergoes a cross-metathesis reaction to install the E-alkene. Then, a Wittig reaction is performed to install the Z-alkene. Finally, the protecting groups are removed with acid. In the body PGF2α is synthesized in several distinct steps. First, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) facilitates the conversion of phospholipids to arachidonic acid, the framework from which all prostaglandins are formed. Arachidonic acid then reacts with two cyclooxygenase (COX) receptors, COX-1 and COX-2, or PGH synthase to form prostaglandin H2, an intermediate. Lastly, the compound reacts with aldose reductase or prostaglandin F synthase to form PGF2α. == Analogues == The following medications are analogues of prostaglandin F2α: Latanoprost Bimatoprost Travoprost Carboprost == References ==",Dinoprost,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.31330588459968567), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', 0.0), (' END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -7.52919222577475e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.006903723813593388), ('ICAL', -2.264974000354414e-06), (',', -0.0007134514744393528), ('ĠEND', -0.0005134217790327966), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00862244050949812)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.061967913061380386), (' END', -0.0001584850688232109), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL;https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/dinoprost,https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D00081,https://www.rxreasoner.com/atccodes/G02AD01 ', [])"
2831,"('Orotic acid', 'Vitamin b13', 'Oropur', 'Orodin', 'Orotonin')","Endogenous, Medical","Orotic acid () is a pyrimidinedione and a carboxylic acid. Historically, it was believed to be part of the vitamin B complex and was called vitamin B13, but it is now known that it is not a vitamin. The compound is synthesized in the body via a mitochondrial enzyme, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase or a cytoplasmic enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis pathway. It is sometimes used as a mineral carrier in some dietary supplements (to increase their bioavailability), most commonly for lithium orotate. == Synthesis == Dihydroorotate is synthesized to orotic acid by the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, where it later combines with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form orotidine-5'-monophosphate (OMP). A distinguishing characteristic of pyrimidine synthesis is that the pyrimidine ring is fully synthesized before being attached to the ribose sugar, whereas purine synthesis happens by building the base directly on the sugar. == Chemistry == Orotic acid is a Bronsted acid and its conjugate base, the orotate anion, is able to bind to metals. Lithium orotate, for example, has been investigated for use in treating alcoholism, and complexes of cobalt, manganese, nickel, and zinc are known. The pentahydrate nickel orotate coordination complex converts into a polymeric trihydrate upon heating in water at 100 °C. Crystals of the trihydrate can be obtained by hydrothermal treatment of nickel(II) acetate and orotic acid. When the reactions are run with bidentate nitrogen ligands such as 2,2'-bipyridine present, other solids can be obtained. == Pathology == A buildup of orotic acid can lead to orotic aciduria and acidemia. It may be a symptom of an increased ammonia load due to a metabolic disorder, such as a urea cycle disorder. In ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, an X-linked inherited and the most common urea cycle disorder, excess carbamoyl phosphate is converted into orotic acid. This leads to an increased serum ammonia level, increased serum and urinary orotic acid levels and a decreased serum blood urea nitrogen level. This also leads to an increased urinary orotic acid excretion, because the orotic acid is not being properly utilized and must be eliminated. The hyperammonemia depletes alpha-ketoglutarate leading to the inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) decreasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Orotic aciduria is a cause of megaloblastic anaemia. == Biochemistry == Orotic acid is a precursor to a RNA base, uracil. The breast milk of smokers has a higher concentration of orotic acid than that of a non smoking woman. It is reasoned that the smoking causes the pyrimidine biosynthesis process in the mother to be altered thus causing the orotic acid concentration to increase. A modified orotic acid (5-fluoroorotic acid) is toxic to yeast. The mutant yeasts which are resistant to 5-fluoroorotic acid require a supply of uracil. == See also == Magnesium orotate Pyrimidine biosynthesis == References == == Further reading == == External links == Orotic+Acid at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",Orotic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0005370667786337435), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.029752103611826897), (' FOOD', -0.02357119880616665)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.02980908192694187), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('OUS', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.0009211826254613698), ('ĠFOOD', -0.046454980969429016), (',', -0.313346266746521), ('ĠMED', -0.08929014950990677), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006733110640197992)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.842555426876061e-06), (' FOOD', -7.493430894101039e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orotic_acid,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11924127/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9794088/ ', [])"

Etravirine is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Unlike agents in the class, resistance to other NNRTIs does not seem to confer resistance to etravirine. Etravirine is marketed by Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. In January 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its use for people with established resistance to other drugs, making it the 30th anti-HIV drug approved in the United States and the first to be approved in 2008. It was also approved for use in Canada in April 2008. Etravirine is licensed in the United States, Canada, Israel, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, and the European Union, and is under regulatory review in Switzerland. == Medical uses == In the US, etravirine is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients aged two years of age and older.

Ancient Greek: ξύλον, xylon, ""wood"") is a sugar first isolated from wood, and named for it. Xylose is classified as a monosaccharide of the aldopentose type, which means that it contains five carbon atoms and includes an aldehyde functional group. It is derived from hemicellulose, one of the main constituents of biomass. Like most sugars, it can adopt several structures depending on conditions. With its free aldehyde group, it is a reducing sugar. == Structure == The acyclic form of xylose has chemical formula HOCH2(CH(OH))3CHO. The cyclic hemiacetal isomers are more prevalent in solution and are of two types: the pyranoses, which feature six-membered C5O rings, and the furanoses, which feature five-membered C4O rings (with a pendant CH2OH group). Each of these rings is subject to further isomerism, depending on the relative orientation of the anomeric hydroxy group. The dextrorotary form, d-xylose, is the one that usually occurs endogenously in living things. A levorotary form, l-xylose, can be synthesized. == Occurrence == Xylose is the main building block for the hemicellulose xylan, which comprises about 30% of some plants (birch for example), far less in others (spruce and pine have about 9% xylan). Xylose is otherwise pervasive, being found in the embryos of most edible plants. It was first isolated from wood by Finnish scientist, Koch, in 1881, but first became commercially viable, with a price close to sucrose, in 1930. Xylose is also the first saccharide added to the serine or threonine in the proteoglycan type O-glycosylation, and, so, it is the first saccharide in biosynthetic pathways of most anionic polysaccharides such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Xylose is also found in some species of Chrysolinina beetles, including Chrysolina coerulans. They have cardiac glycosides (including xylose) in their defensive glands. == Applications == === Chemicals === The acid-catalysed degradation of hemicellulose gives furfural, a precursor to synthetic polymers and to tetrahydrofuran. === Human consumption === Xylose is metabolised by humans, although it is not a major human nutrient and is largely excreted by the kidneys. Humans can obtain xylose only from their diet. An oxidoreductase pathway is present in eukaryotic microorganisms. Humans have enzymes called protein xylosyltransferases (XYLT1, XYLT2) which transfer xylose from UDP to a serine in the core protein of proteoglycans. Xylose contains 2.4 calories per gram (lower than glucose or sucrose, approx. 4 calories per gram). === Animal medicine === In animal medicine, xylose is used to test for malabsorption by administration in water to the patient after fasting. If xylose is detected in blood and/or urine within the next few hours, it has been absorbed by the intestines. High xylose intake on the order of approximately 100 g/kg of animal body weight is relatively well tolerated in pigs, and in a similar manner to results from human studies, a portion of the xylose intake is passed out in urine undigested. === Derivatives === Reduction of xylose by catalytic hydrogenation produces the sugar substitute xylitol. == See also == Saccharophagus degradans Xylonic acid Xylose metabolism == References ==",Xylose,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.021689945831894875), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0052350712940096855), (' INDUSTR', -0.13517168164253235), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.20163562893867493), (' MED', -0.012930906377732754), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.00785843189805746), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.011087238788604736), ('ĠINDU', -0.24228735268115997), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.693314790725708)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylose,https://www.deascal.com/ingredient-information/xylose/,https://www.foodadditivesasia.com/en/xylose,https://www.americanbioprocessing.com/blogs/xylose-potential-applications-in-the-food-industry ', [])"

Herein, (13)C NMR spectroscopy was used to identify isomers formed in aqueous solutions of glycerol (a prototype compound) and seven carbohydrates, as well as to estimate the equilibrium constant of formation (Keq). Although both isomers are formed, glycerol 1-carbonate corresponds to 90% of the product. While fructose and ribose form an indistinct mixture of isomers, the anomers of d-glucopyranose 6-carbonate correspond to 74% of the eight isomers of glucose carbonate that were detected.

Ribose (Keq = 0.89)-the only sugar without a significant concentration of a species containing a -CH2OH group in an aqueous solution-resulted in the smallest Keq. On the basis of the Keq value and the concentrations of HCO3(-) and glucose in blood, one can anticipate a concentration of 2-4 µmol L(-1) for glucose 6-carbonate, which corresponds to ca. of 10% of its phosphate counterpart (glucose 6-phosphate). The growth inhibitory effect of a mixture of t,t conjugated linoleic acid isomers (t,t CLA) was investigated in the human osteosarcoma cell MG-63, with references to c9,t11 and t10,c12 CLA isomers. The t,t CLA effectively induced a cytotoxic effect in a time-dependent (0 to 6 d) and concentration-dependent (0 to 40 microM) manner, as compared to the reference and control treatments. The apoptosis and cell cycle related parameters were measured on the cells treated with 40 microM t,t CLA for 4 d. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the t,t CLA treatment effectively increased the proportion of apoptotic cells with a low DNA content (sub G0/G1) and a marked loss of cells from the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, relative to other treatments. The occurrence of the characteristic morphological changes and DNA fragmentation confirmed the apoptosis. The level of Bax protein was increased, whereas the Bcl-2 expression was reduced. In addition, cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria into the cytosol, and the activation of caspase-3 led to the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Moreover, the composition of linoleic and arachidonic acids in membrane was decreased by increase in t,t CLA. These findings suggest that t,t CLA incorporation in membrane activates a mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway that can enhance the antiproliferative effect of t,t CLA in the osteosarcoma cells. A new commercially available HPLC column, poly-N-(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)-methacrylamide-bonded stationary phase (Daicel DCpak PTZ), was systematically evaluated for its carbohydrate isomer separation capability by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) with charged aerosol detection (CAD) or (tandem) mass spectrometry. Reducing sugars tend to split into two anomer peaks which makes carbohydrate isomer separations in non-derivatized form even more complicated. For practical purposes anomer separations are therefore ideally suppressed which can be accomplished by using high temperature or high pH that are both associated with fast interconversion kinetics leading to peak coalescence, or on the other hand by conditions with low chromatographic anomer selectivity. Four major hexoses (glucose, mannose, galactose, fructose), five main pentoses (ribose, ribulose, xylose, xylulose, arabinose) and five most important disaccharides (maltose, cellobiose, lactose, sucrose, trehalose) were analyzed as single carbohydrate standards by isocratic HILIC with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 2 mM ammonium acetate at various temperatures to study anomer interconversion equilibria in a pH-dependent manner.

It consists of the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan. The combination is sometimes described as an ""angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor"" (ARNi). In 2016, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force recommended it as a replacement for an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Potential side effects include angioedema, nephrotoxicity, and low blood pressure. It was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 2015, and in Australia in 2016. In 2022, it was the 165th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Sacubitril/valsartan can be used instead of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker in people with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), alongside other standard therapies (e.g. beta-blockers) for heart failure. To investigate its use for heart failure in those with a preserved LVEF (HFpEF), Novartis funded the PARAGON-HF trial which was designed to investigate the use of sacubitril/valsartan in the treatment of HFpEF patients with a LVEF of 45% or more. Concluding in 2019, it failed to show significance for reducing hospitalisation related to heart failure or reducing death from cardiovascular causes, and therefore appearing to show limited benefit to those with HFpEF. There is moderate evidence to suggest that treating people with HFpEF using MRA and ARNI may reduce the rate of people being hospitalized due to heart failure, however, there is no evidence that this type of treatment improves the person's quality of life or rate of survival due to cardiovascular disease. Evidence is lacking to support the use of ACE Inhibitors, ARBs or ARNIs in people with HFpEF at this time, and that the mainstay pharmacological therapy for HFpEF still remains the treatment of co-morbidities such as hypertension or other triggers for decompensation. Patients who exhibit symptoms of NYHA Class II or III heart failure and are still symptomatic despite maximally tolerated dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB alone, may be considered for sacubitril/valsartan dual therapy to decrease the risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality. Mortality benefits have only been observed to date in those with LVEF less than 35%. == Adverse effects == Common adverse effects [>1%] include hyperkalaemia [high potassium levels in the blood, a known side effect of Valsartan], hypotension [low blood pressure, common in vasodilators and extracellular fluid volume reducers], a persistent dry cough and renal impairment [reduced kidney function]. Angioedema, a rare but more serious reaction, can occur in some patients [<1%] and involves swelling of the face and lips. Angioedema is more common in black (African American) patients. Sacubitril/Valsartan should not be taken within 36 hours of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor to reduce the risk of developing Angioedema. The side effect profile in trials of sacubitril/valsartan compared to valsartan alone or enalapril [an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor] is very similar, with the incidence of hypotension slightly higher in sacubitril/valsartan, the risk comparable for angioedema, and the chance of hyperkalaemia, renal impairment and cough slightly lower. Sacubitril/valsartan is contraindicated in pregnancy because it contains valsartan, a known risk for birth defects. == Pharmacology == Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1). This receptor is found on both vascular smooth muscle cells, and on the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal gland which are responsible for aldosterone secretion. In the absence of AT1 blockade, angiotensin causes both direct vasoconstriction and adrenal aldosterone secretion, the aldosterone then acting on the distal tubular cells of the kidney to promote sodium reabsorption which expands extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. Blockade of (AT1) thus causes blood vessel dilation and reduction of ECF volume. Sacubitril is a prodrug that is activated to sacubitrilat (LBQ657) by de-ethylation via esterases. Sacubitrilat inhibits the enzyme neprilysin, a neutral endopeptidase that degrades vasoactive peptides, including natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and adrenomedullin. Thus, sacubitril increases the levels of these peptides, causing blood vessel dilation and reduction of ECF volume via sodium excretion. Despite these actions, neprilysin inhibitors have been found to have limited efficacy in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure when taken on their own. This is attributed to a reduction in enzymatic breakdown of angiotensin II by the reduction of neprilysin activity, which results in an increase in systemic angiotensin II levels and the negation of the positive effects of this drug family in cardiovascular disease treatment. Combined treatment with a neprilysin inhibitor and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has been shown to be effective in reducing angiotensin II levels, and demonstrated superiority in lowering blood pressure compared to ACE inhibition alone. However, due to an increase in bradykinins from the inhibition of both ACE and neprilysin, there was a threefold increase in relative risk of angioedema compared with ACE inhibition alone following this combination treatment. The combination of a neprilysin inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker instead of the ACE inhibitor has been shown to have a comparable risk of angioedema, whilst also demonstrating superiority in treating moderate-severe heart failure to ACE inhibitor treatment. Neprilysin also has a role in clearing the protein amyloid beta from the cerebrospinal fluid, and its inhibition by sacubitril has shown increased levels of AB1-38 in healthy subjects (Entresto 194/206 for two weeks). Amyloid beta is considered to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease, and there exist concerns that sacubitril may promote the development of Alzheimer's disease. == Structure activity relationship == Sacubitril is the molecule that is metabolically activated by de-ethylation by esterases. The active form of the molecule, sacubitrilat, is responsible for the molecule's drug lowering effects. == Chemistry == Sacubitril/valsartan is co-crystallized sacubitril and valsartan, in a one-to-one molar ratio. One sacubitril/valsartan complex consists of six sacubitril anions, six valsartan dianions, 18 sodium cations, and 15 molecules of water, resulting in the molecular formula C288H330N36Na18O48·15H2O and a molecular mass of 5748.03 g/mol. The substance is a white powder consisting of thin hexagonal plates. It is stable in solid form as well as in aqueous (water) solution with a pH of 5 to 7, and has a melting point of about 138 °C (280 °F). == History == During its development by Novartis, Entresto was known as LCZ696. It was approved under the FDA's priority review process on 7 July 2015. It was also approved in Europe in 2015. In 2022, Novartis sold its India marketing rights of Sacubitril Valsartan to JB Pharma, under the brand name Azmarda. == Society and culture == === Trial design === There was controversy over the PARADIGM-HF trial—the Phase III trial on the basis of which the drug was approved by the FDA. For example, both Richard Lehman, a physician who writes a weekly review of key medical articles for the BMJ Blog and a December 2015, report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) found that the risk–benefit ratio was not adequately determined because the design of the clinical trial was too artificial and did not reflect people with heart failure that doctors usually encounter.: 28 In 2019, the PIONEER-HF and PARAGON-HF trials studied the effect of sacubitril/valsartan in 800 patients recently hospitalised with severe heart failure and 4800 patients with less severe symptoms of heart failure respectively. The medication consistently demonstrated similar levels of safety, with higher rates of very low blood pressure, compared to current treatments across all three trials in a variety of patients, however it has only shown effectiveness in those with more advanced heart failure. In December 2015, Steven Nissen and other thought leaders in cardiology said that the approval of sacubitril/valsartan had the greatest impact on clinical practice in cardiology in 2015, and Nissen called the drug ""truly a breakthrough approach."" One 2015 review stated that sacubitril/valsartan represents ""an advancement in the chronic treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction"" but that widespread clinical success with the drug will require taking care to use it in appropriate patients, specifically those with characteristics similar to those in the clinical trial population. Another 2015 review called the reductions in mortality and hospitalization conferred by sacubitril/valsartan ""striking"", but noted that its effects in heart failure people with hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and the elderly needed to be evaluated further. === Economics === The wholesale cost to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK is approximately £1,200 per person per year as of 2017. The wholesale cost in the United States is US$4,560 per year as of 2015. One industry-funded analysis found a cost of US$45,017 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Similar class generic drugs without sacubitril, such as valsartan alone, cost approximately US$48 a year. In 2023, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) identified Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) as one of five high-expenditure drugs that experienced significant net price increases without new clinical evidence to justify the hikes. Specifically, Entresto's wholesale acquisition cost rose by 7%, leading to an additional $72 million in costs to U.S. payers. == Research == The PARADIGM-HF trial (in which Milton Packer was one of the principal investigators) compared treatment with sacubitril/valsartan to treatment with enalapril. People with heart failure and reduced LVEF (10,513) were sequentially treated on a short-term basis with enalapril and then with sacubitril/valsartan. Those that were able to tolerate both regimens (8442, 80%) were randomly assigned to long-term treatment with either enalapril or sacubitril/valsartan. Participants were mainly white (66%), male (78%), middle aged (median 63.8 +/- 11 years) with NYHA stage II (71.6%) or stage III (23.1%) heart failure. The trial was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis revealed a reduction in the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure in the sacubitril/valsartan group relative to those treated with enalapril. Taken individually, the reductions in cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations retained statistical significance. Relative to enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan provided reductions in: the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (incidence 21.8% vs 26.5%) cardiovascular death (incidence 13.3% vs 16.5%) first hospitalization for worsening heart failure (incidence 12.8% vs 15.6%), and all-cause mortality (incidence 17.0% vs 19.8%) Limitations of the trial include scarce experience with initiation of therapy in hospitalized patients and in those with NYHA heart failure class IV symptoms. Additionally the trial compared a maximal dose of valsartan (plus sacubitril) with a sub-maximal dose of enalapril, and was thus not directly comparable with current gold-standard use of ACE inhibitors in heart failure, diminishing the validity of the trial results. == References ==",Neparvis,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.007274686358869076), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032812110148370266)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01416350994259119)])","('INFO; ', [])"
2839,"('Sacubitril/valsartan',)",Medical,"Sacubitril/valsartan, sold under the brand name Entresto among others, is a fixed-dose combination medication for use in heart failure. It consists of the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan. The combination is sometimes described as an ""angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor"" (ARNi). In 2016, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force recommended it as a replacement for an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Potential side effects include angioedema, nephrotoxicity, and low blood pressure. It was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 2015, and in Australia in 2016. In 2022, it was the 165th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Sacubitril/valsartan can be used instead of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker in people with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), alongside other standard therapies (e.g. beta-blockers) for heart failure. To investigate its use for heart failure in those with a preserved LVEF (HFpEF), Novartis funded the PARAGON-HF trial which was designed to investigate the use of sacubitril/valsartan in the treatment of HFpEF patients with a LVEF of 45% or more. Concluding in 2019, it failed to show significance for reducing hospitalisation related to heart failure or reducing death from cardiovascular causes, and therefore appearing to show limited benefit to those with HFpEF. There is moderate evidence to suggest that treating people with HFpEF using MRA and ARNI may reduce the rate of people being hospitalized due to heart failure, however, there is no evidence that this type of treatment improves the person's quality of life or rate of survival due to cardiovascular disease. Evidence is lacking to support the use of ACE Inhibitors, ARBs or ARNIs in people with HFpEF at this time, and that the mainstay pharmacological therapy for HFpEF still remains the treatment of co-morbidities such as hypertension or other triggers for decompensation. Patients who exhibit symptoms of NYHA Class II or III heart failure and are still symptomatic despite maximally tolerated dose of an ACE inhibitor or ARB alone, may be considered for sacubitril/valsartan dual therapy to decrease the risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality.

2842,"('Milrinone', 'Win 47203', 'Primacor', 'Milrinona', 'Milrinonum')",Medical,"Milrinone, sold under the brand name Primacor, is a pulmonary vasodilator used in patients who have heart failure. It is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor that works to increase the heart's contractility and decrease pulmonary vascular resistance. Milrinone also works to vasodilate which helps alleviate increased pressures (afterload) on the heart, thus improving its pumping action. While it has been used in people with heart failure for many years, studies suggest that milrinone may exhibit some negative side effects that have caused some debate about its use clinically. Overall, milrinone supports ventricular functioning of the heart by decreasing the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and thus increasing phosphorylation levels of many components in the heart that contribute to contractility and heart rate. Milrinone is used as a drug that causes positive inotropy and it will lead to an increased force of contraction. Milrinone use following cardiac surgery has been under some debate because of the potential increase risk of postoperative atrial arrhythmias. However, in the short term milrinone has been deemed beneficial to those experiencing heart failure and an effective therapy to maintain heart function following cardiac surgeries. There is no evidence of any long term beneficial effects on survival. In critically ill patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction there is limited good quality evidence to recommend its use. Milrinone is administered IV only and eliminated unchanged in the urine. Dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment. == Contractility in the heart == People experiencing some forms of heart failure have a significant decrease in the contractile ability of muscle cells in the heart (cardiomyocytes). This impaired contractility occurs through a number of mechanisms. Some of the main problems associated with decreased contractility in those with heart failure are issues arising from imbalances in the concentration of calcium. Calcium permits myosin and actin to interact which allows initiation of contraction within the cardiomyocytes. In those with heart failure there may be a decreased amount of calcium within the cardiomyocytes reducing the available calcium to initiate contraction. When contractility is decreased the amount of blood being pumped out of the heart into circulation is decreased as well. This reduction in cardiac output can cause many systemic implications such as fatigue, syncope and other issues associated with decreased blood flow to peripheral tissues. == Mechanism of action == Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor. This drug inhibits the action of phosphodiesterase-3 and thus prevents degradation of cAMP. Normally, cAMP causes increased activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is an enzyme that phosphorylates many elements of the contractile machinery within the heart cell. In the short term this leads to an increased force of contraction. Phosphodiesterases are enzymes responsible for the breakdown of cAMP. Therefore, when phosphodiesterases lower the level of cAMP in the cell they also lower the active fraction of PKA within the cell and reduce the force of contraction. With increased cAMP levels there is an increase in the activation of PKA. This PKA will phosphorylate many components of the cardiomyocyte such as calcium channels and components of the myofilaments. Phosphorylation of calcium channels permits an increase in calcium influx into the cell. This increase in calcium influx results in increased contractility. PKA also phosphorylates potassium channels promoting their action. Potassium channels are responsible for repolarization of the cardiomyocytes therefore increasing the rate at which cells can depolarize and generate contraction. PKA also phosphorylates components on myofilaments allowing actin and myosin to interact more easily and thus increasing contractility and the inotropic state of the heart. Milrinone allows stimulation of cardiac function independently of β-adrenergic receptors which appear to be down-regulated in those with heart failure. == Clinical use == Milrinone is a commonly used therapy for severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), often in combination with other medications such as sildenafil. Targeting PDE3 with optimal doses and timing, milrinone prevents allergic inflammation in HDM-driven models of allergic airway inflammation.

Nelfinavir belongs to the class of drugs known as protease inhibitors (PIs) and like other PIs is almost always used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Nelfinavir is an orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 protease inhibitor (Ki = 2 nM) and is widely prescribed in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. It was patented in 1992 and approved for medical use in 1997. == Toxicity == Common (>1%) side effects include insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and lipodystrophy. Nelfinavir can produce a range of adverse side effects. Flatulence, diarrhea, or abdominal pain are common (i.e. experienced by more than one in one hundred patients). Fatigue, urination, rash, mouth ulcers, or hepatitis are less frequent effects (experienced by one in one thousand to one in one hundred patients). Nephrolithiasis, arthralgia, leukopenia, pancreatitis, or allergic reactions may occur, but are rare (less than one in one thousand patients) . == Other bioactivity == === Antiviral === Nelfinavir inhibits maturation and export of the herpes simplex 1 virus and the Kaposi's sarcoma virus. === Anti-virulence activity === Nelfinavir and simple derivatives have been found to inhibit the production of the virulence factor streptolysin S, a cytolysin produced by the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Nelfinavir and these related molecules did not exhibit detectable antibiotic activity, but did also inhibit the production of other biologically active molecules, including plantazolicin (antibiotic), listeriolysin S (cytolysin), and clostridiolysin S (cytolysin), by other bacteria. == Interactions == Nelfinavir's interaction profile is similar to that of other protease inhibitors. Most interactions occur at the level of the Cytochrome P450 isozymes 3A4 and CYP2C19, by which nelfinavir is metabolised. == Pharmacology == Nelfinavir should be taken with food. Taking the drug with food decreases the risk of diarrhea as a side effect. == Mechanism of action == Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor: it inhibits HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. HIV protease is an aspartate protease which splits viral protein molecules into smaller fragments, and it is vital to both the replication of the virus within the cell, and also to the release of mature viral particles from an infected cell. Nelfinavir is a competitive inhibitor (2 nM) which is designed to bind tightly and is not cleaved due to the presence of a hydroxyl group as opposed to a keto group in the middle amino acid residue mimic, which would be otherwise S-phenylcysteine. All protease inhibitors bind to the protease, the precise mode of binding determines how the molecule inhibits the protease. The way Nelfinavir binds the enzyme may be sufficiently unique to reduce cross-resistance between it and other PIs. Also, not all PIs inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. == History == Nelfinavir was developed by Agouron Pharmaceuticals as part of a joint venture with Eli Lilly and Company. Agouron Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Warner Lambert in 1999 and is now a subsidiary of Pfizer. It is marketed in Europe by Hoffman-La Roche and elsewhere by ViiV Healthcare. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for therapeutic use in March 1997, making it the twelfth approved antiretroviral. The initial product launched proved to be the largest ""biotech launch"" in the history of the pharmaceutical industry, achieving first full year sales exceeding $US335M. Agouron's patent on the drug expired in 2014. In June 2007, both the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the European Medicines Agency put out an alert requesting the recall of any of the drug in circulation, because some batches may have been contaminated with potentially cancer-causing chemicals. == Research == Since 2009, nelfinavir has been under investigation for potential use as an anti-cancer agent. When applied to cancer cells in culture (in vitro), it can inhibit the growth of a variety of cancer types and can trigger cell death (apoptosis). When Nelfinavir was given to laboratory mice with tumors of the prostate or of the brain, it could suppress tumor growth in these animals. At the cellular level, nelfinavir exerts multiple effects to inhibit cancer growth; the two main ones appear to be inhibition of the Akt/PKB signaling pathway and activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress with subsequent unfolded protein response. In the United States, about three dozen clinical trials are being conducted (or have been completed) in order to determine whether nelfinavir is effective as a cancer therapeutic agent in humans. In some of these trials, nelfinavir is used alone in monotherapy fashion, whereas in others it is combined with other modes of cancer therapy, such as well-established chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy. As of April 2022, nelfinavir is being studied as a radiosensitizing agent as part of treatment of advanced cervical cancer. == References == == Further reading ==",Viracept,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1920858014491387e-05), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009151084814220667)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.pfizermedicalinformation.com/viracept/description ', [])"

It is a polyphenol. It is a yellow solid. Structurally, it is classified as a hydroxycinnamic acid. The molecule consists of both phenolic and acrylic functional groups. It is found in all plants as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of lignin, one of the principal components of biomass and its residues. It is chemically unrelated to caffeine; the related name is due to its presence in coffee. == Natural occurrences == Caffeic acid can be found in the bark of Eucalyptus globulus the barley grain Hordeum vulgare and the herb Dipsacus asperoides. It can also be found in the freshwater fern Salvinia molesta and in the mushroom Phellinus linteus. === Occurrences in food === Free caffeic acid can be found in a variety of beverages, including brewed coffee at 63.1-96.0 mg per 100 ml and red wine at 2 mg per 100 ml. It is found at relatively high levels in herbs of the mint family, especially thyme, sage and spearmint (at about 20 mg per 100 g), and in spices, such as Ceylon cinnamon and star anise (at about 22 mg per 100 g). Caffeic acid occurs at moderate levels in sunflower seeds (8 mg per 100 g), apple sauce, apricots and prunes (at about 1 mg per 100 g). It occurs at remarkably high levels in black chokeberry (141 mg per 100 g). It is also quite high in the South American herb yerba mate (150 mg per 100 g based on thin-layer chromatography densitometry and HPLC ). It is also found at lower levels in barley and rye. === Biosynthesis === Caffeic acid is biosynthesized by hydroxylation of coumaroyl ester of quinic acid (esterified through a side chain alcohol). This hydroxylation produces the caffeic acid ester of shikimic acid, which converts to chlorogenic acid. It is the precursor to ferulic acid, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol, all of which are significant building blocks in lignin. The transformation to ferulic acid is catalyzed by the enzyme caffeate O-methyltransferase. Caffeic acid and its derivative caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) are produced in many kinds of plants. Dihydroxyphenylalanine ammonia-lyase was presumed to use 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) to produce trans-caffeate and NH3. However, the EC number for this purported enzyme was deleted in 2007, as no evidence has emerged for its existence. === Biotransformation === Caffeate O-methyltransferase is an enzyme responsible for the transformation of caffeic acid into ferulic acid. Caffeic acid and related o-diphenols are rapidly oxidized by o-diphenol oxidases in tissue extracts. === Biodegradation === Caffeate 3,4-dioxygenase is an enzyme that uses caffeic acid and oxygen to produce 3-(2-carboxyethenyl)-cis,cis-muconate. Caffeic acid is susceptible to autoxidation. Glutathione and thiol compounds (cysteine, thioglycolic acid or thiocresol) or ascorbic acid have a protective effect on browning and disappearance of caffeic acid. This browning is due to the conversion of o-diphenols into reactive o-quinones. Chemical oxidation of caffeic acid in acidic conditions using sodium periodate leads to the formation of dimers with a furan structure (isomers of 2,5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)tetrahydrofuran 3,4-dicarboxylic acid). Caffeic acid can also be polymerized using the horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 oxidizing system. == Glycosides == 3-O-caffeoylshikimic acid (dactylifric acid) and its isomers, are enzymic browning substrates found in dates (Phoenix dactylifera fruits). == Pharmacology == Caffeic acid has a variety of potential pharmacological effects in in vitro studies and in animal models, and the inhibitory effect of caffeic acid on cancer cell proliferation by an oxidative mechanism in the human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell line has recently been established. Caffeic acid is an antioxidant in vitro and also in vivo. Caffeic acid also shows immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity. Caffeic acid outperformed the other antioxidants, reducing aflatoxin production by more than 95 percent. The studies are the first to show that oxidative stress that would otherwise trigger or enhance Aspergillus flavus aflatoxin production can be stymied by caffeic acid. This opens the door to use as a natural fungicide by supplementing trees with antioxidants. Studies of the carcinogenicity of caffeic acid have mixed results. Some studies have shown that it inhibits carcinogenesis, and other experiments show carcinogenic effects. Oral administration of high doses of caffeic acid in rats has caused stomach papillomas. In the same study, high doses of combined antioxidants, including caffeic acid, showed a significant decrease in growth of colon tumors in those same rats. No significant effect was noted otherwise. Caffeic acid is listed under some Hazard Data sheets as a potential carcinogen, as has been listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a Group 2B carcinogen (""possibly carcinogenic to humans""). More recent data show that bacteria in the rats' guts may alter the formation of metabolites of caffeic acid. Other than caffeic acid being a thiamine antagonist (antithiamine factor), there have been no known ill effects of caffeic acid in humans. Also, caffeic acid treatment attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness behaviour in experimental animals by decreasing both peripheral and central cytokine levels along with oxidative stress inflicted by LPS. == Other uses == Caffeic acid may be the active ingredient in caffenol, a do-it-yourself black-and-white photographic developer made from instant coffee. The developing chemistry is similar to that of catechol or pyrogallol. It is also used as a matrix in MALDI mass spectrometry analyses. == Isomers == Isomers with the same molecular formula and in the hydroxycinammic acids family are: Umbellic acid (2,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid) 2,3-Dihydroxycinnamic acid 2,5-Dihydroxycinnamic acid == References == == External links == ""Chemical Land"".

2846,"('Kinetin', 'N-furfuryladenine', 'Cytokinin', 'N-(furan-2-ylmethyl)-9h-purin-6-amine', 'N-(furan-2-ylmethyl)-7h-purin-6-amine')",Medical,"Cytokinins (CK) are a class of plant hormones that promote cell division, or cytokinesis, in plant roots and shoots. They are involved primarily in cell growth and differentiation, but also affect apical dominance, axillary bud growth, and leaf senescence. There are two types of cytokinins: adenine-type cytokinins represented by kinetin, zeatin, and 6-benzylaminopurine, and phenylurea-type cytokinins like diphenylurea and thidiazuron (TDZ). Most adenine-type cytokinins are synthesized in roots. Cambium and other actively dividing tissues also synthesize cytokinins. No phenylurea cytokinins have been found in plants. Cytokinins participate in local and long-distance signalling, with the same transport mechanism as purines and nucleosides. Typically, cytokinins are transported in the xylem. Cytokinins act in concert with auxin, another plant growth hormone. The two are complementary, having generally opposite effects. == History == The idea of specific substances required for cell division to occur in plants actually dates back to the Swiss physiologist J. Wiesner, who, in 1892, proposed that initiation of cell division is evoked by endogenous factors, specifically a proper balance among them. Austrian plant physiologist, G. Haberlandt, reported in 1913 that an unknown substance diffuses from the phloem tissue which can induce cell division in the parenchymatic tissue of potato tubers. In 1941, Johannes Van Overbeek found that the milky endosperm of immature coconut also had this factor, which stimulated cell division and differentiation in very young Datura embryos. Jablonski and Skoog (1954) extended the work of Haberlandt and reported that a substance present in the vascular tissue was responsible for causing cell division in the sith cells. Miller and his co-workers (1954) isolated and purified the cell division substance in crystallised form from autoclaved herring fish sperm DNA. This active compound was named as kinetin because of its ability to promote cell division and was the first cytokinin to be named. Kinetin was later identified to be 6-furfuryl-amino purine. Later on, the generic name kinin was suggested to include kinetin and other substances having similar properties. The first naturally occurring cytokinin was isolated and crystallised simultaneously by Miller and D.S. Lethum (1963–65) from the milky endosperm of corn (Zea mays) and named zeatin. Lethem (1963) proposed the term cytokinins for such substances. == Function == Cytokinins are involved in many plant processes, including cell division and shoot and root morphogenesis. They are known to regulate axillary bud growth and apical dominance. According to the ""direct inhibition hypothesis"", these effects result from the ratio of cytokinin to auxin. This theory states that auxin from apical buds travels down shoots to inhibit axillary bud growth. This promotes shoot growth, and restricts lateral branching. Cytokinin moves from the roots into the shoots, eventually signaling lateral bud growth. Simple experiments support this theory. When the apical bud is removed, the axillary buds are uninhibited, lateral growth increases, and plants become bushier. Applying auxin to the cut stem again inhibits lateral dominance. Moreover, it has been shown that cytokinin alone has no effect on parenchyma cells. When cultured with auxin but no cytokinin, they grow large but do not divide. When cytokinin and auxin are both added together, the cells expand and differentiate. When cytokinin and auxin are present in equal levels, the parenchyma cells form an undifferentiated callus. A higher ratio of cytokinin induces growth of shoot buds, while a higher ratio of auxin induces root formation. Cytokinins have been shown to slow aging of plant organs by preventing protein breakdown, activating protein synthesis, and assembling nutrients from nearby tissues. A study that regulated leaf senescence in tobacco leaves found that wild-type leaves yellowed while transgenic leaves remained mostly green. It was hypothesized that cytokinin may affect enzymes that regulate protein synthesis and degradation. Cytokinins have recently been found to play a role in plant pathogenesis. For example, cytokinins have been described to induce resistance against Pseudomonas syringae in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum. Also in context of biological control of plant diseases cytokinins seem to have potential functions. Production of cytokinins by Pseudomonas fluorescens G20-18 has been identified as a key determinant to efficiently control the infection of A. thaliana with P. syringae.. While cytokinin action in vascular plants is described as pleiotropic, this class of plant hormones specifically induces the transition from apical growth to growth via a three-faced apical cell in moss protonema. This bud induction can be pinpointed to differentiation of a specific single cell, and thus is a very specific effect of cytokinin. == Mode of action == Cytokinin signaling in plants is mediated by a two-component phosphorelay. This pathway is initiated by cytokinin binding to a histidine kinase receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This results in the autophosphorylation of the receptor, with the phosphate then being transferred to a phosphotransfer protein. The phosphotransfer proteins can then phosphorylate the type-B response regulators (RR) which are a family of transcriptions factors. The phosphorylated, and thus activated, type-B RRs regulate the transcription of numerous genes, including the type-A RRs. The type-A RRs negatively regulate the pathway. == Biosynthesis == Adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (IPT) catalyses the first reaction in the biosynthesis of isoprene cytokinins. It may use ATP, ADP, or AMP as substrates and may use dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) or hydroxymethylbutenyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP) as prenyl donors. This reaction is the rate-limiting step in cytokinin biosynthesis. DMADP and HMBDP used in cytokinin biosynthesis are produced by the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP). Cytokinins can also be produced by recycled tRNAs in plants and bacteria. tRNAs with anticodons that start with a uridine and carrying an already-prenylated adenosine adjacent to the anticodon release on degradation the adenosine as a cytokinin. The prenylation of these adenines is carried out by tRNA-isopentenyltransferase. Auxin is known to regulate the biosynthesis of cytokinin. == Uses == Because cytokinins promote plant cell division and growth, they have been studied since the 1970s as potential agrochemicals, however they have yet to be widely adopted, probably due to the complex nature of their effects. One study found that applying cytokinin to cotton seedlings led to a 5–10% increase in yield under drought conditions. Some cytokinins are utilized in tissue culture of plants and can also be used to promote the germination of seeds. == References == == External links == Agrares Fertilizer with cytokinins Lincoln T, Zeiger E (2010).

2847,"('S-methylisothiourea (sulfate)', 'Sulphuric acid', 'Oil of vitriol', 'Dihydrogen sulfate', 'Mattling acid')",Medical,"Sulfuric acid (American spelling and the preferred IUPAC name) or sulphuric acid (Commonwealth spelling), known in antiquity as oil of vitriol, is a mineral acid composed of the elements sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen, with the molecular formula H2SO4. It is a colorless, odorless, and viscous liquid that is miscible with water. Pure sulfuric acid does not occur naturally due to its strong affinity to water vapor; it is hygroscopic and readily absorbs water vapor from the air. Concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong oxidant with powerful dehydrating properties, making it highly corrosive towards other materials, from rocks to metals. Phosphorus pentoxide is a notable exception in that it is not dehydrated by sulfuric acid but, to the contrary, dehydrates sulfuric acid to sulfur trioxide. Upon addition of sulfuric acid to water, a considerable amount of heat is released; thus, the reverse procedure of adding water to the acid is generally avoided since the heat released may boil the solution, spraying droplets of hot acid during the process. Upon contact with body tissue, sulfuric acid can cause severe acidic chemical burns and secondary thermal burns due to dehydration. Dilute sulfuric acid is substantially less hazardous without the oxidative and dehydrating properties; though, it is handled with care for its acidity. Many methods for its production are known, including the contact process, the wet sulfuric acid process, and the lead chamber process. Sulfuric acid is also a key substance in the chemical industry. It is most commonly used in fertilizer manufacture but is also important in mineral processing, oil refining, wastewater treating, and chemical synthesis. It has a wide range of end applications, including in domestic acidic drain cleaners, as an electrolyte in lead-acid batteries, as a dehydrating compound, and in various cleaning agents. Sulfuric acid can be obtained by dissolving sulfur trioxide in water. == Physical properties == === Grades of sulfuric acid === Although nearly 100% sulfuric acid solutions can be made, the subsequent loss of SO3 at the boiling point brings the concentration to 98.3% acid. The 98.3% grade, which is more stable in storage, is the usual form of what is described as ""concentrated sulfuric acid"". Other concentrations are used for different purposes. Some common concentrations are: ""Chamber acid"" and ""tower acid"" were the two concentrations of sulfuric acid produced by the lead chamber process, chamber acid being the acid produced in the lead chamber itself (<70% to avoid contamination with nitrosylsulfuric acid) and tower acid being the acid recovered from the bottom of the Glover tower. They are now obsolete as commercial concentrations of sulfuric acid, although they may be prepared in the laboratory from concentrated sulfuric acid if needed. In particular, ""10 M"" sulfuric acid (the modern equivalent of chamber acid, used in many titrations), is prepared by slowly adding 98% sulfuric acid to an equal volume of water, with good stirring: the temperature of the mixture can rise to 80 °C (176 °F) or higher. === Sulfuric acid === Sulfuric acid contains not only H2SO4 molecules, but is actually an equilibrium of many other chemical species, as it is shown in the table below. Sulfuric acid is a colorless oily liquid, and has a vapor pressure of <0.001 mmHg at 25 °C and 1 mmHg at 145.8 °C, and 98% sulfuric acid has a vapor pressure of <1 mmHg at 40 °C. In the solid state, sulfuric acid is a molecular solid that forms monoclinic crystals with nearly trigonal lattice parameters. The structure consists of layers parallel to the (010) plane, in which each molecule is connected by hydrogen bonds to two others. Hydrates H2SO4·nH2O are known for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.5, and 8, although most intermediate hydrates are stable against disproportionation. === Polarity and conductivity === Anhydrous H2SO4 is a very polar liquid, having a dielectric constant of around 100. It has a high electrical conductivity, a consequence of autoprotolysis, i.e. self-protonation: 2 H2SO4 ⇌ H3SO+4 + HSO−4 The equilibrium constant for autoprotolysis (25 °C) is: [H3SO4]+[HSO4]− = 2.7 × 10−4 The corresponding equilibrium constant for water, Kw is 10−14, a factor of 1010 (10 billion) smaller. In spite of the viscosity of the acid, the effective conductivities of the H3SO+4 and HSO−4 ions are high due to an intramolecular proton-switch mechanism (analogous to the Grotthuss mechanism in water), making sulfuric acid a good conductor of electricity. It is also an excellent solvent for many reactions. == Chemical properties == === Acidity === The hydration reaction of sulfuric acid is highly exothermic. As indicated by its acid dissociation constant, sulfuric acid is a strong acid: H2SO4 → H3O+ + HSO−4 Ka1 = 1000 (pKa1 = −3) The product of this ionization is HSO−4, the bisulfate anion. Bisulfate is a far weaker acid: HSO−4 + H2O → H3O+ + SO2−4 Ka2 = 0.01 (pKa2 = 2) The product of this second dissociation is SO2−4, the sulfate anion. === Dehydration === Concentrated sulfuric acid has a powerful dehydrating property, removing water (H2O) from other chemical compounds such as table sugar (sucrose) and other carbohydrates, to produce carbon, steam, and heat. Dehydration of table sugar (sucrose) is a common laboratory demonstration. The sugar darkens as carbon is formed, and a rigid column of black, porous carbon called a carbon snake may emerge. C 12 H 22 O 11 sucrose ⟶ 12 C black graphitic foam + 11 H 2 O ( g , l ) {\displaystyle {\underset {\text{sucrose}}{{\ce {C12H22O11}}}}\longrightarrow {\underset {{\text{black}} \atop {\text{graphitic foam}}}{{\ce {12 C}}}}+{\ce {11 H2O_{(g,l)}}}} Similarly, mixing starch into concentrated sulfuric acid gives elemental carbon and water. The effect of this can also be seen when concentrated sulfuric acid is spilled on paper. Paper is composed of cellulose, a polysaccharide related to starch. The cellulose reacts to give a burnt appearance in which the carbon appears much like soot that results from fire. Although less dramatic, the action of the acid on cotton, even in diluted form, destroys the fabric.

Aluminium sulfate, also known as paper maker's alum, is made by treating bauxite with sulfuric acid: 2 AlO(OH) + 3 H2SO4 → Al2(SO4)3 + 4 H2O Sulfuric acid can also be used to displace weaker acids from their salts. Reaction with sodium acetate, for example, displaces acetic acid, CH3COOH, and forms sodium bisulfate: H2SO4 + CH3CO2Na → NaHSO4 + CH3COOH Similarly, treating potassium nitrate with sulfuric acid produces nitric acid. Sulfuric acid reacts with sodium chloride, and gives hydrogen chloride gas and sodium bisulfate: NaCl + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + HCl When combined with nitric acid, sulfuric acid acts both as an acid and a dehydrating agent, forming the nitronium ion NO+2, which is important in nitration reactions involving electrophilic aromatic substitution. This type of reaction, where protonation occurs on an oxygen atom, is important in many organic chemistry reactions, such as Fischer esterification and dehydration of alcohols. When allowed to react with superacids, sulfuric acid can act as a base and can be protonated, forming the [H3SO4]+ ion. Salts of [H3SO4]+ have been prepared (e.g. trihydroxyoxosulfonium hexafluoroantimonate(V) [H3SO4]+[SbF6]−) using the following reaction in liquid HF: [(CH3)3SiO]2SO2 + 3 HF + SbF5 → [H3SO4]+[SbF6]− + 2 (CH3)3SiF The above reaction is thermodynamically favored due to the high bond enthalpy of the Si–F bond in the side product. Protonation using simply fluoroantimonic acid, however, has met with failure, as pure sulfuric acid undergoes self-ionization to give [H3O]+ ions: 2 H2SO4 ⇌ H3O+ + HS2O−7 which prevents the conversion of H2SO4 to [H3SO4]+ by the HF/SbF5 system. === Reactions with metals === Even diluted sulfuric acid reacts with many metals via a single displacement reaction, like other typical acids, producing hydrogen gas and salts (the metal sulfate). It attacks reactive metals (metals at positions above copper in the reactivity series) such as iron, aluminium, zinc, manganese, magnesium, and nickel. Fe + H2SO4 → H2 + FeSO4 Concentrated sulfuric acid can serve as an oxidizing agent, releasing sulfur dioxide: Cu + 2 H2SO4 → SO2 + 2 H2O + SO2−4 + Cu2+ Lead and tungsten, however, are resistant to sulfuric acid. === Reactions with carbon and sulfur === Hot concentrated sulfuric acid oxidizes carbon (as bituminous coal) and sulfur: C + 2 H2SO4 → CO2 + 2 SO2 + 2 H2O S + 2 H2SO4 → 3 SO2 + 2 H2O === Electrophilic aromatic substitution === Benzene and many derivatives undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution with sulfuric acid to give the corresponding sulfonic acids: === Sulfur–iodine cycle === Sulfuric acid can be used to produce hydrogen from water: The compounds of sulfur and iodine are recovered and reused, hence the process is called the sulfur–iodine cycle. This process is endothermic and must occur at high temperatures, so energy in the form of heat has to be supplied. The sulfur–iodine cycle has been proposed as a way to supply hydrogen for a hydrogen-based economy. It is an alternative to electrolysis, and does not require hydrocarbons like current methods of steam reforming. But note that all of the available energy in the hydrogen so produced is supplied by the heat used to make it. == Occurrence == Sulfuric acid is rarely encountered naturally on Earth in anhydrous form, due to its great affinity for water. Dilute sulfuric acid is a constituent of acid rain, which is formed by atmospheric oxidation of sulfur dioxide in the presence of water – i.e. oxidation of sulfurous acid. When sulfur-containing fuels such as coal or oil are burned, sulfur dioxide is the main byproduct (besides the chief products carbon oxides and water). Sulfuric acid is formed naturally by the oxidation of sulfide minerals, such as pyrite: 2 FeS2(s) + 7 O2 + 2 H2O → 2 Fe2+ + 4 SO2−4 + 4 H+ The resulting highly acidic water is called acid mine drainage (AMD) or acid rock drainage (ARD). The Fe2+ can be further oxidized to Fe3+: 4 Fe2+ + O2 + 4 H+ → 4 Fe3+ + 2 H2O The Fe3+ produced can be precipitated as the hydroxide or hydrous iron oxide: Fe3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3↓ + 3 H+ The iron(III) ion (""ferric iron"") can also oxidize pyrite: FeS2(s) + 14 Fe3+ + 8 H2O → 15 Fe2+ + 2 SO2−4 + 16 H+ When iron(III) oxidation of pyrite occurs, the process can become rapid. pH values below zero have been measured in ARD produced by this process. ARD can also produce sulfuric acid at a slower rate, so that the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of the aquifer can neutralize the produced acid. In such cases, the total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration of the water can be increased from the dissolution of minerals from the acid-neutralization reaction with the minerals. Sulfuric acid is used as a defense by certain marine species, for example, the phaeophyte alga Desmarestia munda (order Desmarestiales) concentrates sulfuric acid in cell vacuoles. === Stratospheric aerosol === In the stratosphere, the atmosphere's second layer that is generally between 10–50 km above Earth's surface, sulfuric acid is formed by the oxidation of volcanic sulfur dioxide by the hydroxyl radical: SO2 + HO• → HSO3 HSO3 + O2 → SO3 + HO2 SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 Because sulfuric acid reaches supersaturation in the stratosphere, it can nucleate aerosol particles and provide a surface for aerosol growth via condensation and coagulation with other water-sulfuric acid aerosols. This results in the stratospheric aerosol layer. === Extraterrestrial sulfuric acid === The permanent Venusian clouds produce a concentrated acid rain, as the clouds in the atmosphere of Earth produce water rain. Sulfuric acid ice has been detected on Jupiter's moon Europa, where it forms when sulfur ions from Jupiter's magnetosphere implant into the icy surface. == Production == Sulfuric acid is produced from sulfur, oxygen and water via the conventional contact process (DCDA) or the wet sulfuric acid process (WSA). === Contact process === In the first step, sulfur is burned to produce sulfur dioxide. S(s) + O2 → SO2 The sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide by oxygen in the presence of a vanadium(V) oxide catalyst. This reaction is reversible and the formation of the sulfur trioxide is exothermic. 2 SO2 + O2 ⇌ 2 SO3 The sulfur trioxide is absorbed into 97–98% H2SO4 to form oleum (H2S2O7), also known as fuming sulfuric acid or pyrosulphuric acid. The oleum is then diluted with water to form concentrated sulfuric acid. H2SO4 + SO3 → H2S2O7 H2S2O7 + H2O → 2 H2SO4 Directly dissolving SO3 in water, called the ""wet sulfuric acid process"", is rarely practiced because the reaction is extremely exothermic, resulting in a hot aerosol of sulfuric acid that requires condensation and separation. === Wet sulfuric acid process === In the first step, sulfur is burned to produce sulfur dioxide: S + O2 → SO2 (−297 kJ/mol) or, alternatively, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas is incinerated to SO2 gas: 2 H2S + 3 O2 → 2 H2O + 2 SO2 (−1036 kJ/mol) The sulfur dioxide then oxidized to sulfur trioxide using oxygen with vanadium(V) oxide as catalyst. 2 SO2 + O2 ⇌ 2 SO3 (−198 kJ/mol) (reaction is reversible) The sulfur trioxide is hydrated into sulfuric acid H2SO4: SO3 + H2O → H2SO4(g) (−101 kJ/mol) The last step is the condensation of the sulfuric acid to liquid 97–98% H2SO4: H2SO4(g) → H2SO4(l) (−69 kJ/mol) === Other methods === Burning sulfur together with saltpeter (potassium nitrate, KNO3), in the presence of steam, has been used historically. As saltpeter decomposes, it oxidizes the sulfur to SO3, which combines with water to produce sulfuric acid. Prior to 1900, most sulfuric acid was manufactured by the lead chamber process. As late as 1940, up to 50% of sulfuric acid manufactured in the United States was produced by chamber process plants. A wide variety of laboratory syntheses are known, and typically begin from sulfur dioxide or an equivalent salt. In the metabisulfite method, hydrochloric acid reacts with metabisulfite to produce sulfur dioxide vapors. The gas is bubbled through nitric acid, which will release brown/red vapors of nitrogen dioxide as the reaction proceeds. The completion of the reaction is indicated by the ceasing of the fumes. This method conveniently does not produce an inseparable mist. 3 SO2 + 2 HNO3 + 2 H2O → 3 H2SO4 + 2 NO Alternatively, dissolving sulfur dioxide in an aqueous solution of an oxidizing metal salt such as copper(II) or iron(III) chloride: 2 FeCl3 + 2 H2O + SO2 → 2 FeCl2 + H2SO4 + 2 HCl 2 CuCl2 + 2 H2O + SO2 → 2 CuCl + H2SO4 + 2 HCl Two less well-known laboratory methods of producing sulfuric acid, albeit in dilute form and requiring some extra effort in purification, rely on electrolysis. A solution of copper(II) sulfate can be electrolyzed with a copper cathode and platinum/graphite anode to give spongy copper at cathode and oxygen gas at the anode. The solution of dilute sulfuric acid indicates completion of the reaction when it turns from blue to clear (production of hydrogen at cathode is another sign): 2 CuSO4 + 2 H2O → 2 Cu + 2 H2SO4 + O2 More costly, dangerous, and troublesome is the electrobromine method, which employs a mixture of sulfur, water, and hydrobromic acid as the electrolyte. The sulfur is pushed to bottom of container under the acid solution. Then the copper cathode and platinum/graphite anode are used with the cathode near the surface and the anode is positioned at the bottom of the electrolyte to apply the current. This may take longer and emits toxic bromine/sulfur-bromide vapors, but the reactant acid is recyclable. Overall, only the sulfur and water are converted to sulfuric acid and hydrogen (omitting losses of acid as vapors): 2 HBr → H2 + Br2 (electrolysis of aqueous hydrogen bromide) Br2 + Br− ↔ Br−3 (initial tribromide production, eventually reverses as Br− depletes) 2 S + Br2 → S2Br2 (bromine reacts with sulfur to form disulfur dibromide) S2Br2 + 8 H2O + 5 Br2 → 2 H2SO4 + 12 HBr (oxidation and hydration of disulfur dibromide) == Uses == Sulfuric acid is a very important commodity chemical, and a nation's sulfuric acid production was as recently as 2002 believed to be a good indicator of its industrial strength. World production in the year 2004 was about 180 million tonnes, with the following geographic distribution: Asia 35%, North America (including Mexico) 24%, Africa 11%, Western Europe 10%, Eastern Europe and Russia 10%, Australia and Oceania 7%, South America 7%. World production in 2022 was estimated at about 260 million tonnes. As of the late 20th century, most of the produced amount (≈60%) was consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates. About 20% is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and antifreeze, as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, and water treatment. About 6% of uses are related to pigments and include paints, enamels, printing inks, coated fabrics and paper, while the rest is dispersed into a multitude of applications such as production of explosives, cellophane, acetate and viscose textiles, lubricants, non-ferrous metals, and batteries. === Industrial production of chemicals === The dominant use for sulfuric acid is in the ""wet method"" for the production of phosphoric acid, used for manufacture of phosphate fertilizers. In this method, phosphate rock is used, and more than 100 million tonnes are processed annually. This raw material is shown below as fluorapatite, though the exact composition may vary. This is treated with 93% sulfuric acid to produce calcium sulfate, hydrogen fluoride (HF) and phosphoric acid. The HF is removed as hydrofluoric acid. The overall process can be represented as: Ca 5 ( PO 4 ) 3 F fluorapatite + 5 H 2 SO 4 + 10 H 2 O ⟶ 5 CaSO 4 ⋅ 2 H 2 O calcium sulfate dihydrate + HF + 3 H 3 PO 4 {\displaystyle {\underset {\text{fluorapatite}}{{\ce {Ca5(PO4)3F}}}}+{\ce {5 H2SO4 + 10 H2O}}\longrightarrow {\underset {{\text{calcium sulfate}} \atop {\text{dihydrate}}}{{\ce {5 CaSO4*2H2O}}}}+{\ce {HF + 3 H3PO4}}} Ammonium sulfate, an important nitrogen fertilizer, is most commonly produced as a byproduct from coking plants supplying the iron and steel making plants. Reacting the ammonia produced in the thermal decomposition of coal with waste sulfuric acid allows the ammonia to be crystallized out as a salt (often brown because of iron contamination) and sold into the agro-chemicals industry. Sulfuric acid is also important in the manufacture of dyestuffs solutions. === Industrial cleaning agent === Sulfuric acid is used in steelmaking and other metallurgical industries as a pickling agent for removal of rust and fouling. Used acid is often recycled using a spent acid regeneration (SAR) plant. These plants combust spent acid with natural gas, refinery gas, fuel oil or other fuel sources. This combustion process produces gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfur trioxide (SO3) which are then used to manufacture ""new"" sulfuric acid. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can be added to sulfuric acid to produce piranha solution, a powerful but potentially hazardous cleaning solution with which substrate surfaces can be cleaned. Piranha solution is typically used in the microelectronics industry, and also in laboratory settings to clean glassware. === Catalyst === Sulfuric acid is used for a variety of other purposes in the chemical industry. For example, it is the usual acid catalyst for the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam, used for making nylon. It is used for making hydrochloric acid from salt via the Mannheim process. Much H2SO4 is used in petroleum refining, for example as a catalyst for the reaction of isobutane with isobutylene to give isooctane, a compound that raises the octane rating of gasoline (petrol). Sulfuric acid is also often used as a dehydrating or oxidizing agent in industrial reactions, such as the dehydration of various sugars to form solid carbon. === Electrolyte === Sulfuric acid acts as the electrolyte in lead–acid batteries (lead-acid accumulator): At anode: Pb + SO2−4 ⇌ PbSO4 + 2 e− At cathode: PbO2 + 4 H+ + SO2−4 + 2 e− ⇌ PbSO4 + 2 H2O Overall: Pb + PbO2 + 4 H+ + 2 SO2−4 ⇌ 2 PbSO4 + 2 H2O === Domestic uses === Sulfuric acid at high concentrations is frequently the major ingredient in domestic acidic drain cleaners which are used to remove lipids, hair, tissue paper, etc. Similar to their alkaline versions, such drain openers can dissolve fats and proteins via hydrolysis. Moreover, as concentrated sulfuric acid has a strong dehydrating property, it can remove tissue paper via dehydrating process as well. Since the acid may react with water vigorously, such acidic drain openers should be added slowly into the pipe to be cleaned. == History == === Vitriols === The study of vitriols (hydrated sulfates of various metals forming glassy minerals from which sulfuric acid can be derived) began in ancient times. Sumerians had a list of types of vitriol that they classified according to the substances' color. Some of the earliest discussions on the origin and properties of vitriol is in the works of the Greek physician Dioscorides (first century AD) and the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD). Galen also discussed its medical use. Metallurgical uses for vitriolic substances were recorded in the Hellenistic alchemical works of Zosimos of Panopolis, in the treatise Phisica et Mystica, and the Leyden papyrus X. Medieval Islamic alchemists like the authors writing under the name of Jabir ibn Hayyan (died c. 806 – c. 816 AD, known in Latin as Geber), Abu Bakr al-Razi (865 – 925 AD, known in Latin as Rhazes), Ibn Sina (980 – 1037 AD, known in Latin as Avicenna), and Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Watwat (1234 – 1318 AD) included vitriol in their mineral classification lists. === Jabir ibn Hayyan, Abu Bakr al-Razi, Ibn Sina, et al. === The Jabirian authors and al-Razi experimented extensively with the distillation of various substances, including vitriols. In one recipe recorded in his Kitāb al-Asrār ('Book of Secrets'), al-Razi may have created sulfuric acid without being aware of it: Take white (Yemeni) alum, dissolve it and purify it by filtration. Then distil (green?) vitriol with copper-green (the acetate), and mix (the distillate) with the filtered solution of the purified alum, afterwards let it solidify (or crystallise) in the glass beaker. You will get the best qalqadis (white alum) that may be had. In an anonymous Latin work variously attributed to Aristotle (under the title Liber Aristotilis, 'Book of Aristotle'), to al-Razi (under the title Lumen luminum magnum, 'Great Light of Lights'), or to Ibn Sina, the author speaks of an 'oil' (oleum) obtained through the distillation of iron(II) sulfate (green vitriol), which was likely 'oil of vitriol' or sulfuric acid. The work refers multiple times to Jabir ibn Hayyan's Seventy Books (Liber de septuaginta), one of the few Arabic Jabir works that were translated into Latin. The author of the version attributed to al-Razi also refers to the Liber de septuaginta as his own work, showing that he erroneously believed the Liber de septuaginta to be a work by al-Razi. There are several indications that the anonymous work was an original composition in Latin, although according to one manuscript it was translated by a certain Raymond of Marseilles, meaning that it may also have been a translation from the Arabic. According to Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, three recipes for sulfuric acid occur in an anonymous Garshuni manuscript containing a compilation taken from several authors and dating from before c. 1100 AD. One of them runs as follows: The water of vitriol and sulphur which is used to irrigate the drugs: yellow vitriol three parts, yellow sulphur one part, grind them and distil them in the manner of rose-water. A recipe for the preparation of sulfuric acid is mentioned in Risālat Jaʿfar al-Sādiq fī ʿilm al-ṣanʿa, an Arabic treatise falsely attributed to the Shi'i Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (died 765). Julius Ruska dated this treatise to the 13th century, but according to Ahmad Y. al-Hassan it likely dates from an earlier period: Then distil green vitriol in a cucurbit and alembic, using medium fire; take what you obtain from the distillate, and you will find it clear with a greenish tint. === Vincent of Beauvais, Albertus Magnus, and pseudo-Geber === Sulfuric acid was called 'oil of vitriol' by medieval European alchemists because it was prepared by roasting iron(II) sulfate or green vitriol in an iron retort. The first allusions to it in works that are European in origin appear in the thirteenth century AD, as for example in the works of Vincent of Beauvais, in the Compositum de Compositis ascribed to Albertus Magnus, and in pseudo-Geber's Summa perfectionis. === Producing sulfuric acid from sulfur === A method of producing oleum sulphuris per campanam, or ""oil of sulfur by the bell"", was known by the 16th century: it involved burning sulfur under a glass bell in moist weather (or, later, under a moistened bell). However, it was very inefficient (according to Gesner, 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of sulfur converted into less than 1 ounce (0.03 kg) of acid), and the resulting product was contaminated by sulfurous acid (or rather, solution of sulfur dioxide) so most alchemists (including, for example, Isaac Newton) didn't consider it equivalent with the ""oil of vitriol"". In the 17th century, Johann Rudolf Glauber discovered that adding saltpeter (potassium nitrate, KNO3) significantly improves the output, also replacing moisture with steam. As saltpeter decomposes, it oxidizes the sulfur to SO3, which combines with water to produce sulfuric acid. In 1736, Joshua Ward, a London pharmacist, used this method to begin the first large-scale production of sulfuric acid. === Lead chamber process === In 1746 in Birmingham, John Roebuck adapted this method to produce sulfuric acid in lead-lined chambers, which were stronger, less expensive, and could be made larger than the previously used glass containers. This process allowed the effective industrialization of sulfuric acid production. After several refinements, this method, called the lead chamber process or ""chamber process"", remained the standard for sulfuric acid production for almost two centuries. === Distillation of pyrite === Sulfuric acid created by John Roebuck's process approached a 65% concentration. Later refinements to the lead chamber process by French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and British chemist John Glover improved concentration to 78%. However, the manufacture of some dyes and other chemical processes require a more concentrated product. Throughout the 18th century, this could only be made by dry distilling minerals in a technique similar to the original alchemical processes. Pyrite (iron disulfide, FeS2) was heated in air to yield iron(II) sulfate, FeSO4, which was oxidized by further heating in air to form iron(III) sulfate, Fe2(SO4)3, which, when heated to 480 °C, decomposed to iron(III) oxide and sulfur trioxide, which could be passed through water to yield sulfuric acid in any concentration. However, the expense of this process prevented the large-scale use of concentrated sulfuric acid. === Contact process === In 1831, British vinegar merchant Peregrine Phillips patented the contact process, which was a far more economical process for producing sulfur trioxide and concentrated sulfuric acid. Today, nearly all of the world's sulfuric acid is produced using this method. In the early to mid 19th century ""vitriol"" plants existed, among other places, in Prestonpans in Scotland, Shropshire and the Lagan Valley in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, where it was used as a bleach for linen. Early bleaching of linen was done using lactic acid from sour milk but this was a slow process and the use of vitriol sped up the bleaching process. == Safety == === Laboratory hazards === Sulfuric acid is capable of causing very severe burns, especially when it is at high concentrations. In common with other corrosive acids and alkali, it readily decomposes proteins and lipids through amide and ester hydrolysis upon contact with living tissues, such as skin and flesh. In addition, it exhibits a strong dehydrating property on carbohydrates, liberating extra heat and causing secondary thermal burns. Accordingly, it rapidly attacks the cornea and can induce permanent blindness if splashed onto eyes. If ingested, it damages internal organs irreversibly and may even be fatal. Personal protective equipment should hence always be used when handling it. Moreover, its strong oxidizing property makes it highly corrosive to many metals and may extend its destruction on other materials. Because of such reasons, damage posed by sulfuric acid is potentially more severe than that by other comparable strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. Sulfuric acid must be stored carefully in containers made of nonreactive material (such as glass). Solutions equal to or stronger than 1.5 M are labeled ""CORROSIVE"", while solutions greater than 0.5 M but less than 1.5 M are labeled ""IRRITANT"". However, even the normal laboratory ""dilute"" grade (approximately 1 M, 10%) will char paper if left in contact for a sufficient time. The standard first aid treatment for acid spills on the skin is, as for other corrosive agents, irrigation with large quantities of water. Washing is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes to cool the tissue surrounding the acid burn and to prevent secondary damage. Contaminated clothing is removed immediately and the underlying skin washed thoroughly. === Dilution hazards === Preparation of diluted acid can be dangerous due to the heat released in the dilution process. To avoid splattering, the concentrated acid is usually added to water and not the other way around. A saying used to remember this is ""Do like you oughta, add the acid to the water"". Water has a higher heat capacity than the acid, and so a vessel of cold water will absorb heat as acid is added. Also, because the acid is denser than water, it sinks to the bottom. Heat is generated at the interface between acid and water, which is at the bottom of the vessel. Acid will not boil, because of its higher boiling point. Warm water near the interface rises due to convection, which cools the interface, and prevents boiling of either acid or water. In contrast, addition of water to concentrated sulfuric acid results in a thin layer of water on top of the acid. Heat generated in this thin layer of water can boil, leading to the dispersal of a sulfuric acid aerosol, or worse, an explosion. Preparation of solutions greater than 6 M (35%) in concentration is dangerous, unless the acid is added slowly enough to allow the mixture sufficient time to cool. Otherwise, the heat produced may be sufficient to boil the mixture. Efficient mechanical stirring and external cooling (such as an ice bath) are essential. Reaction rates double for about every 10-degree Celsius increase in temperature. Therefore, the reaction will become more violent as dilution proceeds, unless the mixture is given time to cool. Adding acid to warm water will cause a violent reaction. On a laboratory scale, sulfuric acid can be diluted by pouring concentrated acid onto crushed ice made from de-ionized water. The ice melts in an endothermic process while dissolving the acid. The amount of heat needed to melt the ice in this process is greater than the amount of heat evolved by dissolving the acid so the solution remains cold. After all the ice has melted, further dilution can take place using water. === Industrial hazards === Sulfuric acid is non-flammable. The main occupational risks posed by this acid are skin contact leading to burns (see above) and the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure to aerosols at high concentrations leads to immediate and severe irritation of the eyes, respiratory tract and mucous membranes: this ceases rapidly after exposure, although there is a risk of subsequent pulmonary edema if tissue damage has been more severe. At lower concentrations, the most commonly reported symptom of chronic exposure to sulfuric acid aerosols is erosion of the teeth, found in virtually all studies: indications of possible chronic damage to the respiratory tract are inconclusive as of 1997. Repeated occupational exposure to sulfuric acid mists may increase the chance of lung cancer by up to 64 percent. In the United States, the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for sulfuric acid is fixed at 1 mg/m3: limits in other countries are similar. There have been reports of sulfuric acid ingestion leading to vitamin B12 deficiency with subacute combined degeneration. The spinal cord is most often affected in such cases, but the optic nerves may show demyelination, loss of axons and gliosis. == Legal restrictions == International commerce of sulfuric acid is controlled under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988, which lists sulfuric acid under Table II of the convention as a chemical frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. == See also == Aqua regia Diethyl ether – also known as ""sweet oil of vitriol"" Piranha solution Sulfur oxoacid Sulfuric acid poisoning == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0362 Sulfuric acid at The Periodic Table of Videos (University of Nottingham) NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards CDC – Sulfuric Acid – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic Calculators: surface tensions, and densities, molarities and molalities of aqueous sulfuric acid",Dihydrogen sulfate,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -8.41866585687967e-06), ('U', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('STR', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.0019676387310028076), ('DU', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07897280901670456)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.16022412478923798), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('Sulfuric acid, also known as dihydrogen sulfate (H₂SO₄), is primarily used in industrial applications.

2848,"('(r)-gossypol acetic acid', 'Gossypol acetic acid', 'Gossypol', 'Pogosin', 'Tash 1')",Medical,"Gossypol () is a natural phenol derived from the cotton plant (genus Gossypium). Gossypol is a phenolic aldehyde that permeates cells and acts as an inhibitor for several dehydrogenase enzymes. It is a yellow pigment. The structure exhibits atropisomerism, with the two enantiomers having different biochemical properties. Among other applications, it has been tested as a male oral contraceptive in China. In addition to its putative contraceptive properties, gossypol has also long been known to possess antimalarial properties. == History == Utilization of cotton-seed oil in the 19th century was complicated by the fact that it stained everything. In 1882-1883 James Longmore from Liverpool took several patents on separating the colorant by partial saponification of the oil, and in 1886 he presented his findings to the local section of the Society of Chemical Industry. He is often considered the discoverer of gossypol, even though he only isolated it in crude form. The name was coined in 1899 by Leon Marchlewski, who first purified the compound and studied some of its chemical properties. F. E. Withers and F. E. Caruth first attributed the toxic properties of the cotton seed (known since the 19th c.) to gossypol in 1915, and its chemical formula was established in 1927 by Earl Perry Clark (1892-1943). == Biosynthesis == Gossypol is a terpenoid aldehyde which is formed metabolically through acetate via the isoprenoid pathway. The sesquiterpene dimer undergoes a radical coupling reaction to form gossypol. The biosynthesis begins when geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) are combined to make the sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). The cadinyl cation (1) is oxidized to 2 by (+)-δ-cadinene synthase. The (+)-δ-cadinene (2) is involved in making the basic aromatic sesquiterpene unit, homigossypol, by oxidation, which generates the 3 (8-hydroxy-δ-cadinene) with the help of (+)-δ-cadinene 8-hyroxylase. Compound 3 goes through various oxidative processes to make 4 (deoxyhemigossypol), which is oxidized by one electron into hemigossypol (5, 6, 7) and then undergoes a phenolic oxidative coupling, ortho to the phenol groups, to form gossypol (8). The coupling is catalyzed by a hydrogen peroxide-dependent peroxidase enzyme, which results in the final product. == Research == === Contraception === A 1929 investigation in Jiangxi showed correlation between low fertility in males and use of crude cottonseed oil for cooking. The compound causing the contraceptive effect was determined to be gossypol. In the 1970s, the Chinese government began researching the use of gossypol as a contraceptive. Their studies involved over 10,000 subjects, and continued for over a decade. They concluded that gossypol provided reliable contraception, could be taken orally as a tablet, and did not upset men's balance of hormones. However, gossypol also had serious flaws. The studies also discovered an abnormally high rate (0.75%) of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels) among subjects. Hypokalemia causes symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and at its most extreme, paralysis. In addition, about 7% of subjects reported effects on their digestive systems, about 12% had increased fatigue, some subjects experienced impotence or reduced libido, and 9.9% became irreversibly infertile, apparently associated with longer treatment and greater total dose of gossypol. Most subjects recovered after stopping treatment and taking potassium supplements. The same study showed taking potassium supplements during gossypol treatment did not prevent hypokalemia in primates. The potassium deficiency may also be a result of the Chinese diet or genetic predisposition. In the mid-1990s, the Brazilian pharmaceutical company Hebron announced plans to market a low-dose gossypol pill called Nofertil, but the pill never came to market. Its release was indefinitely postponed due to unacceptably high rates of permanent infertility. 5% to 25% of the men remained azoospermic up to a year after stopping treatment. Researchers have suggested gossypol might make a good noninvasive alternative to surgical vasectomy. In 1986, in conjunction with the Chinese Ministry of Public Health and the Rockefeller Foundation, the World Health Organization formalized a decision to discontinue research into gossypol as a male contraceptive drug. In addition to the other side effects, the WHO researchers were concerned about gossypol's toxicity: the LD50 in primates is less than 10 times the contraceptive dose, creating a small therapeutic window. This report effectively ended further studies of gossypol as a temporary contraceptive, but research into using it as an alternative to vasectomy continues in Austria, Brazil, Chile, China, the Dominican Republic, and Nigeria. == Toxicity == Food and animal agricultural industries must manage cotton-derivative product levels to avoid toxicity. For example, only ruminant microflora can digest gossypol, and then only to a certain level, and cottonseed oil must be refined. Genetically engineered cotton plants that contain little gossypol in the seed may still contain the compound in the stems and leaves. == References == == External links == Media related to Gossypol at Wikimedia Commons",Gossypol,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.09183686226606369), ('OD', -4.320199877838604e-07), (',', -0.0009117019944824278), (' INDUSTR', -0.016316577792167664), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5763421654701233), (' MED', -0.05679517984390259), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.2846742272377014), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), (',', -0.0015098373405635357), ('ĠFOOD', -0.32251566648483276), (',', -0.38690608739852905), ('ĠINDU', -0.04917503520846367), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01420881599187851)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.16032922267913818)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossypol,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12020773/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24073600/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6103251/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6928215/,https://www.drugs.com/npp/gossypol.html ', [])"

During exercise, the increase of PGC-1α protein triggers the secretion of BAIBA from exercising muscles into the blood (concentration 2 to 3 μM in human serum). When BAIBA reaches white fat tissue, it activates the expression of thermogenic genes via PPARα receptors, resulting in browning of white fat cells. One of the consequences of BAIBA activity is increased background metabolism of BAIBA target cells. BAIBA is thought to play a number of roles in cell metabolism, regulation of fat burning, and regulation of insulin, blood triglycerides, and total cholesterol. BAIBA is found as a normal metabolite of skeletal muscle. Its plasma concentrations are increased by exercise. The increased production is likely a result of enhanced mitochondrial activity, as this increase is also observed in muscle of PGC-1a overexpression mice.

As of October 2002, phase II trials were ongoing and launch is expected in 2004/2005. Study of HIV-1 resistance development to the diketo analogue S-1360, the first HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor that has entered clinical development. HIV-1(IIIB) was passaged in cell culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of S-1360 (IIIB/S-1360(res)). The IIIB/S-1360(res) strains selected for 30, 50 and 70 passages in the presence of S-1360 were evaluated genotypically by sequencing analysis and phenotypically using the MT-4/MTT assay. Multiple mutations, nine in total, emerged progressively in the catalytic domain of integrase as a result of the selection process. They included T66I and L74M that have both been associated with resistance against the diketo acid L-708,906. After 30, 50 and 70 passages in the presence of S-1360, IIIB/S-1360(res) displayed a four-, eight- and more than 62-fold reduced susceptibility for S-1360, respectively. Phenotypic cross-resistance to L-708,906 was modest for the IIIB/S-1360(res) strain selected during 50 passages, but pronounced for the strain selected during 70 passages. Interesting, all IIIB/S-1360(res) strains remained fully susceptible to the pyranodipyrimidine V-165, an integrase DNA binding inhibitor. Recombination of the mutant integrase genes into wild-type background by integrase-chimeric virus technology entirely reproduced the resistance profile of the IIIB/S-1360(res) strains. As for the replication kinetics of the selected and recombined strains, reduced replication fitness was measured for all strains when compared with their respective wild-type strains. The accumulation of integrase mutations coincided with an increasing level of (cross-)resistance of IIIB/S-1360(res). Integrase-chimeric virus technology confirmed that the integrase mutations are indeed fully responsible for the resistance phenotype of IIIB/S-1360. S-1360, a 1,3-diketone derivative, was the first HIV integrase inhibitor to enter human trials. Clinical data suggested involvement of non-cytochrome P450 clearance pathways, including reduction and glucuronidation. Reduction of S-1360 generates a key metabolite in humans, designated HP1, and constitutes a major clearance pathway. For characterization of subcellular location and cofactor dependence of HP1 formation, [(14)C]-S-1360 was incubated with commercially available pooled human liver fractions, including microsomes, cytosol, and mitochondria, followed by HPLC analysis with radiochemical detection. Incubations were performed in the presence and absence of the cofactors NADH or NADPH. Results showed that the enzyme system responsible for generation of HP1 in vitro is cytosolic and NADPH-dependent, implicating aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) and/or short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs). A validated LC/MS/MS method was developed for investigating the reduction of S-1360 in detail. The reduction reaction exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a K(m,app) of 2 microM and a Hill coefficient of 2. The ratio of V(max)/K(m) was approximately 1 ml/(min mg cytosolic protein). The S-1360 kinetic data were consistent with positive cooperativity and a single enzyme system. The relative contributions of AKRs and SDRs were examined through the use of chemical inhibitors. For these experiments, non-radiolabeled S-1360 was incubated with pooled human liver cytosol and NADPH in the presence of inhibitors, followed by quantitation of HP1 by LC/MS/MS. Quercetin and menadione produced approximately 30% inhibition at a concentration of 100 microM. Enzymes sensitive to these inhibitors include the carbonyl reductases (CRs), a subset of the SDR enzyme family predominantly located in the cytosol.

2858,"('Wortmannin', 'Wartmannin', 'Ky 12420', 'Antibiotic sl-2052', 'Pi 3-kinase inhibitor')",Medical,"Wortmannin, a steroid metabolite of the fungi Penicillium funiculosum, Talaromyces wortmannii, is a non-specific, covalent inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). It has an in vitro inhibitory concentration (IC50) of around 5 nM, making it a more potent inhibitor than LY294002, another commonly used PI3K inhibitor. It displays a similar potency in vitro for the class I, II, and III PI3K members although it can also inhibit other PI3K-related enzymes such as mTOR, DNA-PKcs, some phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) at high concentrations Wortmannin has also been reported to inhibit members of the polo-like kinase family with IC50 in the same range as for PI3K. The half-life of wortmannin in tissue culture is about 10 minutes due to the presence of the highly reactive C20 carbon that is also responsible for its ability to covalently inactivate PI3K. Wortmannin is a commonly used cell biology reagent that has been used previously in research to inhibit DNA repair, receptor-mediated endocytosis and cell proliferation. == Phosphoinositide-3-kinase == Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) activates an important cell survival signaling pathway, and constitutive activation is seen in ovarian, head and neck, urinary tract, cervical and small cell lung cancer. PI3K signaling is attenuated by the phosphatase activity of the tumor suppressor PTEN that is absent in a number of human cancers. Inhibiting PI3K presents the opportunity to inhibit a major cancer cell survival signaling pathway and to overcome the action of an important deleted tumor suppressor, providing antitumor activity and increased tumor sensitivity to a wide variety of drugs. Wortmannin is a PI3K inhibitor; as such, it has detrimental influence on memory and impairs spatial learning abilities. == Derivatives == Medicinal chemistry research has been conducted to identify wortmannin derivatives that are more stable, while not losing its therapeutic effect. === Sonolisib === One of these, sonolisib (PX-866), has been shown to be an irreversible inhibitor of PI-3 kinase with efficacy when delivered orally. Sonolisib was put in a phase 1 clinical trial by Oncothyreon. The clinical development plan for sonolisib includes both standalone and combination therapy in major human cancers. In 2010, sonolisib was starting 4 phase II trials for solid tumors. The company gave an update on its phase 2 trials in Jun 2012. Phase 1 results (with docetaxel) published Aug 2013. In July 2014 published results of a phase 2 trial (for NSCLC) concluded : ""The addition of PX-866 to docetaxel did not improve PFS, response rate, or OS in patients with advanced, refractory NSCLC without molecular preselection"".

Emerging evidence implicates Nanog as a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. Amcasertib (BBI-503) is an orally administered primary class stemness kinase inhibitor that effectively targets NANOG and various cancer stem cell pathways by specifically inhibiting serine-threonine stemness kinases. This study aimed to evaluate the antineoplastic effects of Nanog inhibition, a critical transcription factor associated with pluripotency and its role in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis, using the novel therapeutic agent Amcasertib in ovarian cancer cells characterized by distinct genetic profiles. The cytotoxicity of Amcasertib was assessed in both ovarian cancer and cancer stem cell models utilizing the Xelligence-RTCA system. The impact of the determined IC50 dose on apoptosis, invasion, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell cycle progression, colony formation, and spheroid growth was evaluated using appropriate analytical techniques. Our findings revealed that Amcasertib exhibited significant antiproliferative effects and induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer and cancer stem cells. Moreover, Amcasertib caused G1 phase arrest and impeded colony formation in MDAH-2774 cells. Additionally, Amcasertib effectively inhibited spheroid growth in OVCAR-3 and OCSC cells. Notably, it demonstrated the ability to suppress invasion and migration in MDAH-2774 and OCSC cells. Furthermore, the suppression of Nanog-mediated stem cell-like features by Amcasertib was particularly pronounced in ER-negative ovarian cancer and cancer stem cells, highlighting its high anticancer efficacy in this subgroup. These results suggest that Amcasertib holds promise as a potential standalone or combination therapy agent for the treatment of ER-negative ovarian cancer.",Amcasertib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00030524839530698955), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005297314375638962)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([ascopubs.org](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.6036?utm_source=openai), [ascopubs.org](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.6032?utm_source=openai), [synapse.patsnap.com](https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/390385e853cd4cbd859e9adbe58b4c5b?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=306, start_index=6, title='A phase 1b/2 study of amcasertib, a first-in-class cancer stemness kinase inhibitor, in advanced adenoid cystic carcinoma. | Journal of Clinical Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.6036?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=306, start_index=6, title='A phase 1b/2 study of amcasertib, a first-in-class cancer stemness kinase inhibitor in advanced head and neck cancer. | Journal of Clinical Oncology', type='url_citation', url='https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.15_suppl.6032?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=306, start_index=6, title='Amcasertib - Drug Targets, Indications, Patents - Synapse', type='url_citation', url='https://synapse.patsnap.com/drug/390385e853cd4cbd859e9adbe58b4c5b?utm_source=openai')])"
2862,"('Cetalkonium (chloride)', 'Benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium (chloride)', 'Cetalkonium', 'Cetyldimethylbenzylammonium', 'Benzyl-hexadecyl-dimethylazanium')",Medical,"Cetalkonium chloride (CKC) is a quaternary ammonium compound of the alkyl-benzyldimethylammonium chloride family, the alkyl group having a chain length of C16 (16 carbons). It is used in pharmaceutical products either as an excipient (Cationorm, Retaine MGD) or as an active ingredient (Bonjela, Pansoral). It may be found in very small amount in the excipient benzalkonium chloride mixture (typically less than 5% of the total mixture). Cetalkonium chloride is purchased as a raw material in dry form as a white powder. == Applications == Cetalkonium chloride can be used in different applications depending on its concentration. === Anti-infective agent === It can be used as an active ingredient to relieve the pain of mouth ulcers and denture sores in buccal solutions or gels such as Pansoral or in Bonjela. The usual concentration in these products is 0.01% (w/w). However, it isn't known as a potent bactericidal compound, mainly because of its low solubility in water. For example, US and European pharmacopeias enforce suppliers of benzalkonium chloride to limit the amount of cetalkonium chloride in the mixture to less than 5% w/w. === Cationic surface-active agent === Cetalkonium chloride can also be used as a pharmaceutical excipient due to its amphiphilic property and cationic charge. For example, it has recently been included in a contact lens to bind an anionic active drug to serve as reservoir and extend the release rate of the molecule. Most frequently, it is used as an emulsifier and cationic agent in ophthalmic nanoemulsions in products like Cationorm and Retaine MGD. Due to its high lipophilicity, cetalkonium chloride is strongly associated to oil nanodroplets at the oil/water interface in oil-in-water emulsions, hence providing a positive charge at the surface of the oil nanodroplets. This polarization of the nanodroplets stabilizes the emulsion by creating an electrostatic repulsion between the nanodroplets and is the driving force behind the biological adhesion of the nanodroplets to negatively charged cell epithelium in vivo. In life science the cationic charge of cetalkonium is used to separate biological extracts according to their charge. === Biological activity === Biological activity of cetalkonium chloride as excipient has been widely described in the scientific literature. Cetalkonium chloride acts by creating a positive charge that provides bioadhesive properties of the cationic nanoemulsions on the negatively charged ocular surface. Hence, increasing the penetration of active ingredients formulated in cationic nanoemulsions into ocular tissues. Even more, cetalkonium chloride cationic emulsions seem to improve healing of corneal lesions. == Safety == Even though cetalkonium chloride belongs to the family of benzalkonium chloride, the ophthalmic use of cetalkonium chloride cationic nanoemulsions have been shown to be safe. These observations are explained by the fact that cetalkonium chloride present in oil-in-water emulsions is bound to the oil nanodroplets therefore sequestered from the water phase and not available to cause damages to ocular tissues. Pansoral has been on the market since 1981 and Cationorm since 2008, both products being well accepted by patients. == Regulatory == Cetalkonium is listed on the FDA OTC ingredient list updated April 2010. The MHRA has published in 2012 the ""Consolidated list of substances which are present in authorized medicines for general sale"" in which CKC is cited.

It is used to treat pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery. Nepafenac is a prodrug of amfenac, an inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 activity. == Medical uses == Nepafenac is indicated for use in the treatment of pain and inflammation following cataract surgery. In the European Union nepafenac is also indicated for the reduction in the risk of postoperative macular edema associated with cataract surgery in people with diabetes. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Nepafenac is an NSAID, thought to be a prodrug of amfenac after conversion by ocular tissue hydrolases after penetration via the cornea. Amfenac, like other NSAIDs, is thought to inhibit cyclooxygenase action. == Adverse events == Side effects include headache; runny nose; pain or pressure in the face; nausea; vomiting; and dry, itchy, sticky eyes. Serious side effects include red or bloody eyes; foreign body sensation in the eye; sensitivity to light; decreased visual acuity; seeing specks or spots; teary eyes; or eye discharge or crusting. == Regulatory == === Nevanac === On February 25, 2005, Alcon filed a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Nevanac 0.1%. Results from the two trials referenced in the NDA (Phase 2/3 study C-02-53; Phase 3 study C-03-32) have not been published. Study C-02-53 consisted of 228 patients across 10 centers in the United States. Study C-03-32 consisted of 522 patients across 22 centers in the United States. The efficacy results presented were confirmed in a study published in 2007. Nevanac was approved by the FDA on August 19, 2005, with application number 021–862. === Ilevro === An NDA for Ilevro was filed on December 15, 2011. In a one-month study, no new toxicities arose in the new formulation of nepafenac. Safety and efficacy information was derived from the previous Nevanac application. In June 2010, a confirmatory study began (Study C09055) consisting of over 2000 patients from 49 US sites and 37 European sites. A second phase 3 trial (Study C11003) was conducted in a population of 1,342 patients at 37 sites across the United States which failed to demonstrate superiority over Nevanac in an altered dosing regimen. Ilevro was approved by the FDA on October 16, 2012, with application number 203–491. == Commercialization == Both Nevanac and Ilevro are manufactured and sold by Alcon, Inc. Alcon is currently a division of Novartis International AG, which is primarily based out of Switzerland. Alcon, Inc. also holds locations in both Switzerland and the United States. The company has gone through several name changes, from Alcon Laboratories, Inc. to Alcon Universal, Ltd., to Alcon, Inc. Nevanac entered the market in 2005 as a product of Alcon, at the time a subsidiary of Nestlé. On April 6, 2008, Novartis agreed to purchase approximately 74 million shares of Alcon from Nestlé at $143.18 per share. On January 4, 2010, Novartis agreed to purchase all remaining shares of Alcon from Nestlé, totalling 156 million shares or 77% of the shares in the company. At the time of the purchase, a proposal for a merger under Swiss merger law was given to the Alcon board of directors. The merger was agreed upon on December 15, 2010, making Alcon ""the second largest division within Novartis."" The merger was completed on April 8, 2011. Ilevro was launched by Alcon on January 21, 2013. In 2014 and 2015, net sales by Alcon grew, contributed to in part by the increased volume in sales of Ilevro. That financial year, Novartis reported $18 billion in total financial debt. That figure has grown steadily since. In 2016, Novartis reported a total debt of $23.8 billion, up from the $21.9 billion reported in 2015 and the $20.4 billion reported in 2014. As of May 2017, Novartis is estimated to be worth $193.2 billion. On January 27, 2016, Alcon was moved to become a branch of the Innovative Medicines Division at Novartis. Early in 2016, Alcon formed agreements with both TrueVision and PowerVision, and acquired Transcend Medical. As of January 2017, Novartis is weighing options for Alcon in the business structure. === Commercial risks === Alcon faced declining growth in 2016, having faced challenges in development and marketing of new products. === Marketing === Novartis maintains a detailing unit geared toward health professionals consisting of over 3,000 employees within the United States and an additional 21,000 worldwide. Novartis is also seeking to expand direct-to-consumer advertising and entrance into specialty product markets. Novartis also notes the influence of position and preference on US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid formularies in expanding their market value. Nepafenac, Nevanac, and Ilevro are all absent from the 2016 Annual Report issued from Novartis. === Intellectual property === There are currently seven U.S. patents filed that are directly associated with the modernized formulations of nepafenac, all stemming from Novartis. There are three patents associated with Nevanac that are still active and four associated with Ilevro. The earliest patent related to the modern formulations of nepafenac was approved on June 11, 2002, after being filed in 1999, by Bahram Asgharian. A patent was filed by Warren Wong, associated with Alcon, Inc. based out of Fort Worth, Texas, on December 2, 2005, for aqueous suspensions of nepafenac. Another patent for a nepafenac-based drug was filed on May 8, 2006, by Geoffrey Owen, Amy Brooks, and Gustav Graff. A patent was filed by Masood A. Chowhan and Huagang Chen on February 9, 2007, and approved on May 24, 2011, followed closely by a patent filed by Warren Wong on September 23, 2010, and approved on December 6, 2011. Masood A. Chowhan, Malay Ghosh, Bahram Asgharian, and Wesley Wehsin Han filed another patent on December 1, 2010, and approved on December 30, 2014. The most recent patent was filed by Masood A. Chowhan, Malay Ghosh, Bahram Asgharian, and Wesley Weshin Han on November 12, 2014, and approved on May 30, 2017.

2864,"('Methionine sulfoxide (hydrochloride)', 'Methionine sulfoxide', 'Methionine s-oxide', 'Methionine, s-oxide', '(2r)-2-amino-4-(methylsulfinyl)butanoic acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Methionine sulfoxide is the organic compound with the formula CH3S(O)CH2CH2CH(NH2)CO2H. It is an amino acid that occurs naturally although it is formed post-translationally. Oxidation of the sulfur of methionine results in methionine sulfoxide or methionine sulfone. The sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine are more easily oxidized than the other amino acids. Unlike oxidation of other amino acids, the oxidation of methionine can be reversed by enzymatic action, specifically by enzymes in the methionine sulfoxide reductase family of enzymes. The three known methionine sulfoxide reductases are MsrA, MsrB, and fRmsr. Oxidation of methionine results in a mixture of the two diastereomers methionine-S-sulfoxide and methionine-R-sulfoxide, which are reduced by MsrA and MsrB, respectively. MsrA can reduce both free and protein-based methionine-S-sulfoxide, whereas MsrB is specific for protein-based methionine-R-sulfoxide. fRmsr, however, catalyzes the reduction of free methionine-R-sulfoxide. Thioredoxin serves to recycle by reduction some of the methionine sulfoxide reductase family of enzymes, whereas others can be reduced by metallothionein. == Biochemical function == Methionine sulfoxide (MetO), the oxidized form of the amino acid methionine (Met), increases with age in body tissues, which is believed by some to contribute to biological ageing. Oxidation of methionine residues in tissue proteins can cause them to misfold or otherwise render them dysfunctional. Uniquely, the methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) group of enzymes act with thioredoxin to catalyze the enzymatic reduction and repair of oxidized methionine residues. Moreover, levels of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) decline in aging tissues in mice and in association with age-related disease in humans. There is thus a rationale for thinking that by maintaining the structure, increased levels or activity of MsrA might retard the rate of aging. Indeed, transgenic Drosophila (fruit flies) that overexpress methionine sulfoxide reductase show extended lifespan. However, the effects of MsrA overexpression in mice were ambiguous. MsrA is found in both the cytosol and the energy-producing mitochondria, where most of the body's endogenous free radicals are produced. Transgenically increasing the levels of MsrA in either the cytosol or the mitochondria had no significant effect on lifespan assessed by most standard statistical tests, and may possibly have led to early deaths in the cytosol-specific mice, although the survival curves appeared to suggest a slight increase in maximum (90%) survivorship, as did analysis using Boschloo's Exact test, a binomial test designed to test greater extreme variation. The oxidation of methionine serves as a switch that deactivates certain protein activities such as E.coli ribosomal protein, L12. Proteins with great amount of methionine residues tend to exist within the lipid bilayer as methionine is one of the most hydrophobic amino acids. Those methionine residues that are exposed to the aqueous exterior thus are vulnerable to oxidation. The oxidized residues tend to be arrayed around the active site and may guard access to this site by reactive oxygen species. Once oxidized, the MetO residues are reduced back to methionine by the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase. Thus, an oxidation–reduction cycle occurs in which exposed methionine residues are oxidized (e.g., by H2O2) to methionine sulfoxide residues, which are subsequently reduced.

2865,"('Isocorydine', 'Isocorynoline', 'Artabotrin', 'Uzokoridin', 'Luteanin')",Medical," In order to improve the anticancer activity of isocorydine (ICD), ten isocorydine derivatives were prepared through chemical structure modifications, and their in vitro and in vivo activities were experimentally investigated. 8-Amino-isocorydine (8) and 6a,7-dihydrogen-isocorydione (10) could inhibit the growth of human lung (A549), gastric (SGC7901) and liver (HepG2) cancer cell lines in vitro. Isocorydione (2) could inhibit the tumor growth of murine sarcoma S180-bearing mice, and 8-acetamino-isocorydine (11), a pro-drug of 8-amino-isocorydine (8), which is instable in water solution at room temperature, had a good inhibitory effect on murine hepatoma H22-induced tumors. The results suggested that the isocorydine structural modifications at C-8 could significantly improve the biological activity of this alkaloid, indicating its suitability as a lead compound in the development of an effective anticancer agent. Isocorydine (ICD), an aporphine alkaloid, is widely distributed in nature. Its ability to target side population (SP) cells found in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) makes it and its derivative 8-amino-isocorydine (NICD) promising chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of HCC. To improve the anticancer activity of isocorydine derivatives, twenty derivatives of NICD were designed and synthesized through chemical structure modifications of the aromatic amino group at C-8. The anti-proliferative activities of all synthesized compounds against human hepatocellular (HepG2), cervical (HeLa), and gastric (MGC-803) cancer cell lines were evaluated using an MTT assay. The results showed that all the synthetic compounds had some tumor cell growth inhibitory activity.

2866,"('Propylparaben', 'Propyl parahydroxybenzoate', 'Propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate', 'Propyl paraben', 'Propyl p-hydroxybenzoate')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Propylparaben (also spelled propyl paraben) is the n-propyl ester of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. It occurs as a natural substance found in many plants and some insects. Additionally, it can be manufactured synthetically for use in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods. It is a member of the class of parabens and can be used as a preservative in many water-based cosmetics, such as creams, lotions, shampoos, and bath products. As a food additive, it has an E number, which is E216. Sodium propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, the sodium salt of propylparaben, a compound with formula Na(C3H7(C6H4COO)O), is used similarly as a food additive and as an anti-fungal preservation agent. Its E number is E217. In 2010, the European Union Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety stated that the use of butylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives in finished cosmetic products as safe to the consumer, as long as the sum of their concentrations does not exceed 0.19%. == Applications == === Food === Under FDA regulations, propylparaben is safe to use with a maximum of 0.1% of the weight of the finished food or 200–450 ppm for a variety of foods like coffee extracts, juices, jams, baked goods, and dairy products. It is even found naturally in a plant called Stocksia brahuica. It is often used as a food and cosmetic preservative as it has no odor or taste, and does not change the texture. The compound has some medicinal application as well as it has been used in pills, syrups, eyewashes, weight gain drinks, and recently has been discovered to have anticonvulsant activities suggesting it may be useful in the development of anticonvulsant medicine. A study of combining plasma-activated water (PAW) with propylparaben shows increased antimicrobial efficacy of PAW for fresh produce sanitation. PAW is used for fresh produce sanitation. However, when used in food applications, its effectiveness decreased because of interfering substances like polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids. With propylparaben and PAW, bacteria undergo more oxidative stress and cell damage, increasing preservation of produce. For now, the potential health risk and residue level of propylparaben with this new method is still unknown. Propylparaben is also used as a food additive, and is designated with the E number E216. Propylparaben is commonly used as a preservative in packaged baked goods, particularly pastries and tortillas. Propylparaben is also a Standardized Chemical Allergen and is used in allergenic testing. === Cosmetic === Propylparaben is one of the most commonly used paraben in cosmetic formulation. It can be found in moisturizers, shampoos, conditioners, makeups, shaving products, and many more. In cosmetic products, propylparaben is typically combined with other parabens (such as methylparaben) or other preservatives to protect against a broader range of microorganisms. The chemical stability in room temperature and wide pH range (4.5–7.5) is advantageous to prolong a product shelf life. Under FDA regulations, the maximum use of concentration for propylparaben is 25%. However, cosmetics do not require testing by the FDA prior to sale. While there is no conclusive evidence of harm to human health from propylparaben, more cosmetic companies are creating paraben-free lines, specifically in shampoos. Since parabens can easily absorb through skin, daily use is believed to cause toxic accumulation in the body that might be harmful. Some people may also experience allergic reaction to parabens including redness, irritation, itchiness, flaking, and hives. === Pharmaceutical === Used since the mid-1920s as a preservative, parabens are present in eyewashes, pills, cough syrups, injectable solutions, contraceptives, and even weight-gain drinks. Unlike cosmetics where propylparaben is mostly used in the surface, propylparaben is ingested and absorbed. According to a law from the EEC (European Economic Community), the maximum level of parabens in pharmaceutical products is 1% (w/w), much stricter and defined than cosmetics. Propylparaben also cannot be used alone in ophthalmic products, such as eyewash because it may cause irritation at the effective concentration level to have antimicrobial activities. A MES (Maximal Electroshock) test also shows anticonvulsant activity in propylparaben. Since propylparaben has minimum to no toxicity and well absorbed in the GI tract, it can potentially be develop to new anticonvulsant medicine to control seizures. == Chemical properties == Propylparaben is a stable and non-volatile compound with antimicrobial properties and has been used as preservatives in food for over 50 years. It is typically used in a variety of water-based cosmetics and personal-care products. it is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 202.18 amu. Humans most often absorb the chemical through their skin or ingestion as it is in many cosmetic and food products as an antifungal preservative. It is metabolized in two major pathways leading to the production of either conjugated metabolites or hydrolysates (PHBA, PHHA). These products are excreted from the body in urine. Propylparaben is an effective antimicrobial, especially against green and blue molds on citrus fruits. Its high solubility in water allows it to be applied to the fruits easily. == Synthesis == One of the simplest ways to produce propylparaben is through the esterification of 4-hydroxy benzoic acid with propanol using an acidic catalyst. The first major step includes the protonation of the carbonyl due to the acidic conditions. This protonation results in a positive charge on the carbonyl which will offset the electron density from the ester carbon atom, this allows the propanol to preform a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl. The proton of the nucleophilic propanol is then transferred by the solvent to the esters hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl can then act as a good leaving group and be expelled from the tetrahedral intermediate as water, allowing the ester carbonyl group to reform. Finally, deprotonation of the reformed carbonyl group will produce the final ester product, propylparaben. == Safety == Propylparaben, among other parabens, has been raising concerns on its possible interaction and disruption of estrogen in the endocrine system Exposure to high levels of propylparaben has been correlated to lower sperm and testosterone production in males in animal studies, with one other study showing that it can even act as an effective spermicide. Animal studies of propylparaben in the body show that propylparaben is metabolized from the GI tract and excreted rapidly through urine with no accumulation in the body. Despite parabens' interaction with the endocrine system, it has not been shown to be significantly correlated with breast cancer. With cracked or damaged skins, the use of propylparaben in cosmetics or skincare can result in skin sensitization; however, for normal skin, it is considered safe. As of May 2023, New York began considering banning the use of propylparaben because studies in humans and animals indicate that it acts as an endocrine disruptor and affects reproductive health. In October 2023, the Governor of California signed a bill into law outlawing the use of propylparaben in foods by 2027. The new law bans the manufacture, sale, and distribution of propylparaben and three other additives (brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, and Red 3). This is the first law in the U.S. to ban it and will possibly have nationwide effects. == References ==",Propyl p-hydroxybenzoate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.48604992032051086), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.0524824857711792), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -1.2664456789934775e-06), (' MED', -0.1269528865814209), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.2524525225162506), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00020597243565134704), ('ĠPERSON', -0.006660641171038151), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ĠCARE', -2.3841855067985307e-07), (',', -0.0005550036439672112), ('ĠMED', -0.07946861535310745), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.313316285610199)])","('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD', [('PERSON', -0.10020871460437775), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -1.6240566083070007e-06), (' FOOD', -6.015305552864447e-05)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylparaben?utm_source=openai), [food-info.net](https://www.food-info.net/uk/e/e216.htm?utm_source=openai), [drugtodayonline.com](https://www.drugtodayonline.com/drug-directory/drug_info/propyl-hydroxy-benzoate?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=303, start_index=21, title='Propylparaben', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylparaben?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=303, start_index=21, title='Food-Info.net : E-numbers : E216: Propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate', type='url_citation', url='https://www.food-info.net/uk/e/e216.htm?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=303, start_index=21, title='Propyl Hydroxybenzoate (Propylparaben) - Uses, Dosage, and Side Effects', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugtodayonline.com/drug-directory/drug_info/propyl-hydroxy-benzoate?utm_source=openai')])"
2867,"('Edaravone', 'Radicut', 'Norphenazone', 'Developer z', 'Methylphenylpyrazolone')",Medical,"Edaravone, sold under the brand name Radicava among others, is a medication used to treat stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is given by intravenous infusion and by mouth. The mechanism by which edaravone might be effective is unknown. The medication is known to be an antioxidant, and oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be part of the process that kills neurons in people with ALS and in stroke victims. The most common side effects include bruising (contusions), problems walking (gait disturbances), and headaches. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Edaravone is used to help people recover from stroke in Japan, and is used to treat ALS in the US and Japan. == Adverse effects == The label carries a warning about the potential for hypersensitivity reactions to edaravone, and adverse effects include bruising, gait disturbances, headache, skin inflammation, eczema, problems breathing, excess sugar in urine, and fungal skin infections. The following adverse effects in at least 2% more people given the medication than were given placebo: bruising, gait disturbances, headache, skin inflammation, eczema, problems breathing, excess sugar in urine, and fungal skin infections. There is no data on whether it is safe for pregnant women to take, and it is unknown if edaravone is secreted in breast milk. == Pharmacology == The mechanism by which edaravone might be effective is unknown. The medication is known to be an antioxidant, and oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be part of the process of neurodegeneration. The half-life of edaravone is 4.5 to 6 hours and the half-lives of its metabolites are 2 to 3 hours. It is metabolized to a sulfate conjugate and a glucuronide conjugate, neither of which are active. It is primarily excreted in urine as the glucuronide conjugate form. == History == Researchers first developed the free radical scavenger edaravone in late 1980s as a treatment for stroke. The approach, introduced by Koji Abe, now at Okayama University Hospital in Japan, aimed to prevent the swelling of the brain which may occur after a stroke. It has been marketed in Japan by Mitsubishi Pharma for stroke since 2001 and is now generic. Mitsubishi Tanabe started a phase III clinical trial in ALS in 2011, in Japan, and by June 2015, it had been approved for that use in Japan. The company had received Orphan Drug Designation for edaravone from the FDA and EU by 2016. It was approved for ALS in the US in 2017, based on a small randomized controlled clinical trial with people who had early-stage ALS in Japan, who were administered the medication for 6 months; it had failed two earlier trials in people with all stages of ALS. In May 2017, I.V. edaravone was approved by the FDA to treat people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the United States. The FDA approval was conditioned on Mitsubishi Tanabe completing several additional studies to clarify the risks of cancer and liver disease, among other effects of the medication. A formulation of edaravone by mouth, which is a mixture of edaravone and SBE-HP-βCD, has been under development by Ferrer (called FAB122) and licensed by Treeway (called TW001) for ALS. As of 2015, they successfully completed a Phase I trial and received orphan status in the US and in the European Union. Ferrer reported on 10 January 2024 that the Phase III ADORE clinical trial (EudraCT 2020-003376-40 / NCT05178810) of FAB122/TW001 in ALS did not meet the primary or key secondary study endpoints. A different oral formulation of edaravone from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America (MT1186 or MT-1186) was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2022. The effectiveness of oral edaravone is based on a study that showed comparable levels of oral edaravone in the bloodstream to the levels from the IV formulation of edaravone. The efficacy of edaravone for the treatment of ALS was previously demonstrated in a six-month clinical trial that served as the basis for approval in 2017. In that trial, 137 participants were randomized to receive edaravone or placebo. At week 24, individuals receiving edaravone declined less on a clinical assessment of daily functioning compared to those receiving placebo. An analysis of real-world data of 194 patients from 12 ALS clinics of the intravenous formulation, failed to reproduce the effect. A global Ph3b study with the oral formulation was halted in 2023. == Society and culture == === Economics === The price for the medication when it launched in Japan for stroke in 2001, was set by the Japanese government at 9,931 yen/ampule. When the medication launched in Japan for ALS in 2001, the price was $35,000; the price in Japan in 2017 was $5,000, the US price at launch was around $145,000. In the US the medication was approved for all people with ALS but it was unclear at approval whether insurers would agree to pay for the medication for all people with ALS, or only people in the early stages of the disease. === Brand names === Brand names include Radicut, Radicava, Xavron. == References == == Further reading == Yoshino H (March 2019).

The drug was found to cause EKG abnormalities (QT prolongation) and its clinical development was stopped. More recent animal studies have suggested traxoprodil may exhibit rapid-acting antidepressant effects similar to those of ketamine, although there is some evidence for similar psychoactive side effects and abuse potential at higher doses, which might limit clinical acceptance of traxoprodil for this application. Traxoprodil showed ketamine-like rapidly-acting antidepressant effects in a small clinical trial of 30 patients with depression who were non-responders to 6 weeks of paroxetine treatment. The response rate was 60%, relative to 20% for placebo, and 33% of the participants met remission criteria by day five following a single administration. After one week, 78% of responders still showed an antidepressant response, and after 15 days, 42% did so. In the study, half of the participants had to have their dose lowered due to a high incidence of dissociative side effects at the higher doses.

2869,"('Reserpine', 'Serpalan', 'Serpasil', 'Apoplon', 'Serpivite')",Medical,"Reserpine is a drug that is used for the treatment of high blood pressure, usually in combination with a thiazide diuretic or vasodilator. Large clinical trials have shown that combined treatment with reserpine plus a thiazide diuretic reduces mortality of people with hypertension. Although the use of reserpine as a solo drug has declined since it was first approved by the FDA in 1955, the combined use of reserpine and a thiazide diuretic or vasodilator is still recommended in patients who do not achieve adequate lowering of blood pressure with first-line drug treatment alone. The reserpine-hydrochlorothiazide combo pill was the 17th most commonly prescribed of the 43 combination antihypertensive pills available in 2012. The antihypertensive actions of reserpine are largely due to its antinoradrenergic effects, which are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines (among other monoamine neurotransmitters) from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral vascular resistance. At doses of 0.05 to 0.2 mg per day, reserpine is well tolerated; the most common adverse effect being nasal stuffiness. Reserpine has also been used for relief of psychotic symptoms. A review found that in persons with schizophrenia, reserpine and chlorpromazine had similar rates of adverse effects, but that reserpine was less effective than chlorpromazine for improving a person's global state. == Medical uses == Reserpine is recommended as an alternative drug for treating hypertension by the JNC 8. A 2016 Cochrane review found reserpine to be as effective as other first-line antihypertensive drugs for lowering of blood pressure. The reserpine–thiazide diuretic combination is one of the few drug treatments shown to reduce mortality in randomized controlled trials: The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group in Anti-hypertensive Agents, and the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program. Moreover, reserpine was included as a secondary antihypertensive option for patients who did not achieve blood pressure lowering targets in the ALLHAT study. It was previously used to treat symptoms of dyskinesia in patients with Huntington's disease, but alternative medications are preferred today. The daily dose of reserpine in antihypertensive treatment is as low as 0.05 to 0.25 mg. The use of reserpine as an antipsychotic drug had been nearly completely abandoned, but more recently it made a comeback as adjunctive treatment, in combination with other antipsychotics, so that more refractory patients get dopamine blockade from the other antipsychotic, and dopamine depletion from reserpine. Doses for this kind of adjunctive goal can be kept low, resulting in better tolerability. Originally, doses of 0.5 mg to 40 mg daily were used to treat psychotic diseases. Doses in excess of 3 mg daily often required use of an anticholinergic drug to combat excessive cholinergic activity in many parts of the body as well as parkinsonism. For adjunctive treatment, doses are typically kept at or below 0.25 mg twice a day. == Adverse effects == At doses of less than 0.2 mg/day, reserpine has few adverse effects, the most common of which is nasal congestion. Reserpine can cause: nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, gastric intolerance, gastric ulceration (due to increased cholinergic activity in gastric tissue and impaired mucosal quality), stomach cramps and diarrhea. The drug causes hypotension and bradycardia and may worsen asthma. Congested nose and erectile dysfunction are other consequences of alpha-blockade. Central nervous system effects at higher doses (0.5 mg or higher) include drowsiness, dizziness, nightmares, Parkinsonism, general weakness and fatigue. High dose studies in rodents found reserpine to cause fibroadenoma of the breast and malignant tumors of the seminal vesicles among others. Early suggestions that reserpine causes breast cancer in women (risk approximately doubled) were not confirmed. It may also cause hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine passes into breast milk and is harmful to breast-fed infants, and should therefore be avoided during breastfeeding if possible. It may produce an excessive decline in blood pressure at doses needed for treatment of anxiety, depression, or psychosis. == Mechanism of action == Reserpine irreversibly blocks the H+-coupled vesicular monoamine transporters, VMAT1 and VMAT2. VMAT1 is mostly expressed in neuroendocrine cells. VMAT2 is mostly expressed in neurons. Thus, it is the blockade of neuronal VMAT2 by reserpine that inhibits uptake and reduces stores of the monoamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and histamine in the synaptic vesicles of neurons. VMAT2 normally transports free intracellular norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the presynaptic nerve terminal into presynaptic vesicles for subsequent release into the synaptic cleft (""exocytosis""). Unprotected neurotransmitters are metabolized by MAO (as well as by COMT), attached to the outer membrane of the mitochondria in the cytosol of the axon terminals, and consequently never excite the post-synaptic cell. Thus, reserpine increases removal of monoamine neurotransmitters from neurons, decreasing the size of the neurotransmitter pools, and thereby decreasing the amplitude of neurotransmitter release. As it may take the body days to weeks to replenish the depleted VMATs, reserpine's effects are long-lasting. == Biosynthetic pathway == Reserpine is one of dozens of indole alkaloids isolated from the plant Rauvolfia serpentina. In the Rauvolfia plant, tryptophan is the starting material in the biosynthetic pathway of reserpine, and is converted to tryptamine by tryptophan decarboxylase enzyme. Tryptamine is combined with secologanin in the presence of strictosidine synthetase enzyme and yields strictosidine. Various enzymatic conversion reactions lead to the synthesis of reserpine from strictosidine. == History == Reserpine was isolated in 1952 from the dried root of Rauvolfia serpentina (Indian snakeroot), which had been known as Sarpagandha and had been used for centuries in India for the treatment of insanity, as well as fever and snakebites — Mahatma Gandhi used it as a tranquilizer. It was first used in the United States by Robert Wallace Wilkins in 1950. Its molecular structure was elucidated in 1953 and natural configuration published in 1955. It was introduced in 1954, two years after chlorpromazine. The first total synthesis was accomplished by R. B. Woodward in 1958. Reserpine was influential in promoting the thought of a biogenic amine hypothesis of depression. Reserpine-induced depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters in the synapse allegedly caused depression and was cited as evidence that a ""chemical imbalance"", namely low levels of monoamine neurotransmitters, is what causes clinical depression in humans. A 2003 review showed barely any evidence that reserpine actually causes depression in either human patients or animal models. Notably, reserpine was the first compound ever to be shown to be an effective antidepressant in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. A 2022 systematic review found that studies of the influence of reserpine on mood were highly inconsistent, with similar proportions of studies reporting depressogenic effects, no influence on mood, and antidepressant effects. The quality of evidence was limited, and only a subset of studies were randomized controlled trials. Although reserpine itself cannot provide good evidence for the monoamine hypothesis of depression, other lines of evidence support the idea that boosting serotonin or norepinephrine can effectively treat depression, as shown by SSRIs, SNRIs, and tricyclic antidepressants. == Veterinary use == Reserpine is used as a long-acting tranquilizer to subdue excitable or difficult horses and has been used illicitly for the sedation of show horses, for-sale horses, and in other circumstances where a ""quieter"" horse might be desired. It is also used in dart guns. == Research == === Animal model of depression and amotivation === Similarly to tetrabenazine, reserpine, via depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters, produces depression-like effects and lack of motivation or fatigue-like symptoms in animals.

2870,"('Rapamycin', 'Sirolimus', 'Ay 22989', 'I 2190a', 'Rapammune')",Medical,"Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin and sold under the brand name Rapamune among others, is a macrolide compound that is used to coat coronary stents, prevent organ transplant rejection, treat a rare lung disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa). It has immunosuppressant functions in humans and is especially useful in preventing the rejection of kidney transplants. It is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitor that reduces the sensitivity of T cells and B cells to interleukin-2 (IL-2), inhibiting their activity. This compound also has a use in cardiovascular drug-eluting stent technologies to inhibit restenosis. It is produced by the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus and was isolated for the first time in 1972, from samples of Streptomyces hygroscopicus found on Easter Island. The compound was originally named rapamycin after the native name of the island, Rapa Nui. Sirolimus was initially developed as an antifungal agent. However, this use was abandoned when it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties due to its ability to inhibit mTOR. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999. Hyftor (sirolimus gel) was authorized for topical treatment of facial angiofibroma in the European Union in May 2023. == Medical uses == In the US, sirolimus, as Rapamune, is indicated for the prevention of organ transplant rejection and for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis; and, as Fyarro, in the form of protein-bound particles, for the treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa). In the EU, sirolimus, as Rapamune, is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adults at low to moderate immunological risk receiving a renal transplant and for the treatment of people with sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis with moderate lung disease or declining lung function; and, as Hyftor, for the treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. === Prevention of transplant rejection === The chief advantage sirolimus has over calcineurin inhibitors is its low toxicity toward kidneys. Transplant patients maintained on calcineurin inhibitors long-term tend to develop impaired kidney function or even kidney failure; this can be avoided by using sirolimus instead. It is particularly advantageous in patients with kidney transplants for hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as this disease is likely to recur in the transplanted kidney if a calcineurin-inhibitor is used. However, on 7 October 2008, the FDA approved safety labeling revisions for sirolimus to warn of the risk for decreased renal function associated with its use. In 2009, the FDA notified healthcare professionals that a clinical trial conducted by Wyeth showed an increased mortality in stable liver transplant patients after switching from a calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimen to sirolimus. A 2019 cohort study of nearly 10,000 lung transplant recipients in the US demonstrated significantly improved long-term survival using sirolimus + tacrolimus instead of mycophenolate mofetil + tacrolimus for immunosuppressive therapy starting at one year after transplant. Sirolimus can also be used alone, or in conjunction with a calcineurin inhibitor (such as tacrolimus), and/or mycophenolate mofetil, to provide steroid-free immunosuppression regimens. Impaired wound healing and thrombocytopenia are possible side effects of sirolimus; therefore, some transplant centers prefer not to use it immediately after the transplant operation, but instead administer it only after a period of weeks or months. Its optimal role in immunosuppression has not yet been determined, and it remains the subject of a number of ongoing clinical trials. === Lymphangioleiomyomatosis === In May 2015, the FDA approved sirolimus to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, progressive lung disease that primarily affects women of childbearing age. This made sirolimus the first drug approved to treat this disease. LAM involves lung tissue infiltration with smooth muscle-like cells with mutations of the tuberous sclerosis complex gene (TSC2). Loss of TSC2 gene function activates the mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in the release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus blocks this pathway. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus treatment of LAM were investigated in clinical trials that compared sirolimus treatment with a placebo group in 89 patients for 12 months. The patients were observed for 12 months after the treatment had ended. The most commonly reported side effects of sirolimus treatment of LAM were mouth and lip ulcers, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, sore throat, acne, chest pain, leg swelling, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, muscle pain and elevated cholesterol. Serious side effects including hypersensitivity and swelling (edema) have been observed in renal transplant patients. While sirolimus was considered for treatment of LAM, it received orphan drug designation status because LAM is a rare condition. The safety of LAM treatment by sirolimus in people younger than 18 years old has not been tested. === Coronary stent coating === The antiproliferative effect of sirolimus has also been used in conjunction with coronary stents to prevent restenosis in coronary arteries following balloon angioplasty. The sirolimus is formulated in a polymer coating that affords controlled release through the healing period following coronary intervention. Several large clinical studies have demonstrated lower restenosis rates in patients treated with sirolimus-eluting stents when compared to bare-metal stents, resulting in fewer repeat procedures. However, this kind of stent may also increase the risk of vascular thrombosis. === Vascular malformations === Sirolimus is used to treat vascular malformations. Treatment with sirolimus can decrease pain and the fullness of vascular malformations, improve coagulation levels, and slow the growth of abnormal lymphatic vessels. Sirolimus is a relatively new medical therapy for the treatment of vascular malformations in recent years, sirolimus has emerged as a new medical treatment option for both vascular tumors and vascular malformations, as a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), capable of integrating signals from the PI3K/AKT pathway to coordinate proper cell growth and proliferation. Hence, sirolimus is ideal for ""proliferative"" vascular tumors through the control of tissue overgrowth disorders caused by inappropriate activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as an antiproliferative agent. === Angiofibromas === Sirolimus has been used as a topical treatment of angiofibromas with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Facial angiofibromas occur in 80% of patients with TSC, and the condition is very disfiguring. A retrospective review of English-language medical publications reporting on topical sirolimus treatment of facial angiofibromas found sixteen separate studies with positive patient outcomes after using the drug. The reports involved a total of 84 patients, and improvement was observed in 94% of subjects, especially if treatment began during the early stages of the disease. Sirolimus treatment was applied in several different formulations (ointment, gel, solution, and cream), ranging from 0.003 to 1% concentrations. Reported adverse effects included one case of perioral dermatitis, one case of cephalea, and four cases of irritation. In April 2022, sirolimus was approved by the FDA for treating angiofibromas. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse reactions (≥30% occurrence, leading to a 5% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies of organ rejection prophylaxis in individuals with kidney transplants include: peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, pain, constipation, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, increased creatinine, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, arthralgia, and thrombocytopenia. The most common adverse reactions (≥20% occurrence, leading to an 11% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis are: peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, stomatitis, nasopharyngitis, acne, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness, and myalgia. The following adverse effects occurred in 3–20% of individuals taking sirolimus for organ rejection prophylaxis following a kidney transplant: === Diabetes-like symptoms === While sirolimus inhibition of mTORC1 appears to mediate the drug's benefits, it also inhibits mTORC2, which results in diabetes-like symptoms. This includes decreased glucose tolerance and insensitivity to insulin. Sirolimus treatment may additionally increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. In mouse studies, these symptoms can be avoided through the use of alternate dosing regimens or analogs such as everolimus or temsirolimus. === Lung toxicity === Lung toxicity is a serious complication associated with sirolimus therapy, especially in the case of lung transplants. The mechanism of the interstitial pneumonitis caused by sirolimus and other macrolide MTOR inhibitors is unclear, and may have nothing to do with the mTOR pathway. The interstitial pneumonitis is not dose-dependent, but is more common in patients with underlying lung disease. === Lowered effectiveness of immune system === There have been warnings about the use of sirolimus in transplants, where it may increase mortality due to an increased risk of infections. === Cancer risk === Sirolimus may increase an individual's risk for contracting skin cancers from exposure to sunlight or UV radiation, and risk of developing lymphoma. In studies, the skin cancer risk under sirolimus was lower than under other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and calcineurin inhibitors, and lower than under placebo. === Impaired wound healing === Individuals taking sirolimus are at increased risk of experiencing impaired or delayed wound healing, particularly if they have a body mass index more than 30 kg/m2 (classified as obese). == Interactions == Sirolimus is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme and is a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump; hence, inhibitors of either protein may increase sirolimus concentrations in blood plasma, whereas inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations in blood plasma. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Unlike the similarly named tacrolimus, sirolimus is not a calcineurin inhibitor, but it has a similar suppressive effect on the immune system. Sirolimus inhibits IL-2 and other cytokine receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on mTOR, and thereby blocks activation of T and B cells. Ciclosporin and tacrolimus inhibit the secretion of IL-2, by inhibiting calcineurin. The mode of action of sirolimus is to bind the cytosolic protein FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) like tacrolimus. Unlike the tacrolimus-FKBP12 complex, which inhibits calcineurin (PP2B), the sirolimus-FKBP12 complex inhibits the mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin, rapamycin being another name for sirolimus) pathway by directly binding to mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1). mTOR has also been called FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein), RAFT (rapamycin and FKBP target), RAPT1, or SEP. The earlier names FRAP and RAFT were coined to reflect the fact that sirolimus must bind FKBP12 first, and only the FKBP12-sirolimus complex can bind mTOR. However, mTOR is now the widely accepted name, since Tor was first discovered via genetic and molecular studies of sirolimus-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that identified FKBP12, Tor1, and Tor2 as the targets of sirolimus and provided robust support that the FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits Tor1 and Tor2. === Pharmacokinetics === Sirolimus is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme and is a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump. It has linear pharmacokinetics. In studies on N=6 and N=36 subjects, peak concentration was obtained in 1.3 hours +/r- 0.5 hours and the terminal elimination was slow, with a half life around 60 hours +/- 10 hours. Sirolimus was not found to effect the concentration of ciclosporin, which is also metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 enzyme. The bioavailabiliy of sirolimus is low, and the absorption of sirolimus into the blood stream from the intestine varies widely between patients, with some patients having up to eight times more exposure than others for the same dose. Drug levels are, therefore, taken to make sure patients get the right dose for their condition. This is determined by taking a blood sample before the next dose, which gives the trough level. However, good correlation is noted between trough concentration levels and drug exposure, known as area under the concentration-time curve, for both sirolimus (SRL) and tacrolimus (TAC) (SRL: r2 = 0.83; TAC: r2 = 0.82), so only one level need be taken to know its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. PK profiles of SRL and of TAC are unaltered by simultaneous administration. Dose-corrected drug exposure of TAC correlates with SRL (r2 = 0.8), so patients have similar bioavailability of both. == Chemistry == Sirolimus is a natural product and macrocyclic lactone. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of the rapamycin core is accomplished by a type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in conjunction with a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The domains responsible for the biosynthesis of the linear polyketide of rapamycin are organized into three multienzymes, RapA, RapB, and RapC, which contain a total of 14 modules (figure 1). The three multienzymes are organized such that the first four modules of polyketide chain elongation are in RapA, the following six modules for continued elongation are in RapB, and the final four modules to complete the biosynthesis of the linear polyketide are in RapC. Then, the linear polyketide is modified by the NRPS, RapP, which attaches L-pipecolate to the terminal end of the polyketide, and then cyclizes the molecule, yielding the unbound product, prerapamycin. The core macrocycle, prerapamycin (figure 2), is then modified (figure 3) by an additional five enzymes, which lead to the final product, rapamycin. First, the core macrocycle is modified by RapI, SAM-dependent O-methyltransferase (MTase), which O-methylates at C39. Next, a carbonyl is installed at C9 by RapJ, a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450). Then, RapM, another MTase, O-methylates at C16. Finally, RapN, another P-450, installs a hydroxyl at C27 immediately followed by O-methylation by Rap Q, a distinct MTase, at C27 to yield rapamycin. The biosynthetic genes responsible for rapamycin synthesis have been identified. As expected, three extremely large open reading frames (ORF's) designated as rapA, rapB, and rapC encode for three extremely large and complex multienzymes, RapA, RapB, and RapC, respectively. The gene rapL has been established to code for a NAD+-dependent lysine cycloamidase, which converts L-lysine to L-pipecolic acid (figure 4) for incorporation at the end of the polyketide. The gene rapP, which is embedded between the PKS genes and translationally coupled to rapC, encodes for an additional enzyme, an NPRS responsible for incorporating L-pipecolic acid, chain termination and cyclization of prerapamycin. In addition, genes rapI, rapJ, rapM, rapN, rapO, and rapQ have been identified as coding for tailoring enzymes that modify the macrocyclic core to give rapamycin (figure 3). Finally, rapG and rapH have been identified to code for enzymes that have a positive regulatory role in the preparation of rapamycin through the control of rapamycin PKS gene expression. Biosynthesis of this 31-membered macrocycle begins as the loading domain is primed with the starter unit, 4,5-dihydroxocyclohex-1-ene-carboxylic acid, which is derived from the shikimate pathway. Note that the cyclohexane ring of the starting unit is reduced during the transfer to module 1. The starting unit is then modified by a series of Claisen condensations with malonyl or methylmalonyl substrates, which are attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and extend the polyketide by two carbons each. After each successive condensation, the growing polyketide is further modified according to enzymatic domains that are present to reduce and dehydrate it, thereby introducing the diversity of functionalities observed in rapamycin (figure 1). Once the linear polyketide is complete, L-pipecolic acid, which is synthesized by a lysine cycloamidase from an L-lysine, is added to the terminal end of the polyketide by an NRPS. Then, the NSPS cyclizes the polyketide, giving prerapamycin, the first enzyme-free product. The macrocyclic core is then customized by a series of post-PKS enzymes through methylations by MTases and oxidations by P-450s to yield rapamycin. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In February 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Hyftor, intended for the treatment of angiofibroma. The applicant for this medicinal product is Plusultra pharma GmbH. Hyftor was authorized for medical used in the European Union in May 2023. Sirolimus, as Rapamune solution, was approved for medical use in the United States in 1999; and as Rapamune tablets in August 2000. Sirolimus, as Fyarro, was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2021. Sirolimus, as Hyftor, was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2022. == Research == === Cancer === The antiproliferative effects of sirolimus may have a role in treating cancer. When dosed appropriately, sirolimus can enhance the immune response to tumor targeting or otherwise promote tumor regression in clinical trials. Sirolimus seems to lower the cancer risk in some transplant patients. Sirolimus was shown to inhibit the progression of dermal Kaposi's sarcoma in patients with renal transplants. Other mTOR inhibitors, such as temsirolimus (CCI-779) or everolimus (RAD001), are being tested for use in cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme and mantle cell lymphoma. However, these drugs have a higher rate of fatal adverse events in cancer patients than control drugs. A combination therapy of doxorubicin and sirolimus has been shown to drive Akt-positive lymphomas into remission in mice. Akt signalling promotes cell survival in Akt-positive lymphomas and acts to prevent the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. Sirolimus blocks Akt signalling and the cells lose their resistance to the chemotherapy. Bcl-2-positive lymphomas were completely resistant to the therapy; eIF4E-expressing lymphomas are not sensitive to sirolimus. === Tuberous sclerosis complex === Sirolimus also shows promise in treating tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a congenital disorder that predisposes those afflicted to benign tumor growth in the brain, heart, kidneys, skin, and other organs. After several studies conclusively linked mTOR inhibitors to remission in TSC tumors, specifically subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in children and angiomyolipomas in adults, many US doctors began prescribing sirolimus (Wyeth's Rapamune) and everolimus (Novartis's RAD001) to TSC patients off-label. Numerous clinical trials using both rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with TSC, are underway in the United States. === Effects on longevity === mTOR, specifically mTORC1, was first shown to be important in aging in 2003, in a study on worms; sirolimus was shown to inhibit and slow aging in worms, yeast, and flies, and then to improve the condition of mouse models of various diseases of aging. Sirolimus was first shown to extend lifespan in wild-type mice in a study published by NIH investigators in 2009; the studies have been replicated in mice of many different genetic backgrounds. A study published in 2020 found late-life sirolimus dosing schedules enhanced mouse lifespan in a sex-specific manner: limited rapamycin exposure enhanced male but not female lifespan, providing evidence for sex differences in sirolimus response. The results are further supported by the finding that genetically modified mice with impaired mTORC1 signalling live longer. Sirolimus has potential for widespread use as a longevity-promoting drug, with evidence pointing to its ability to prevent age-associated decline of cognitive and physical health. In 2014, researchers at Novartis showed that a related compound, everolimus, increased elderly patients' immune response on an intermittent dose. This led to many in the anti-aging community self-experimenting with the compound. However, because of the different biochemical properties of sirolimus, the dosing is potentially very different from that of everolimus. Ultimately, due to known side-effects of sirolimus, as well as inadequate evidence for optimal dosing, it was concluded in 2016 that more research was required before sirolimus could be widely prescribed for this purpose. Two human studies on the effects of sirolimus (rapamycin) on longevity did not show statistically significant benefits. However, due to limitations in the studies, further research is needed to fully assess its potential in humans. Sirolimus has complex effects on the immune system—while IL-12 goes up and IL-10 decreases, which suggests an immunostimulatory response, TNF and IL-6 are decreased, which suggests an immunosuppressive response. The duration of the inhibition and the exact extent to which mTORC1 and mTORC2 are inhibited play a role, but were not yet well understood according to a 2015 paper. === Topical administration === When applied as a topical preparation, researchers showed that rapamycin can regenerate collagen and reverse clinical signs of aging in elderly patients. The concentrations are far lower than those used to treat angiofibromas. === SARS-CoV-2 === Rapamycin has been proposed as a treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 insofar as its immunosuppressive effects could prevent or reduce the cytokine storm seen in very serious cases of COVID-19. Moreover, inhibition of cell proliferation by rapamycin could reduce viral replication. === Atherosclerosis === Rapamycin can accelerate degradation of oxidized LDL cholesterol in endothelial cells, thereby lowering the risk of atherosclerosis. Oxidized LDL cholesterol is a major contributor to atherosclerosis. === Lupus === As of 2016, studies in cells, animals, and humans have suggested that mTOR activation as process underlying systemic lupus erythematosus and that inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin may be a disease-modifying treatment. As of 2016 rapamycin had been tested in small clinical trials in people with lupus. === Lymphatic malformation (LM) === Lymphatic malformation, lymphangioma or cystic hygroma, is an abnormal growth of lymphatic vessels that usually affects children around the head and neck area and more rarely involving the tongue causing macroglossia. LM is caused by a PIK3CA mutation during lymphangiogenesis early in gestational cell formation causing the malformation of lymphatic tissue. Treatment often consists of removal of the affected tissue via excision, laser ablation or sclerotherapy, but the rate of recurrence can be high and surgery can have complications. Sirolimus has shown evidence of being an effective treatment in alleviating symptoms and reducing the size of the malformation by way of altering the mTOR pathway in lymphangiogenesis. Although an off label use of the drug, Sirolimus has been shown to be an effective treatment for both microcystic and macrocystic LM. More research is however needed to develop and create targeted, effective treatment therapies for LM. === Graft-versus-host disease === Due to its immunosuppressant activity, Rapamycin has been assessed as prophylaxis or treatment agent of Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. While contrasted results were obtained in clinical trials, pre-clinical studies have shown that Rapamycin can mitigate GVHD by increasing the proliferation of regulatory T cells, inhibiting cytotoxic T cells and lowering the differentiation of effector T cells. === Applications in biology research === Rapamycin is used in biology research as an agent for chemically induced dimerization. In this application, rapamycin is added to cells expressing two fusion constructs, one of which contains the rapamycin-binding FRB domain from mTOR and the other of which contains an FKBP domain. Each fusion protein also contains additional domains that are brought into proximity when rapamycin induces binding of FRB and FKBP. In this way, rapamycin can be used to control and study protein localization and interactions. == Veterinary uses == A number of veterinary medicine teaching hospitals are participating in a long-term clinical study examining the effect of rapamycin on the longevity of dogs. A clinical trial lead by NC State College of Veterinary Medicine (HALT), run at a number of veterinary hospitals across the US, found that rapamycin reverses the effects of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in cats. In March 2025, the US Food and Drug Administration announced conditional approval of sirolimus delayed-release tablets (Felycin-CA1) for the management of ventricular hypertrophy in cats with subclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This is the first product approved for use in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy for any indication. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in cats causes thickening of the heart's left ventricle. It is the most common heart disease in cats and is one of the most common causes of death in cats. While the cause is unknown in most cases, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with a genetic mutation in certain breeds, such as Maine Coons, Ragdolls, and Persians. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a progressive disease. Cats in the subclinical phase have thickening of their heart wall but do not show clinical symptoms of the disease yet. Cats may live for years in the subclinical phase, while others may progress to congestive heart failure, arterial thromboembolism, or sudden death. == References == == Further reading == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02494570 for ""A Phase 2 Study of ABI-009 in Patients With Advanced Malignant PEComa (AMPECT)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Sirolimus,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00013493580627255142), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10024131089448929)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='Sirolimus', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus?utm_source=openai')])"

2872,"('Butylparaben', 'Butyl parahydroxybenzoate', 'Butyl paraben', 'Butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate', 'Butyl p-hydroxybenzoate')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Butylparaben, or butyl p-hydroxybenzoate, is an organic compound with the formula C4H9O2CC6H4OH. It is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents. It has proven to be a highly successful antimicrobial preservative in cosmetics. It is also used in medication suspensions, and as a flavoring additive in food. == Natural occurrence == Members of the paraben family are found in fruit and vegetable products, such as barley, flax seed, and grapes. Butylparaben has also been found to be produced in some microorganisms including Microbulbifer . == Preparation == Butylparaben is prepared by the esterification of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid with 1-butanol in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid. It is produced industrially. == Uses and reactions == Butylparaben is one of the most common bactericidal/fungicidal additives in cosmetics. It has been used in cosmetic products since the 1940s and in pharmaceutical products since 1924. The popularity of butylparaben in these products is due to its low toxicity in humans and its effective antimicrobial properties, in particular those against mold and yeast. It is now found in more than 20,000 cosmetic products including eye shadow, facial moisturizer/treatment, anti-aging cream, foundation, and sunscreen. It is also used as low-ionic strength solutions as a preservative in some foods and drugs. In most cosmetics paraben is used at low levels, ranging from 0.01 to 0.3%. Butylparaben is used in low concentrations in liquid and solid medication suspensions, such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen. === Mechanism of action === The exact mechanism of how parabens work is unknown but they are proposed to act by inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis, and enzymes like ATPase and phosphotransferase in some bacterial species. It has also been suggested that they interfere with membrane transport processes by disrupting the lipid bilayer and possibly causing the leakage of intracellular constituents. == Regulation and controversy == Butylparaben has not escaped controversy, which itself is controversial. In December 2010 the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Union reported that insufficient data is available to perform risk assessments for butylparaben in humans. The committee has also stated that it considers the use of butylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives in finished cosmetic products as safe to the consumer, as long as the sum of their individual concentrations does not exceed 0.19%.[1] === Regulation === Denmark restricts butylparaben in products for use by children younger than the age of three. In 2003, butylparaben was approved for use as a flavor additive in food by the U.S. Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. Butylparaben is also regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Its pesticide registration was canceled in 1998. in 2020 European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) added Butylparaben to very high concern (SVHC) in the Candidate List for eventual inclusion in Annex XIV REACH in category ""Toxic for reproduction"". === Endocrine disruption === Long-chained parabens, like butylparaben, are more estrogenic than short-chained parabens, like methyl- or ethylparaben. This difference is attributed to the greater lipophilicity of the former. Butylparaben displayed the most competitive binding to rat estrogen receptors when tested along with methyl, ethyl, and propylparabens. === Antiandrogenic === Butylparaben can decrease sperm function and alter metabolic hormones. Rats exposed to a high concentration of butylparaben during pregnancy gave birth to fewer pups, and pups with malformed reproductive organs. Mice administered butylparaben at 0.01-1% body weight for ten weeks showed a decrease in serum testosterone concentration and in spermatid counts in the seminiferous tubules. === Other === It has been shown that butylparaben enter the body through the lungs, GI tract, and skin epithelium. It occurs in breast cancers at around 20.6±4.2 ng/g tissue. However, parabens have not been proven to cause breast cancer. Estimates by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition have found that the average person is exposed to about 37 ng of butylparaben per day. Butylparaben has been found in small concentrations in human breast fat and breast tumors. A review by the National Toxicology Program concluded, ""There is no evidence of demonstrable risk for the development of breast cancer caused by the use of paraben-containing underarm cosmetics."" Animal studies have been inconclusive. Oral administration of butylparaben to eight-week-old rats has caused tumors such as thymic lymphoma, non-thymic lymphoid leukemia, and myeloid leukemia. Similar studies, however, have found no significant increase in tumors upon butylparaben administration. Butylparaben is not listed as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. == Environmental fate == Butylparaben has been found in the sewage. A 2001 study found that concentrations of parabens in Danish sewage facilities was to 1/100 to 1/1000 of the acute or chronic effect concentrations. == Notes ==",Butyl p-hydroxybenzoate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.6167570948600769), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.25511619448661804), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -1.688212614681106e-05), (' MED', -0.03804333135485649), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.07902330160140991), (' INDUSTR', -0.0025534271262586117), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.39332544803619385), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -9.822363062994555e-05), ('ĠFOOD', -0.49363958835601807), (',', -9.179073458653875e-06), ('ĠPERSON', -0.0035203646402806044), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -2.1815061700181104e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6932387351989746)])","('PERSONAL CARE, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.0004343645414337516), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.00020354038861114532), (' FOOD', -0.03804252669215202), (',', -0.693148672580719), (' INDUSTR', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butylparaben,https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/n-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoate-99-thermo-scientific-1/p-7021632,https://www.femaflavor.org/flavor-library/butyl-p-hydroxybenzoate ', [])"
