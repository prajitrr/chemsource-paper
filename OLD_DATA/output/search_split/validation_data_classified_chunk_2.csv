200,"('Cisapride', 'R 51619', '(¬±)-cisaprid', 'Cisaprida', 'Cisapridum')",Medical,"Cisapride is a gastroprokinetic agent, a drug that increases motility in the upper gastrointestinal tract. It acts directly as a serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist and indirectly as a parasympathomimetic. Stimulation of the serotonin receptors increases acetylcholine release in the enteric nervous system. It has been sold under the trade names Prepulsid (Janssen-Ortho) and Propulsid (in the United States). It was discovered by Janssen Pharmaceuticals in 1980. In many countries, it has been either withdrawn from the market or had its indications limited due to incidence of serious cardiac side-effects. Propulsid was linked to children's deaths. The commercial preparations of this drug are the racemic mixture of both enantiomers of the compound. The (+) enantiomer itself has the major pharmacologic effects and does not induce many of the detrimental side-effects of the mixture. == Medical uses == Cisapride has been used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). There is no evidence it is effective for this use in children. It also increases gastric emptying in people with diabetic gastroparesis. Evidence for its use in constipation is not clear. In many countries, it has been either withdrawn or had its indications limited because of reports of the side-effect long QT syndrome, which may cause arrhythmias. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning letter to doctors, and cisapride was voluntarily removed from the U.S. market on July 14, 2000. Its use in Europe has also been limited. It was banned in India and in the Philippines in 2011. == Veterinary uses == Cisapride is still available in the United States and Canada for use in animals, and is commonly prescribed by veterinarians to treat megacolon in cats. Cisapride is also commonly used to treat GI stasis in rabbits, sometimes in conjunction with metoclopramide (Reglan). == Kinetics == Oral bioavailability of cisapride is approximately 33%. It is inactivated primarily by hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 with a half-life of 10 hours. The dose of the drug should be reduced in case of liver diseases. == Pharmacology and mechanism of action == As a prokinetic agent that increases gastrointestinal motility, cisapride acts as a selective serotonin agonist in the 5-HT4 receptor subtype. Cisapride also relieves constipation-like symptoms by indirectly stimulating the release of acetylcholine, which acts on muscarinic receptors. == See also == Domperidone Drug of last resort Serotonin-agonising laxatives Benzamide Itopride Metoclopramide Mosapride Prucalopride == References == == Further reading == == External links == Archived Drug Label",Cisapride,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.0280383548888494e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.092700980138034e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008624804206192493)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisapride?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='Cisapride', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisapride?utm_source=openai')])"

202,"('Isavuconazole', 'Isavuconazole [inn]', 'Isavuconazole (inn)', 'Isavuconazole(bal-4815; ro-0094815)', 'Isavuconazol')",Medical,"Isavuconazonium, sold under the brand name Cresemba, is a systemic antifungal medication of the triazole class which is used to treat invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. It is used as the sulfate. It is taken by mouth or given via injection into a vein. The most common side effects include abnormal liver tests, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, injection site reactions, headache, low blood potassium and skin rash. Isavuconazonium is a prodrug of isavuconazole. == Medical uses == Isavuconazonium is used to treat invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis in adults aged eighteen years old and older. It is available in a capsule for administration by mouth and as a powder for administration via infusion. == Contraindications == Isavuconazonium is contraindicated in people taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inducers, or moderate CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 inducers. It is contraindicated in people with familial short QT syndrome. == Side effects == Common adverse effects (occurring in between 1 and 10% of people) include low potassium, decreased appetite, delirium, headache, sleepiness, vein inflammation, difficulty breathing, acute respiratory failure, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, elevated results in liver function tests, rash, itchy skin, kidney failure, chest pain, and fatigue. There are several uncommon side effects as well. In preclinical studies, isavuconazonium caused birth defects in animals; it has not been tested in pregnant women. == Interactions == Isavuconazonium is converted into isavuconazole inside the body, and isavuconazole is a substrate for CYP3A4 or CYP3A5. Many other medications inhibit or induce those two enzymes, and isavuconazonium should not be administered with them. Inducers result in levels of isavuconazole that are too low and won't work, and inhibitors can cause high levels of isavuconazole which will in turn cause increased adverse events and toxicity. Likewise isavuconazonium can interfere with appropriate dosing of other drugs that are substrates for those enzymes. In addition, isavuconazole induces CYP2B6 and can decrease the amount of drugs that are metabolized by the enzyme. Isavuconazole inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, SLC22A2, and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases, each of which remove drugs from circulation; isavuconazonium will increase the amount of drugs that are affected by those proteins and may increase their toxicities. == Pharmacology == After oral or intravenous administration, isavuconazonium is rapidly hydrolysed by esterases in blood or the gastrointestinal tract to the active form, isavuconazole. Isavuconazole works by inhibition of lanosterol 14α-demethylase, the enzyme responsible for converting lanosterol to ergosterol by demethylation. The resulting depletion of ergosterol and buildup of lanosterol compromise the structure of the fungal cell membrane. Mammalian cells are resistant to demethylation inhibition by azoles, making the drug effects specific to fungi. == Chemistry == Isavuconazonium comprises an N-(3-acetoxypropyl)-N-methylamino-carboxymethyl group linked through an ester moiety to the triazole nitrogen in isavuconazole. In the aquatic media of the body, the isavuconazole molecule is transformed into monohydrate. == History == Isavuconazole and isavuconazonium were discovered in Japan by researchers at Roche's research center in Kamakura. Basilea Pharmaceutica, which had been spun out of Roche to develop antimicrobial assets, developed isavuconazonium through Phase II clinical trials. In February 2010, Basilea partnered with Astellas Pharma to complete Phase III trials, obtain regulatory approvals, and market the drug. In 2013 and 2014, the partners won orphan drug designation in the US for isavuconazonium for treating invasive aspergillosis, mucormycosis, and invasive candidiasis. In 2014, Basilea and Astellas amended the agreement to give Astellas sole marketing authority in North America, and Basilea the rights to market in the rest of the world. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval in March 2015, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved it in October 2015. In 2017, Basilea licensed rights to Pfizer to market isavuconazole in Europe and other regions. == References ==",Isavuconazole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.400034933700226e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001995002618059516)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([kegg.jp](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D10750?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=72, start_index=9, title='KEGG DRUG: Isavuconazole', type='url_citation', url='https://www.kegg.jp/entry/D10750?utm_source=openai')])"
203,"('Aripiprazole lauroxil', 'Aristada', '[7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butoxy]-2-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinolin-1-yl]methyl dodecanoate', 'Aripiprazole lauroxil [usan]', 'Aripiprazole lauroxil (usan)')",Medical,"Aripiprazole lauroxil, sold under the brand name Aristada among others, is a long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic that was developed by Alkermes. It is an N-acyloxymethyl prodrug of aripiprazole that is administered via intramuscular injection once every four to eight weeks for the treatment of schizophrenia. Aripiprazole lauroxil was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2015. == Medical uses == Aripiprazole lauroxil is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Aripiprazole lauroxil is a longer-lasting and injectable version of the schizophrenia pill aripiprazole. Aripiprazole lauroxil, along with other drugs in its family, are not approved for treatment of the elderly with dementia-related psychosis. == Side effects == The most common side effects are akathisia. According to the drug's warning label and safety information, the side effects are large in variety. The complete list of side effects include: akathisia, contraindication cerebrovascular adverse reactions (including stroke), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, metabolic changes, hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, orthostatic hypotension, leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, seizures, potential for cognitive and motor impairment, difficulties with body temperature regulation, dysphagia, injection site reactions (rash, swelling, redness, irritation at the point of injection), dystonia and pregnancy and nursing complications. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. === Overdosing === The largest known case of ingestion with a known outcome involved a 1260 mg of oral aripiprazole, 42 times the recommended dose. The patient survived and fully recovered. Common adverse reactions, reported in at least 5% of overdose cases, included vomiting, somnolence, and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms of overdoses include acidosis, aggression, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusion, convulsion, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, pneumonia aspiration, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and tachycardia. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Arristada is injected intramuscularly as an atypical antipsychotic. In one 12-week clinical trial involving 622 participants, the efficacy of extended aripiprazole was demonstrated. Its mechanism of action is not completely known, but is thought to be converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole. The hydroxymethyl aripiprazole is then hydrolysed to aripiprazole. Efficacy could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors. Since it is a newly approved drug by the FDA, many validation of mechanisms of action are still being studied. === Pharmacodynamics === Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A receptors, dopamine D2, and dopamine D3. Moderate affinity is exhibited for serotonin 5-HT7, α1-adrenergic, dopamine D4, histamine H1, and serotonin re-uptake site. No affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors have been found. === Pharmacokinetics === Aristada's activity in the body is due to aripiprazole and also dehydro-aripiprazole. Dehydro-aripiprazole has been shown to have affinities for D2 receptors. These D2 receptors have similarities to aripiprazole whereas they represent 30-40% of exposure of aripiprazole in plasma. After five to six days of the single intramuscular injection appearance of aripiprazole in circulation, it additionally will be released for 36 days. In the fourth monthly injection, consecutive doses of Aristada will reach steady-state. With additional supplements of the oral aripiprazole at a dosage of 21 days during the first dose of Aristada, aripiprazole concentrations within 4 days can reach therapeutic levels. == Chemistry == In contrast to many other depot antipsychotics, aripiprazole lauroxil is described as a non-ester chemical modification. It is specifically N-lauroyloxymethylaripiprazole. However, the N-lauroyloxymethyl moiety contains a laurate ester, technically making aripiprazole lauroxil an antipsychotic ester. More specifically, aripiprazole lauroxil is the laurate ester of N-hydroxymethylaripiprazole. Following cleavage of the laurate ester, N-hydroxymethylaripiprazole is further metabolized to aripiprazole, making aripiprazole lauroxil a prodrug of aripiprazole with N-hydroxymethylaripiprazole as an intermediate. == References ==",Aristada,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.98412734689191e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010156115604331717)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.128163257315464e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripiprazole_lauroxil,https://www.drugs.com/aristada.html,https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/aristada ', [])"
204,"('Griseofulvin', 'Amudane', 'Grisactin', 'Grisefuline', 'Griseofulvinum')",Medical,"Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication used to treat a number of types of dermatophytoses (ringworm). This includes fungal infections of the nails and scalp, as well as the skin when antifungal creams have not worked. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include allergic reactions, nausea, diarrhea, headache, trouble sleeping, and feeling tired. It is not recommended in people with liver failure or porphyria. Use during or in the months before pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Griseofulvin works by interfering with fungal mitosis. Griseofulvin was discovered in 1939 from the soil fungus Penicillium griseofulvum. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Griseofulvin is used orally only for dermatophytosis. It is ineffective topically. It is reserved for cases in which topical treatment with creams is ineffective. Terbinafine given for 2 to 4 weeks is at least as effective as griseofulvin given for 6 to 8 weeks for treatment of Trichophyton scalp infections. However, griseofulvin is more effective than terbinafine for treatment of Microsporum scalp infections. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The drug binds to tubulin, interfering with microtubule function, thus inhibiting mitosis. It binds to keratin in keratin precursor cells and makes them resistant to fungal infections. The drug reaches its site of action only when hair or skin is replaced by the keratin-griseofulvin complex. Griseofulvin then enters the dermatophyte through energy-dependent transport processes and binds to fungal microtubules. This alters the processing for mitosis and also underlying information for deposition of fungal cell walls. == Biosynthesis == It is produced industrially by fermenting the fungus Penicillium griseofulvum. The first step in the biosynthesis of griseofulvin by P. griseofulvin is the synthesis of the 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain by a type I iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) via iterative addition of 6 malonyl-CoA to an acyl-CoA starter unit. The 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain undergoes cyclization/aromatization, using cyclase/aromatase, respectively, through a Claisen and aldol condensation to form the benzophenone intermediate. The benzophenone intermediate is then methylated via S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) twice to yield griseophenone C. The griseophenone C is then halogenated at the activated site ortho to the phenol group on the left aromatic ring to form griseophenone B. The halogenated species then undergoes a single phenolic oxidation in both rings forming the two oxygen diradical species. The right oxygen radical shifts alpha to the carbonyl via resonance allowing for a stereospecific radical coupling by the oxygen radical on the left ring forming a tetrahydrofuranone species. The newly formed grisan skeleton with a spiro center is then O-methylated by SAM to generate dehydrogriseofulvin. Ultimately, a stereoselective reduction of the olefin on dehydrogriseofulvin by NADPH affords griseofulvin. == Toxicology == === Mice === Griseofulvin is found to alter the bile metabolism of mice by Yokoo et al. 1979. The same team went on to find a similar effect on mice by a chemically unrelated substance, 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine, in Yokoo et al. 1982 and Tsunoo et al. 1987. == References ==",Grisefuline,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.5523738915799186e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019331354415044188)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.47407791018486023)])","('INFO; ([vidal.fr](https://www.vidal.fr/actualites/27396-grisefuline-arret-de-commercialisation-et-recommandations-pour-le-traitement-de-la-teigne-chez-l-enfant.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=184, start_index=6, title=""GRISEFULINE : arrêt de commercialisation et recommandations pour le traitement de la teigne chez l'enfant"", type='url_citation', url='https://www.vidal.fr/actualites/27396-grisefuline-arret-de-commercialisation-et-recommandations-pour-le-traitement-de-la-teigne-chez-l-enfant.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is under trial for its use as combination treatment for Hepatitis D Virus. The most common side effects included nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, infection, decreased appetite and fatigue. Lonafarnib was approved for medical use in the United States in November 2020, and in the European Union in July 2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Lonafarnib is indicated to be used to reduce the risk of death due to Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and for the treatment of certain other processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies in people one year of age and older. Ongoing studies and clinical trials have found a correlation of lonafarnib treatment with cure of hepatitis D (HDV).

The effectiveness of lonafarnib for the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome was demonstrated in 62 patients from two single-arm trials (Trial 1/NCT00425607 and Trial 2/NCT00916747) that were compared to matched, untreated patients from a separate natural history study. Compared to untreated patients, the lifespan of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome patients treated with lonafarnib increased by an average of three months through the first three years of treatment and by an average of 2.5 years through the maximum follow-up time of 11 years. Lonafarnib's approval for the treatment of certain processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies that are very rare took into account similarities in the underlying genetic mechanism of disease and other available data. The participants were from 34 countries around the world, including the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for lonafarnib priority review, orphan drug, and breakthrough therapy designations. In addition, the manufacturer received a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. The FDA granted the approval of Zokinvy to Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 19 May 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances for the medicinal product Zokinvy, intended for the treatment of patients with progeroid syndromes. The applicant for this medicinal product is EigerBio Europe Limited. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in July 2022. == Research == Lonafarnib is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) that has been investigated in a human clinical trial as a treatment for progeria, which is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at a very early age. Lonafarnib is a synthetic tricyclic halogenated carboxamide with antineoplastic properties. As such, it is used primarily for cancer treatment. For those with progeria, research has shown that the drug reduces the prevalence of stroke and transient ischemic attack, and the prevalence and frequency of headaches while taking the medication.

208,"('Flecainide (acetate)', 'Flecainide', 'Flecaine', 'N-(piperidin-2-ylmethyl)-2,5-bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)benzamide', 'Tambocor')",Medical,"Flecainide is a medication used to prevent and treat abnormally fast heart rates. This includes ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias. Its use is only recommended in those with dangerous arrhythmias or when significant symptoms cannot be managed with other treatments. Its use does not decrease a person's risk of death. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein. Common side effects include dizziness, problems seeing, shortness of breath, chest pain, and tiredness. Serious side effects may include cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure. It may be used in pregnancy, but has not been well studied in this population. Use is not recommended in those with structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease. Flecainide is a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent. It works by decreasing the entry of sodium in heart cells, causing prolongation of the cardiac action potential. Flecainide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1985. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 205th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Flecainide is used in the treatment of many types of supraventricular tachycardias, including AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). It also has limited use in the treatment of certain forms of ventricular tachycardia (VT). In particular, flecainide has been useful in the treatment of ventricular tachycardias that are not in the setting of an acute ischemic event. It has use in the treatment of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia and in the suppression of arrhythmias in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). Studies (notably the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial) have shown an increased mortality when flecainide is used to suppress ventricular extrasystoles in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. In individuals suspected of having the Brugada syndrome, the administration of flecainide may help reveal the ECG findings that are characteristic of the disease process. This may help make the diagnosis of the disease in equivocal cases. Flecainide has been introduced into the treatment of arrhythmias in children. In the long-term, flecainide seems to be safe in people with a healthy heart with no signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease, or heart failure. == Side effects == Results of a medical study known as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) demonstrated that patients with structural heart disease (such as a history of MI (heart attack), or left ventricular dysfunction) and also patients with ventricular arrhythmias, should not take this drug. The results were so significant that the trial was stopped early and preliminary results were published. The dose may need to be adjusted in certain clinical scenarios. As with all other antiarrhythmic agents, there is a risk of proarrhythmia associated with the use of flecainide. This risk is probably increased when flecainide is co-administered with other class Ic antiarrhythmics, such as encainide. The risk of proarrhythmia may also be increased by hypokalemia. The risk of proarrhythmia is not necessarily associated with the length of time an individual is taking flecainide, and cases of late proarrhythmia have been reported. Because of the role of both the liver and the kidneys in the elimination of flecainide, the dosing of flecainide may need to be adjusted in individuals who develop either liver failure or kidney failure. Because of the negative inotropic effects of flecainide, it should be used with caution in individuals with depressed ejection fraction, and may worsen congestive heart failure in these individuals. It should be avoided in people with ischaemic heart disease and the elderly. As with all class I antiarrhythmic agents, flecainide increases the capture thresholds of pacemakers. === Heart === Due to the narrow therapeutic index of flecainide, physicians should be alert for signs of toxicity before life-threatening arrhythmias occur like torsades de pointes. While the toxic effects of flecainide are closely related to the plasma levels of the drug, it is unfeasible to check the plasma concentration in an individual on a regular basis. Signs of flecainide toxicity include marked prolongation of the PR interval and widening of the QRS duration on the surface ECG. There may be signs and symptoms attributable to overt heart failure secondary to sudden decreased myocardial contractility. ==== Treatment ==== Treatment of flecainide cardiac toxicity involves increasing the excretion of flecainide, blocking its effects in the heart, and (rarely) institution of cardiovascular support to avoid impending lethal arrhythmias. Modalities that have had success include administration of a beta-sympathomimetic agent, and administration of a sodium load(often in the form of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate). Placing the individual on cardiopulmonary bypass support may be necessary in order to temporarily remove the need for a beating heart and to increase blood flow to the liver. === Lungs === Flecainide has a very high affinity for lung tissue and is associated with drug-induced interstitial lung disease. == Interactions == Flecainide has high bioavailability after an oral dose, meaning that most of the drug that is ingested will enter the systemic blood stream. Peak serum concentrations can be seen 1 to 6 hours after ingestion of an oral dose. While the plasma half-life is about 20 hours, it is quite variable, and can range from 12 to 27 hours. During oral loading with flecainide, a steady state equilibrium is typically achieved in 3 to 5 days. The majority of flecainide is eliminated by the kidneys, with the remainder metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 isoenzyme in the liver. Therefore, alterations in renal function or urine pH will greatly affect the elimination of flecainide, as more is eliminated by the kidney than by the hepatic route. Because of the dual elimination routes of flecainide and its tendency to decrease myocardial contractility, flecainide interacts with numerous pharmaceuticals and can potentiate the effects of other myocardial depressants and AV node blocking agents. In addition, flecainide can decrease the metabolism or elimination of many (but not all) agents that use the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. A full list of drug interactions with flecainide can be obtained from the manufacturer. Some important drug interactions with flecainide include: Alcohol – may further depress normal heart function Amiodarone – inhibits cytochrome P450 2D6 and may increase flecainide levels Cimetidine – increases flecainide levels by 30% and half-life by 10% Digoxin – may increase digoxin levels Paroxetine – increased effect of both drugs Propafenone – increased effect of both drugs and increased risk of toxicity Quinidine – inhibits cytochrome P450 2D6 and may increase flecainide levels == Overdose == Flecainide intoxication is rare but serious due to the cardiogenic shock that it provokes. Its diagnosis can be difficult in the lack of contributing anamnestic elements. Clinical and paraclinical signs are not specific. Treatment is primarily symptomatic, which gives good results thanks to the hypertonic solution of sodium salts. Organ donation is possible in the case of braindead patients who had a flecainide intoxication. == Mechanism of action == Flecainide works by blocking the Nav1.5 sodium channel in the heart, slowing the upstroke of the cardiac action potential. This thereby slows conduction of the electrical impulse within the heart, i.e. it ""reduces excitability"". The greatest effect is on the His-Purkinje system and ventricular myocardium. The effect of flecainide on the ventricular myocardium causes decreased contractility of the muscle, which leads to a decrease in the ejection fraction. The effect of flecainide on the sodium channels of the heart increases as the heart rate increases; This is known as use-dependence and is why that flecainide is useful to break a tachyarrhythmia. Flecainide also inhibits ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), a major regulator of sarcoplasmic release of stored calcium ions. It can reduce calcium sparks and thus arrhythmogenic calcium waves in the heart. While Flecainide therapy has been shown to suppress ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and mouse models of this disease, the relative contribution from the inhibition of sodium channels and of RyR2 in this effect on CPVT is unclear. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Flecainide is sold under the trade name Tambocor (manufactured by 3M pharmaceuticals). Flecainide went off-patent in February 2004. In addition to being marketed as Tambocor, it is available in generic version and under the brand names Almarytm, Apocard, Ecrinal, and Flécaine. == References ==",Tambocor,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.5258672647178173e-05), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002790300059132278)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/tambocor.html ', [])"

It is a nitrogen mustard β-chloro-nitrosourea compound. == Mechanism of action == As an alkylating agent, carmustine can form interstrand crosslinks in DNA, which prevents DNA replication and DNA transcription. == Uses == Carmustine is used as an alkylating agent to treat several types of brain cancer including glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma and astrocytoma, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin). Carmustine is sometimes used in conjunction with alkyl guanine transferase (AGT) inhibitors, such as O6-benzylguanine. The AGT-inhibitors increase the efficacy of carmustine by inhibiting the direct reversal pathway of DNA repair, which will prevent formation of the interstrand crosslink between the N1 of guanine and the N3 of cytosine. It is also used as part of a chemotherapeutic protocol in preparation for hematological stem cell transplantation, a type of bone marrow transplant, in order to reduce the white blood cell count in the recipient. Use under this protocol, usually with fludarabine and melphalan, was developed by oncologists at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. == Implants == In the treatment of brain tumours, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved biodegradable discs infused with carmustine (Gliadel).

It is marketed by Bausch and Lomb as Lotemax and Loterex. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Applications for this drug include the reduction of inflammation after eye surgery, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, uveitis, and chronic forms of keratitis - such as adenoviral, Thygeson's keratitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis,pingueculitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis, and episcleritis. == Contraindications == Contraindications: As corticosteroids are immunosuppressive, loteprednol is contraindicated in patients with viral, fungal or mycobacterial infections of the eye. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects in patients being treated with the gel formulation are anterior chamber inflammation (in 5% of people), eye pain (2%), and foreign body sensation (2%). == Interactions == Because long term use (more than 10 days) can cause increased intraocular pressure, loteprednol may interfere with the treatment of glaucoma. Following ocular administration, the drug is very slowly absorbed into the blood, therefore the blood level is limited to an extremely small concentration, and interactions with drugs taken by mouth or through any route other than topical ophthalmic are very unlikely. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Corticosteroids mediate their anti-inflammatory effects mainly through the modulation of the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at the genomic level. Preclinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate is highly lipophilic and has strong binding affinity to glucocorticoid receptors. After it binds to the GR in the cytoplasm, the activated corticosteroid-GR complex migrates to the nucleus, where it upregulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins and represses the expression of proinflammatory proteins. Corticosteroids inhibit inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and other inflammatory mediators. They also reduce synthesis of histamine, stabilize cell membranes, and inhibit degranulation of mast cells. Recent work suggests that the activated corticosteroid-GR complex also elicits nongenomic effects, particularly the inhibition of vasodilation, vascular permeability, and migration of leukocytes. === Pharmacokinetics === Neither loteprednol etabonate nor its inactive metabolites Δ1-cortienic acid and Δ1-cortienic acid etabonate are detectable in the bloodstream, even after oral administration. A study with patients receiving loteprednol eye drops over 42 days showed no adrenal suppression, which would be a sign of the drug reaching the bloodstream to a clinically relevant extent. Steroid receptor affinity was 4.3 times that of dexamethasone in animal studies. === Retrometabolic drug design === Loteprednol etabonate was developed using retrometabolic drug design. It is a so-called soft drug, meaning its structure was designed so that it is predictably metabolised to inactive substances. These metabolites, Δ1-cortienic acid and its etabonate, are derivatives of cortienic acid, itself an inactive metabolite of hydrocortisone. == Chemistry == Loteprednol etabonate is an ester of loteprednol with etabonate (ethyl carbonate). The pure chemical compound has a melting point between 220.5 °C (428.9 °F) and 223.5 °C (434.3 °F). Its solubility in water is 1:2,000,000, therefore it is formulated for ophthalmic use as either an ointment, a gel, or a suspension. Loteprednol is a corticosteroid.

It is used in form of tenapanor hydrochloride. It is also used in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia associated with chronic kidney disease. Tenapanor is a sodium hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) inhibitor. Tenapanor is a drug developed by Ardelyx, which acts as an inhibitor of the sodium-proton exchanger NHE3. This antiporter protein is found in the kidney and intestines, and normally acts to regulate the levels of sodium absorbed and secreted by the body. When administered orally, tenapanor selectively inhibits sodium uptake in the intestines, limiting the amount absorbed from food, and thereby reduces levels of sodium in the body. This may make it useful in the treatment of chronic kidney disease and hypertension, both of which are exacerbated by excess sodium in the diet. It was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2019. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. In October 2023, tenapanor was approved by the FDA for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02686138 for ""A 26-Week Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Tenapanor in IBS-C (T3MPO-2)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02621892 for ""A 12-Week Study With a 4-Week Randomized Withdrawal Period to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Tenapanor for the Treatment of IBS-C (T3MPO-1)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT02675998 for ""An 8-Week Study to Evaluate Tenapanor in the Treatment of Hyperphosphatemia in End-Stage Renal Disease Patients on Hemodialysis (ESRD-HD)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03427125 for ""A Phase 3 Study of Tenapanor to Treat Hyperphosphatemia in ESRD Patients on Dialysis"" at ClinicalTrials.gov Clinical trial number NCT03824587 for ""Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Tenapanor as Adjunctive Therapy to Phosphate Binder Therapy"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Ibsrela,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.658331868587993e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005615564878098667)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/ibsrela.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Ibsrela: Uses, Warnings, Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/ibsrela.html?utm_source=openai')])"

218,"('Flumequine', 'Apurone', 'Flumigal', 'Flumequinum', 'Flumequino')",Medical,"Flumequine is a synthetic fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. It is a first-generation fluoroquinolone antibacterial that has been removed from clinical use and is no longer being marketed. The marketing authorization of flumequine has been suspended throughout the EU. It kills bacteria by interfering with the enzymes that cause DNA to unwind and duplicate. Flumequine was used in veterinarian medicine for the treatment of enteric infections (all infections of the intestinal tract), as well as to treat cattle, swine, chickens, and fish, but only in a limited number of countries. It was occasionally used in France (and a few other European Countries) to treat urinary tract infections under the trade name Apurone. However this was a limited indication because only minimal serum levels were achieved. == History == The first quinolone used was nalidixic acid (was marketed in many countries as Negram) followed by the fluoroquinolone flumequine. The first-generation fluoroquinolone agents, such as flumequine, had poor distribution into the body tissues and limited activity. As such they were used mainly for treatment of urinary tract infections. Flumequine (benzo quinolizine) was first patented in 1973, (German Patent) by Rikker Labs. Flumequine is a known antimicrobial compound described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,131 (Example 3), July 22, 1975. Flumequine is the first quinolone compound with a fluorine atom at the C6-position of the related quinolone basic molecular structure. Even though this was the first fluoroquinolone, it is often overlooked when classifying the drugs within this class by generations and excluded from such a list. Though used frequently to treat farm animals and on occasion household pets, flumequine was also used to treat urinary tract infections in humans. Flumequine, was used transiently treat urinary infections until ocular toxicity was reported. as well as liver damage and anaphylactic shock. In 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested that all quinolone/fluoroquinolone drugs package inserts include a Black Boxed Warning concerning the risk of spontaneous tendon ruptures, which would have included flumequine. The FDA also requested that the manufacturers send out Dear Doctor Letters regarding this new warning. Such tendon problems have also been associated with flumequine. == Drug residue == The use of flumequine in food animals had sparked considerable debate. Significant and harmful residues of quinolones have been found in animals treated with quinolones and later slaughtered and sold as food products. There has been significant concern regarding the amount of flumequine residue found within food animals such as fish, poultry and cattle. In 2003 the Joint FAO/WHO Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) withdrew the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for flumequine and carbadox based on evidence showing both are direct acting genotoxic carcinogens, therefore the Committee was unable to establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for human exposure to such residues. Subsequently, in 2006, the JEFCA, re-established the ADI having received appropriate evidence and MRLs were re-specified. The role of JECFA is to evaluate toxicology, residue chemistry and related information and make recommendations for acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels and maximum residue limits (MRLs). At its 16th session, held May 2006, the Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF) requested information on registered uses of flumequine. As the CCRVDF did not receive any information regarding the registered uses of flumequine that they had requested, the committee members agreed to discontinue work on the MRLs for flumequine in shrimp. == Licensed uses == Urinary tract infections (veterinary and human) == Availability == Veterinary use: Solution; Oral; 20% (prescription only) Solution; Oral; 10% (prescription only) Human use: Tablet; Oral; Flumequine 400 mg (discontinued) == Mode of action == Flumequine is a member of the quinolone antibiotics family, which are active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, and topoisomerase IV, enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. This mechanism can also affect mammalian cell replication. In particular, some congeners of this drug family (for example those that contain the C-8 fluorine), display high activity not only against bacterial topoisomerases, but also against eukaryotic topoisomerases and are toxic to cultured mammalian cells and in vivo tumor models. Although quinolones are highly toxic to mammalian cells in culture, its mechanism of cytotoxic action is not known. Quinolone induced DNA damage was first reported in 1986 (Hussy et al.). Recent studies have demonstrated a correlation between mammalian cell cytotoxicity of the quinolones and the induction of micronuclei. As such, some fluoroquinolones may cause injury to the chromosome of eukaryotic cells. There continues to be considerable debate as to whether or not this DNA damage is to be considered one of the mechanisms of action concerning the severe adverse reactions experienced by some patients following fluoroquinolone therapy. == Adverse reactions == Flumequine was associated with severe ocular toxicity, which precluded its use in human patients. Drug-induced calculi (kidney stones) has been associated with such therapy as well. Anaphylactic shock induced by flumequine therapy has also been associated with its use. Anaphylactoid reactions such as shock, urticaria, and Quincke’s oedema have been reported to generally appear within two hours after taking the first tablet. There were eighteen reports listed within the WHO file in 1996. As with all drugs within this class, flumequine therapy may result in severe central nervous system (CNS) reactions, phototoxicity resulting in skin reactions like erythema, pruritus, urticaria and severe rashes, gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. == Drug interactions == Flumequine was found to have no effect on theophylline pharmacokinetics. == Chemistry == Flumequine is a 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-1-oxo-1H,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid. The molecular formula is C14H12FNO3. It is a white powder, odorless, flavorless, insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvent. == Pharmacokinetics == Flumequine is considered to be well absorbed and is excreted in the urine and feces as the glucuronide conjugates of the parent drug and 7-hydroxyflumequine. It is eliminated within 168 hours post-dosing. However, studies concerning the calf liver showed additional unidentified residues, of which a new metabolite, ml, represented the major single metabolite 24 hours after the last dose and at all subsequent time points. The metabolite ml, which exhibited no antimicrobial activity, was present in both free and protein-bound fractions. The major residue found in the edible tissues of sheep, pigs, and chickens was parent drug together with minor amounts of the 7-hydroxy-metabolite. The only detected residue in trout was the parent drug. == See also == Adverse effects of fluoroquinolones == References ==",Flumequine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.054275114089250565), ('U', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.02568124607205391), ('ICAL', -4.589452510117553e-05), (',', -0.01817150041460991), ('ĠINDU', -0.02427823655307293), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07892654091119766)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO;\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flumequine,https://www.fao.org/4/W8338E/w8338e0a.htm,https://www.advacarepharma.com/en/veterinary/flumequine-oral-solution ', [])"
219,"('Prasugrel', 'Effient', 'Efient', 'Prasugrel (effient)', 'Cs 747')",Medical,"Prasugrel, sold under the brand names Effient and Efient, is a medication used to prevent formation of blood clots. It is a platelet inhibitor and an irreversible antagonist of P2Y12 ADP receptors and is of the thienopyridine drug class. It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Co. and produced by Ube and marketed in the United States in cooperation with Eli Lilly and Company. Prasugrel was approved for use in the European Union in February 2009, and in the US in July 2009, for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in people with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). == Medical uses == Prasugrel is used in combination with low-dose aspirin to prevent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome, including unstable angina pectoris, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), who are planned for treatment with PCI. Prasugrel is associated with a higher bleeding risk compared to clopidogrel but has demonstrated superiority in reducing the composite endpoint of death, recurrent myocardial infarctions and stroke. Prasugrel does not change the risk of death when given to people who have had a STEMI or NSTEMI. Given the risk of bleeding, prasugrel should not be used in people who are older than 75 years, who have low body weight or a history of transient ischemic attacks or strokes. The initiation of prasugrel before coronary angiography outside the context of primary PCI is not recommended. == Approval status == The drug was introduced to clinical practice in Canada in 2010 but was subsequently withdrawn by the manufacturer in 2020 as a ""business decision"". This has left a gap in the management of high-risk patients in certain situations in Canada where Effient was the drug of choice. == Contraindications == Prasugrel should not be given to people with active pathological bleeding, such as peptic ulcer or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, because of higher risk of stroke (thrombotic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage). == Adverse effects == Adverse effects include: Cardiovascular: Hypertension (8%), hypotension (4%), atrial fibrillation (3%), bradycardia (3%), noncardiac chest pain (3%), peripheral edema (3%), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) Central nervous system: Headache (6%), dizziness (4%), fatigue (4%), fever (3%), extremity pain (3%) Dermatologic: Rash (3%) Endocrine and metabolic: Hypercholesterolemia/hyperlipidemia (7%) Gastrointestinal: Nausea (5%), diarrhea (2%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (2%) Hematologic: Leukopenia (3%), anemia (2%) Neuromuscular and skeletal: Back pain (5%) Respiratory: Epistaxis (6%), dyspnea (5%), cough (4%) Hypersensitivity, including angioedema == Interactions == Prasugrel has a low potential for interactions. It may, for example, be used with proton pump inhibitors to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding without loss of its antiplatelet effect. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Prasugrel is a member of the thienopyridine class of ADP receptor inhibitors, like ticlopidine (trade name Ticlid) and clopidogrel (trade name Plavix). These agents reduce the aggregation (""clumping"") of platelets by irreversibly binding to P2Y12 receptors. Prasugrel inhibits platelet aggregation more rapidly, more consistently, and to a greater extent than clopidogrel. The TRITON-TIMI 38 study compared prasugrel with clopidogrel, and showed that prasugrel reduced rates of ischaemic events, but increased bleeding risk. Overall mortality rates were similar for each drug. Clopidogrel, unlike prasugrel, was issued a black box warning from the FDA on 12 March 2010, as the estimated 2–14% of the US population who have low levels of the CYP2C19 liver enzyme needed to activate clopidogrel may not get the full effect. Tests are available to predict if a patient would be susceptible to this problem or not. Unlike clopidogrel, prasugrel is effective in most individual with the exception in patients over the age of 75, weight under 60 kg, and patients with a history of stroke or TIA due to increased risk of bleeding, although several cases have been reported of decreased responsiveness to prasugrel. It has been suggested that the decreased responsiveness observed in prasugrel is likely due to its low but significant frequency of High Platelet Reactivity (HPR). === Pharmacodynamics === Prasugrel produces inhibition of platelet aggregation to 20 μM or 5 μM ADP, as measured by light transmission aggregometry. Following a 60-mg loading dose of the drug, about 90% of patients had at least 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation by one hour. Maximum platelet inhibition was about 80%. Mean steady-state inhibition of platelet aggregation was about 70% following three to five days of dosing at 10 mg daily after a 60-mg loading dose. Platelet aggregation gradually returns to baseline values over five to 9 days after discontinuation of prasugrel, this time course being a reflection of new platelet production rather than pharmacokinetics of prasugrel. Discontinuing clopidogrel 75 mg and initiating prasugrel 10 mg with the next dose resulted in increased inhibition of platelet aggregation, but not greater than that typically produced by a 10-mg maintenance dose of prasugrel alone. Increasing platelet inhibition could increase bleeding risk. The relationship between inhibition of platelet aggregation and clinical activity has not been established. === Pharmacokinetics === Prasugrel is a prodrug and is rapidly metabolized by carboxylesterase 2 in the intestine and carboxylesterase 1 in the liver to a likewise inactive thiolactone, which is then converted by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, and to a minor extent by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, to a pharmacologically active metabolite (R-138727). R-138727 has an elimination half-life of about 7 hours (range 2 h to 15 h). Healthy subjects, patients with stable atherosclerosis, and patients undergoing PCI show similar pharmacokinetics. == Chemistry == Prasugrel has one chiral atom.

We analyzed the effect of the GSI IX on growth and epithelial plasticity of human pancreatic cancer cell lines, and on the tumorigenicity of pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells. Notably, apoptosis was induced after GSI IX treatment and EMT markers were selectively targeted. Furthermore, under GSI IX treatment, decline in the growth of pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells was observed in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model.

It is also used for the treatment of tumors due to one specific rare mutation: it is specifically intended for adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) that harbor a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation. Avapritinib is a kinase inhibitor. Common side effects include edema (swelling), nausea, fatigue/asthenia (abnormal physical weakness or lack of energy), cognitive impairment, vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hair color changes, increased lacrimation (secretion of tears), abdominal pain, constipation, rash and dizziness. == Medical uses == Avapritinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) harboring the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. Avapritinib is also indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced systemic mastocytosis, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological neoplasm, and mast cell leukemia (MCL). It is also indicated for the treatment of adults with indolent systemic mastocytosis. == History == The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved avapritinib in January 2020. The application for avapritinib was granted fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and orphan drug designation. The FDA granted approval of Ayvakit to Blueprint Medicines Corporation. Avapritinib was approved based on the results from the Phase I NAVIGATOR clinical trial involving 43 subjects with GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including 38 subjects with PDGFRA D842V mutation. Subjects received avapritinib 300 mg or 400 mg orally once daily until disease progression or they experienced unacceptable toxicity. The recommended dose was determined to be 300 mg once daily. The trial measured how many subjects experienced complete or partial shrinkage (by a certain amount) of their tumors during treatment (overall response rate). For subjects harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, the overall response rate was 84%, with 7% having a complete response and 77% having a partial response. For the subgroup of subjects with PDGFRA D842V mutations, the overall response rate was 89%, with 8% having a complete response and 82% having a partial response. While the median duration of response was not reached, 61% of the responding subjects with exon 18 mutations had a response lasting six months or longer (31% of subjects with an ongoing response were followed for less than six months). The FDA approved avapritinib based on evidence from one clinical trial (NCT02508532) of 204 subjects with GIST. The trial was conducted at 17 sites in the United States, Europe and Asia. Avapritinib showed a median PFS of 4.2 months compared to 5.6 months for regorafenib. The difference in median PFS between the avapritinib and regorafenib groups was not statistically significant. The overall response rate was 17 percent for the avapritinib group and 7 percent for the regorafenib group. The VOYAGER trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of avapritinib (N=240) versus regorafenib (N=236) in patients with third- or fourth-line GIST. Avapritinib was approved for medical use in the European Union in September 2020. Ayvakit was granted approval for advanced systemic mastocytosis by the FDA in June 2021.

223,"('Delafloxacin (meglumine)', 'Delafloxacin', 'Baxdela', 'Abt 492', 'Delafloxacin [usan:inn]')",Medical,"Delafloxacin sold under the brand name Baxdela (by Melinta Therapeutics) among others, is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. == Medical use == Delafloxacin is indicated to treat adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by designated susceptible bacteria or adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) caused by designated susceptible bacteria. Susceptible bacteria for ABSSSI are: Gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] isolates), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (including Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus), Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis Gram-negative organisms: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Susceptible bacteria for CABP are: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] isolates only), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It has not been tested in pregnant women. In the European Union, it is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial treatment of these infections. == Adverse effects == Like other drugs in the fluoroquinolone class, delafloxacin contains a black box warning about the risk of tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. The label also warns against the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea. Adverse effects occurring in more than 2% of clinical trial subjects included nausea, diarrhea, headache, elevated transaminases, and vomiting. == Interactions == Like other fluoroquinolones, delafloxacin chelates metals including aluminum, magnesium, sucralfate, iron, zinc, and divalent and trivalent cations like didanosine; using this drugs with antacids, some dietary supplements, or drugs buffered with any of these ions will interfere with available amounts of delafloxacin. == Pharmacology == The half-life varies in around 8 hours at normal doses. Excretion is 65% through urine, mostly in unmetabolized form, and 28% via feces. Clearance is reduced in people with severe kidney disease. Delafloxacin is more active (lower MIC90) than other quinolones against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In contrast to most approved fluoroquinolones, which are zwitterionic, delafloxacin has an anionic character, which results in a 10-fold increase in delafloxacin accumulation in both bacteria and cells at acidic pH. This property is believed to confer to delafloxacin an advantage for the eradication of Staphylococcus aureus in acidic environments, including intracellular infections and biofilms. Given its anti-biofilm activity, delafloxacin is increasingly being considered as a treatment option for hardware-associated infections. == Chemistry == The chemical name is 1-deoxy-1 (methylamino)-D-glucitol, 1-(6-amino-3,5-difluoropyridin-2-yl)-8-chloro-6-fluoro-7-(3-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate (salt). The injectable form of delafloxacin is sold as the meglumine salt of the active ingredient and its United States Adopted Name, delafloxacin meglumine, reflects that; the injection formulation also includes EDTA and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin. The tablet is made of delafloxacin, citric acid anhydrous, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate. == History == Delafloxacin was known as ABT-492, RX-3341, and WQ-3034 while it was under development. Rib-X Pharmaceuticals acquired delafloxacin from Wakunaga Pharmaceutical in 2006. Rib-X was renamed to Melinta Therapeutics in 2013. It was developed and marketed by Melinta Therapeutics (formerly Rib-X Pharmaceuticals), which subsequently merged with Cempra. Key clinical trials for delafloxacin have been performed by Melinta regarding indications for skin and skin structure infections as well as complicated bacterial infections and uncomplicated gonorrhea. The trial on gonorrhea was terminated before data was released. Delafloxacin was approved by the FDA in June 2017, after it was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in two trials on 1042 patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection. New Drug Applications (NDA) for delafloxacin (Baxdela) 450 mg tablets and 300 mg injections were approved by the FDA in June 2017. The FDA obligated Melinta to conduct further studies as follows: a 5-year surveillance study to determine if resistance emerges, with the final report due in December 2022 a study of the IV form in pregnant rats to determine distribution to the reproductive tract, due June 2018, with further studies required if there is significant distribution. Melinta merged with Cempra in August, 2017. Melinta has entered into commercialization and distribution agreements with both Menarini Therapeutics (March 2017) and Eurofarma Laboratórios (January 2015) for international commercialization of delafloxacin. The agreement with Menarini allows them to commercialize and distribute in 68 countries, including Europe, China, and South Korea among others. A similar agreement with Eurofarma allows for commercialization in Brazil. == References ==",Baxdela,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000726197671610862), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -8.666139910928905e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([baxdela.com](https://baxdela.com/about-melinta/?utm_source=openai), [medlibrary.org](https://medlibrary.org/lib/rx/meds/baxdela/?utm_source=openai), [fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drug-trials-snapshots-baxdela?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=274, start_index=9, title='BAXDELA (delafloxacin) | About Melinta', type='url_citation', url='https://baxdela.com/about-melinta/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=274, start_index=9, title='Baxdela (Melinta Therapeutics, LLC): FDA Package Insert', type='url_citation', url='https://medlibrary.org/lib/rx/meds/baxdela/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=274, start_index=9, title='Drug Trials Snapshots: BAXDELA | FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drug-trials-snapshots-baxdela?utm_source=openai')])"

It is only used in combination with artemether. The term ""co-artemether"" is sometimes used to describe this combination. Lumefantrine has a much longer half-life compared to artemether (3-6 days vs. 2 hours), and is therefore thought to clear any residual parasites that remain after combination treatment. == Mechanism of action == Exact mechanism by which lumefantrine acts on erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum is unknown. However, it was shown to exert its action through possible two mechanisms: inhibiting β-hematin formation by creating complexes with hemin inhibiting nucleic acid and protein synthesis Moreover, it was shown to interact with human sodium/potassium ATPase subunit α1. == Metabolism == Lumefantrine is metabolised in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4) and 2D6 (CYP2D6), yielding desbutyl-lumefantrine as a major metabolite. == Adverse effects == Lumefantrine, as used in combination with artemether, was shown to induce the following side effects: prolongation of QT interval, especially in combination with other drugs exhibiting the same effects or in patients with congenital prolongation of the QT interval hypersensitivity reactions interactions with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inducing or inhibiting drugs infertility (sperm abnormalities and trouble getting pregnant) People taking efavirenz as a part of HIV therapy should be wary of potential deviations during treatment, due to a decrease of AUC of this antiretroviral. == History == Lumefantrine, along with pyronaridine and naphthoquine, were synthesized during the Chinese Project 523 antimalaria drug research effort initiated in 1967; these compounds are all used in combination antimalaria therapies. == Research == Lumefantrine is being investigated as a part of a regimen with ganaplacide for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Along with O-choline (octadecyl 2-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate), lumefantrine inhibits in vivo growth of Theileria equi and Babesia caballi, due to inhibition of membrane phospholipid synthesis, hemoglobin digestion and targeting lactate metabolism. Additionally, it can inhibit Babesia gibsoni growth in vitro (synergistically with artemisinin derivatives). It may exert negative effects on aquatic ecosystems by adversely acting on Chlorella vulgaris, Raphidocelis subcapitata, Lemna minor and Microcystis aeruginosa. Moreover, it is classified as a potential endocrine disrupting compound by decreasing FSHB and increasing prolactin secretion. Lumefantrine and calcium phosphate-loaded lipid nanoparticles or cubosomes were investigated as a potential treatment of lung cancer due to probable antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of this combination. Selene-containing lumefantrine derivatives synthesised through Knoevenagel condensation (which itself is used to synthesise lumefantrine) exhibit potential antibacterial and antifungal activity. Compared with ciprofloxacin, they were shown to more potently bind to E. coli MurB enzyme – an enzyme participating in cell cycle and cell wall synthesis. == See also == Artemether/lumefantrine Halofantrine == References ==",Benflumetol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.7205765440594405e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0040893275290727615)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumefantrine,https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.42.9.2347 ', [])"

229,"('Elraglusib', 'Elraglusib [usan]', 'Ex-a4074', 'S9602', 'Compound 26 [pmid: 19338355]')",Medical," Elraglusib (formerly 9-ING-41) is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The drug reduces proliferation of several NHL cell lines and has efficacy in xenograft models of the disease. To confirm the importance of its action on GSK3β, we treated 3 lymphoma cell lines with selective, structurally distinct GSK3 inhibitors: CT99021, SB216763, LY2090314, tideglusib, and elraglusib. Stabilization of β-catenin and reduced phosphorylation of CRMP2, two validated targets of GSK3, were used as functional read-outs for GSK3 inhibition. CT99021, SB216763, and LY2090314 failed to reduce proliferation or viability in any cell line at concentrations that stabilized β-catenin and reduced CRMP2 phosphorylation. There was partial reduction of CRMP2 phosphorylation but no significant effect on β-catenin at cytotoxic doses of elraglusib. There was no indication of GSK3 inhibition at doses of tideglusib that affected cell viability and apoptosis. Cell-free kinase screening confirmed several other targets of elraglusib, distinct from the GSK3 inhibitors with no anti-lymphoma actions, including PIM kinases and MST2. These data question GSK3 as the target of elraglusib in lymphoma, and hence the utility of GSK3 expression as a 'stand-alone', therapeutic biomarker in NHL. Video Abstract. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of elraglusib, a glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) small-molecule inhibitor, as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy, in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or hematologic malignancies was studied. Elraglusib (intravenously twice weekly in 3-week cycles) monotherapy dose escalation was followed by dose escalation with eight chemotherapy regimens (gemcitabine, doxorubicin, lomustine, carboplatin, irinotecan, gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel/carboplatin, and pemetrexed/carboplatin) in patients previously exposed to the same chemotherapy. Patients received monotherapy (n = 67) or combination therapy (n = 171) elraglusib doses 1 to 15 mg/kg twice weekly. The initial recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of elraglusib was 15 mg/kg twice weekly and was defined, without dose-limiting toxicity observation, due to fluid volumes necessary for drug administration. The RP2D was subsequently reduced to 9.3 mg/kg once weekly to reduce elraglusib-associated central/peripheral vascular access catheter blockages. Other common elraglusib-related adverse events (AE) included transient visual changes and fatigue. Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs occurred in 55.2% and 71.3% of patients on monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively. Part 1 monotherapy (n = 62) and part 2 combination (n = 138) patients were evaluable for response. In part 1, a patient with melanoma had a complete response, and a patient with acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma had a partial response (PR). In part 2, seven PRs were observed, and the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2-2.6] and 6.9 (95% CI, 5.7-8.4) months, respectively. Elraglusib had a favorable toxicity profile as monotherapy and combined with chemotherapy and was associated with clinical benefit supporting further clinical evaluation in combination with chemotherapy. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in numerous oncogenic processes. GSK-3 inhibitor elraglusib (9-ING-41) has shown promising preclinical and clinical antitumor activity across multiple tumor types. Despite promising early-phase clinical trial results, there have been limited efforts to characterize the potential immunomodulatory properties of elraglusib. We report that elraglusib promotes immune cell-mediated tumor cell killing of microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Mechanistically, elraglusib sensitized CRC cells to immune-mediated cytotoxicity and enhanced immune cell effector function. Using western blots, we found that elraglusib decreased CRC cell expression of NF-κB p65 and several survival proteins. Using microarrays, we discovered that elraglusib upregulated the expression of proapoptotic and antiproliferative genes and downregulated the expression of cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, metastasis, TGFβ signaling, and anti-apoptotic genes in CRC cells. Elraglusib reduced CRC cell production of immunosuppressive molecules such as VEGF, GDF-15, and sPD-L1. Elraglusib increased immune cell IFN-γ secretion, which upregulated CRC cell gasdermin B expression to potentially enhance pyroptosis. Elraglusib enhanced immune effector function resulting in augmented granzyme B, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and TRAIL production. Using a syngeneic, immunocompetent murine model of microsatellite stable CRC, we evaluated elraglusib as a single agent or combined with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1/L1) and observed improved survival in the elraglusib and anti-PD-L1 group. Murine responders had increased tumor-infiltrating T cells, augmented granzyme B expression, and fewer regulatory T cells. Murine responders had reduced immunosuppressive (VEGF, VEGFR2) and elevated immunostimulatory (GM-CSF, IL-12p70) cytokine plasma concentrations. To determine the clinical significance, we then utilized elraglusib-treated patient plasma samples and found that reduced VEGF and BAFF and elevated IL-1 beta, CCL22, and CCL4 concentrations correlated with improved survival. Using paired tumor biopsies, we found that tumor-infiltrating immune cells had a reduced expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints (VISTA, PD-1, PD-L2) and an elevated expression of T-cell activation markers (CTLA-4, OX40L) after elraglusib treatment. These results address a significant gap in knowledge concerning the immunomodulatory mechanisms of GSK-3 inhibitor elraglusib, provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of elraglusib in combination with immune checkpoint blockade, and are expected to have an impact on additional tumor types, besides CRC.",Elraglusib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001726001501083374), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002483737887814641)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([actuatetherapeutics.com](https://actuatetherapeutics.com/press_releases/actuate-therapeutics-announces-positive-interim-phase-2-data-of-elraglusib-in-first-line-treatment-of-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer/?utm_source=openai), [actuatetherapeutics.com](https://actuatetherapeutics.com/press_releases/actuate-announces-fda-rare-pediatric-disease-designation-granted-to-elraglusib-for-treatment-of-ewing-sarcoma/?utm_source=openai), [actuatetherapeutics.com](https://actuatetherapeutics.com/press_releases/actuate-therapeutics-receives-fda-orphan-drug-designation-for-elraglusib-for-treatment-of-pancreatic-cancer/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=640, start_index=9, title='Actuate Therapeutics Announces Positive Interim Phase 2 Data of Elraglusib in First Line Treatment of Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer | Actuate Therapeutics, Inc.', type='url_citation', url='https://actuatetherapeutics.com/press_releases/actuate-therapeutics-announces-positive-interim-phase-2-data-of-elraglusib-in-first-line-treatment-of-metastatic-pancreatic-cancer/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=640, start_index=9, title='Actuate Announces FDA Rare Pediatric Disease Designation Granted to Elraglusib for Treatment of Ewing Sarcoma | Actuate Therapeutics, Inc.', type='url_citation', url='https://actuatetherapeutics.com/press_releases/actuate-announces-fda-rare-pediatric-disease-designation-granted-to-elraglusib-for-treatment-of-ewing-sarcoma/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=640, start_index=9, title='ACTUATE THERAPEUTICS RECEIVES FDA ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR\xa0 ELRAGLUSIB FOR TREATMENT OF PANCREATIC CANCER | Actuate Therapeutics, Inc.', type='url_citation', url='https://actuatetherapeutics.com/press_releases/actuate-therapeutics-receives-fda-orphan-drug-designation-for-elraglusib-for-treatment-of-pancreatic-cancer/?utm_source=openai')])"

Thus, its contribution to Alzheimer's disease merits attention, given the known impact of the prostaglandin E2 pathway in Alzheimer's disease. We used the TgF344-AD transgenic rat model because it exhibits age-dependent and progressive Alzheimer's disease pathology. Prostaglandin D2 levels in hippocampi of TgF344-AD and wild-type littermates were significantly higher than prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin D2 signals through DP1 and DP2 receptors. Microglial DP1 receptors were more abundant and neuronal DP2 receptors were fewer in TgF344-AD than in wild-type rats. Expression of the major brain prostaglandin D2 synthase (lipocalin-type PGDS) was the highest among 33 genes involved in the prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 pathways. We treated a subset of rats (wild-type and TgF344-AD males) with timapiprant, a potent highly selective DP2 antagonist in development for allergic inflammation treatment. Timapiprant significantly mitigated Alzheimer's disease pathology and cognitive deficits in TgF344-AD males. Thus, selective DP2 antagonists have potential as therapeutics to treat Alzheimer's disease. The present work focused on evaluating the feasibility of fused deposition modeling (FDM) in the development of a dosage form containing Timapiprant (TMP), also known as CHF6532, which is a novel active molecule indicated in the potential treatment of eosinophilic asthma upon oral administration. The resulting product could be an alternative, with potential towards personalization, of immediate release (IR) tablets used in the clinical studies.

It is a PARP inhibitor, inhibiting poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair. It acts against cancers in people with hereditary BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which include some ovarian, breast, and prostate, pancreatitis cancers. In December 2014, olaparib was approved for use as a single agent by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the European Union and by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. == Medical uses == Olaparib is indicated to treat breast cancer, ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, peritoneal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. == Side effects == Side effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite; fatigue; muscle and joint pain; and low blood counts such as anemia, with occasional leukemia. Somnolence was sometimes seen in clinical trials which used doses higher than the approved schedule. == Mechanism of action == Olaparib acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), and is termed a PARP inhibitor. BRCA1/2 mutations may be genetically predisposed to development of some forms of cancer, and may be resistant to other forms of cancer treatment. However, these cancers sometimes have a unique vulnerability, as the cancer cells have increased reliance on PARP to repair their DNA and enable them to continue dividing. This means that drugs which selectively inhibit PARP may be of benefit if the cancers are susceptible to this treatment. == History == Olaparib was developed and first dosed into patients by the UK-based biotechnology company, KuDOS Pharmaceuticals, that was founded by Stephen Jackson of Cambridge University, UK. Since KuDOS was acquired by AstraZeneca in 2006, the drug has undergone clinical development by AstraZeneca and Merck & Co. In December 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved olaparib as monotherapy. The FDA approval is in germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAm) advanced ovarian cancer that has received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. The EMA public assessment report, which utilized the same phase II trial data, made reference to both ""high grade serous ovarian cancers"" and to the use of olaparib ""not later than 8 weeks after a course of platinum-based medicines, when the tumour was diminishing in size or had completely disappeared"". Olaparib in combination with temozolomide demonstrated substantial clinical activity in relapsed small cell lung cancer. The FDA approval was for germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAm) advanced ovarian cancer that has received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. In January 2018, olaparib became the first PARP inhibitor to be approved by the FDA for gBRCAm metastatic breast cancer. In breast cancer, olaparib is approved for gBRCAm HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients who have previously been treated with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. If patients have hormone receptor positive cancer, they should have received endocrine therapy where appropriate. This approval was based on the OlympiAD randomised phase III trial, which showed a progression-free survival benefit for patients treated with olaparib compared to conventional chemotherapy. In August 2017, olaparib tablets were approved in the United States for the maintenance treatment of adults with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The formulation was changed from capsules to tablets and the capsules were phased out in the United States. The capsules and tablets are not interchangeable. The approval in the maintenance setting was based on two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trials in patients with recurrent ovarian cancers who were in response to platinum-based therapy. SOLO-2 (NCT01874353) randomized 295 patients with recurrent germline BRCA-mutated ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (2:1) to receive olaparib tablets 300 mg orally twice daily or placebo. SOLO-2 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in patients randomized to olaparib compared with those who received placebo, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.41; p<0.0001). Study 19 (NCT00753545) randomized 265 patients regardless of BRCA status (1:1) to receive olaparib capsules 400 mg orally twice daily or placebo. Study 19 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in investigator-assessed PFS in patients treated with olaparib vs. placebo with a HR of 0.35. In January 2018, olaparib was approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with certain types of breast cancer that have spread (metastasized) and whose tumors have a specific inherited (germline) genetic mutation, making it the first drug in its class (PARP inhibitor) approved to treat breast cancer, and it is the first time any drug has been approved to treat certain patients with metastatic breast cancer who have a “BRCA” gene mutation. Patients are selected for treatment with Lynparza based on an FDA-approved genetic test, called the BRACAnalysis CDx. In December 2018, olaparib was approved in the United States for the maintenance treatment of adults with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm or sBRCAm) advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Adults with gBRCAm advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer should be selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic. Approval was based on SOLO-1 (NCT01844986), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial that compared the efficacy of olaparib with placebo in patients with BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive olaparib tablets 300 mg orally twice daily (n=260) or placebo (n=131). In December 2019, olaparib was approved for the maintenance treatment of adults with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. The FDA also approved the BRACAnalysis CDx test (Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc.) as a companion diagnostic for the selection of patients with pancreatic cancer for treatment with olaparib based upon the identification of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Efficacy was investigated in POLO (NCT02184195), a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial that randomized (3:2) 154 patients with gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to olaparib 300 mg orally twice daily or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In March 2022, olaparib was approved for the adjuvant treatment of adults with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high-risk early breast cancer who have been treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. In April 2023, the National Health Service (NHS) in Wales and England will administer Olaparib to cancer patients as part of its targeted therapy. This drug is developed to target specific malignancies connected to defective breast cancer (BRCA) gene variants. Through this move, 800 people—300 women with early breast cancer and 500 men with advanced prostate cancer will receive this drug for free. Andrew Tutt, a breast oncology professor at King's College London and Institute of Cancer Research said that this treatment increases patients’ chances of surviving breast cancer. It can also extend a person’s life in cases of prostate cancer.

236,"('Domperidone', 'Motilium', 'Nauzelin', 'Domperidonum', 'Domperidona')",Medical,"Domperidone, sold under the brand name Motilium among others, is a dopamine antagonist medication which is used to treat nausea and vomiting and certain gastrointestinal problems like gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying). It raises the level of prolactin in the human body and is used off label to induce and promote breast milk production. It may be taken by mouth or rectally. Side effects may include headache, anxiety, dry mouth, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and elevated prolactin levels. Secondary to increased prolactin levels, breast changes, milk outflow, menstrual irregularities, and hypogonadism can occur. Domperidone may also cause QT prolongation and has rarely been associated with serious cardiac complications such as sudden cardiac death. However, the risks are small and occur more with high doses. Domperidone acts as a peripherally selective antagonist of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. Due to its low entry into the brain, the side effects of domperidone are different from those of other dopamine receptor antagonists like metoclopramide and it produces little in the way of central nervous system adverse effects. However, domperidone can nonetheless increase prolactin levels as the pituitary gland is outside of the blood–brain barrier. Domperidone was discovered in 1974 and was introduced for medical use in 1979. It was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica. Domperidone is available over-the-counter in many countries, for instance in Europe and elsewhere throughout the world. It is not approved for use in the United States. However, it is available in the United States for people with severe and treatment-refractory gastrointestinal motility problems under an expanded access individual-patient investigational new drug application. An analogue of domperidone called deudomperidone is under development for potential use in the United States and other countries. == Medical uses == === Nausea and vomiting === There is some evidence that domperidone has antiemetic activity. It is recommended by the Canadian Headache Society for treatment of nausea associated with acute migraine. === Gastroparesis === Gastroparesis is a medical condition characterised by delayed emptying of the stomach when there is no mechanical gastric outlet obstruction. Its cause is most commonly idiopathic, a diabetic complication or a result of abdominal surgery. The condition causes nausea, vomiting, fullness after eating, early satiety (feeling full before the meal is finished), abdominal pain, and bloating. Domperidone can be used to increase the transit of food through the stomach by increasing gastrointestinal peristalsis and hence to treat gastroparesis. It may be useful in idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis. However, increased rate of gastric emptying induced by drugs like domperidone does not always correlate well with relief of symptoms. === Lactation === Domperidone is used off-label in some countries to stimulate lactation or enhance breast milk production, but, as of December 2023, it is not approved for that purpose in any country, and is not approved for use in humans in the United States. Domperidone acts as a peripheral dopamine antagonist and is hypothesized to stimulate prolactin secretion, with a 2003 study supporting that hypothesis. A 2018 meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found that domperidone resulted in a moderate increase of in breast milk volume for mothers of preterm infants with insufficient milk supply. The analysis also indicated that domperidone was well tolerated with no significant difference in maternal adverse events compared to placebo. Domperidone has no officially established dosage for increasing milk supply, but most published studies have used 10 mg three times daily for 4 to 10 days (30 mg per day). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expressed concerns about serious adverse side effects and concerns about its effectiveness. The FDA identified serious cardiac adverse events associated with domperidone use in lactating individuals, including arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. Additionally, discontinuation or tapering of domperidone has been linked to severe neuropsychiatric adverse events such as agitation, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Because of these risks, the FDA strongly cautions against the use of domperidone to enhance lactation. A review by Health Canada also found a link between the sudden discontinuation or tapering of domperidone when used off-label for lactation, and psychiatric withdrawal events, particularly daily doses greater than the maximum recommended dose of 30 mg per day. A 2021 study found that postpartum usage of domperidone increased across five Canadian provinces from 2004 and 2017 with usage plateauing in 2011 and a drop in usage after a 2012 Health Canada advisory warning about domperidone. === Other uses === ==== Parkinson's disease ==== Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological condition where a decrease in dopamine in the brain leads to rigidity (stiffness of movement), tremor, and other symptoms and signs. Poor gastrointestinal function, nausea, and vomiting are major problems for people with Parkinson's disease because most medications used to treat Parkinson's disease are given by mouth. These medications, such as levodopa, can also cause nausea as a side effect. Furthermore, anti-nausea drugs, such as metoclopramide, which do cross the blood–brain barrier, may worsen the extrapyramidal symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Domperidone can be used to relieve nausea and gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease; it blocks peripheral D2 receptors but minimally crosses the blood-brain barrier in normal doses, so has no effect on the extrapyramidal symptoms of the disease. In addition, domperidone may be useful in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension caused by dopaminergic therapy in people with Parkinson's disease. ==== Other gastrointestinal uses ==== Domperidone may be used in functional dyspepsia in both adults and children. It has also been found effective in the treatment of reflux in children. However some specialists consider its risks prohibitory of the treatment of infantile reflux. === Available forms === Domperidone is available for use by oral administration in the form of tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) and suspension, and by rectal administration in the form of suppositories. The oral tablets are available in the strength of 10 mg. Domperidone has been studied for use by intramuscular injection and an intravenous formulation was previously available, but the medication is now only available in forms for oral and rectal administration. == Veterinary uses == Domperidone is used as immunotherapy to treat leishmania in dogs. Domperidone also has an FDA-approved formulation for the prevention of fescue toxicosis in periparturient mares. == Contraindications == Domperidone is contraindicated with QT-prolonging drugs like amiodarone. == Side effects == Side effects associated with domperidone include dry mouth, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea, rash, itching, hives, and hyperprolactinemia (the symptoms of which may include breast enlargement, galactorrhea, breast pain/tenderness, gynecomastia, hypogonadism, and menstrual irregularities). Due to the blockade of D2 receptors in the central nervous system, D2 receptor antagonists like metoclopramide and antipsychotics can also produce a variety of additional side effects including drowsiness, akathisia, restlessness, insomnia, lassitude, fatigue, extrapyramidal symptoms, dystonia, Parkinsonian symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and depression. However, this is not the case with domperidone, because, unlike other D2 receptor antagonists, it minimally crosses the blood–brain barrier, and for this reason, is rarely associated with such side effects. However, domperidone theoretically might be able to produce some blockade of central D2 receptors at higher doses, in turn producing side effects similar to those of centrally permeable D2 receptor antagonists like antipsychotics. === Elevated prolactin levels === Due to D2 receptor blockade, domperidone causes hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia can suppress the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, in turn suppressing the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and resulting in hypogonadism and low levels of the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone. Accordingly, 10 to 15% of females have been reported to experience mammoplasia (breast enlargement), mastodynia (breast pain/tenderness), galactorrhea (inappropriate or excessive milk production/secretion), and amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual cycles) with domperidone therapy. Males may experience low libido, erectile dysfunction, and impaired spermatogenesis, as well as galactorrhea and gynecomastia. D2 receptor antagonists like antipsychotics and domperidone may also increase the risk of prolactinomas, but more research is needed to confirm this. === Rare reactions === ==== Cardiac complications ==== Domperidone use is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (by 70%) most likely through its prolonging effect of the cardiac QT interval and ventricular arrhythmias. The cause is thought to be blockade of hERG voltage-gated potassium channels. The risks are dose-dependent, and appear to be greatest with high/very high doses via intravenous administration and in the elderly, as well as with drugs that interact with domperidone and increase its circulating concentrations (namely CYP3A4 inhibitors). Conflicting reports exist, however. In neonates and infants, QT prolongation is controversial and uncertain. UK drug regulatory authorities (MHRA) have issued the following restriction on domperidone in 2014 due to increased risk of adverse cardiac effects: Domperidone (Motilium) is associated with a small increased risk of serious cardiac side effects. Its use is now restricted to the relief of nausea and vomiting and the dosage and duration of use have been reduced. It should no longer be used for the treatment of bloating and heartburn. Domperidone is now contraindicated in those with underlying cardiac conditions and other risk factors. Patients with these conditions and patients receiving long-term treatment with domperidone should be reassessed at a routine appointment, in light of the new advice. However, a 2015 Australian review concluded the following: Based on the results of the two TQT (the regulatory agency gold standard for assessment of QT prolongation) domperidone does not appear to be strongly associated with QT prolongation at oral doses of 20 mg QID in healthy volunteers. Further, there are limited case reports supporting an association with cardiac dysfunction, and the frequently cited case-control studies have significant flaws. While there remains an ill-defined risk at higher systemic concentrations, especially in patients with a higher baseline risk of QT prolongation, our review does not support the view that domperidone presents intolerable risk. ==== Possible central toxicity in infants ==== In Britain, a legal case involved the death of two children of a mother whose three children had all had hypernatraemia. She was charged with poisoning the children with salt. One of the children, who was born at 28 weeks gestation with respiratory complications and had a fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux and failure to thrive was prescribed domperidone. An advocate for the mother suggested the child may have had neuroleptic malignant syndrome as a side effect of domperidone due to the drug crossing the child's immature blood–brain barrier. == Interactions == In healthy volunteers, the CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole increased the Cmax and AUC concentrations of domperidone by 3- to 10-fold. This was accompanied by a QT interval prolongation of about 10–20 milliseconds when domperidone 10 mg four times daily and ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily were administered, whereas domperidone by itself at the dosage assessed produced no such effect. As such, domperidone with ketoconazole or other CYP3A4 inhibitors is a potentially dangerous combination. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Domperidone is a peripherally selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It has no clinically significant interaction with the D1 receptor, unlike metoclopramide. The medication provides relief from nausea by blocking D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and from gastrointestinal symptoms by blocking D2 receptors in the gut. It blocks D2 receptors in the lactotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland increasing release of prolactin which in turn increases lactation. Domperidone may be more useful in some patients and cause harm in others by way of the genetics of the person, such as polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene ABCB1 (which encodes P-glycoprotein), the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNH2 gene (hERG/Kv11.1), and the α1D-adrenergic receptor ADRA1D gene. ==== Effects on prolactin levels ==== A single 20 mg oral dose of domperidone has been found to increase mean serum prolactin levels (measured 90 minutes post-administration) in non-lactating women from 8.1 ng/mL to 110.9 ng/mL (a 13.7-fold increase). This was similar to the increase in prolactin levels produced by a single 20 mg oral dose of metoclopramide (7.4 ng/mL to 124.1 ng/mL; 16.7-fold increase). After two weeks of repeated administration (30 mg/day in both cases), the increase in prolactin levels produced by domperidone was reduced (53.2 ng/mL; 6.6-fold above baseline), but the increase in prolactin levels produced by metoclopramide, conversely, was heightened (179.6 ng/mL; 24.3-fold above baseline). This indicates that acute and continuous administration of both domperidone and metoclopramide is effective in increasing prolactin levels, but that there are different effects on the secretion of prolactin with repeated use. The mechanism of the difference is unknown. The increase in prolactin levels observed with the two drugs was much greater in women than in men. This appears to be due to the higher estrogen levels in women, as estrogen stimulates prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland. For comparison, normal prolactin levels in women are less than 20 ng/mL, prolactin levels peak at 100 to 300 ng/mL at parturition in pregnant women, and in lactating women, prolactin levels have been found to be 90 ng/mL at 10 days postpartum and 44 ng/mL at 180 days postpartum. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The absolute bioavailability of domperidone is low (13–17% or approximately 15%). This is due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Conversely, its bioavailability is high via intramuscular injection (90%). The onset of action of domperidone taken orally is about 30 to 60 minutes. Peak levels of domperidone following an oral dose occur after about 60 minutes. Domperidone exposure increases proportionally with doses in the 10 to 20 mg dose range. There is a 2- to 3-fold accumulation in levels of domperidone with frequent repeated oral administration of domperidone (four times per day (every 5 hours) for 4 days). The oral bioavailability of domperidone is somewhat increased, and time to peak slightly increased when it is taken with food and bioavailability is decreased by prior concomitant administration of cimetidine and sodium bicarbonate. ==== Distribution ==== The plasma protein binding of domperidone is 91 to 93%. The tissue distribution of domperidone based on animal studies is wide, but concentrations are low in the brain. The drug is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) transporter, and animal studies suggest that this is the reason for the low central nervous system penetration of domperidone. Small amounts of domperidone cross the placenta in animals. ==== Metabolism ==== Domperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver and intestines with oral administration. This occurs via hydroxylation and N-dealkylation. Domperidone is almost exclusively metabolized by CYP3A4/5, though minor contributions by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C8 have been reported. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the N-dealkylation of domperidone, while CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1 are involved in its aromatic hydroxylation. All of the metabolites of domperidone are inactive as D2 receptor ligands. Overall and peak levels of domperidone are increased by about 2.9- and 1.5-fold in moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. ==== Elimination ==== Domperidone is eliminated 31% in urine and 66% in feces. The proportion of domperidone excreted unchanged is small (10% in feces and 1% in urine). The elimination half-life of domperidone is about 7 to 9 hours in healthy individuals. However, the elimination half-life of domperidone can be prolonged to 20 hours in people with severe renal dysfunction. == Chemistry == Domperidone is a derivative of benzimidazolinone. It is structurally related to butyrophenone neuroleptics like haloperidol. == History == Domperidone was synthesized at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1974 following their research on antipsychotic drugs. Janssen pharmacologists discovered that some antipsychotic drugs had a significant effect on dopamine receptors in the central chemoreceptor trigger zone that regulated vomiting, and started searching for a dopamine antagonist that would not pass the blood–brain barrier, thereby being free of the extrapyramidal side effects that were associated with drugs of this type. This led to the discovery of domperidone as a strong antiemetic with minimal central effects. Domperidone was patented in the United States in 1978, with the patent filed in 1976. In 1979, domperidone was first marketed, under the brand name Motilium, in Switzerland and West Germany. Domperidone was subsequently introduced in the forms of orally disintegrating tablets (based on Zydis technology) in 1999. In April 2014, the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures – Human (CMDh) published an official press release suggesting restricting the use of domperidone-containing medicines. It also approved earlier published suggestions by Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) to use domperidone only for treating nausea and vomiting and reduce maximum daily dosage to 10mg. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Domperidone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Regulatory approval === It was reported in 2007 that domperidone is available in 58 countries, but the uses or indications of domperidone vary between nations. In Italy it is used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and in Canada, the drug is indicated in upper gastrointestinal motility disorders and to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the use of dopamine agonist antiparkinsonian agents. In the United Kingdom, domperidone is only indicated for the treatment of nausea and vomiting and the treatment duration is usually limited to 1 week. In the United States, domperidone is not a legally marketed human drug and it is not approved for sale in the United States. In June 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that distributing any domperidone-containing products is illegal. It is available over-the-counter to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional dyspepsia in many countries, such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, South Africa, Mexico, India, Chile, and China. Domperidone is not approved for use in the United States. There is an exception for use in people with treatment-refractory gastrointestinal symptoms under an FDA Investigational New Drug application. === Formulations === == Research == Domperidone has been studied as a potential hormonal contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women. == References ==",Nauzelin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.004548679105937481), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04884699732065201)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

238,"('Uridine, 5-fluoro-', 'Fluorouridine', 'Fur', 'Beta-d-5fdu', 'Cid_1821')",Medical,"A fur is a soft, thick growth of hair that covers the skin of almost all mammals. It consists of a combination of oily guard hair on top and thick underfur beneath. The guard hair keeps moisture from reaching the skin; the underfur acts as an insulating blanket that keeps the animal warm. The fur of mammals has many uses: protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflaging, with the primary usage being thermoregulation. The types of hair include: 99 definitive, which may be shed after reaching a certain length; vibrissae, which are sensory hairs and are most commonly whiskers; pelage, which consists of guard hairs, under-fur, and awn hair; spines, which are a type of stiff guard hair used for defense in, for example, porcupines; bristles, which are long hairs usually used in visual signals, such as the mane of a lion; velli, often called ""down fur"", which insulates newborn mammals; and wool, which is long, soft, and often curly. Hair length is negligible in thermoregulation, as some tropical mammals, such as sloths, have the same fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation; and, conversely, other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals. The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur; for example, the muskox has guard hairs measuring 30 cm (12 in) as well as a dense underfur, which forms an airtight coat, allowing them to survive in temperatures of −40 °C (−40 °F).: 162–163 Some desert mammals, such as camels, use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin, allowing the animal to stay cool; a camel's fur may reach 70 °C (158 °F) in the summer, but the skin stays at 40 °C (104 °F).: 188 Aquatic mammals, conversely, trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry.: 162–163 Mammalian coats are colored for a variety of reasons, the major selective pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. Camouflage is a powerful influence in many mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive honey badger. In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, is the result of a symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with darker colored coats can absorb more heat from solar radiation and stay warmer; some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.: 166–167 The term pelage – first known use in English c. 1828 (French, from Middle French, from poil for 'hair', from Old French peilss, from Latin pilus) – is sometimes used to refer to an animal's complete coat. The term fur is also used to refer to animal pelts that have been processed into leather with their hair still attached. The words fur or furry are also used, more casually, to refer to hair-like growths or formations, particularly when the subject being referred to exhibits a dense coat of fine, soft ""hairs"". If layered, rather than grown as a single coat, it may consist of short down hairs, long guard hairs, and in some cases, medium awn hairs. Mammals with reduced amounts of fur are often called ""naked"", as with the naked mole-rat, or ""hairless"", as with hairless dogs. An animal with commercially valuable fur is known within the fur industry as a furbearer. The use of fur as clothing or decoration is controversial; animal welfare advocates object to the trapping and killing of wildlife, and the confinement and killing of animals on fur farms. == Composition == The modern mammalian fur arrangement is known to have occurred as far back as docodonts, haramiyidans and eutriconodonts, with specimens of Castorocauda, Megaconus and Spinolestes preserving compound follicles with both guard hair and underfur. Fur may consist of three layers, each with a different type of hair. === Down hair === Down hair (also known as underfur, undercoat, underhair or ground hair) is the bottom – or inner – layer, composed of wavy or curly hairs with no straight portions or sharp points. Down hairs, which are also flat, tend to be the shortest and most numerous in the coat. Thermoregulation is the principal function of the down hair, which insulates a layer of dry air next to the skin. === Awn hair === The awn hair can be thought of as a hybrid, bridging the gap between the distinctly different characteristics of down and guard hairs. Awn hairs begin their growth much like guard hairs, but less than halfway to their full length, awn hairs start to grow thin and wavy like down hair. The proximal part of the awn hair assists in thermoregulation (like the down hair), whereas the distal part can shed water (like the guard hair). The awn hair's thin basal portion does not allow the amount of piloerection that the stiffer guard hairs are capable of. Mammals with well-developed down and guard hairs also usually have large numbers of awn hairs, which may even sometimes be the bulk of the visible coat. === Guard hair === Guard hair (overhair) is the top—or outer—layer of the coat. Guard hairs are longer, generally coarser, and have nearly straight shafts that protrude through the layer of softer down hair. The distal end of the guard hair is the visible layer of most mammal coats. This layer has the most marked pigmentation and gloss, manifesting as coat markings that are adapted for camouflage or display. Guard hair repels water and blocks sunlight, protecting the undercoat and skin in wet or aquatic habitats, and from the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Guard hairs can also reduce the severity of cuts or scratches to the skin. Many mammals, such as the domestic dog and cat, have a pilomotor reflex that raises their guard hairs as part of a threat display when agitated. == Mammals with reduced fur == Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals; however, several species or breeds have considerably reduced amounts of fur. These are often called ""naked"" or ""hairless"". === Natural selection === Some mammals naturally have reduced amounts of fur. Some semiaquatic or aquatic mammals such as cetaceans, pinnipeds and hippopotamuses have evolved hairlessness, presumably to reduce resistance through water. The naked mole-rat has evolved hairlessness, perhaps as an adaptation to their subterranean lifestyle. Two of the largest extant terrestrial mammals, the elephant and the rhinoceros, are largely hairless. The hairless bat is mostly hairless but does have short bristly hairs around its neck, on its front toes, and around the throat sac, along with fine hairs on the head and tail membrane. Most hairless animals cannot go in the sun for long periods of time, or stay in the cold for too long. Marsupials are born hairless and grow out fur later in development. Humans are the only primate species that have undergone significant hair loss. The hairlessness of humans compared to related species may be due to loss of functionality in the pseudogene KRTHAP1 (which helps produce keratin) Although the researchers dated the mutation to 240,000 years ago, both the Altai Neandertal and Denisovan peoples possessed the loss-of-function mutation, indicating it is much older. Mutations in the gene HR can lead to complete hair loss, though this is not typical in humans. === Artificial selection === At times, when a hairless domesticated animal is discovered, usually owing to a naturally occurring genetic mutation, humans may intentionally inbreed those hairless individuals and, after multiple generations, artificially create hairless breeds. There are several breeds of hairless cats, perhaps the most commonly known being the Sphynx cat. Similarly, there are some breeds of hairless dogs. Other examples of artificially selected hairless animals include the hairless guinea-pig, nude mouse, and the hairless rat. == Use in clothing == Fur has long served as a source of clothing for humans, including Neanderthals. Historically, it was worn for its insulating quality, with aesthetics becoming a factor over time. Pelts were worn in or out, depending on their characteristics and desired use. Today fur and trim used in garments may be dyed bright colors or to mimic exotic animal patterns, or shorn close like velvet. The term ""a fur"" may connote a coat, wrap, or shawl. The manufacturing of fur clothing involves obtaining animal pelts where the hair is left on the animal's processed skin. In contrast, making leather involves removing the hair from the hide or pelt and using only the skin. Fur is also used to make felt. A common felt is made from beaver fur and is used in bowler hats, top hats, and high-end cowboy hats. Common furbearers used include fox, rabbit, mink, muskrat, leopard, beaver, ermine, otter, sable, jaguar, seal, coyote, chinchilla, raccoon, lemur, and possum. == See also == Angora wool Animal coloration Cat coat genetics Coat (animal) Futfell Plumage Rabbit hair Skinning Tanning (leather) == References == == External links ==",Fur,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('IN', -0.6969099640846252), ('DU', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('ST', -1.6689160474925302e-05), ('RI', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.313423216342926), ('ĠPERSON', -0.22954516112804413), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ĠCARE', -4.887569048150908e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03810246288776398)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

In ARPE-19 cells and primary murine RPE cells, PF-06409577 significantly inhibited UVR-induced viability reduction, cell death and apoptosis. PF-06409577 activated AMPK signaling in RPE cells by increasing AMPKα1-acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation and AMPK activity. AMPK inhibition, by AMPKα1-shRNA, -CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or -T172A dominant negative mutation, almost abolished PF-06409577-induced RPE cytoprotection against UVR. PF-06409577 enhanced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) activity and expression levels of Nrf2-dependent genes in RPE cells. Furthermore, UVR-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage were largely inhibited by the AMPK activator. In summary, PF-06409577 inhibits UVR-induced oxidative stress and RPE cell death by activating AMPK signaling. Renal cyst development and expansion in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) involves over-proliferation of cyst-lining epithelial cells and excessive cystic fluid secretion. While metformin effectively inhibits renal cyst growth in mouse models of ADPKD it exhibits low potency, and thus an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator with higher potency is required. Herein, we adopted a drug repurposing strategy to explore the potential of PF-06409577, an AMPK activator for diabetic nephropathy, in cellular, ex vivo and in vivo models of ADPKD. Our results demonstrated that PF-06409577 effectively down-regulated mammalian target of rapamycin pathway-mediated proliferation of cyst-lining epithelial cells and reduced cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-regulated cystic fluid secretion.

The FDA granted the application for repotrectinib priority review, breakthrough therapy, and fast track designations. === Clinical trials === ==== TRIDENT-1 ==== Efficacy was evaluated in TRIDENT-1 (NCT03093116), a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, multi-cohort trial in 88 adult participants with locally advanced or metastatic neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase gene fusion-positive solid tumors who had either received a prior TRK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (n=48) or were TKI-naïve (n=40). All participants were assessed for central nervous (CNS) lesions at baseline, and patients with symptomatic brain metastases were excluded. Tumor assessments were performed every eight weeks. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In November 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorization for the medicinal product Augtyro, intended for the treatment of people whose solid tumors have a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, or people with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The applicant for this medicinal product is Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG.

It has been approved as a medication for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) after clinical trials showed it to have similar or improved efficacy and some improvement in safety over existing drugs for this application. == Medical uses == Rolapitant is used in combination with other antiemetic (anti-vomiting) agents in adults for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The approved antiemetic combination consists of rolapitant plus dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist. == Contraindications == Under the US approval, rolapitant is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine, whose inactivation could be inhibited by rolapitant. Under the European approval, it is contraindicated in combination with St. John's Wort, which is expected to accelerate inactivation of rolapitant. == Side effects == In studies comparing chemotherapy plus rolapitant, dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist to chemotherapy plus placebo, dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist, most side effects had comparable frequencies in both groups, and differed more between chemotherapy regimens than between rolapitant and placebo groups. Common side effects included decreased appetite (9% under rolapitant vs. 7% under placebo), neutropenia (9% vs. 8% or 7% vs. 6%, depending on the kind of chemotherapy), dizziness (6% vs. 4%), indigestion and stomatitis (both 4% vs. 2%). == Overdose == Up to eightfold therapeutic doses have been given in studies without problems. == Interactions == Rolapitant moderately inhibits the liver enzyme CYP2D6. Blood plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan have increased threefold when combined with rolapitant; and increased concentrations of other substrates are expected. The drug also inhibits the transporter proteins ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of the ABCG2 substrate sulfasalazine twofold and the P-gp substrate digoxin by 70%. Strong inducers of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 decrease the area under the curve of rolapitant and its active metabolite (called M19); for rifampicin, this effect was almost 90% in a study. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 have no relevant effect on rolapitant concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Both rolapitant and its active metabolite M19 block the NK1 receptor with high affinity and selectivity: to block the closely related receptor NK2 or any other of 115 tested receptors and enzymes, more than 1000-fold therapeutic concentrations are necessary. === Pharmacokinetics === Rolapitant is practically completely absorbed from the gut, independently of food intake. It undergoes no measurable first-pass effect in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after about four hours. When in the bloodstream, 99.8% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. It is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, resulting in the major active metabolite M19 (C4-pyrrolidine-hydroxylated rolapitant) and a number of inactive metabolites. Rolapitant is mainly excreted via the feces (52–89%) in unchanged form, and to a lesser extent via the urine (9–20%) in form of its inactive metabolites. Elimination half-life is about seven days (169 to 183 hours) over a wide dosing range. == Chemistry == The drug is used in form of rolapitant hydrochloride monohydrate, a white to off-white, slightly hygroscopic crystalline powder.

Here, we conducted a phase 1b study (ClinicalTrials.gov., NCT03143985) to determine the primary endpoints of safety, tolerability, and maximal tolerated dose (200 mg twice daily) for the orally-available TGFβ type I receptor kinase inhibitor vactosertib in combination with pomalidomide in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients who had received ≥2 lines of chemoimmunotherapy. Secondary endpoints demonstrated sustained clinical responses, favorable pharmacokinetic parameters and a 6-month progression-free survival of 82%. Vactosertib combined with pomalidomide was well-tolerated at all dose levels and displayed a manageable adverse event profile. Exploratory analysis indicated that vactosertib co-treatment with pomalidomide also reduced TGFβ levels in patient bone marrow as well as the level of CD8 The study was to determine the activity and safety of the TGF-β inhibitor vactosertib in combination with imatinib in patients with desmoid tumors. In this investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, phase Ib/II trial, patients with desmoid tumors not amenable to locoregional therapies (surgery and/or radiotherapy) or with disease progression following at least one treatment were enrolled. Participants were administered 400 mg imatinib daily in combination with vactosertib (5 days on and 2 days off, twice a day) every 28 days. In phase Ib, the vactosertib dose was set at 100 mg (level -1) and 200 mg (level 1) to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Phase II assessed the efficacy, with the primary endpoint being progression-free rate (PFR) at 16 weeks. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during phase Ib; therefore RP2D was defined at doses of 400 mg imatinib daily in combination with 200 mg vactosertib. Of the 27 patients evaluated, 7 (25.9%) achieved a confirmed partial response and 19 (70.4%) were stable. The PFR at 16 weeks and 1 year were 96.3% and 81.0%, respectively. Most toxicities were mild to moderate myalgia (n = 10, 37%), anemia (n = 10, 37%), and nausea (n = 9, 33.3%). Common grade 3 to 4 toxicities included neutropenia (n = 6, 22.2%) and anemia (n = 5, 18.5%). The vactosertib and imatinib combination was well tolerated, with promising clinical activity in patients with progressive, locally advanced desmoid tumors. This is the first study investigating a novel target agent, a TGF-β inhibitor, in this rare and difficult-to-treat desmoid tumor. Several studies have shown that the TGF-β signaling pathway plays a critical role in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis. The aim of the current study is to investigate the therapeutic potential of Vactosertib (EW-7197), a selective inhibitor of TGF-β receptor type I, either alone or in combination with the standard first-line chemotherapeutic treatment, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), in CRC progression in both cellular and animal models. Real-Time PCR, Zymography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) tissue staining, and Flow cytometry techniques were applied to determine the anti-tumor properties of this novel TGF-β inhibitor in in vitro (CT-26 cell line) and in vivo (inbred BALB/C mice) samples. Our findings showed that Vactosertib decreased cell proliferation and induced spheroid shrinkage. Moreover, this inhibitor suppressed the cell cycle and its administration either alone or in combination with 5-FU induced apoptosis by regulating the expression of p53 and BAX proteins. It also improved 5-FU anti-cancer effects by decreasing the tumor volume and weight, increasing tumor necrosis, and regulating tumor fibrosis and inflammation in an animal model. Vactosertib also enhanced the inhibitory effect of 5-FU on invasive behavior of CRC cells by upregulating the expression of E-cadherin and inhibiting MMP-9 enzymatic activity. This study demonstrating the potent anti-tumor effects of Vactosertib against CRC progression.

244,"('Fluvastatin (sodium)', 'Xu 62-320', 'Fluvastatin', 'Lescol', '(3r,5s)-fluvastatin')",Medical,"Fluvastatin is a member of the statin drug class, used to treat hypercholesterolemia and to prevent cardiovascular disease. It was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1994. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects are comparable to other statins. Common are nausea, indigestion, insomnia and headache. Myalgia (muscle pain), and rarely rhabdomyolysis, characteristic side effects for statins, can also occur. == Interactions == Contrary to lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin, fluvastatin has no relevant interactions with drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and a generally lower potential for interactions than most other statins. Fluconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9, does increase fluvastatin levels. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Fluvastatin works by blocking the liver enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which facilitates an important step in cholesterol synthesis. === Pharmacodynamics === In a Cochrane systematic review the dose-related magnitudes of fluvastatin on blood lipids was determined. Over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/day total cholesterol was reduced by 10.7% to 24.9%, LDL cholesterol by 15.2% to 34.9%, and triglycerides by 3% to 17.5%. === Pharmacokinetics === The drug is quickly and almost completely (98%) absorbed from the gut. Food intake slows down absorption, but does not decrease it. Due to its first-pass effect, bioavailability is lower: about 24–30% according to different sources. Over 98% of the substance is bound to plasma proteins. Several cytochrome P450 enzymes (mainly CYP2C9, but also CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) are involved in the metabolism of fluvastatin, which makes is less liable to interactions than most other statins. The main metabolite is inactive and is called ""N-desisopropyl propionic acid"" in the literature. 93–95% of the drug is excreted via the feces, less than 2% of which in form of the original substance. == Names == Fluvastatin is the INN. Brandnames include Lescol, Canef, Vastin. == Research == Data from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) publication was used to determine the effects of fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on LDL cholesterol lowering and reduction of myocardial infarction. In two RCTs an average dose of 72 mg/day fluvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 31.9%, and reduced myocardial infarction, relative risk, 0.68 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.85) as compared to placebo. In five RCTs a mean atorvastatin dose of 26 mg/day reduced LDL cholesterol by 44.0% and reduced myocardial infarction, relative risk, 0.67 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.77) as compared to placebo. In four RCTs a mean rosuvastatin dose of 16 mg/day reduced LDL cholesterol by 48.8% and reduced myocardial infarction, relative risk, 0.82 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.93) as compared to placebo. Thus despite reducing LDL cholesterol by a much lesser amount with fluvastatin than atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, fluvastatin reduced myocardial infarction similarly to atorvastatin and to a greater degree than rosuvastatin. == References ==",Lescol,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.556489552167477e-06), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002669931564014405)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/lescol.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=75, start_index=9, title='Lescol: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects & Warnings - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/lescol.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Elevated expression of translocator protein (TSPO) has been shown to predict disease progression and aggressive, invasive behavior in a variety of solid tumors. Thus, noninvasive molecular imaging of TSPO expression could form the basis of a novel, predictive cancer imaging biomarker. In quantitative preclinical PET studies, we evaluated a high-affinity pyrazolopyrimidinyl-based TSPO imaging ligand, N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-(18)F-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide ((18)F-DPA-714), as a translational probe for quantification of TSPO levels in glioma. Glioma-bearing rats were imaged with (18)F-DPA-714 in a small-animal PET system. Dynamic images were acquired simultaneously on injection of (18)F-DPA-714 (130-200 MBq/0.2 mL). Blood was collected to derive the arterial input function (AIF), with high-performance liquid chromatography radiometabolite analysis performed on selected samples for AIF correction. Compartmental modeling was performed using the corrected AIF. Specific tumor cell binding of DPA-714 was evaluated by radioligand displacement of (3)H-PK 11195 with DPA-714 in vitro and displacement of (18)F-DPA-714 with an excess of DPA-714 in vivo. Immediately after imaging, tumor and healthy brain tissues were harvested for validation by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. (18)F-DPA-714 was found to preferentially accumulate in tumors, with modest uptake in the contralateral brain. Infusion with DPA-714 (10 mg/kg) displaced (18)F-DPA-714 binding by greater than 60% on average. Tumor uptake of (18)F-DPA-714 was similar to another high-affinity TSPO imaging ligand, (18)F-N-fluoroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline, and agreed with ex vivo assay of TSPO levels in tumor and healthy brain. These studies illustrate the feasibility of using (18)F-DPA-714 for visualization of TSPO-expressing brain tumors. Importantly, (18)F-DPA-714 appears suitable for quantitative assay of tumor TSPO levels in vivo. Given the relationship between elevated TSPO levels and poor outcome in oncology, these studies suggest the potential of (18)F-DPA-714 PET to serve as a novel predictive cancer imaging modality. Many neurological conditions result in the overexpression of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), today recognized as a biomarker for microglial activation and neuroinflammation imaging. The pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine acetamides are a particularly attractive class of TSPO-specific ligands, prompting the development of several positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers.

247,"('Demeclocycline (hydrochloride)', 'Demeclocycline', 'Demethylchlortetracycline', 'Ledermycin', 'Demethylchlortetracyclin')",Medical,"Demeclocycline (INN, BAN, USAN, brand name Declomycin) is a tetracycline antibiotic which was derived from a mutant strain of Streptomyces aureofaciens. == Uses == Demeclocycline is officially indicated for the treatment of various types of bacterial infections. It is used as an antibiotic in the treatment of Lyme disease, acne, and bronchitis. Resistance, though, is gradually becoming more common, and demeclocycline is now rarely used for treatment of infections. It is widely used (though off-label in many countries including the United States) in the treatment of hyponatremia (low blood sodium concentration) due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) when fluid restriction alone has been ineffective. Physiologically, this works by reducing the responsiveness of the collecting tubule cells to ADH. The use in SIADH actually relies on a side effect; demeclocycline induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (dehydration due to the inability to concentrate urine). The use of demeclocycline in SIADH was first reported in 1975, and, in 1978, a larger study found it to be more effective and better tolerated than lithium carbonate, the only available treatment at the time. Demeclocycline used to be the drug of choice for treating SIADH. Meanwhile, it might be superseded, now that vasopressin receptor antagonists, such as tolvaptan, became available. == Contraindications == Like other tetracyclines, demeclocycline is contraindicated in children and pregnant or nursing women. All members of this class interfere with bone development and may discolour teeth. == Side effects and interactions == The side effects are similar to those of other tetracyclines. Skin reactions with sunlight have been reported. Like only few other known tetracycline derivatives, demeclocycline causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Furthermore, demeclocycline might have psychotropic side effects similar to lithium. Tetracyclines bind to cations, such as calcium, iron (when given orally), and magnesium, rendering them insoluble and nonadsorbable for the gastrointestinal tract. Demeclocycline should not be taken with food (particularly milk and other dairy products) or antacids. == Mechanism of action == As with related tetracycline antibiotics, demeclocycline acts by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit to inhibit binding of aminoacyl tRNA which impairs protein synthesis by bacteria. It is bacteriostatic (it impairs bacterial growth, but does not kill bacteria directly). Demeclocycline inhibits the renal action of antidiuretic hormone by interfering with the intracellular second messenger cascade (specifically, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activation) after the hormone binds to vasopressin V2 receptors in the kidney. Exactly how demeclocycline does this has yet to be elucidated, however. == Brand names == Brand names include Declomycin, Declostatin, Ledermycin, Bioterciclin, Deganol, Deteclo, Detravis, Meciclin, Mexocine, and Clortetrin. == References ==",Demethylchlortetracyclin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.160317621426657e-05), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015162649797275662)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;  ', [])"

Regorafenib shows anti-angiogenic activity due to its dual targeted VEGFR2-TIE2 tyrosine kinase inhibition. Since 2009 it was studied as a potential treatment option in multiple tumor types. By 2015 it had two US approvals for advanced cancers. == Approvals and indications == === Metastatic colorectal cancer === Regorafenib demonstrated to increase the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and has been approved by the US FDA in September 2012. After a manufacturer's appeal Regorafenib was restored to the list of treatments funded by the English Cancer Drugs Fund. === Advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours === In February 2013 the US FDA expanded the approved use to treat patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors that cannot be surgically removed and no longer respond to other FDA-approved treatments for this disease. In a clinical study with 199 patients regorafenib treated patients had a delay in tumor growth (progression-free survival) that was, on average, 3.9 months longer than patients who were given placebo. === Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma === In November 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approved use of regorafenib in people with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were previously treated with sorafenib. == Clinical trials == MetastaticCRC: After the CORRECT trial, two phase 3 trials (CONSIGN, CONCUR) showed benefits compared to placebo. Regorafenib dosing was 150 or 160 mg/d for first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. == Adverse effects == Regorafenib is being approved with a Boxed Warning alerting patients and health care professionals that severe and fatal liver toxicity occurred in patients treated with regorafenib during clinical studies. Serious side effects, which occurred in less than one percent of patients, were liver damage, severe bleeding, blistering and peeling of skin, very high blood pressures requiring emergency treatment, heart attacks and perforations (holes) in the intestines. The most common side effects reported in patients treated with regorafenib include weakness or fatigue, loss of appetite, hand-foot syndrome (also called palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), diarrhoea, mouth sores (mucositis), weight loss, infection, high blood pressure, and changes in voice volume or quality (dysphonia). == Other actions == Regorafenib and at least one of its analogs, sorafenib, are potent inhibitors of Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). sEH metabolizes, and in general thereby inactivates, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs), epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs), and other epoxy polyunsaturated fatty acids that are made by various cytochrome P450 epoxygenases. EETs, EDPs, and EEQs have various effects in animals including vasodilation, anti-hypertensive, and anti-blood-clotting actions. However, EDPs, unlike EETs, inhibit the vascularization, growth, and metastasis of human cancer cells in vitro and in animal models. It is suggested that the inhibition of sEH and consequential increase in EDP levels contributes to the anti-cancer activity of regorafenib and related analogs, a possibility supported by studies showing that 1) DHA acted synergistically with regorafenib to increase EDP levels in and inhibit the growth of several human renal cancer cell lines in vitro and 2) dietary DHA likewise acted synergistically with regorafenib to inhibit the invasiveness and growth of a human renal cancer cell line while increasing its EPA levels in mice. These preclinical studies suggest that dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA, may be useful in enhancing the anti-cancer actions of regorafenib in humans. == Brand names == In Bangladesh under the trade name Regonix., Regora manufactured by Beacon Pharmaceuticals Ltd. == References ==",Stivarga,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.8980677345534787e-05), ('ICAL', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000933926145080477)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ema.europa.eu](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/stivarga?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=104, start_index=9, title='Stivarga | European Medicines Agency (EMA)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/stivarga?utm_source=openai')])"

Halofantrine's structure contains a substituted phenanthrene, and is related to the antimalarial drugs quinine and lumefantrine. Marketed as Halfan, halofantrine is never used to prevent malaria and its mode of action is unknown, although a crystallographic study showed that it binds to hematin in vitro, suggesting a possible mechanism of action. Halofantrine has also been shown to bind to plasmepsin, a haemoglobin degrading enzyme unique to the malarial parasites. Halofantrine was developed at SRI International for the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research from 1965 to 1975 by a team led by medicinal chemist William Colwell. == Adverse reactions == Halofantrine can cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, rash, headache, itching and elevated liver enzymes. It can be associated with cardiotoxicity. The most dangerous side effect is cardiac arrhythmias: halofantrine causes significant QT prolongation, and this effect is seen even at standard doses. The drug should therefore not be given to patients with cardiac conduction defects and should not be combined with mefloquine. A survey from 2009 suggests that the drug is safe when correctly administered. == Other adverse reactions == Consumption of grapefruit combined with certain medications can cause serious side effects, even death. Halofantrine combined with this fruit or grapefruit juice is dangerous. The mechanism of action is inhibition of CYP3A4, which is necessary to metabolize the drug and eliminate it from the body. Without CYP3A4, levels of the drug will become toxic in the body. == Pharmacology == The mechanism of action of halofantrine is unknown. The absorption of halofantrine is erratic, but is increased when taken with fatty food. Because of fears of toxicity due to increased halofantrine blood levels, halofantrine should be taken on an empty stomach. Plasma levels peak at 16 hours and the half-life of the drug is about 4 days. == Uses == Halofantrine is only used to treat malaria. It is not used to prevent malaria (prophylaxis) because of the risk of toxicity and unreliable absorption. == Dosing == Adult dose: three doses of 500 mg six hours apart. Halofantrine should be taken on an empty stomach. == Manufacturing information and availability == Halfan (GlaxoSmithKline) is available as 250 mg tablets.

Thirty-seven women with mild-to-moderate SUI were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. Patients received 1.5 mg Ro 115-1240 twice daily or matching placebo for 2 or 4 weeks. Voiding diaries were used to record the number of SUI episodes, urge incontinence episodes and pads used. Sitting blood pressures and heart rate were recorded at each visit. Ro 115-1240 was associated with a significantly lower mean weekly number of SUI episodes than placebo (8.4 vs 6.0; P= 0.0079), a 28% relative improvement over placebo. There was also a significantly lower mean number of pads used and wet pads changed/week with Ro 115-1240 than with placebo (P = 0.0055 and 0.0066, respectively). The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were scalp tingling, headache, chills, piloerection, and pruritus. Generally these events were transient and mild to moderate. There was a slightly lower mean sitting heart rate with Ro 115-1240 than with placebo, but no difference in mean systolic or diastolic blood pressure between treatments. This study suggests that selective alpha1A/1l-adrenoceptor partial agonists have the potential to improve the symptoms of SUI with little or no cardiovascular effect. These results are encouraging and a randomized controlled trial of Ro 115-1240 in a larger population with SUI is warranted to substantiate these findings. To describe the preclinical pharmacology of Ro 115-1240, a peripherally acting selective alpha1A/1L-adrenoceptor (AR) partial agonist, compared with the alpha1A/1L-AR full agonist amidephrine, as AR agonists have some utility in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) but are limited by undesirable cardiovascular and central nervous system side-effects. In radioligand-binding studies Ro 115-1240 had greater affinity for alpha1A than for alpha1B and alpha1D subtypes. The potency and intrinsic activity of amidephrine and Ro 115-1240 relative to noradrenaline were determined in native and cell-based assays using human recombinant alpha1-ARs; they acted as selective alpha1A/1L-AR full and partial agonists, respectively. In anaesthetized micropigs and rabbits, amidephrine and Ro 115-1240 produced non-selective, dose-dependent increases in intraurethral and arterial blood pressures but the magnitude of the pressure increases evoked by Ro 115-1240 were about a third of those with amidephrine. In conscious micropigs both agents produced dose-dependent increases in urethral tension. Again, the magnitude of the urethral response to Ro 115-1240 was about a third of that with amidephrine. More importantly, only amidephrine produced dose-dependent increases in blood pressure and decreases in heart rate. Ro 115-1240 produced a maximum increase in urethral tension with no effect on blood pressure or heart rate. These results show that by combining selectivity for the alpha1A/1L-AR subtype with a reduction in intrinsic agonist efficacy, Ro 115-1240 has reduced haemodynamic effects while retaining to some degree the contractile effects on urethral smooth muscle. These studies indicate that Ro 115-1240 may be useful as a novel treatment for SUI.",Ro 115-1240,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.011047935113310814), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0011891205795109272), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00862894020974636)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO;https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2004.04577.x,https://bjui-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2004.04560.x,https://www.medchemexpress.com/dabuzalgron.html ', [])"
252,"('Ketanserin', 'Ketanserin tartrate', 'Ketanserinum', 'Ketaserin', 'Ketanserina')",Medical,"Ketanserin, sold under the brand name Sufrexal, is an antihypertensive agent which is used to treat arterial hypertension and vasospastic disorders. It is also used in scientific research as an antiserotonergic agent in the study of the serotonin system; specifically, the 5-HT2 receptor family. The drug is taken by mouth. Side effects of ketanserin include dizziness, tiredness, edema, dry mouth, weight gain, and QT interval prolongation. Ketanserin acts as a selective antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, α1-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors. It also shows lower affinity for various other targets. Ketanserin was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1980. It was the first serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist to be discovered that showed selectivity over other serotonin receptors. The drug is not available in the United States and is mostly no longer marketed throughout the rest of the world. == Uses == === Medical uses === Ketanserin is classified as an antihypertensive by the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Health. It has been used to reverse pulmonary hypertension caused by protamine (which in turn was administered to reverse the effects of heparin overdose). The reduction in hypertension is not associated with reflex tachycardia. It has been used in cardiac surgery. A 2000 Cochrane Review found that, compared to placebo, ketanserin did not provide significant relief for people suffering from Raynaud's phenomenon attacks in the setting of progressive systemic sclerosis (an autoimmune disorder). While the frequency of the attacks was unaffected by ketanserin, there was a reduction in the duration of the individual attacks. However, due to the significant adverse effect burden, the authors concluded that ketanserin's utility for this indication is likely unbeneficial. Ketanserin is a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist that was initially developed as an anti-hypertensive medicine. However, now the drug is available as a topical gel formulation for treating wounds, burns, ulcers, and anal fissures. Its action is through the acceleration of epithelialization. === Research uses === With tritium (3H) radioactively labeled ketanserin is used as a radioligand for serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, e.g. in receptor binding assays and autoradiography. This radio-labeling has enabled the study of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor distribution in the human brain. An autoradiography study of the human cerebellum has found an increasing binding of 3H-ketanserin with age (from below 50 femtomol per milligram tissue at around 30 years of age to over 100 above 75 years). The same research team found no significant correlation with age in their homogenate binding study. Ketanserin has also been used with carbon (11C) radioactively labeled NNC112 in order to image cortical D1 receptors without contamination by 5-HT2 receptors. Increasing research into the use of psychedelics as antidepressants has seen ketanserin used to both block the hallucinogenic experience, and to disentangle the specific cognitive effects of 5-HT2A activation. Ketanserin has been found to block the psychedelic effects of psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, and ayahuasca (dimethyltryptamine) in clinical studies. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ketanserin is a high-affinity non-selective antagonist of 5-HT2 receptors in rodents, In addition to the 5-HT2 receptors, ketanserin is also a high affinity antagonist for the H1 receptor. It has also been found to block the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Occupancy of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor by ketanserin in humans has been studied. === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of ketanserin is 50%. The plasma protein binding of ketanserin is 95.0% and it is mainly bound to albumin. The elimination half-life of ketanserin is 10 to 29 hours. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === Either 3-(2-Chloroethyl)quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione [5081-87-8] (1a), or alternatively 2,3-dihydro-[1,3]oxazolo[2,3-b]quinazolin-5-one [52727-44-3] (1b) can be used as starting material.

It is manufactured by Merck KGaA under the tradename Emflex. It is no longer available in the UK (since 2018), however is available in other countries as a prescription-only drug. == Medical uses == Acemetacin has proven effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other kinds of rheumatoid inflammation, as well as in post-operative and post-traumatic pain and attack of gout. Application of a single dose of acemetacin for post-operative pain is not well supported by studies. == Contraindications == Contraindications are basically the same as with other NSAIDs: hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs in the past (typically asthma or skin reactions), gastrointestinal or cerebral bleeding, peptic ulcer, haematopoietic disorders (anaemia, leukopenia), and during the third trimester of pregnancy. == Adverse effects == Common side effects (in about 1–10% of patients) include gastrointestinal problems typical of NSAIDs, such as nausea, diarrhoea, stomach pain, and peptic ulcer; central nervous effects like headache and dizziness; and skin reactions. Gastrointestinal tolerability is better than that of the related drug indometacin. Severe allergic reactions and haematopoietic disorders occur in fewer than 0.01% of patients. == Interactions == The following interactions, typical of NSAIDs, have been described: other NSAIDs, corticosteroids: increased frequency of side effects, especially peptic ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding diuretics, ACE inhibitors and other antihypertensive drugs: reduced effectiveness of these drugs with ACE inhibitors or ciclosporin, increased risk of kidney function disorders anticoagulants such as warfarin: increased risk of bleeding increased blood plasma concentrations of digoxin and methotrexate decreased plasma concentrations of lithium == Pharmacology == Acemetacin acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX), producing the anti-inflammatory and analgetic (pain relieving) effects. In the body, it is partly metabolized to indomethacin, which also acts as a COX inhibitor. The same mechanism is responsible for the antipyretic and antiplatelet effects, which are however not clinically used, as well as for the typical NSAID adverse effects. An advantage of acemetacin is that it reduces gastric damage as compared to indometacin, possibly because acemetacin has less effect on the increase of leukotriene B4 synthesis and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression, leading to less induction of leukocyte-endothelial adherence. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance is quickly and almost completely absorbed from the gut. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after two hours. It is bound to plasma proteins to 80–90%. Concentrations in the synovial fluid and membranes, muscle and bone are higher than in the blood. Apart from the active metabolite indometacin, a number of inactive metabolites are found after application of acemetacin: the O-desmethyl-, des-4-chlorobenzoyl-, and O-desmethyl-des-4-chlorobenzoyl derivatives of both indometacin and acemetacin, as well as all of these substances' glucuronides (mediated at least partly by the enzyme UGT2B7). Elimination half-life is 4.5±2.8 hours (in some individuals up to 16 hours) under steady state conditions. 40% are eliminated via the kidney, and 50% via the faeces. == Chemistry == Acemetacin is the glycolic acid ester of indometacin. It is a fine, slightly yellowish, crystalline powder that melts at 150 to 153 °C (302 to 307 °F). It is polymorphic, with four known anhydrous (water-free) and two monohydrate crystalline forms. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Other brand names include Zadex (Hungary), Rheutrop (Austria), Acemetadoc, Acephlogont, Azeat, Rantudil (Germany, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Turkey), Gamespir (Greece), Oldan, Reudol (Spain), Tilur (Switzerland), ACEO (Taiwan), Ost-map (Egypt). == References ==",Emflex,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0003103728231508285), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005625095800496638)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.2014133334159851), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acemetacin ', [])"

Riluzole has also been reported to directly inhibit the kainate and NMDA receptors. The drug has also been shown to postsynaptically potentiate GABAA receptors via an allosteric binding site. However, the action of riluzole on glutamate receptors has been controversial, as no binding of the drug to any known sites has been shown for them. In addition, as its antiglutamatergic action is still detectable in the presence of sodium channel blockers, it is also uncertain whether or not it acts via this way. Rather, its ability to stimulate glutamate uptake seems to mediate many of its effects. In addition to its role in accelerating glutamate clearance from the synapse, riluzole may also prevent glutamate release from presynaptic terminals. Since CK1δ plays a key role in TDP-43 proteinopathy, a pathological hallmark of ALS, this could help to better decipher drug mechanism of action. == Synthesis == Riluzole can be prepared beginning with the reaction of 4-(trifluoromethoxy)aniline with potassium thiocyanate followed by reaction with bromine, forming the thiazole ring. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Riluzole was approved for medical use in the European Union in October 1996. == Research == A number of case studies and randomized controlled trials have indicated that riluzole, which is neuroprotective and a glutamate modulator, may have use in mood and anxiety disorders. However, it failed in trials of Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. Riluzole has been investigated in rodent models for its potential ability to protect against noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. These protective effects are believed to be caused by riluzole's antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, but other mechanisms, including modulation of glutamate signaling, are also being investigated. However, further research, especially in human trials, is necessary to confirm these findings and establish riluzole's clinical efficacy for treating hearing loss. A sublingual reformulation of riluzole that originated at Yale University and is known by the code name BHV-0223 is under development for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and mood disorders by Biohaven Pharmaceuticals. A prodrug formulation of riluzole, troriluzole, has been researched as a potential treatment for several different conditions. == See also == Utreloxastat == References ==",Rilutek,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00032050241134129465), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009336879593320191)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/pro/rilutek.html ', [])"

Cisplatin (DDP), as the first-line treatment, is always served as a mainstay of chemotherapeutic agents in combination with other drugs for NSCLC treatment. Nevertheless, DDP-based therapy is limited due to the frequent development of chemoresistance and adverse effects. Herein, it is necessary to find a more effective therapeutic approach with less toxicity. Falnidamol (FLD) is a pyrimido-pyrimidine compound and exerts anti-cancer activity. In the present study, we found that FLD could strongly promote the cytotoxicity of DDP and markedly reduce the IC ABCB1 overexpression is a key factor in causing multidrug resistance (MDR). As a result, it is crucial to discover effective medications against ABCB1 to overcome MDR. Falnidamol, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is currently in phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors. In this work, we assessed whether falnidamol could act as an inhibitor of ABCB1 to reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR. The reversal effect of falnidamol on MDR was assessed by MTT, colony formation, 3D microsphere, and xenograft model assays. The protein expression or cellular localization was tested by western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. The intracellular doxorubicin accumulation and efflux were assessed by flow cytometry. The ATPase activity of ABCB1 was detected by a microplate reader. The interaction between falnidamol and ABCB1 was evaluated by docking analysis and cellular thermal shift assay. Our data showed that falnidamol specifically reversed ABCB1-mediated MDR but not ABCG2-mediated MDR in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies suggested falnidamol had no effect on ABCB1 expression or cellular localization, nor on the AKT or ERK pathways. Further studies found that falnidamol reduced ABCB1's efflux function, resulting in enhanced intracellular agent accumulation and thus overcoming MDR. ATPase assay showed that falnidamol suppressed the ABCB1 ATPase activity. Furthermore, docking analysis and cellular thermal shift assay indicated that falnidamol bound directly to the drug-binding site of ABCB1 transporter. The present study proves that falnidamol acts as a highly potent and specific active ABCB1 transporter inhibitor, and can reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR, implying that combining falnidamol with ABCB1 substrate chemotherapeutic agents has the potential to overcome ABCB1-mediated MDR.",Falnidamol,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.547789674485102e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.002579102059826255), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01817091554403305)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.1602243334054947)])","('INFO; ([drugs.ncats.io](https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/0MU316797D?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=6, title='FALNIDAMOL', type='url_citation', url='https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/0MU316797D?utm_source=openai')])"

Post-RP patients often show a failure to respond to phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. The acute effect of BAY 60-4552, the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, and vardenafil were evaluated alone or in combination on erectile responses to electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve (ES CN) in rats with cavernous nerve (CN) crush injury-induced ED. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats underwent laparotomy (sham, n=10) or bilateral CN crush injury (n=56). After 3 wk of recovery, erectile function was evaluated under urethane anaesthesia following ES CN at different frequencies. The acute effects of intravenous (IV) injection of vehicle, vardenafil 0.03 mg/kg, BAY 60-4552 0.03 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg, or a BAY 60-4552 0.03 mg/kg plus vardenafil 0.03 mg/kg combination were evaluated in CN-crushed rats. Bilateral CN crush injury followed by a 3-wk recovery period decreased erectile responses to ES CN by about 50%. In CN-crushed rats, IV vardenafil 0.03 mg/kg and BAY 60-4552 (0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg) increased erectile responses to ES CN to the same extent: Δ intracavernosal pressure/mean arterial pressure (ICP/MAP) at 10 Hz ES CN was 21±1% after vehicle, 25±3% (p<0.001) after vardenafil, and 26±5% and 27±5% after BAY 60-4552 0.03 mg/kg (p<0.01) and 0.3 mg/kg (p<0.001), respectively. The combination of vardenafil with BAY 60-4552 in CN-crushed rats totally restored erectile responses to ES CN equivalent to sham rats (ΔICP/MAP at 10 Hz ES CN: 34±4% after BAY 60-4552/vardenafil combination vs 39±4% in sham rats; not significant). The present study supports the concept that the combined administration of a sGC stimulator, BAY 60-4552, and vardenafil provides synergistic beneficial effects and might therefore salvage patients who experience treatment failures with PDE5 inhibitors after RP. Overall efficacy rates of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-i) for erectile dysfunction (ED) are 60-70%. PDE5-i treatment failures currently have to resort to invasive treatment options for restoration of erectile function. AIMS.: To assess changes in the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/protein kinase (PKG) pathway in human corpus cavernosum (HCC) of PDE5-i nonresponders compared with healthy controls. To evaluate the effects of BAY 60-4552, a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), and vardenafil on relaxation of HCC strips from PDE5-i nonresponders. mRNA expression, morphological localization of the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway, and relaxant capacity of both compounds alone or combined. Analysis of variance, t-test or Mann-Whitney test based upon number of groups and normality of data. HCC tissues were harvested after consent from individuals undergoing penile prosthesis implantation (patients) and potent patients undergoing transurethral surgery (healthy controls, needle biopsy). HCC tissues of patients were compared with those of healthy controls for the expression of mRNA coding for PDE5A, eNOS, PKGα1, PKG2, sGCα1, sGCα2, sGCβ1, sGCβ2, α-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) and β-actin by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The respective proteins were localized using immunofluorescence. Tissue strips of patients were precontracted with phenylepinephrine followed by incubation with 1 μM of either vardenafil or BAY 60-4552, or both simultaneously. The main targets in the NO/cGMP/sGC pathway were downregulated in PDE5-i nonresponders. The pathway was morphologically located to HCC smooth muscle, of which the overall content was preserved in ED patients based on aSMA expression. BAY 60-4552 and vardenafil have synergistic effects on relaxation of HCC of PDE5-i nonresponders.

Accumulative evidence suggests that each sirtuin possesses individual character, implicating its role in the regulation of multifaceted biological functions leading to BC initiation, progression and metastasis. Selisistat (EX527) is a potent, cell permeable, highly selective SIRT1 inhibitor. In the study, the tumour-suppressive effects of the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (selisistat) alone and in combination with paclitaxel (PAX) in different breast cancer cell lines and zebrafish xenograft models were investigated. The type of pharmacological drug-drug interaction between EX527 and PAX was determined using the isobolographic method. EX527 and PAX used individually inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in G1 and subG1/G2 phases. Interestingly, the combination of these compounds used in the 1:1 dose-ratio augmented all these effects (IC Selisistat, a selective SirT1 inhibitor is being developed as a potentially disease-modifying therapeutic for Huntington's disease (HD).

It has been tested in CMV infected patients with allogeneic stem cell transplants and may also be useful for other patients with a compromised immune system such as those with organ transplants or HIV infections. The drug was initially developed by the anti-infective division at Bayer, which became AiCuris Anti-infective Cures AG through a spin-out and progressed the development to end of Phase 2 before the project was sold to Merck & Co for Phase 3 development and approval. The drug was granted fast track status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and orphan drug status by the European Medicines Agency. It is approved for prevention of CMV infection and disease in recipients of an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The FDA considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical use == In the US as well as in the EU, letermovir is used for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The therapy is started shortly after the transplantation and typically lasts for 100 days. Although letermovir is a relatively new antiviral, CMV resistance has been documented in stem cell transplantation recipients; although rare, breakthrough infections of prophylactic treatment with letermovir underscores the ongoing selective pressure on CMV's viral evolution and its continued ability to evade therapeutic suppression through mutations in critical gene regions such as within the UL56 amplicon. == Contraindications == Combining the drug with pimozide or ergot alkaloids (such as ergotamine or methylergometrine) is contraindicated because these drugs are metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and letermovir inhibits this enzyme. In people who also take ciclosporin, which increases letermovir concentrations in the body, combination with the cholesterol lowering drugs simvastatin and pitavastatin is also contraindicated. In Canada, this also applies to bosentan, lovastatin and rosuvastatin; and in the EU, to dabigatran, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin. == Adverse effects == Side effects from the use of letermovir are uncommon, but gastrointestinal symptoms such as gastritis and nausea may occur, as can dyspnea (difficulties breathing) and hepatitis. In general, side effects of the drug are comparable to those under placebo treatment. == Overdose == In studies, giving the threefold therapeutic dose for 14 days resulted in no additional adverse effects. It is unknown whether the substance can be removed from the system by hemodialysis. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Letermovir is a viral terminase inhibitor. It specifically inhibits the CMV viral terminase complex which is encoded by the CMV genes UL56, UL51 and UL89. This inhibition has the effect of preventing cleavage of CMV DNA concatamers, resulting in long uncleaved DNA and noninfectious viral particles. Letermovir is only active against CMV and has no effect on other herpesviruses. === Pharmacokinetics === Letermovir is quickly absorbed from the gut, reaching its highest concentrations in the blood plasma after 1.5 to 3 hours. Its bioavailability is estimated to be 37%. Ciclosporin increases this bioavailability to about 85%. When in the bloodstream, the substance is almost completely (98.2%) bound to plasma proteins. It is mostly (96.6%) circulating in its original form; only a small proportion is metabolized by the liver enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT1A3, resulting in a glucuronide. The drug is mainly excreted via the feces (93.3%). Less than 2% is found in the urine. == Chemistry == Letermovir is used as the free acid.

263,"('Finafloxacin', 'Xtoro', 'Finafloxacin (inn)', 'Finafloxacin [inn]', 'Gastrochinolon')",Medical,"Finafloxacin (Xtoro) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear) caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. == Medical uses == Finafloxacin is used to treat a type of ear infection called acute otitis externa caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. In the clinical trial that led to the drug's approval, finafloxacin shortened the time to cessation of ear pain from an average of 6.8 days in patients taking a placebo to 3.5 days. Finafloxacin cannot be purchased over-the-counter, and is available by prescription only. === Available forms === Finafloxacin is commercially available as a 0.3% otic (meaning ""for the ear"") suspension for topical administration in the United States. The suspension should be warmed gently in the hands for 1–2 minutes before administration to prevent dizziness, and shaken before use. It is necessary to remain still for 1 minute, with the affected ear facing up while lying on one's side, after administration to allow finafloxacin to penetrate the ear canal and reach the site of infection. === Specific populations === ==== Pregnancy ==== Finafloxacin is classified as pregnancy category C, meaning that the risk for harming a developing fetus has not been ruled out. ==== Pediatrics ==== The efficacy and safety profile of finafloxacin ear drops are unknown in children younger than the age of 1 years old. ==== Geriatrics ==== There are no limitations against using finafloxacin ear drops in the elderly. == Adverse effects == The spectrum of adverse effects caused by finafloxacin vary by the method of administration. People that have administered finafloxacin into their ears in the form of drops have experienced ear itching and nausea (<1% for both). People that have administered finafloxacin by mouth or intravenously (IV) have experienced gastrointestinal side effects (including diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea), fatigue, headaches, musculoskeletal problems, and injection site reactions (if IV). Respiratory disorders, including rhinitis and nasopharyngitis, have also been associated with the use of finafloxacin. People that are allergic to other quinolones may be allergic to finafloxacin as well, and use may result in an allergic reaction in that population. Adverse effects consistent with an allergic reaction to finafloxacin may include swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty swallowing, and shortness of breath. == Overdose == It is not thought that an overdose of the otic suspension is likely to cause severe or life-threatening symptoms. == Interactions == Owing to the local effect of administering finafloxacin into the ears, it is unlikely that it will affect or be affected by other medications that are administered into the systemic circulation (e.g. drugs taken by mouth, or by injection). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Finafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone class antibiotic of the 8-cyano subclass (referring to the CN substituent at the 8th position). Like other fluoroquinolones, its antibiotic activity is derived from its pharmacological mechanism of action as a type II topoisomerase poison, preventing bacteria from replicating and performing other vital, cellular functions. However, unlike other fluoroquinolones, finafloxacin is highly active under acidic (pH 5.0–6.0) conditions, where certain bacteria (like Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that is known to infect the human stomach, despite the harsh acidity) thrive. Other acidic conditions found on the human body include the vagina, urinary tract, and skin, though finafloxacin is currently not used to treat infections in these areas either. Finafloxacin has demonstrated bactericidal activity against a range of bacterial pathogens, especially at acidic pH, with a post-antibiotic effect. Owing to its activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, finafloxacin is classified as a broad-spectrum antibiotic. === Pharmacokinetics === Finafloxacin has good oral bioavailability, meaning that a substantial portion of a dose taken by mouth reaches a person's systemic circulation. Some people have experienced unintentional, quantifiable absorption of finafloxacin into systemic circulation after administering the drug via the ear. The elimination half-life of finafloxacin is approximately 10 hours in humans. == Chemistry == The chemical structure of finafloxacin has been described as a ""fluorinated quinolone derivative with 8-cyano-substituent and 7-pyrrolo-oxazinyl moiety."" Its low isoelectric point (pH 6.7) is lower than the isoelectric point of another fluoroquinolone class antibiotic called ciprofloxacin (pH 7.4), which accounts for finafloxacin's superior activity at low pH (5.0–6.0). There are some notable differences between the chemistry of finafloxacin and related fluoroquinolones. For example, the 8-cyano-substituent is not found in ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin has an 8-methoxy-substituent instead. The oxygen atom in the ring structure of finafloxacin makes the molecule more hydrophilic than ciprofloxacin. The chemical structure of finafloxacin is nearly identical to that of pradofloxacin. === Synthesis === The synthesis of finafloxacin has been described in detail in its patents. An example of its synthesis is provided below: == History == Finafloxacin is the first FDA approved medication in the United States that was first developed by a Singaporean drug company. Finafloxacin was officially approved by the FDA on December 17, 2014. The company, MerLion Pharmaceuticals, partnered with the North American company Alcon to produce the drug commercially in the United States. == Research == Owing to its high bactericidal activity in acidic environments, Bartoletti et al have speculated that finafloxacin may be useful in the treatment of urinary tract infections in the future. Finafloxacin's manufacturer, MerLion, has invested money in studying the use of finafloxacin for this indication. == References ==",Xtoro,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0031911423429846764), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016139635408762842)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.941850526549388e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/xtoro.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=74, start_index=9, title='Xtoro: Side Effects, Dosage & Uses - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/xtoro.html?utm_source=openai')])"
264,"('Vx 702', 'Kinome_3176', 'Ex-a013', 'S6005')",Medical," Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (S-AKI) contributes to high mortality, but it is lack of specific treatments. We aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of S-AKI and to identify target drugs to alleviate AKI. We establish a stable mouse model of S-AKI by Pseudomonas aeruginosa incision infection. Based on high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we investigated the underlying mechanism and selected the target drug (VX-702) for S-AKI. An in vitro model established by co-cultured of kidney tubular epithelial cell line (TCMK-1) cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced leukemic monocyte/macrophage cells (RAW264.7), we explored the effect of VX-702 on S-AKI. The data showed interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β were the hub genes, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was the main pathway involved in S-AKI. Administration of VX-702 by oral gavage decreased the elevated concentrations of IL-6, IL-1β, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen in mice with S-AKI. Moreover, VX-702 reduced the number of apoptotic cells in damaged kidney tissues. Cell viability was decreased, and the number of apoptotic cells was increased in TCMK-1 cells co-cultured with LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells compared to LPS-induced TCMK-1 cells. VX-702 treatment reversed this effect. VX-702 treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and proinflammatory cytokines in RAW264.7 cells and the supernatant. VX-702 could bind IL-6, IL-1β and MAPK, and affect the binding of IL-1β and its receptor, as demonstrated by molecular docking. VX-702 ameliorated S-AKI by inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages, indicating its potential as a novel therapeutic for S-AKI treatment. VX-702 is a novel p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor being developed to treat rheumatoid arthritis. To characterize the renal excretion profile of VX-702 using the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPRK) model. Studies were performed to assess the dose linearity of VX-702 excretion and to evaluate the effect of inhibitors of organic anion (probenecid) and organic cation (cimetidine) transport systems on VX-702 disposition. VX-702 excretion was studied over a range of doses targeting concentrations between 100 and 600 ng/mL. VX-702 (600 ng/mL) was also co-perfused with probenecid (1 mM) and cimetidine (2 mM). The results were compared to parallel experiments performed with methotrexate (MTX). VX-702 excretion was linear over the range of doses studied, and clearance data were consistent with net reabsorption by the kidney. Transport inhibition studies indicate that VX-702 is not a substrate for renal organic anion and organic cation transport systems. MTX (500 ng/mL) also displayed net reabsorption in the IPRK, but secretory transport was inhibited upon co-administration with probenecid. This finding is consistent with previous IPRK studies that demonstrated inhibitory effects of NSAIDS on MTX excretion. Overall, this study suggests that a renal drug-drug interaction between VX-702 and MTX would be unlikely if these medications were co-administered. To assess the efficacy and safety of VX-702, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, in patients with active, moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of VX-702 were conducted in patients with active, moderate-to-severe RA. In the VeRA study, 313 patients received placebo or 2 daily doses of VX-702. In Study 304, 117 patients received placebo, daily VX-702, or twice weekly VX-702 in addition to concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Study end points included the proportion of patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (an ACR20 response), ACR50 and ACR70 responses, changes in the serum levels of biomarkers of inflammation, and safety assessments. The numerically superior ACR20 response rates among patients receiving VX-702 compared with those receiving placebo in both studies did not reach pairwise statistical significance at the highest doses in either study. At week 12 in the VeRA study, ACR20 response rates were 40%, 36%, and 28% among patients receiving 10 mg of VX-702, 5 mg of VX-702, and placebo, respectively. In Study 304, the response rates were 40%, 44%, and 22% for patients receiving 10 mg VX-702 daily plus MTX, 10 mg VX-702 twice weekly plus MTX, and placebo, respectively. Reductions in the levels of C-reactive protein, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor p55, and serum amyloid A were observed as early as week 1 in both studies, but these levels rapidly returned to baseline values by week 4. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar between the VX-702 and placebo groups. In the VeRA study, serious infections were more frequent in the VX-702 groups compared with the placebo group (2.4% versus 0%) but not in Study 304 (2.6% versus 4.9%). The modest clinical efficacy plus the transient suppression of biomarkers of inflammation observed in this study suggest that p38 MAPK inhibition may not provide meaningful, sustained suppression of the chronic inflammation seen in RA.",Vx 702,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.1637164789135568e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0021381154656410217), ('ICAL', -2.7418097943154862e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.008629531599581242)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.02324547804892063)])","('INFO; ([go.drugbank.com](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB05470?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=6, title='VX-702: Uses, Interactions, Mechanism of Action | DrugBank Online', type='url_citation', url='https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB05470?utm_source=openai')])"
265,"('Capecitabine', 'Xeloda', 'Capiibine', 'Capecitibine', 'Captabin')",Medical,"Capecitabine, sold under the brand name Xeloda among others, is a anticancer medication used to treat breast cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. For breast cancer it is often used together with docetaxel. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and rashes. Other severe side effects include blood clotting problems, allergic reactions, heart problems such as cardiomyopathy, and low blood cell counts. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the fetus. Capecitabine, inside the body, is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) through which it acts. It belongs to the class of medications known as fluoropyrimidines, which also includes 5-FU and tegafur. Capecitabine was patented in 1992 and approved for medical use in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Capecitabine is indicated for adjuvant treatment of people with Stage III colon cancer as a single agent or as a component of a combination chemotherapy regimen; perioperative treatment of adults with locally advanced rectal cancer as a component of chemoradiotherapy; treatment of people with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer as a single agent or as a component of a combination chemotherapy regimen; treatment of people with advanced or metastatic breast cancer as a single agent if an anthracycline- or taxane-containing chemotherapy is not indicated; treatment of people with advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with docetaxel after disease progression on prior anthracycline-containing chemotherapy; treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction cancer as a component of a combination chemotherapy regimen; treatment of adults with HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease as a component of a combination regimen; adjuvant treatment of adults with pancreatic adenocarcinoma as a component of a combination chemotherapy regimen. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects by frequency: Very common (>10% frequency) Notes on adverse effects: == Contraindications == Contraindications include: History of hypersensitivity to fluorouracil, capecitabine or any of its excipients DPD deficiency (see Pharmacogenetics) Pregnancy and lactation Severe leucopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia Severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment Treatment with sorivudine or its chemically related analogues, such as brivudine In 2020, the EU and UK license was updated to state that capecitabine was contra-indicated in patients that ""have a known complete absence of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity"". In US, as of 2024, there is no specific contraindication on the package inserts however, there is a cautionary warning: ""Patients with certain homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the DPYD gene are at increased risk for acute early-onset toxicity and serious, including fatal, adverse reactions due to XELODA (e.g., mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity). XELODA is not recommended for use in patients known to have certain homozygous or compound heterozygous DPYD variants that result in complete absence of DPD activity. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on clinical assessment. No XELODA dose has been proven safe in patients with complete absence of DPD activity.

MK-0773 is a selective androgen receptor modulator designed to improve muscle function while minimizing effects on other tissues. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate an improvement in muscle strength and lean body mass (LBM) in sarcopenic frail elderly women treated with MK-0773 relative to placebo. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 6-month study. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either MK-0773 50mg b.i.d. or placebo; all participants received Vitamin D and protein supplementation. General community. 170 Women aged ≥65 with sarcopenia and moderate physical dysfunction. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength and power, physical performance measures. Participants receiving MK-0773 showed a statistically significant increase in LBM from baseline at Month 6 vs. placebo (p<0.001). Participants receiving both MK-0773 and placebo showed a statistically significant increase in strength from baseline to Month 6, but the mean difference between the two groups was not significant (p=0.269). Both groups showed significant improvement from baseline at Month 6 in physical performance measures, but there were no statistically significant differences between participants receiving MK-0773 and placebo. A greater number of participants experienced elevated transaminases in the MK-0773 group vs. placebo, which resolved after discontinuation of study therapy. MK-0773 was generally well-tolerated with no evidence of androgenization. The MK-0773-induced increase in LBM did not translate to improvement in strength or function vs. placebo. The improvement of strength and physical function in the placebo group could be at least partly attributed to protein and vitamin D supplementation. Research into developing anabolic agents for various therapeutic purposes has been pursued for decades. As the clinical utility of anabolic-androgenic steroids has been found to be limited because of their lack of tissue selectivity and associated off-target effects, alternative drug entities have been designed and are commonly referred to as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). While most of these SARMs are of nonsteroidal structure, the drug candidate MK-0773 comprises a 4-aza-steroidal nucleus. Besides the intended therapeutic use, SARMs have been found to be illicitly distributed and misused as doping agents in sport, necessitating frequently updated doping control analytical assays. As steroidal compounds reportedly undergo considerable metabolic transformations, the phase-I metabolism of MK-0773 was simulated using human liver microsomal (HLM) preparations and electrochemical conversion. Subsequently, major metabolic products were identified and characterized employing liquid chromatography-high-resolution/high- accuracy tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. MK-0773 produced numerous phase-I metabolites under the chosen in vitro incubation reactions, mostly resulting from mono- and bisoxygenation of the steroid. HLM yielded at least 10 monooxygenated species, while electrochemistry-based experiments resulted predominantly in three monohydroxylated metabolites. Elemental composition data and product ion mass spectra were generated for these analytes, ESI/APCI measurements corroborated the formation of at least two N-oxygenated metabolites, and NMR data obtained from electrochemistry-derived products supported structures suggested for three monohydroxylated compounds. Hereby, the hydroxylation of the A-ring located N- bound methyl group was found to be of particular intensity. In the absence of controlled elimination studies, the produced information enables the implementation of new target analytes into routine doping controls and expands the focus of anti-doping efforts concerning this new anabolic agent. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are androgen receptor (AR) ligands that induce anabolism while having reduced effects in reproductive tissues. In various experimental contexts SARMs fully activate, partially activate, or even antagonize the AR, but how these complex activities translate into tissue selectivity is not known. Here, we probed receptor function using >1000 synthetic AR ligands. These compounds produced a spectrum of activities in each assay ranging from 0 to 100% of maximal response. By testing different classes of compounds in ovariectomized rats, we established that ligands that transactivated a model promoter 40-80% of an agonist, recruited the coactivator GRIP-1 <15%, and stabilized the N-/C-terminal interdomain interaction <7% induced bone formation with reduced effects in the uterus and in sebaceous glands. Using these criteria, multiple SARMs were synthesized including MK-0773, a 4-aza-steroid that exhibited tissue selectivity in humans. Thus, AR activated to moderate levels due to reduced cofactor recruitment, and N-/C-terminal interactions produce a fully anabolic response, whereas more complete receptor activation is required for reproductive effects. This bimodal activation provides a molecular basis for the development of SARMs.",Mk 0773,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.7120533811976202e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.003616936504840851), ('ICAL', -2.622600959512056e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.3133406937122345)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.02324547804892063)])","('INFO; https://iiab.me/kiwix/content/mdwiki_en_all_2023-11/A/MK-0773,https://cdek.pharmacy.purdue.edu/api/48917/ ', [])"
268,"('Barasertib', 'Barasertib [inn]', 'Barasertibum', 'Barasertib (who-dd)', 'Kinome_3324')",Medical," Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease characterized by progressive cartilage loss that causes disability worldwide. The accumulation of senescent chondrocytes in aging human cartilage contributes to the high incidence of OA. Heterochromatin instability, the hallmark and driving factor of senescence, regulates the expression of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype that induces inflammation and cartilage destruction. However, the role of heterochromatin instability in OA progression remains unclear. In this work, we identified AURKB as a key senescence-associated chromatin regulator using bioinformatics methods. We found that AURKB was upregulated in OA cartilage and chondrocytes exposed to abnormal mechanical strain. Overexpression of AURKB could cause senescence and heterochromatin instability. Furthermore, the AURKB inhibitor Barasertib reversed senescence and heterochromatin instability in chondrocytes and alleviated OA in a rat model. Mechanistically, abnormal mechanical strain increased AURKB levels through the Piezo1/Ca Barasertib is a highly selective Aurora kinase B (AURKB) inhibitor and has been widely applied in a variety of cancer cells to investigate the regulatory function of AURKB. However, the effect of barasertib on glucose metabolism in gastric cancer (GC) remains illustrated. Here, barasertib was identified to effectively reduce glucose uptake and lactate production in GC cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. The expression levels of GLUT1, LDHA and HK2 were decreased by barasertib treatment of GC cells. Furthermore, we found that barasertib induced the expression of ribosomal protein S7 (RPS7), as a tumor suppressor, to regulate glucose metabolism. Silencing of RPS7 rescued the effects of barasertib on glucose metabolism in GC cells. Overexpression of RPS7 suppressed the promoter activity of C-Myc, which has been identified as an important regulator of glucose metabolism in cancer cells. The clinical data showed that the expression level of AURKB in GC patients' sera and tissues were positively correlated with those of C-Myc, GLUT1 and LDHA, but negatively with that of RPS7. Therefore, these findings provide new evidence that barasertib regulates GC cell glucose metabolism by inducing the RPS7/C-Myc signal pathway, and have important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches using AURKB as a target protein to prevent tumor recurrence. Barasertib, an aurora B inhibitor, terminates cell division, introduces polyploidy, and consequently causes apoptosis. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the combination of barasertib and cytarabine (ara-C), a key agent for leukemia chemotherapy, on leukemic cells in vitro. Human leukemia HL-60 cells and HL-60/ara-C20 cells, a 20-fold ara-C-resistant variant, were used. The 50% growth inhibitory concentrations of an active metabolite of barasertib, barasertib-hydroxyquinazoline-pyrazol-aniline (Barasertib-HQPA), and ara-C were 51 nM and 300 nM for HL-60 cells and 70 nM and 5300 nM for HL-60/ara-C20 cells, respectively. Barasertib-HQPA induced polyploidy with a subsequent induction of sub-G1 phase apoptosis, indicating the M-phase specific cytotoxicity. Cells treated with the S-phase specific ara-C accumulated in S phase and subsequently died through apoptosis. When HL-60 cells were treated with barasertib-HQPA and ara-C in combination, a greater-than-additive apoptosis was induced. This enhancement was obtained when the cells were treated with barasertib-HQPA prior to ara-C (37.9% sub-G1) or with both concurrently (31.2% sub-G1), but not with ara-C prior to barasertib-HQPA (17.8% sub-G1). The combination effects were similarly obtained in HL-60/ara-C20 cells with 19.7% sub-G1 for barasertib-HQPA→ara-C, 18.4% sub-G1 for both concurrently, and 13.8% sub-G1 for ara-C→barasertib-HQPA, and another leukemic U937 cells with 25.4% sub-G1 for barasertib-HQPA→ara-C, 28.2% sub-G1 for both concurrently, and 16.0% sub-G1 for ara-C→barasertib-HQPA.

Pralsetinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is taken by mouth. The most common adverse reactions include increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocytes, decreased neutrophils, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased creatinine, increased alkaline phosphatase, fatigue, constipation, musculoskeletal pain, decreased calcium, hypertension, decreased sodium, decreased phosphate, and decreased platelets. Pralsetinib was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2020, and in the European Union in November 2021. == Medical uses == Pralsetinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as detected by an FDA approved test. == History == Efficacy was investigated in a multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort clinical trial (ARROW, NCT03037385) with 220 participants aged 26-87 whose tumors had RET alterations. Identification of RET gene alterations was prospectively determined in local laboratories using either next generation sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or other tests. The main efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and response duration determined by a blinded independent review committee using RECIST 1.1. The trial was conducted at sites in the United States, Europe and Asia. Efficacy for RET fusion-positive NSCLC was evaluated in 87 participants previously treated with platinum chemotherapy. The ORR was 57% (95% CI: 46%, 68%); 80% of responding participants had responses lasting 6 months or longer. Efficacy was also evaluated in 27 participants who never received systemic treatment. The ORR for these participants was 70% (95% CI: 50%, 86%); 58% of responding participants had responses lasting 6 months or longer. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for pralsetinib priority review, orphan drug, and breakthrough therapy designationsand granted approval of Gavreto to Blueprint Medicines. == Society and culture == === Legal status === On 16 September 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorization for the medicinal product Gavreto, intended for the treatment of people with rearranged during transfection (RET)-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

270,"('Diazoxide', 'Sch-6783', 'Proglycem', 'Eudemine', 'Hyperstat')",Medical,"Diazoxide, sold under the brand name Proglycem among others, is a medication used to treat low blood sugar due to a number of specific causes. This includes islet cell tumors that cannot be removed and leucine sensitivity. It can also be used in refractory cases of sulfonylurea toxicity. It is taken by mouth. Diazoxide, used as the salt diazoxide choline, and sold under the brand name Vykat XR, is used for the treatment of hyperphagia in people with Prader-Willi syndrome. It was approved for this use in the United States in March 2025. Common side effects include high blood sugar, fluid retention, low blood platelets, a fast heart rate, increased hair growth, and nausea. Other severe side effects include pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. It is chemically similar to thiazide diuretics. It works by decreasing insulin release from the pancreas and increasing glucose release by the liver. Diazoxide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1973. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Diazoxide is used as a vasodilator in the treatment of acute hypertension or malignant hypertension. Diazoxide also inhibits the secretion of insulin by opening ATP-sensitive potassium channel of beta cells of the pancreas; thus, it is used to counter hypoglycemia in disease states such as insulinoma (a tumor producing insulin) or congenital hyperinsulinism. Diazoxide acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA and kainate receptors, suggesting potential application as a cognitive enhancer. == Side effects == Diazoxide interferes with insulin release through its action on potassium channels. Diazoxide is one of the most potent openers of the K+ ATP channels present on the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. Opening these channels leads to hyperpolarization of cell membrane, a decrease in calcium influx, and a subsequently reduced release of insulin. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a safety announcement in July 2015 highlighting the potential for development of pulmonary hypertension in newborns and infants treated with this drug. == Research == Diazoxide, formulated as its choline salt diazoxide choline, is an experimental antiobesity drug being tested in people with Prader-Willi syndrome and monogenic obesity caused by mutations in the SH2B1, PCSK1, or SIM1 genes. == References ==",Hyperstat,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.450303382938728e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001529715140350163)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.001170225441455841), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/pro/hyperstat.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Hyperstat: Package Insert / Prescribing Information', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/pro/hyperstat.html?utm_source=openai')])"
271,"('Clomipramine (hydrochloride)', 'Clomipramine', 'Chlorimipramine', 'Monochlorimipramine', 'Hydiphen')",Medical,"Clomipramine, sold under the brand name Anafranil among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It is used in the treatment of various conditions, most notably obsessive–compulsive disorder but also many other disorders, including hyperacusis, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, trichotillomania, body dysmorphic disorder and chronic pain. It has also been notably used to treat premature ejaculation and the cataplexy associated with narcolepsy. It may also address certain fundamental features surrounding narcolepsy besides cataplexy (especially hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations). The evidence behind this, however, is less robust. As with other antidepressants (notably including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), it may paradoxically increase the risk of suicide in those under the age of 25, at least in the first few weeks of treatment. It is typically taken by mouth, although intravenous preparations are sometimes used. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, loss of appetite, sleepiness, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and trouble urinating. Serious side effects include an increased risk of suicidal behavior in those under the age of 25, seizures, mania, and liver problems. If stopped suddenly, a withdrawal syndrome may occur with headaches, sweating, and dizziness. It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear but is believed to involve increased levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Clomipramine was discovered in 1964 by the Swiss drug manufacturer Ciba-Geigy. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Clomipramine has a number of uses in medicine, including in the treatment of: Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), which happens to be its only US FDATooltip Food and Drug Administration-labeled indication. Other regulatory agencies (such as the TGA of Australia and the MHRA of the UK) have also approved clomipramine for this indication. Major depressive disorder (MDD), a popular off-label use in the US. It is approved by the Australian TGA and the United Kingdom MHRA for this indication. In Japan it is also approved for depression. Some have suggested the possible superior efficacy of clomipramine compared to other antidepressants in the treatment of MDD, especially the more severe, although at the current time the evidence may be insufficient to more fully substantiate this claim. As-with other tricyclic antidepressants, the antidepressant response specifically may be augmented, including in treatment-resistant cases, with triiodothyronine, at a dosage of 50 mcg. In the case of clomipramine specifically, this may also be the case with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Body dysmorphic disorder Repetitive self-injurious/self-harming behaviours in those with intellectual disability specifically. The subtype of systemised paranoia characterised by somatic phenomena. Compulsive nail-biting (onychophagia). Cataplexy associated with narcolepsy. This is a TGA and MHRA-labeled indication for clomipramine. Self-bloodletting Premature ejaculation, where it may be more effective than paroxetine Depersonalization-derealization disorder Chronic pain with or without organic disease, particularly headache of the tension type. Developmental stuttering Sleep paralysis, with or without narcolepsy Enuresis (involuntary urinating in sleep) in children. The effect may not be sustained following treatment, and alarm therapy may be more effective in both the short-term and the long-term. Combining a tricyclic (such as clomipramine) with anticholinergic medication may be more effective for treating enuresis than the tricyclic alone. Trichotillomania In combination with lithium and tryptophan for severe, particularly treatment-resistant depression. This combination, in a similar vein, has also been used for clomipramine-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder. When electro-convulsive therapy is performed alongside this treatment-regime (as may be the case in severe depression and accompanied with thyroxine,) however, great care must be taken with lithium. The overall risk of seizures may have to be weighted against the refractory severity of the current illness and necessity of the amalgamation of treatment(s). Isolated cataplexy unto itself (i.e., in the absence of characteristically associated narcolepsy), admittedly a rare condition There is anecdotal and tentative, as-yet-undocumented information suggesting that clomipramine may address certain core features of hyperacusis, and possibly misophonia. In the case of hyperacusis, this appears to be especially the case at doses > 150 mg/d. As-with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a full response to any one dose may not be experienced for up to 12–16 weeks. Although lithium is most-associated with the treatment of bipolar disorder (where it is known for its general mood-stabilising features and to be especially useful in treating and preventing mania), it may have a certain place in the management of treatment-resistant depression (which is often of higher severity than other depressions which have not been addressed with ECT). In these cases is often prescribed alongside SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine), venlafaxine and various of the tricyclics (e.g., clomipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, maprotiline), which is why it may feature sometimes in the discussion of depression being managed with clomipramine. Lithium also significantly reduces the long-term risk of suicide in general. In any case, it is not necessary to have a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder (manic-depressive illness), or even to be considered to have subtle elements of it (“soft bipolarity”), to benefit from lithium in the context of treatment with clomipramine. In a meta-analysis of various trials involving fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Faverin/Luvox), and sertraline (Zoloft) to test their relative efficacies in treating OCD, clomipramine was found to be significantly more effective. Other studies have borne similar results even when risk of bias is eliminated. A potentially significantly greater inherent side-effect profile, however, makes it a second-line choice in the treatment of OCD. SSRIs are generally better-tolerated but appear to be inferior in terms of actual clinical efficacy. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Known hypersensitivity to clomipramine, or any of the excipients or cross-sensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants of the dibenzazepine group Recent myocardial infarction Any degree of heart block or other cardiac arrhythmias Mania Severe liver disease Narrow angle glaucoma Untreated urinary retention It must not be given in combination or within 3 weeks before or after treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. (Moclobemide-included; however, clomipramine may be initiated sooner at 48 hours following discontinuation of moclobemide.) === Pregnancy and lactation === Clomipramine use during pregnancy is associated with congenital heart defects in the newborn. It is also associated with reversible withdrawal effects in the newborn. Clomipramine is also distributed in breast milk and hence nursing while taking clomipramine is advised against. == Side effects == Clomipramine has been associated with the side effects listed below: Very common (>10% frequency): Common (1–10% frequency): Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency): Convulsions Ataxia Arrhythmias Elevated blood pressure Activation of psychotic symptoms Very rare (<0.01% frequency): Conduction disorder (e.g. widening of QRS complex, prolonged QT interval, PR/PQ interval changes, bundle-branch block, torsade de pointes, particularly in patients with hypokalaemia) Individual side-effects may or may not be amendable to treatment. As noted below, bethanechol may alleviate anti-muscarinic/anti-cholinergic side-effects. It may also treat sexual side-effects common to the likes of clomipramine, SSRIs and phenelzine. Topiramate has been used to off-set the weight-gain induced from various antidepressants and antipsychotics, and more broadly for general weight-loss (likewise with bupropion). This option may be especially attractive in patients either overweight prior to clomipramine treatment or who have gained an undesirable amount of weight on it. Another potential advantage of topiramate in the adjunctive treatment of people taking clomipramine is engendered in its status as an anti-convulsant medication, thereby theoretically increasing the seizure-threshold in patients (which clomipramine decreases to an extent which precludes its dosage ranging above 250 m.g./d. in normal circumstances, likewise with maprotiline and its 225 m.g./d. upper-ceiling). It may, thus, be useful and of increased importance in any case for patients with a familial or personal history of epilepsy or seizures of some other kind to concurrently take a daily dose of an anti-convulsant drug (topiramate, gabapentin, etc.) should they require or opt for treatment with an antidepressant which reduces the seizure-threshold significantly (bupropion, clomipramine, amoxapine, maprotiline, venlafaxine). In the case of seizures occurring due to overdose of tricyclic antidepressants, intravenous lorazepam may successfully terminate them. Phenytoin may or may not prevent them in the first instance but its status as an appropriate acute treatment for these seizures is somewhat controversial. Tremor may be relieved with a beta-blocker (e.g., pindolol, propranolol, atenolol). In certain cases of tremor, pindolol may be an especially sensible option for serious consideration, as there is substantial evidence that its utilisation is an effective augmentation-strategy for obsessive-compulsive disorder, an important indication for clomipramine. == Withdrawal == Withdrawal symptoms may occur during gradual or particularly abrupt withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressant drugs. Possible symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, insomnia, headache, nervousness, anxiety, dizziness and worsening of psychiatric status. Differentiating between the return of the original psychiatric disorder and clomipramine withdrawal symptoms is important. Clomipramine withdrawal can be severe. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur in neonates when clomipramine is used during pregnancy. A major mechanism of withdrawal from tricyclic antidepressants is believed to be due to a rebound effect of excessive cholinergic activity due to neuroadaptations as a result of chronic inhibition of cholinergic receptors by tricyclic antidepressants. Restarting the antidepressant and slow tapering is the treatment of choice for tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms may respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate. == Overdose == Clomipramine overdose usually presents with the following symptoms: There is no specific antidote for overdose and all treatment is purely supportive and symptomatic. Treatment with activated charcoal may be used to limit absorption in cases of oral overdose. Anyone suspected of overdosing on clomipramine should be hospitalised and kept under close surveillance for at least 72 hours. Clomipramine has been reported as being less toxic in overdose than most other TCAs in one meta-analysis but this may well be due to the circumstances surrounding most overdoses as clomipramine is more frequently used to treat conditions for which the rate of suicide is not particularly high such as OCD. In another meta-analysis, however, clomipramine was associated with a significant degree of toxicity in overdose. == Interactions == Clomipramine may interact with a number of different medications, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors which include isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, selegiline and tranylcypromine, antiarrhythmic agents (due to the effects of TCAs like clomipramine on cardiac conduction. There is also a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with quinidine due to the fact that clomipramine is metabolised by CYP2D6 in vivo), diuretics (due to the potential for hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) to develop which increases the risk for QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs; due to both potential additive serotonergic effects leading to serotonin syndrome and the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with the SSRIs that inhibit CYP2D6 (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine)] and serotonergic agents such as triptans, other tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, etc. (due to the potential for serotonin-toxicity | serotonin syndrome). Its use is also advised against in those concurrently on CYP2D6 inhibitors, due to the potential for increased plasma levels of clomipramine and the resulting potential for CNS and cardiotoxicity. Fluvoxamine increases the serotoninergic effects of clomipramine and, likewise, clomipramine increases fluvoxamine levels. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Clomipramine is a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, or a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); that is, it blocks the reuptake of these neurotransmitters back into neurons by preventing them from interacting with their transporters, thereby increasing their extracellular concentrations in the synaptic cleft and resulting in increased serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. In addition, clomipramine also has antiadrenergic, antihistamine, antiserotonergic, antidopaminergic, and anticholinergic activities. It is specifically an antagonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, the histamine H1 receptor, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, the dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors, and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1–M5). Like other TCAs, clomipramine weakly blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels as well. Probably all “anticholinergic” side-effects may be successfully reversed in a majority of people with bethanechol chloride, although knowledge of this amenability has unfortunately decreased in medical circles over the decades. Bethanechol supplementation arguably should, however, be seriously considered as an add-on treatment when tricyclics (which often carry significant anti-muscarinic effects, especially for amitriptyline, protriptyline, imipramine, and clomipramine) are prescribed, as it may alleviate potentially otherwise-limiting side-effects (blurry vision, dry mouth, urinary hesitancy/retention, etc.). This practice can make drugs of otherwise indispensably potent value more tolerable to certain patients and spare them needless suffering, hence-reducing the overall side-effect burden or concern thereof. Although clomipramine shows around 100- to 200-fold preference in affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) over the norepinephrine transporter (NET), its major active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (norclomipramine), binds to the NET with very high affinity (Ki = 0.32 nM) and with dramatically reduced affinity for the SERT (Ki = 31.6 nM). Moreover, desmethylclomipramine circulates at concentrations that are approximately twice those of clomipramine. In accordance, occupancy of both the SERT and the NET has been shown with clomipramine administration in positron emission tomography studies with humans and non-human primates. As such, clomipramine is in fact a fairly balanced SNRI rather than only a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI). The antidepressant effects of clomipramine are thought to be due to reuptake inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine, while serotonin reuptake inhibition only is thought to be responsible for the effectiveness of clomipramine in the treatment of OCD. Conversely, antagonism of the H1, α1-adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is thought to contribute to its side effects. Blockade of the H1 receptor is specifically responsible for the antihistamine effects of clomipramine and side effects like sedation and somnolence (sleepiness). Antagonism of the α1-adrenergic receptor is thought to cause orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. Inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is responsible for the anticholinergic side effects of clomipramine like dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, and cognitive/memory impairment. In overdose, sodium channel blockade in the brain is believed to cause the coma and seizures associated with TCAs while blockade of sodium channels in the heart is considered to cause cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death. On the other hand, sodium channel blockade is also thought to contribute to the analgesic effects of TCAs, for instance in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The exceptionally strong serotonin reuptake inhibition of clomipramine likely precludes the possibility of its antagonism of serotonin receptors (which it binds to with more than 100-fold lower affinity than the SERT) resulting in a net decrease in signaling by these receptors. In accordance, while serotonin receptor antagonists like cyproheptadine and chlorpromazine are effective as antidotes against serotonin syndrome, clomipramine is nonetheless capable of inducing this syndrome. In fact, while all TCAs are SRIs and serotonin receptor antagonists to varying extents, the only TCAs that are associated with serotonin syndrome are clomipramine and to a lesser extent its dechlorinated analogue imipramine, which are the two most potent SRIs of the TCAs (and in relation to this have the highest ratios of serotonin reuptake inhibition to serotonin receptor antagonism). As such, whereas other TCAs can be combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (with caution due to the risk of hypertensive crisis from NET inhibition; sometimes done in treatment-resistant depressives), clomipramine cannot be due to the risk of serotonin syndrome and death. Unlike the case of its serotonin receptor antagonism, orthostatic hypotension is a common side effect of clomipramine, suggesting that its blockade of the α1-adrenergic receptor is strong enough to overcome the stimulatory effects on the α1-adrenergic receptor of its NET inhibition. ==== Serotonergic activity ==== Clomipramine is an extremely strong SRI by all accounts. Its affinity for the SERT was reported in one study using human tissues to be 0.14 nM, which is considerably higher than that of other TCAs. For example, the TCAs with the next highest affinities for the SERT in the study were imipramine, amitriptyline, and dosulepin (dothiepin), with Ki values of 1.4 nM, 4.3 nM, and 8.3 nM, respectively. In addition, clomipramine has a terminal half-life that is around twice as long as that of amitriptyline and imipramine. In spite of these differences however, clomipramine is used clinically at the same usual dosages as other serotonergic TCAs (100–200 mg/day). Some health authorities recommend daily dosage is in the range of 30 to 75 mg in single or divided doses. Initial dosage should be 10 mg/day with gradual increments to 30–150 mg/day in divided doses or as a single dose at bedtime. Health Canada recommends maximum dose for outpatients is preferred at 200 mg/day. Sustained-release 75 mg formulation may be preferable at doses above 150 mg/day (i.e. 200 mg to 250 mg/day). It achieves typical circulating concentrations that are similar in range to those of other TCAs but with an upper limit that is around twice that of amitriptyline and imipramine. For these reasons, clomipramine is the most potent SRI among the TCAs and is far stronger as an SRI than other TCAs at typical clinical dosages. In addition, clomipramine is more potent as an SRI than any selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); it is more potent than paroxetine, which is the strongest SSRI. A positron emission tomography study found that a single low dose of 10 mg clomipramine to healthy volunteers resulted in 81.1% occupancy of the SERT, which was comparable to the 84.9% SERT occupancy by 50 mg fluvoxamine. In the study, single doses of 5 to 50 mg clomipramine resulted in 67.2 to 94.0% SERT occupancy while single doses of 12.5 to 50 mg fluvoxamine resulted in 28.4 to 84.9% SERT occupancy. Chronic treatment with higher doses was able to achieve up to 100.0% SERT occupancy with clomipramine and up to 93.6% SERT occupancy with fluvoxamine. Other studies have found 83% SERT occupancy with 20 mg/day paroxetine and 77% SERT occupancy with 20 mg/day citalopram. These results indicate that very low doses of clomipramine are able to substantially occupy the SERT and that clomipramine achieves higher occupancy of the SERT than SSRIs at comparable doses. Moreover, clomipramine may be able to achieve more complete occupancy of the SERT at high doses, at least relative to fluvoxamine. If the ratios of the 80% SERT occupancy dosage and the approved clinical dosage range are calculated and compared for SSRIs, SNRIs, and clomipramine, it can be deduced that clomipramine is by far the strongest SRI used medically. The lowest approved dosage of clomipramine can be estimated to be roughly comparable in SERT occupancy to the maximum approved dosages of the strongest SSRIs and SNRIs. Because their mechanism of action was originally not known and dose-ranging studies were never conducted, first-generation antipsychotics were dramatically overdosed in patients. It has been suggested that the same may have been true for clomipramine and other TCAs. Nonetheless, there is little doubt that many may, indeed, benefit from much higher doses. 250 mg/d, as mentioned elsewhere, is the typical maximum recommended dose but some people may need as much as 300 mg/d or more to benefit from all clomipramine has to offer beyond its potent SNRI capacity alone. ==== Obsessive–compulsive disorder ==== Clomipramine was the first drug that was investigated for and found to be effective in the treatment of OCD. In addition, it was the first drug to be approved by the FDATooltip Food and Drug Administration in the United States for the treatment of OCD. The effectiveness of clomipramine in the treatment of OCD is far greater than that of other TCAs, which are comparatively weak SRIs; a meta-analysis found pre- versus post-treatment effect sizes of 1.55 for clomipramine relative to a range of 0.67 for imipramine and 0.11 for desipramine. In contrast to other TCAs, studies have found that clomipramine and SSRIs, which are more selective SRIs, have similar effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. However, multiple meta-analyses have found that clomipramine nonetheless retains a significant effectiveness advantage relative to SSRIs; in the same meta-analysis mentioned previously, the effect sizes of SSRIs in the treatment of OCD ranged from 0.81 for fluoxetine to 1.36 for sertraline (relative to 1.55 for clomipramine). However, the effectiveness advantage for clomipramine has not been apparent in head-to-head comparisons of clomipramine versus SSRIs for OCD. The differences in effectiveness findings could be due to differences in methodologies across non-head-to-head studies. Relatively high doses of SSRIs are needed for effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. Studies have found that high dosages of SSRIs above the normally recommended maximums are significantly more effective in OCD treatment than lower dosages (e.g., 250 to 400 mg/day sertraline versus 200 mg/day sertraline). In addition, the combination of clomipramine and SSRIs has also been found to be significantly more effective in alleviating OCD symptoms, and clomipramine is commonly used to augment SSRIs for this reason. Studies have found that intravenous clomipramine, which is associated with very high circulating concentrations of the drug and a much higher ratio of clomipramine to its metabolite desmethylclomipramine, is more effective than oral clomipramine in the treatment of OCD. There is a case report of complete remission from OCD for approximately one month following a massive overdose of fluoxetine, an SSRI with a uniquely long duration of action. Taken together, stronger serotonin reuptake inhibition has consistently been associated with greater alleviation of OCD symptoms, and since clomipramine, at the clinical dosages in which it is employed, is effectively the strongest SRI used medically (see table above), this may underlie its unique effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. In addition to serotonin reuptake inhibition, clomipramine is also a mild but clinically significant antagonist of the dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors at high concentrations. Addition of antipsychotics, which are potent dopamine receptor antagonists, to SSRIs, has been found to significantly augment their effectiveness in the treatment of OCD. As such, besides strong serotonin reuptake inhibition, clomipramine at high doses might also block dopamine receptors to treat OCD symptoms, and this could additionally or alternatively be involved in its possible effectiveness advantage over SSRIs. For this reason, it may also be that augmentation with neuroleptics (a common procedure in the occurrence of inadequate response to monotherapy with an SRI) is needed with less frequency with clomipramine relative to SSRIs, the latter of-which apparently lack significant activity as dopamine-receptor antagonists. Although clomipramine is probably more effective in the treatment of OCD compared to SSRIs, it is greatly inferior to them in terms of tolerability and safety due to its lack of selectivity for the SERT and promiscuous pharmacological activity. In addition, clomipramine has high toxicity in overdose and can potentially result in death, whereas death rarely, if ever, occurs with overdose of SSRIs. It is for these reasons that clomipramine, in spite of potentially superior effectiveness to SSRIs, is now rarely used as a first-line agent in the treatment of OCD, with SSRIs being used as first-line therapies instead and clomipramine generally being reserved for more severe cases and as a second-line agent. === Pharmacokinetics === The oral bioavailability of clomipramine is approximately 50%. Peak plasma concentrations occur around 2–6 hours (with an average of 4.7 hours) after taking clomipramine orally and are in the range of 56–154 ng/mL (178–489 nmol/L). Steady-state concentrations of clomipramine are around 134–532 ng/mL (426–1,690 nmol/L), with an average of 218 ng/mL (692 nmol/L), and are reached after 7 to 14 days of repeated dosing. Steady-state concentrations of the active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, are around 230–550 ng/mL (730–1,750 nmol/L). The volume of distribution (Vd) of clomipramine is approximately 17 L/kg. It binds approximately 97–98% to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. Clomipramine is metabolized in the liver mainly by CYP2D6. It has a terminal half-life of 32 hours, and its N-desmethyl metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, has a terminal half-life of approximately 69 hours. Clomipramine is mostly excreted in urine (60%) and feces (32%). Although the normal maximum-recommended total daily dosage of clomipramine is 250 milligrams, treatment-resistant cases of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder may require corresponding doses within the range of 255 to 300 milligrams. Indeed, doses of 375 milligrams per day, sometimes in combination with venlafaxine or aripiprazole, have not only been necessary but, remarkably, relatively well-tolerated. Caution, however, is generally prudent when doing this, as seizures, which are more likely to occur with clomipramine than every other tricyclic antidepressant besides maprotiline, become more and more of a risk beyond the normally-recommended upper-ceiling. At daily doses ≤ 250 m.g., the incidence of seizures may be reliably estimated to be around the order of 0.48%. (All tricyclic antidepressants technically lower the seizure-threshold but this is only significant with amoxapine, maprotiline and, indeed, clomipramine.) Dose-increases between 25 m.g. and 150 m.g., barring significant drug-drug interactions which may elevate clomipramine blood-levels, should be titrated in doses of 50 m.g. (25 m.g. in the case of panic disorder and 10 to 25 m.g. in the cases of premature ejaculation and narcoleptic cataplexy) and above 150 m.g. in 25 m.g. increments. Average optimal total daily doses for depression (whether mild or severe), premature ejaculation, cataplexy-narcolepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and trichotilomania respectively are (in milligrams) 150, 50, 25 - 75, 150 - 250, 50 - 150 and 150 - 200. Some consider the minimum optimally-therapeutic dose of clomipramine in obsessive-compulsive disorder, which often requires much higher levels of serotoninergic concentration than other indications for these drugs, to be 200, rather than 150, milligrams per day. For premature ejaculation, clomipramine can be taken prn 3 to 5 hours before attempted sexual intercourse. == Chemistry == Clomipramine is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzazepine, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzazepine TCAs include imipramine, desipramine, and trimipramine. Clomipramine is a derivative of imipramine with a chlorine atom added to one of its rings and is also known as 3-chloroimipramine. It is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite desmethylclomipramine being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), doxepin, and trimipramine. The chemical name of clomipramine is 3-(3-chloro-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H23ClN2 with a molecular weight of 314.857 g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 303-49-1 and of the hydrochloride is 17321–77–6. == History == Clomipramine was developed by Geigy as a chlorinated derivative of imipramine. It was first referenced in the literature in 1961 and was patented in 1963. The drug was first approved for medical use in Europe in the treatment of depression in 1970, and was the last of the major TCAs to be marketed. In fact, clomipramine was initially considered to be a ""me-too drug"" by the FDA, and in relation to this, was declined licensing for depression in the United States. As such, to this day, clomipramine remains the only TCA that is available in the United States that is not approved for the treatment of depression, in spite of the fact that it is a highly effective antidepressant. Clomipramine was eventually approved in the United States for the treatment of OCD in 1989 and became available in 1990. It was the first drug to be investigated and found effective in the treatment of OCD. The benefits in OCD were first reported by Juan José López-Ibor in 1967, and the first double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of clomipramine for OCD was conducted in 1976, with more rigorous clinical studies that solidified its effectiveness conducted in the 1980s. It remained the ""gold standard"" for the treatment of OCD for many years until the introduction of the SSRIs, which have since largely superseded it due to greatly improved tolerability and safety (although notably not effectiveness). Clomipramine is the only TCA that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of OCD and that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of OCD; the other TCAs failed clinical trials for this indication, likely due to insufficient serotonergic activity. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Clomipramine is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while clomipramine hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Clomipramina is its generic name in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana, while clomipramin is its generic name in German and clomipraminum is its generic name in Latin. === Brand names === Clomipramine is marketed throughout the world mainly under the brand names Anafranil and Clomicalm for use in humans and animals, respectively. == Veterinary uses == In the US, clomipramine is only licensed to treat separation anxiety in dogs for which it is sold under the brand name Clomicalm. It has proven effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorders in cats and dogs. In dogs, it has also demonstrated similar efficacy to fluoxetine in treating tail chasing. In dogs some evidence suggests its efficacy in treating noise phobia. Clomipramine has also demonstrated efficacy in treating urine spraying in cats. Various studies have been done on the effects of clomipramine on cats to reduce urine spraying/marking behavior. It has been shown to be able to reduce this behavior by up to 75% in a trial period of four weeks. == References ==",Hydiphen,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.01815919391810894), ('ICAL', -3.128163257315464e-07)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.17898054420948029), ('ICAL', -2.145764938177308e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.030793622136116028)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

273,"('Pd 184352', 'Ci 1040', 'C.i. 1040', 'Pd 184,352', 'Pd 184352(ci-1040)')",Medical," Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Owing to differences in its efficacy across individuals, determining the indicators of patient response to TACE and finding approaches to reversing nonresponse thereto are necessary. Transcriptome data were obtained from the GSE104580 dataset, in which patients were marked as having TACE response or nonresponse. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. We screened genes with a prognostic value for TACE in the HIF-1 signaling pathway by univariate regression analysis. By using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression, we established a multigene signature in GSE14520, which we verified using a drug sensitivity test. The Connectivity Map (CMap) database was used to find potential drugs to reverse nonresponse to TACE. We constructed a prognostic signature consisting of three genes (erythropoietin ( We constructed a TACE-specific three-gene signature that could be used to predict HCC patients' responses to and prognosis after TACE treatment. PD-184352 might have potential as a drug to improve TACE efficacy. Utilizing a genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified a novel autoactivation region in mammalian MEK1 that is involved in binding the specific MEK inhibitor, PD 184352. The genetic screen is possible due to the homology between components of the yeast pheromone response pathway and the eukaryotic Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade. Using the FUS1::HIS3 reporter as a functional readout for activation of a reconstituted Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, randomly mutagenized MEK variants that were insensitive to PD 184352 were obtained. Seven single-base-change mutations were identified, five of which mapped to kinase subdomains III and IV of MEK. Of the seven variants, only one, a leucine-to-proline substitution at amino acid 115 (Leu115Pro), was completely insensitive to PD 184352 in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration >10 micro M). However, all seven mutants displayed strikingly high basal activity compared to wild-type MEK. Overexpression of the MEK variants in HEK293T cells resulted in an increase in mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation, a finding consistent with the elevated basal activity of these constructs. Further, treatment with PD 184352 failed to inhibit Leu115Pro-stimulated MAP kinase activation in HEK293T cells, whereas all other variants had some reduction in phospho-MAP kinase levels. By using cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (1CDK) as a template, an MEK homology model was generated, with five of the seven identified residues clustered together, forming a potential hydrophobic binding pocket for PD 184352. Additionally, the model allowed identification of other potential residues that would interact with the inhibitor.

274,"('Triamcinolone', 'Fluoxyprednisolone', 'Aristocort', 'Rodinolone', 'Triamcinolon')",Medical,"Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid used to treat certain skin diseases, allergies, and rheumatic disorders among others. It is also used to prevent worsening of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It can be taken in various ways including by mouth, injection into a muscle, and inhalation. Common side effects with long-term use include osteoporosis, cataracts, thrush, and muscle weakness. Serious side effects may include psychosis, increased risk of infections, adrenal suppression, and bronchospasm. Use in pregnancy is generally safe. It works by decreasing inflammation and immune system activity. Triamcinolone was patented in 1956 and came into medical use in 1958. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 102nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Triamcinolone is used to treat various medical conditions, such as eczema, alopecia areata, lichen sclerosus, psoriasis, arthritis, allergies, ulcerative colitis, lupus, sympathetic ophthalmia, temporal arteritis, uveitis, ocular inflammation, keloids, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, aphthous ulcers (usually as triamcinolone acetonide), central retinal vein occlusion, visualization during vitrectomy and the prevention of asthma attacks. The derivative triamcinolone acetonide is the active ingredient in various topical skin preparations (cream, lotion, ointment, aerosol spray) designed to treat such skin conditions as rash, inflammation, redness, or intense itching due to eczema and dermatitis. == Contraindications == Contraindications for systemic triamcinolone are similar to those of other corticoids. They include systemic mycoses (fungal infections) and parasitic diseases, as well as eight weeks before and two weeks after application of live vaccines. For long-term treatment, the drug is also contraindicated in people with peptic ulcers, severe osteoporosis, severe myopathy, certain viral infections, glaucoma, and metastasizing tumours. There are no contraindications for use in emergency medicine. == Side effects == The side effects of triamcinolone are similar to other corticosteroids. In short-term treatment of up to ten days, it has very few adverse effects; however, sometimes gastrointestinal bleeding is seen, as well as acute infections (mainly viral) and impaired glucose tolerance. Side effects of triamcinolone long-term treatment may include coughing (up to bronchospasms), sinusitis, metabolic syndrome–like symptoms such as high blood sugar and cholesterol, weight gain due to water retention, and electrolyte imbalance, as well as cataract, thrush, osteoporosis, reduced muscle mass, and psychosis. Triamcinolone injections can cause bruising and joint swelling. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itch, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing, and anaphylaxis. == Overdose == No acute overdosing of triamcinolone has been described. == Interactions == Drug interactions are mainly pharmacodynamic, that is, they result from other drugs either adding to triamcinolone's corticosteroid side effects or working against its desired effects. They include: Atropine and other anticholinergics can substantially increase pressure in the eyes. Antidiabetic drugs can become less effective because triamcinolone causes diabetes-like symptoms. Aspirin and other NSAIDs, as well as anticoagulants such as warfarin, add to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Diuretics that excrete potassium (such as loop diuretics and thiazides) can increase the risk of hypokalemia and thus lead to abnormal heart rhythm. Cardiac glycosides may have more adverse effects due to reduced potassium levels in the blood. The risk for blood count changes is increased when combining triamcinolone with ACE inhibitors. Triamcinolone and other drugs can also influence each other's concentrations in the body, amounting to pharmacokinetic interactions such as: Rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and other inducers of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 speed up metabolization of triamcinolone and can therefore reduce its effectiveness. Conversely, CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole, can increase its concentrations in the body and the risk for adverse effects. Blood concentrations of ciclosporin can be increased. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid that is about five times as potent as cortisol but has very few mineralocorticoid effects. === Pharmacokinetics === When taken by mouth, the drug's bioavailability is over 90%. It reaches its highest concentrations in the blood plasma after one to two hours and is bound to plasma proteins to about 80%. The biological half-life from the plasma is 200 to 300 minutes; due to stable complexes of triamcinolone and its receptor in the intracellular fluid, the total half-life is significantly longer at about 36 hours. A small fraction of the substance is metabolized to 6-hydroxy- and 20-dihydro-triamcinolone; most of it probably undergoes glucuronidation, and a smaller part sulfation. Three-quarters are excreted via the urine, and the rest via the faeces. Due to corticoids' mechanism of action, the effects are delayed as compared to plasma concentrations. Depending on the route of administration and the treated condition, the onset of action can be from two hours up to one or two days after application; and the drug can act much longer than its elimination half-life would suggest. == Chemistry == Triamcinolone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and is also known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyhydrocortisone or 9α-fluoro-16α-hydroxyprednisolone as well as 9α-fluoro-11β,16α,17α,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. The substance is a light-sensitive, white to off-white, crystalline powder, or has the form of colourless, matted crystals. It has no odour or is nearly odourless. Information on the melting point varies, partly due to the substance's polymorphism: 260 to 263 °C (500 to 505 °F), 264 to 268 °C (507 to 514 °F), or 269 to 271 °C (516 to 520 °F) can be found in the literature. Solubility is 1:500 in water and 1:240 in ethanol; it is slightly soluble in methanol, very slightly soluble in chloroform and diethylether, and practically insoluble in dichloromethane. The specific rotation is [ α ] D 20 {\displaystyle [\alpha ]_{D}^{20}} +65° to +72° cm3/dm·g (1% in dimethylformamide). == Society and culture == In 2010, Teva and Perrigo launched the first generic inhalable triamcinolone. According to Chang et al. (2014), ""Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is classified as an S9 glucocorticoid in the 2014 Prohibited List published by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which caused it to be prohibited in international athletic competition when administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly or rectally"". == References == == External links == ""Triamcinolone Topical"".

Eliprodil failed a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in 1996, sponsored by Synthélabo Recherche. NMDA receptors are a key component in mediating glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and it is believed that NMDA antagonists would be neuroprotective after a stroke or other traumatic brain injury. After a traumatic brain injury, neurons become deprived of glucose and oxygen. These neurons quickly lose ATP and become depolarized, which releases glutamate. The extracellular buildup of glutamate triggers the overstimulation of AMPA and NMDA receptors. This, in turn, causes an influx of Na+ and Ca2+. Therefore, when NMDA receptors are activated, there is an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. High Ca2+ causes fatal metabolic consequences, including neuronal cell death. == References ==",Eliprodil,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -1.676292231422849e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012200777418911457), ('ICAL', -2.622600959512056e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.10024066269397736)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliprodil,https://hellobio.com/eliprodil.html,https://www.bioscience.co.uk/product~736319 ', [])"
278,"('Fluorouracil', 'Fluoroplex', 'Efudex', 'Adrucil', 'Carac')",Medical,"Fluorouracil (5-FU, 5-fluorouracil), sold under the brand name Adrucil among others, is a cytotoxic chemotherapy medication used to treat cancer. By intravenous injection it is used for treatment of colorectal cancer, oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. As a cream it is used for actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, and skin warts. Side effects of use by injection are common. They may include inflammation of the mouth, loss of appetite, low blood cell counts, hair loss, and inflammation of the skin. When used as a cream, irritation at the site of application usually occurs. Use of either form in pregnancy may harm the fetus. Fluorouracil is in the antimetabolite and pyrimidine analog families of medications. How it works is not entirely clear, but it is believed to involve blocking the action of thymidylate synthase and thus stopping the production of DNA. Fluorouracil was patented in 1956 and came into medical use in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 270th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Fluorouracil has been given systemically for anal, breast, colorectal, oesophageal, stomach, pancreatic and skin cancers (especially head and neck cancers). It has also been given topically (on the skin) for actinic keratoses, skin cancers and Bowen's disease (a type of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma), and as eye drops for treatment of ocular surface squamous neoplasia. Other uses include ocular injections into a previously created trabeculectomy bleb to inhibit healing and cause scarring of tissue, thus allowing adequate aqueous humor flow to reduce intraocular pressure. == Contraindications == Fluorouracil is contraindicated in patients who are severely debilitated and in patients with bone marrow suppression due to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy. It is likewise contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Non-topical use, i.e. administration by injection, should be avoided in patients who do not have malignant illnesses. in 2020, the EU and UK license was updated to state that fluorouracil was contra-indicated in patients that ""have a known complete absence of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity"". In US, as of 2024, there is no specific contraindication on the package inserts however, there is a cautionary warning: ""Increased risk of serious or fatal adverse reactions in patients with low or absent Dipyrimidine Dehydrogenase activity: withhold or permanently discontinue fluorouracil in patients with evidence of acute early-onset or unusually severe toxicity, which may indicate near complete or total absence of dipyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity. No fluorouracil dose has been proven safe in patients with absent DPD activity."" Within the UK, DPYD testing to check for this contraindication is now routine practice, this is not the case in the US. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects by frequency include: === During systemic use === Common (> 1% frequency): Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency): Rare (< 0.1% frequency): Anaphylaxis Allergic reactions Fever without signs of infection Mania, reversible dementia Diarrhea is severe and may be dose-limiting and is exacerbated by co-treatment with calcium folinate. Neutropenia tends to peak about 9–14 days after beginning treatment. Thrombocytopenia tends to peak about 7–17 days after the beginning of treatment and tends to recover about 10 days after its peak. Cardiotoxicity is a fairly common side effect, usually manifesting as angina or symptoms associated with coronary artery spasm, but about 0.55% of those receiving the drug will develop life-threatening cardiotoxicity. Life-threatening cardiotoxicity includes: arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest, secondary to transmural ischaemia. === During topical use === Common (> 1% frequency): Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency): Hyper- or hypopigmentation Scarring === Neurological damage === The United States package insert warns that acute cerebellar syndrome has been observed following injection of fluorouracil and may persist after cessation of treatment. Symptoms include ataxia, nystagmus, and dysmetria. == Potential overdose == There is very little difference between the minimum effective dose and maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU, and the drug exhibits marked individual pharmacokinetic variability. Therefore, an identical dose of 5-FU may result in a therapeutic response with acceptable toxicity in some patients and unacceptable and possibly life-threatening toxicity in others. Both overdosing and underdosing are of concern with 5-FU, although several studies have shown that the majority of colorectal cancer patients treated with 5-FU are underdosed based on today's dosing standard, body surface area (BSA). The limitations of BSA-based dosing prevent oncologists from being able to accurately titer the dosage of 5-FU for the majority of individual patients, which results in sub-optimal treatment efficacy or excessive toxicity. Numerous studies have found significant relationships between concentrations of 5-FU in blood plasma and both desirable or undesirable effects on patients. Studies have also shown that dosing based on the concentration of 5-FU in plasma can greatly increase desirable outcomes while minimizing negative side effects of 5-FU therapy. One such test that has been shown to successfully monitor 5-FU plasma levels and which ""may contribute to improved efficacy and safety of commonly used 5-FU-based chemotherapies"" is the My5-FU test. Uridine Triacetate is a potential antidote for cases of suspected overdose. == Dangers to pets == The US Food and Drug Administration has highlighted the dangers of inadvertent administration to pets. While fluorouracil is sometimes used off label to treat horses, its administration to dogs in particular can be fatal. The FDA reports that it has received 20 reports of fatal outcomes in dogs following accidental ingestion of topical fluorouracil. == Interactions == It may increase the INR and prothrombin times in people on warfarin. Fluorouracil's efficacy is decreased when used alongside allopurinol, which can be used to decrease fluorouracil induced stomatitis through use of allopurinol mouthwash. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacogenetics === The dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme is responsible for the detoxifying metabolism of fluoropyrimidines, a class of drugs that includes 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, and tegafur. Genetic variations within the DPD gene (DPYD) can lead to reduced or absent DPD activity, and individuals who are heterozygous or homozygous for these variations may have partial or complete DPD deficiency; an estimated 0.2% of individuals have complete DPD deficiency. Those with partial or complete DPD deficiency have a significantly increased risk of severe or even fatal drug toxicities when treated with fluoropyrimidines; examples of toxicities include myelosuppression, neurotoxicity and hand-foot syndrome. === Mechanism of action === 5-FU acts in several ways, but principally as a thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor. Interrupting the action of this enzyme blocks synthesis of the pyrimidine thymidylate (dTMP), which is a nucleotide required for DNA replication. Thymidylate synthase methylates deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to form thymidine monophosphate (dTMP). Administration of 5-FU causes a scarcity in dTMP, so rapidly dividing cancerous cells undergo cell death via thymineless death. Calcium folinate provides an exogenous source of reduced folinates and hence stabilises the 5-FU-TS complex, hence enhancing 5-FU's cytotoxicity. == History == In 1954, Abraham Cantarow and Karl Paschkis found liver tumors absorbed radioactive uracil more readily than did normal liver cells. Charles Heidelberger, who had earlier found that fluorine in fluoroacetic acid inhibited a vital enzyme, asked Robert Duschinsky and Robert Schnitzer at Hoffmann-La Roche to synthesize fluorouracil. Some credit Heidelberger and Duschinsky with the discovery that 5-fluorouracil markedly inhibited tumors in mice. The original 1957 report In 1958, Anthony R. Curreri, Fred J. Ansfield, Forde A. McIver, Harry A. Waisman, and Charles Heidelberger reported the first clinical findings of 5-FU's activity in cancer in humans. == Natural analogues == In 2003, scientists isolated 5-fluorouracil derivatives, closely related compounds, from the marine sponge, Phakellia fusca, collected around Yongxing Island of the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea. This is significant because fluorine-containing natural products are extremely rare. == Interactive pathway map == Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. == Names == The name ""fluorouracil"" is the INN, USAN, USP name, and BAN. The form ""5-fluorouracil"" is often used; it shows that there is a fluorine atom on the 5th carbon of a uracil ring. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Fluorouracil Topical"".

280,"('Chlorhexidine', 'Chlorhexidine base', 'Chlorohexidine', 'Nolvasan', '(1e)-2-[6-[[amino-[(e)-[amino-(4-chloroanilino)methylidene]amino]methylidene]amino]hexyl]-1-[amino-(4-chloroanilino)methylidene]guanidine')",Medical,"Chlorhexidine is a disinfectant and antiseptic with the molecular formula C22H30Cl2N10, which is used for skin disinfection before surgery and to disinfect surgical instruments. It is also used for cleaning wounds, preventing dental plaque, treating yeast infections of the mouth, and to keep urinary catheters from blocking. It is used as a liquid or a powder. It is commonly used in salt form, either the gluconate or the acetate. Side effects may include skin irritation, tooth discoloration, and allergic reactions, although, apart from discoloration, the risk appears to be the same as that for povidone-iodine. Chlorhexidine rinse is also known to have a bitter metallic aftertaste. Rinsing with water is not recommended as it is known to increase the bitterness. It may cause eye problems if direct contact occurs. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Chlorhexidine may come mixed in alcohol, water, or surfactant solution. It is effective against a range of microorganisms, but does not inactivate spores. Chlorhexidine came into medical use in the 1950s and is available over the counter in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 230th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Uses == Chlorhexidine is used in disinfectants (disinfection of the skin and hands), cosmetics (additive to creams, toothpaste, deodorants, and antiperspirants), and pharmaceutical products (preservative in eye drops, active substance in wound dressings and antiseptic mouthwashes). In endodontics, chlorhexidine has been used for root canal irrigation and as an intracanal dressing. === Antiseptic === Chlorhexidine is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, and yeasts. It is particularly effective against Gram-positive bacteria (in concentrations ≥ 1 μg/L). Significantly higher concentrations (10 to more than 73 μg/mL) are required for Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Chlorhexidine is ineffective against polioviruses and adenoviruses. The effectiveness against herpes viruses has not yet been established unequivocally. There is strong evidence that chlorhexidine is more effective than povidone-iodine for clean surgery. Evidence shows that it is an effective antiseptic for upper limb surgery. Meta-data spanning several decades shows that the efficacy of chlorhexidine (against organisms that cause surgical site infection) has not changed, dispelling concerns over emerging resistance. === Dental use === Use of a chlorhexidine-based mouthwash in combination with normal tooth care can help reduce the build-up of plaque and improve mild gingivitis. There is not enough evidence to determine the effect in moderate to severe gingivitis. Its use as a mouthwash has a number of adverse effects including damage to the mouth lining, tooth discoloration, tartar build-up, and impaired taste. Extrinsic tooth staining occurs when chlorhexidine rinse has been used for four weeks or longer. Mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine which stain teeth less than the classic solution have been developed, many of which contain chelated zinc. Chlorhexidine is a cation which interacts with anionic components of toothpaste, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium monofluorophosphate, and forms salts of low solubility and reduced antibacterial activity. Hence, to enhance the antiplaque effect of chlorhexidine, ""it seems best that the interval between toothbrushing and rinsing with CHX [chlorhexidine] be more than 30 minutes, cautiously close to two hours after brushing"". === Topical === Chlorhexidine gluconate is used as a skin cleanser for surgical scrubs, as a cleanser for skin wounds, for preoperative skin preparation, and for germicidal hand rinses. Chlorhexidine eye drops have been used as a treatment for eyes affected by Acanthamoeba keratitis. Chlorhexidine is a very effective antiseptic and its use is growing in the world for treating the umbilical cord. A 2015 Cochrane review has yielded high-quality evidence that within the community setting, chlorhexidine skin or cord care can reduce the incidence of omphalitis (inflammation of the umbilical cord) by 50% and neonatal mortality by 12%. == Side effects == Side effects may include skin irritation, tooth discoloration, and allergic reactions, although apart from discoloration the risk appears to be the same as povidone-iodine. Chlorhexidine is ototoxic (toxic to the inner ear). If put into a ruptured ear canal it may lead to deafness. Chlorhexidine does not meet European specifications for a hand disinfectant. Under the test conditions of the European Standard EN 1499, no significant difference in the efficacy was found between a 4% solution of chlorhexidine digluconate and soap. In the US, between 2007 and 2009, Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center conducted a cluster-randomized trial and concluded that daily bathing of patients in intensive care units with washcloths saturated with chlorhexidine gluconate reduced the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Whether prolonged exposure over many years may have carcinogenic potential is still not clear. The US Food and Drug Administration recommendation is to limit the use of a chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash to a maximum of six months. When ingested, chlorhexidine is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and can cause stomach irritation or nausea. If aspirated into the lungs at high enough concentration, as reported in one case, it can be fatal due to the high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. == Mechanism of action == At physiologic pH, chlorhexidine salts dissociate and release the positively charged chlorhexidine cation. The bactericidal effect is a result of the binding of this cationic molecule to negatively charged bacterial cell walls. At low concentrations of chlorhexidine, this results in a bacteriostatic effect; at high concentrations, membrane disruption results in cell death. == Chemistry == It is a cationic polybiguanide (bisbiguanide). == Deactivation == Chlorhexidine is deactivated by forming insoluble salts with anionic compounds, including the anionic surfactants commonly used as detergents in toothpastes and mouthwashes, anionic thickeners such as carbomer, and anionic emulsifiers such as acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, among many others. For this reason, chlorhexidine mouth rinses should be used at least 30 minutes after other dental products. == Synthesis == The structure is based on two molecules of proguanil, linked with a hexamethylenediamine spacer. == Society and culture == === Brands === Chlorhexidine topical is sold as Betasept, Biopatch, Calgon Vesta, ChloraPrep One-Step, Dyna-Hex, Hibiclens, Hibistat Towelette, Scrub Care Exidine, and Spectrum-4, among others. Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash is sold as Dentohexin, Paroex, Peridex, PerioChip, Corsodyl and Periogard, among others. == Veterinary medicine == In animals, chlorhexidine is used for topical disinfection of wounds, and to manage skin infections. Chlorhexidine-based disinfectant products are used in the dairy farming industry.

281,"('Tinostamustine', 'Minomustine', 'Tinostamustine(edo-s101)', 'Tinostamustine [usan]', 'Starbld0018955')",Medical," Multiple myeloma is a malignancy characterized by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in bone marrow and the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin. A hallmark of cancer is the evasion of immune surveillance. Histone deacetylase inhibitors have been shown to promote the expression of silenced molecules and hold potential to increase the anti-MM efficacy of immunotherapy. The aim of the present work was to assess the potential effect of tinostamustine (EDO-S101), a first-in-class alkylating deacetylase inhibitor, in combination with daratumumab, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb), through different preclinical studies. Tinostamustine increases CD38 expression in myeloma cell lines, an effect that occurs in parallel with an increment in CD38 histone H3 acetylation levels. Also, the expression of MICA and MICB, ligands for the NK cell activating receptor NKG2D, augments after tinostamustine treatment in myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells. Pretreatment of myeloma cell lines with tinostamustine increased the sensitivity of these cells to daratumumab through its different cytotoxic mechanisms, and the combination of these two drugs showed a higher anti-myeloma effect than individual treatments in ex vivo cultures of myeloma patients' samples. In vivo data confirmed that tinostamustine pretreatment followed by daratumumab administration significantly delayed tumor growth and improved the survival of mice compared to individual treatments. In summary, our results suggest that tinostamustine could be a potential candidate to improve the efficacy of anti-CD38 mAbs. A significant unmet need remains for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) who fail to respond to first-line treatment or experience an early relapse. Tinostamustine, a novel alkylating deacetylase inhibitor, inhibits tumor cell growth and slows disease progression in models of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. This was a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, two-stage trial investigating the safety and efficacy of tinostamustine in patients ≥ 18 years with relapsed/refractory (R/R) hematological malignancies, including HL. Stage 1 involved dose-escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tinostamustine, optimal infusion time and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Stage 2 confirmed the safety and efficacy of the RP2D in expansion cohorts of selected R/R hematological malignancies. Ten patients with heavily pre-treated HL entered dose-escalation, with nine patients experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) considered to be related to study treatment-primarily hematological toxicities. MTD was 100 mg/m Adult-type diffuse gliomas are characterized by inevitable recurrence and very poor prognosis. Novel treatment options, including multimodal drugs or effective drug combinations, are therefore eagerly awaited. Tinostamustine is an alkylating and histone deacetylase inhibiting molecule with great potential in cancer treatment. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate its effects on glioma cells. In this context, tinostamustine was evaluated in monotherapy and as a combination therapy, with either celecoxib or temozolomide; additionally, the results were compared to the golden glioma chemotherapy standard-temozolomide. Our experiments, conducted on both temozolomide-sensitive U-87 MG astrocytoma and temozolomide-resistant U-138 MG glioblastoma cells revealed that tinostamustine and its combination with either celecoxib or temozolomide exert dose-dependent cytotoxicity, cause cell cycle arrest, induce oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis of malignant glioma cells, and mitigate their migratory potential. Astrocytoma cells were more susceptible to the tested treatments than glioblastoma cells, and, generally, those dual therapies were superior in anti-glioma efficacy compared to temozolomide. Overall, our study provides evidence that tinostamustine and the combination therapies consisting of tinostamustine and celecoxib or tinostamustine and temozolomide may represent a new approach for the effective treatment of malignant gliomas.",Tinostamustine,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0001734344696160406), ('ICAL', -6.556489552167477e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006721979938447475)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.pharmiweb.com/press-release/2020-08-04/orphan-drug-designation-granted-to-tinostamustine-in-eu-for-very-rare-form-of-leukaemia,https://imbriumthera.com/news/imbrium-therapeutics-announces-u-s-fda-orphan-drug-designation-for-tinostamustine-for-the-treatment-of-t-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia/,https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-018-0576-6 ', [])"
282,"('Fludarabine (phosphate)', 'Fludarabine phosphate', 'Fludara', ""Fludarabine 5'-monophosphate"", 'Oforta')",Medical,"Fludarabine is a purine analogue and antineoplastic agent. It is generally used as its 5-O-phosphorylated form known as fludarabine phosphate, sold under the brand name Fludara among others. It is a chemotherapy medication used in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. These include chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is given by injection into a vein or by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, fever, rash, shortness of breath, numbness, vision changes, and feeling tired. Severe side effects include brain dysfunction, low blood cell counts, and lung inflammation. Use in pregnancy will likely result in harm to the fetus. Fludarabine is in the purine analog family of medications and works by interfering with the duplication of DNA. Fludarabine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Fludarabine is highly effective in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, producing higher response rates than alkylating agents such as chlorambucil alone. Fludarabine is used in various combinations with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone and rituximab in the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. As part of the FLAG or FLAMSA regimen, fludarabine is used together with cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. Because of its immunosuppressive effects, fludarabine is also used in some conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant. == Side effects == Fludarabine is associated with profound lymphopenia, and as a consequence, increases the risk of opportunistic infections. People who have been treated with fludarabine will usually be asked to take co-trimoxazole or to use monthly nebulised pentamidine to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The profound lymphopenia caused by fludarabine renders patients susceptible to transfusion-associated graft versus host disease, an oftentimes fatal complication of blood transfusion. For this reason, all patients who have ever received fludarabine should only be given irradiated blood components. Fludarabine causes anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, requiring regular blood count monitoring. Some patients require blood and platelet transfusion, or G-CSF injections to boost neutrophil counts. Fludarabine is associated with the development of severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia in a proportion of patients. Difficulties are often encountered when harvesting peripheral blood stem cells from patients previously treated with fludarabine. == Pharmacology == Fludarabine is a purine analog, and can be given both orally and intravenously. Fludarabine inhibits DNA synthesis by interfering with ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase. It is active against both dividing and resting cells. Being phosphorylated, fludarabine is ionized at physiologic pH and is effectually trapped in blood. This provides some level of specificity for blood cells, both cancerous and healthy. == History == Fludarabine was produced by John Montgomery and Kathleen Hewson of the Southern Research Institute in 1968. == Names == Fludarabine is generally administered as its 5-O-phosphorylated form known as fludarabine phosphate, which is rapidly dephosphorylated to fludarabine in the plasma. == References ==",Fludara,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.410734163684538e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00020930961181875318)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludarabine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Fludarabine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludarabine?utm_source=openai')])"

284,"('Clonidine', 'Clonidin', 'Catapres', 'Duraclon', 'N-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1h-imidazol-2-amine')",Medical,"Clonidine, sold under the brand name Catapres among others, is an α2A-adrenergic receptor agonist medication used to treat high blood pressure, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), drug withdrawal (e.g., alcohol, opioids, or nicotine), menopausal flushing, diarrhea, spasticity, and certain pain conditions. The drug is often prescribed off-label for tics. It is used orally (by mouth), by injection, or as a transdermal skin patch. Onset of action is typically within an hour with the effects on blood pressure lasting for up to eight hours. Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, headaches, hypotension, and sleepiness. Severe side effects may include hallucinations, heart arrhythmias, and confusion. If rapidly stopped, withdrawal effects may occur, such as a dangerous rise in blood pressure. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. Clonidine lowers blood pressure by stimulating α2-adrenergic receptors in the brain, which results in relaxation of many arteries. Clonidine was patented in 1961 and came into medical use in 1966. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 71st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Clonidine is used to treat high blood pressure, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); drug withdrawal, including from (alcohol, opioids, and/or nicotine);menopausal flushing, diarrhea, and certain pain conditions, in addition to It also sees some use off-label for episodic insomnia, tics (e.g. from Tourette Syndrome, restless legs syndrome, and anxiety, among others. === Resistant hypertension === Clonidine may be effective for lowering blood pressure in people with resistant hypertension. Clonidine works by slowing the pulse rate and exerts a reduction of serum concentrations of renin, aldosterone, and catecholamines. === Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder === Clonidine may improve symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in some people but causes many adverse effects and the beneficial effect is modest. In Australia, clonidine is an accepted but not approved use for ADHD by the TGA. Clonidine, along with methylphenidate, has been studied for treatment of ADHD. While not as effective as methylphenidate in treating ADHD, clonidine does offer some benefit; it can also be useful in combination with stimulant medications. Some studies show clonidine to be more sedating than guanfacine, which may be better at bedtime along with an arousing stimulant in the morning. Clonidine has been used to reduce sleep disturbances in ADHD, including to help offset stimulant-associated insomnia. Unlike stimulant medications, clonidine is regarded as having no abuse potential, and may even be used to reduce abuse of drugs including nicotine and cocaine. In the US, only the extended-release form of clonidine is approved for ADHD treatment. === Drug withdrawal === Clonidine may be used to ease drug withdrawal symptoms associated with abruptly stopping the long-term use of opioids, alcohol, benzodiazepines, and nicotine. It can alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms by reducing the sympathetic nervous system response such as tachycardia and hypertension, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), hot and cold flashes, and akathisia. It may also be helpful in aiding smokers to quit. The sedation effect can also be useful. Clonidine may also reduce severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome in infants born to mothers that are using certain drugs, particularly opioids. In infants with neonatal withdrawal syndrome, clonidine may improve the neonatal intensive care unit Network Neurobehavioral Score. Clonidine has also been suggested as a treatment for rare instances of dexmedetomidine withdrawal. === Spasticity === Clonidine has some role in the treatment of spasticity caused by spinal cord injury, acting principally by inhibiting excessive sensory transmission below the level of injury. Its use, however, is mainly as a second or third line agent, due to side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, and drowsiness. Clonidine can be administered intrathecally, which confers various benefits, including a reduction or prevention of the blood pressure lowering effects and increased effectiveness against spasticity. The effectiveness of intrathecal clonidine is comparable to that of intrathecal baclofen for spasticity. === Clonidine suppression test === The reduction in circulating norepinephrine by clonidine was used in the past as an investigatory test for phaeochromocytoma, which is a catecholamine-synthesizing tumor, usually found in the adrenal medulla. In a clonidine suppression test, plasma catecholamine levels are measured before and 3 hours after a 0.3 mg oral test dose has been given to the patient. A positive test occurs if there is no decrease in plasma levels. === Other uses === Clonidine also has several off-label uses, and has been prescribed to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders. Clonidine is also a mild sedative, and can be used as premedication before surgery or procedures. It has also been studied as a way to calm acute manic episodes. Its epidural use for pain during heart attack, and postoperative and intractable pain has also been studied extensively. Clonidine can be used in restless legs syndrome. It can also be used to treat facial flushing and redness associated with rosacea. It has also been successfully used topically in a clinical trial as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy. Clonidine can also be used for migraine headaches and hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine has also been used to treat refractory diarrhea associated with irritable bowel syndrome, fecal incontinence, diabetes, diarrhea associated with opioid withdrawal, intestinal failure, neuroendocrine tumors, and cholera. Clonidine can be used in the treatment of Tourette syndrome (specifically for tics). Clonidine has also had some success in clinical trials for helping to remove or ameliorate the symptoms of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). Injection of α2-adrenergic receptor agonists into the knee joint space, including clonidine, may reduce the severity of knee pain after arthroscopic knee surgery. Light-activated derivatives of clonidine (adrenoswitches) have been developed for research purposes and shown to control pupillary reflex with light in blind mice by topical application. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === It is classified by the TGA of Australia as pregnancy category B3, which means that it has shown some detrimental effects on fetal development in animal studies, although the relevance of this to human beings is unknown. Clonidine appears in high concentration in breast milk; a nursing infant's serum clonidine concentration is approximately 2/3 of the mother's. Caution is warranted in women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. == Adverse effects == The principal adverse effects of clonidine are sedation, dry mouth, and hypotension (low blood pressure). By frequency Very common (>10% frequency): Common (1–10% frequency): Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency): Rare (<0.1% frequency): === Withdrawal === Because clonidine suppresses sympathetic outflow, resulting in lower blood pressure, sudden discontinuation can result in acute hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic outflow. In extreme cases, this can result in a hypertensive crisis, which is a medical emergency. Clonidine therapy should generally be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy to avoid rebound effects from occurring. Treatment of clonidine withdrawal hypertension depends on the severity of the condition. Reintroduction of clonidine for mild cases, alpha and beta blockers for more urgent situations. Beta blockers should never be used alone to treat clonidine withdrawal as alpha vasoconstriction would still continue. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Clonidine crosses the blood–brain barrier. ==== High blood pressure ==== Clonidine treats high blood pressure by stimulating α2 receptors in the brainstem, which decreases peripheral vascular resistance, lowering blood pressure. It has specificity towards the presynaptic α2 receptors in the vasomotor center in the brainstem. This binding has a sympatholytic effect, suppresses release of norepinephrine, ATP, renin, and neuropeptide Y which if released would increase vascular resistance.: 201–203 Clonidine also acts as an agonist at imidazoline-1 (I1) receptors in the brain, and it is hypothesized that this effect may contribute to reducing blood pressure by reducing signaling in the sympathetic nervous system; this effect acts upstream of the central α2 agonist effect of clonidine.: 201–203 Clonidine may also cause bradycardia, theoretically by increasing signaling through the vagus nerve. When given intravenously, clonidine can temporarily increase blood pressure by stimulating α1 receptors in smooth muscles in blood vessels. This hypertensive effect is not usual when clonidine is given orally or by the transdermal route.: 201–203 Plasma concentration of clonidine exceeding 2.0 ng/mL does not provide further blood pressure reduction. ==== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ==== In the setting of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), clonidine's molecular mechanism of action occurs due to its agonism at the α2A adrenergic receptor, the subtype of the adrenergic receptor that is most principally found in the brain. Within the brain, the α2A adrenergic receptors are found within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), among other areas. The α2A adrenergic receptors are found on the presynaptic cleft of a given neuron, and, when activated by an agonist, the effect on downstream neurons is inhibitory. The inhibition is accomplished by preventing the secretion of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Thus, clonidine's agonism on α2A adrenergic receptors in the PFC inhibits the action of downstream neurons by preventing the secretion of norepinephrine. This mechanism is similar to the brain's physiological inhibition of PFC neurons by the locus ceruleus (LC), which secretes norepinephrine into the PFC. Although norepinephrine can also bind to target adrenergic receptors on the downstream neuron (otherwise inducing a stimulatory effect), norepinephrine also binds to α2A adrenergic receptors (akin to clonidine's mechanism of action), inhibiting the release of norepinephrine by that neuron and inducing an inhibitory effect. Because the PFC is required for working memory and attention, it is thought that clonidine's inhibition of PFC neurons helps to eliminate irrelevant attention (and subsequent behaviors), improving the person's focus and correcting deficits in attention. ==== Growth hormone test ==== Clonidine stimulates release of GHRH hormone from the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates pituitary release of growth hormone. This effect has been used as part of a ""growth hormone test,"" which can assist with diagnosing growth hormone deficiency in children. === Pharmacokinetics === After being ingested, clonidine is absorbed into the blood stream rapidly with an overall bioavailability around 70–80%. Peak concentrations in human plasma occur within 60–90 minutes for the ""immediate release"" (IR) version of the drug, which is shorter than the ""extended release"" (ER/XR) version. Clonidine is fairly lipid soluble with the logarithm of its partition coefficient (log P) equal to 1.6; to compare, the optimal log P to allow a drug that is active in the human central nervous system to penetrate the blood brain barrier is 2.0. Less than half of the absorbed portion of an orally administered dose will be metabolized by the liver into inactive metabolites, with roughly the other half being excreted unchanged by the kidneys. About one-fifth of an oral dose will not be absorbed, and is thus excreted in the feces. Work with liver microsomes shows in the liver clonidine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 (66%), CYP1A2 (10–20%), and CYP3A (0–20%) with negligible contributions from the less abundant enzymes CYP3A5, CYP1A1, and CYP3A4. 4-hydroxyclonidine, the main metabolite of clonidine, is also an α2A agonist but is non lipophilic and is not believed to contribute to the effects of clonidine since it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Measurements of the half-life of clonidine vary widely, between 6 and 23 hours, with the half-life being greatly affected by and prolonged in the setting of poor kidney function. Variations in half-life may be partially attributable to CYP2D6 genetics. Some research has suggested the half-life of clonidine is dose dependent and approximately doubles upon chronic dosing, while other work contradicts this. Following a 0.3 mg oral dose, a small study of five patients by Dollery et al. (1976) found half-lives ranging between 6.3 and 23.4 hours (mean 12.7). A similar N=5 study by Davies et al. (1977) found a narrower range of half-lives, between 6.7 and 13 hours (mean 8.6), while an N=8 study by Keraäen et al. that included younger patients found a somewhat shorter mean half-life of 7.5 hours. == History == Clonidine was introduced in 1966. It was first used as a hypertension treatment under the trade name of Catapres. == Society and culture == === Brand names === As of June 2017, clonidine is marketed under many brand names worldwide: Arkamin, Aruclonin, Atensina, Catapin, Catapres, Catapresan, Catapressan, Chianda, Chlofazoline, Chlophazolin, Clonid-Ophtal, Clonidin, Clonidina, Clonidinã, Clonidine, Clonidine hydrochloride, Clonidinhydrochlorid, Clonidini, Clonidinum, Clonigen, Clonistada, Clonnirit, Clophelinum, Dixarit, Duraclon, Edolglau, Haemiton, Hypodine, Hypolax, Iporel, Isoglaucon, Jenloga, Kapvay, Klofelino, Kochaniin, Lonid, Melzin, Menograine, Normopresan, Paracefan, Pinsanidine, Run Rui, and Winpress.

The drug is administered by mouth. Fostamatinib blocks the activity of the enzyme spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). This enzyme is involved in stimulating parts of the immune system. By blocking SYK's activity, fostamatinib reduces the immune system's destruction of platelets, so allowing the platelet count to rise, which reduces the likelihood of excessive bleeding. The most commonly reported side effects are diarrhea, high blood pressure, nausea, respiratory infection, dizziness, increased liver enzymes, rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, chest pain and decreased white blood cell count. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Fostamatinib is a drug used to treat adults with low platelet count due to chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) when a prior treatment for ITP has not worked well enough. Chronic immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune bleeding disorder where the blood doesn't clot as it should because of a low platelet count. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The tablets are formulated as fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate, a disodium hexahydrate salt, and is a prodrug of the active compound tamatinib (R-406), which is an inhibitor of the enzyme spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), hence it is an syk inhibitor. Syk is a protein tyrosine kinase associated with various inflammatory cells, including macrophages, which are presumed to be the cells responsible for ITP platelet clearance. When FcγRs I, IIA, and IIIA bind to their ligands, the receptor complex becomes activated and triggers the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor-activating motifs (ITAMs). This leads to various genes becoming activated, which causes a cytoskeletal rearrangement that mediates phagocytosis in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Because Syk plays an important role in FcγR-mediated signal transduction and inflammatory propagation, it is considered a good target for the inhibition of various autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and lymphoma. == Clinical trials == Fostamatinib has been in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, IgA nephropathy, and lymphoma. The drug is currently being used in a Phase 1 trail to test the safety of the combination of the study drugs fostamatinib and paclitaxel for patients with ovarian cancer. The investigation of fostamatinib began with studies involving the treatment of mouse models with cytopenia. Mice were used to measure the effectiveness of R788, a small molecule prodrug of the biologically active R406, a Syk inhibitor. In animal models, treatment with R406/R788 was shown to be safe and effective in reducing inflammation and joint damage in immune-mediated rheumatoid arthritis. The models responded favorably to treatment so the study progressed to Phase 2 trials involving humans. Human studies have shown that R788 has good oral bioavailability, biologic activity, is well tolerated, and does not exhibit collagen or ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In NCT00706342, 16 adults with chronic ITP were entered into an open-label, single-arm cohort dose-escalation trials beginning with 75 mg and rising to 175 mg twice a day. The dose was increased until a persistent response was evident, toxicity was reached, or 175 mg twice a day was met. 8 patients achieved persistent responses with platelet counts greater than 50,000 mm3/L on more than 67% of their visits. 3 of these patients had not persistently responded to thrombopoietic agents. 4 others had nonsustained responses. Mean peak platelet count exceeded 100,000 mm3/L in these 12 patients. Toxicity was evidenced primarily in GI-related side effects, notable diarrhea, urgency, and vomiting. 2 patients developed transaminitis. Fostamatinib as a treatment for severe COVID19 complications has finished a Phase 2 trial, and is entering a Phase 3 trial. === Rheumatoid arthritis === A phase II study of rheumatoid arthritis patients failing to respond to a biologic agent showed little efficacy as compared to placebo, but the drug was well tolerated. In patients with high inflammatory burden, measured by levels of C-reactive protein, ACR20 was achieved by a significantly higher portion of those in the fostamatinib group (42%) versus the placebo group (26%). === Autoimmune thrombocytopenia === Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks and destroys platelets in the blood, causing abnormally low platelet counts. It is characterized by the antibody-mediated destruction of platelets. Patients with ITP have accelerated clearance of circulating IgG-coated platelets via Fcγ receptor-bearing macrophages in the spleen and liver, leading to different levels of thrombocytopenia and variable degrees of mucocutaneous bleeding. Recent studies of ITP pathophysiology suggest decreased platelet production may also be an important component of the thrombocytopenia. Many patients exhibit responses to established therapies, including corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D, splenectomy, and rituximab. However, there are a significant minority of patients who retain persistently low platelet counts despite treatment. These patients are consistently at risk of intracranial hemorrhage and other bleeding complications. Several thrombopoiesis-stimulating therapies including eltrombopag and romiplostim are being investigated to help combat low platelet counts in ITP patients. Rigel reported results from two Phase III clinical trials for fostamatinib as an ITP treatment in August and October 2016. The study is the second Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, study of fostamatinib disodium in the treatment of persistent/chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura that Rigel has conducted. Primary outcome measures are defined as a stable platelet response by the end of the study (week 24) of at least 50,000/μL on at least 4 of the 6 visits between weeks 14–24. Participants received either a placebo, 100 mg, or 150 mg of the drug in the morning and evening for 24 full weeks. The first study, FIT 1 (047) met the primary endpoint in a statistically significant manner, with 18% of patients hitting the 50,000 platelets/μL of blood and no patients receiving the placebo meeting that criteria. As of June 2016, the open-label, long term extension study (049) is currently tracking 118 patients who opted to receive fostamatinib after completing either study 047 or 048. === Autoimmune hemolytic anemia === Approval for treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is in Stage 1 of Phase II trials. This study is a Phase 2, multi-center, open label, Simon two-stage study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fostamatinib disodium in the treatment of warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Primary outcome measures examined include a hemoglobin response measured by levels higher than 10 g/dL and 2 g/dL higher than the baseline hemoglobin. Responses were studied for a period of 12 weeks and for a dose of 150 mg in the morning and evening. The study began in April 2016 and is estimated to conclude in September 2017. The study is currently recruiting participants from U.S. states including Arizona, California, D.C., Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, and Texas. Subjects must have had a diagnosis of primary or secondary warm antibody AIHA, and must have failed at least 1 prior treatment regimen for AIHA. Subjects cannot have a platelet count less than 30,000/μL, have AIHA secondary to autoimmune disease, have uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension, or have cold antibody AIHA, cold agglutinin syndrome, mixed type AIHA, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. === Immunoglobulin A nephropathy === Fostamatinib as a treatment for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is in Phase II trials, which will conclude at the end of 2016. IgAN is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with inflammation in the kidneys that reduces their ability to successfully filter blood. There are currently no disease-targeted therapies for IgAN. Participants are currently being recruited from the US, Austria, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the UK. Patients must be between 18 and 70 years old, have renal biopsy findings consistent with IgA nephropathy, have been treated with an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and/or an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) for at least 90 days at the maximum approved dose, have a proteinuria > 1 gm/day at diagnosis of IgA nephropathy and a level > 0.5 gm/day at the second screening visit, and a blood pressure controlled to ≤ 1302/80 with angiotensin blockade. Eligible candidates cannot have recently used cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, Rituximab, or > 15 mg/day of prednisone or any other corticosteroid equivalent. The study investigates whether fostamatinib is a safe and effective treatment for IgAN. It is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, ascending-dose, placebo-controlled clinical study. Primary outcome measures include the mean change in proteinuria as measured by spot urine protein/creatinine ratio (sPCR). Effects were evaluated for 100 mg, 150 mg, and placebo formulations taken twice daily by mouth for 24 weeks. The study began in October 2014 and is expected to complete by June 2017. == History == Fostamatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2018. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved fostamatinib based on evidence from two identical, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, FIT-1 (NCT02076399) and FIT-2 (NCT02076412) of 150 adults with persistent or chronic ITP who had an insufficient response to previous treatment, which included corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, splenectomy, and/or a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. Participants were allowed to continue previous ITP treatment during the trial. Patients were randomized 2:1 to fostamatinib (100 mg orally twice daily) or placebo twice daily for 24 weeks. Dose could be escalated to 150 mg orally twice daily after one month. The benefit of fostamatinib was assessed based on the percentage of participants who achieved and maintained the pre-determined platelet count between treatment weeks 14 to 24 in fostamatinib and placebo groups respectively. The FIT-1 trial was conducted at 35 sites in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The FIT-2 trial was conducted at 23 sites in Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Spain. The FDA granted the application for fostamatinib an orphan drug designation and granted the approval of Tavalisse to Rigel Pharmaceuticals. Fostamatinib was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2020. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02076399 for ""A Efficacy and Safety Study of R935788 in the Treatment of Persistent/Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) (FIT)"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Tavalisse,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.590759246842936e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00010871296399272978)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/tavalisse.html ', [])"
286,"('Radiprodil', 'Radiprodil [inn]', 'Radiprodil (rgh-896)', 'S6644')",Medical," GRIN-related disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit genes. A large fraction of these mutations lead to a 'gain of function' (GoF) of the NMDAR. Patients present with a range of symptoms including epilepsy, intellectual disability, behavioural and motor. Controlling seizures is a significant unmet medical need in most patients with GRIN-related disorders. Although several hundred GRIN mutations have been identified in humans, until recently none of the mouse models carrying Grin mutations/deletions showed an epileptic phenotype. The two recent exceptions both carry mutations of GluN2A. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of radiprodil, a selective negative allosteric modulator of GluN2B-containing NMDARs, in counteracting audiogenic seizures (AGS) in a murine model carrying the GluN2A(N615S) homozygous mutation (Grin2a Grin2a Radiprodil significantly and dose-dependently reduced the onset and severity of AGS in Grin2a Overall, our data clearly show that radiprodil, a GluN2B selective negative allosteric modulator, may have the potential to control seizures in patients with GRIN2A GoF mutations. Further studies are warranted to better understand the sex-dependent effects observed in this study. Infantile spasm syndrome (ISS) is an epileptic encephalopathy without established treatment after the failure to standard of care based on steroids and vigabatrin. Converging lines of evidence indicating a role of NR2B subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor on the onset of spams in ISS patients, prompted us to test radiprodil, a negative allosteric NR2B modulator in preclinical seizure models and in infants with ISS. Radiprodil has been tested in three models, including pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in rats across different postnatal (PN) ages. Three infants with ISS have been included in a phase 1b escalating repeated dose study. Radiprodil showed the largest protective seizure effects in juvenile rats (maximum at PN12, corresponding to late infancy in humans). Three infants resistant to a combination of vigabatrin and prednisolone received individually titrated doses of radiprodil for up to 34 days. Radiprodil was safe and well tolerated in all three infants, and showed the expected pharmacokinetic profile. One infant became spasm-free and two showed clinical improvement without reaching spasm-freedom. After radiprodil withdrawal, the one infant continued to be spasm-free, while the two others experienced seizure worsening requiring the use of the ketogenic diet and other antiepileptic drugs. Radiprodil showed prominent anti-seizure effect in juvenile animals, consistent with the prevalent expression of NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor at this age in both rodents and humans. The clinical testing, although preliminary, showed that radiprodil is associated with a good safety and pharmacokinetic profile, and with the potential to control epileptic spasms. In this phase I, single-center, open-label study of ten heathy adults (18-45 years; NCT02647697), the PK, safety, and tolerability profile of radiprodil oral suspension in healthy adults were assessed, as well as two PK microsampling techniques. All participants received a single 30 mg radiprodil dose (12 mL oral suspension). Blood was collected at various time points using conventional venous sampling (intravenous catheter or venepuncture), and Mitra™ and Aqua-Cap™ Drummond microsampling (finger-prick and blood taken from venous blood sample tubes).

It is one of the two stereoisomers of clomifene, which itself is a mixture of 38% zuclomifene and 62% enclomifene. Enclomifene is the (E)-stereoisomer of clomifene, while zuclomifene is the (Z)-stereoisomer. Whereas zuclomifene is more estrogenic, enclomifene is more antiestrogenic. In accordance, unlike enclomifene, zuclomifene is antigonadotropic due to activation of the ER and reduces testosterone levels in men. As such, isomerically pure enclomifene is more favorable than clomifene as a progonadotropin for the treatment of male hypogonadism. Enclomiphene (former tentative brand names Androxal and EnCyzix), was under development for the treatment of male hypogonadism and type 2 diabetes. By December 2016, it was in preregistration and was under review by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the European Medicines Agency in the European Union. In January 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency recommended refusal of marketing authorization for enclomifene for the treatment of secondary hypogonadism. In April 2021, development of enclomifene was discontinued for all indications. == Medical uses == Enclomiphene is primarily used as a treatment for men with persistent low testosterone as a result of secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the resulting low levels of testosterone is attributed to inadequacies in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. In contrast, primary hypogonadism is caused by defects in the testes that causes them to be unable to produce the required amount of testosterone. Enclomiphene, which stimulates the endogenous production of testosterone, is not currently known to have common adverse effects of exogenous testosterone replacement therapy, such as reduced spermatogenesis or infertility. == Contraindications == Enclomiphene citrate is contraindicated in the groups of individuals below: Pregnant women. Breastfeeding women. Women with unexplained uterine bleeding. Women with ovarian growths or cysts unrelated to polycystic ovary syndrome. Patients with a history of liver disease. Patients with uncontrolled adrenal or thyroid dysfunction. Patient with known allergy to enclomiphene or clomiphene. == Adverse effects == The adverse effects of enclomiphene have not been extensively studied. Enclomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), which is associated with an increased risk of thrombo-embolic events. Enclomiphene, unlike testosterone replacement therapy, is not associated with infertility or decreased spermatogenesis. The following adverse events were observed in a population of 1,403 persons participating in phase 2 and phase 3 studies of enclomiphene: == Mechanism of action == Enclomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor antagonist, antagonizing the estrogen receptors in the pituitary gland, disrupting the negative feedback loop by estrogen towards the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, ultimately resulting in an increase in gonadotropin secretion. In men with secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, this improves testosterone levels and sperm motility. Men with secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have abnormally low testosterone levels due to low-normal levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicular stimulating hormone (FSH). The biological role of these hormones is to stimulate the endogenous production of testosterone by the testes. Common symptoms of secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism include low libido, energy, and mood. In addition, men with low testosterone may experience osteoporosis, an increase in visceral fat, and the regression of secondary sexual characteristics. Enclomiphene stimulates the endogenous production of testosterone. It works differently from traditional testosterone replacement therapy, which replaces testosterone using an exogenous source. In addition, research has uncovered that enclomiphene increases total and free testosterone levels without increasing dihydrotestosterone disproportionately, suggesting that it ""normalizes endogenous testosterone production pathways and restores normal testosterone levels in men with secondary hypogonadism."" == History == Enclomifene or Enclomiphene (former tentative brand names Androxal and EnCyzix), was under development for the treatment of male hypogonadism and type 2 diabetes. By December 2016, it was in preregistration and was under review by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the European Medicines Agency in the European Union. In January 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency recommended refusal of marketing authorization for enclomifene for the treatment of secondary hypogonadism. In April 2021, development of enclomifene was discontinued for all indications. Clomiphene citrate, which enclomiphene citrate is derived from, is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Association (FDA) for indications of anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory infertility and male infertility (spermatogenesis induction). A media release by the FDA for the pharmacy compounding advisory committee compared the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy against enclomiphene. They wrote that while testosterone replacement therapy often resulted in side effects such as transference risk, supranormal testosterone levels, suppressed spermatogenesis, suppressed testicular function, and testicular atrophy, none of these risks are present in enclomiphene. In 2009, a study discovered that ""short-term clinical safety data for enclomiphene have been satisfactory and equivalent to safety data for testosterone gels and placebo."" In 2016, a study on enclomiphene citrate reported that ""the ability [of enclomiphene citrate] to treat testosterone deficiency in men while maintaining fertility supports a role for enclomiphene citrate in the treatment of men in whom testosterone therapy is not a suitable option."" In 2019, a study was published that found that ""enclomiphene has been shown to increase testosterone levels while stimulating [follicular-stimulating hormone] and [luteinizing hormone] production."" The key difference between enclomiphene citrate and traditional testosterone replacement therapy is that enclomiphene citrate stimulates the body to produce its own testosterone, while traditional testosterone replacement therapy replaces low testosterone levels in men with exogenous, synthetic testosterone. A study conducted in 2013 offered this assessment of the potential of enclomiphene citrate to increase sexual function in men: ""If enclomiphene citrate can correct the central defect in men that blocks their ability to produce [lutenizing hormone] and [follicular-stimulating hormone] and thus to produce both testosterone and sperm in the testes, this drug may prove itself superior to other treatments."" == References == == External links == Enclomifene - AdisInsight",Enclomiphene,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.5759738683700562), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00024256148026324809), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024807651061564684)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclomifene?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=6, title='Enclomifene', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclomifene?utm_source=openai')])"
289,"('Clopidogrel', 'Plavix', '(s)-clopidogrel', 'Zyllt', 'Clopidogrel bisulfate')",Medical,"Clopidogrel, sold under the brand name Plavix among others, is an antiplatelet medication used to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in those at high risk. It is also used together with aspirin in heart attacks and following the placement of a coronary artery stent (dual antiplatelet therapy). It is taken by mouth. Its effect starts about two hours after intake and lasts for five days. Common side effects include headache, nausea, easy bruising, itching, and heartburn. More severe side effects include bleeding and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. While there is no evidence of harm from use during pregnancy, such use has not been well studied. Clopidogrel is in the thienopyridine-class of antiplatelets. It works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12 on platelets. Clopidogrel was patented in 1982, and approved for medical use in 1997. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 47th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Clopidogrel is used to prevent heart attack and stroke in people who are at high risk of these events, including those with a history of myocardial infarction and other forms of acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and those with peripheral artery disease. Treatment with clopidogrel or a related drug is recommended by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology for people who: Present for treatment with a myocardial infarction with ST-elevation including A loading dose given in advance of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), followed by a full year of treatment for those receiving a vascular stent A loading dose given in advance of fibrinolytic therapy, continued for at least 14 days Present for treatment of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina Including a loading dose and maintenance therapy in those receiving PCI and unable to tolerate aspirin therapy Maintenance therapy for up to 12 months in those at medium to high risk for which a noninvasive treatment strategy is chosen In those with stable ischemic heart disease, treatment with clopidogrel is described as a ""reasonable"" option for monotherapy in those who cannot tolerate aspirin, as is treatment with clopidogrel in combination with aspirin in certain high risk patients. It is also used, along with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), for the prevention of thrombosis after placement of a coronary stent or as an alternative antiplatelet drug for people intolerant to aspirin. It is available as a fixed-dose combination with aspirin. A meta-analysis found clopidogrel's benefit as an antiplatelet drug in reducing cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke to be 25% benefit in smokers, with little (8%) benefit in non-smokers. Consensus-based therapeutic guidelines also recommend the use of clopidogrel rather than aspirin (ASA) for antiplatelet therapy in people with a history of gastric ulceration, as inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by ASA can exacerbate this condition. In people with healed ASA-induced ulcers, however, those receiving ASA plus the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole had a lower incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding than those receiving clopidogrel. However, prophylaxis with proton-pump inhibitors along with clopidogrel following acute coronary syndrome may increase adverse cardiac outcomes, possibly due to inhibition of CYP2C19, which is required for the conversion of clopidogrel to its active form. The European Medicines Agency has issued a public statement on a possible interaction between clopidogrel and proton-pump inhibitors. However, several cardiologists have voiced concern that the studies on which these warnings are based have many limitations and that it is not certain whether an interaction between clopidogrel and proton-pump inhibitors is real. == Adverse effects == Serious adverse drug reactions associated with clopidogrel therapy include: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (incidence: four per million patients treated) Hemorrhage – the annual incidence of hemorrhage may be increased by the coadministration of aspirin. In the CURE trial, people with acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation were treated with aspirin plus either clopidogrel or placebo and followed for up to one year. The following rates of major bleed were seen: Any major bleeding: clopidogrel 3.7%, placebo 2.7% Life-threatening bleeding: clopidogrel 2.2%, placebo 1.8% Hemorrhagic stroke: clopidogrel 0.1%, placebo 0.1% The CAPRIE trial compared clopidogrel monotherapy to aspirin monotherapy for 1.6 years in people who had recently experienced a stroke or heart attack. In this trial the following rates of bleeding were observed. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage: clopidogrel 2.0%, aspirin 2.7% Intracranial bleeding: clopidogrel 0.4%, aspirin 0.5% In CAPRIE, itching was the only adverse effect seen more frequently with clopidogrel than aspirin. In CURE, there was no difference in the rate of non-bleeding adverse events. Rashes and itching were uncommon in studies (between 0.1 and 1% of people); serious hypersensitivity reactions are rare. == Interactions == Clopidogrel generally has a low potential to interact with other pharmaceutical drugs. Combination with other drugs that affect blood clotting, such as aspirin, heparins and thrombolytics, showed no relevant interactions. Naproxen did increase the likelihood of occult gastrointestinal bleeding, as might be the case with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. As clopidogrel is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2C19, in cellular models it has been theorized that it might increase blood plasma levels of other drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme, such as phenytoin and tolbutamide. Clinical studies showed that this mechanism is irrelevant for practical purposes. In November 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that clopidogrel should be used with caution in people using the proton-pump inhibitors omeprazole or esomeprazole, but pantoprazole appears to be safe. The newer antiplatelet agent prasugrel has minimal interaction with (es)omeprazole, hence might be a better antiplatelet agent (if no other contraindications are present) in people who are on these proton-pump inhibitors. == Pharmacology == Clopidogrel is a prodrug which is metabolized by the liver into its active form. The active form specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein fibrin. === Pharmacokinetics and metabolism === After repeated oral doses of 75 mg of clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet-inhibiting effect, are very low and, in general, are below the quantification limit (0.258 μg/L) beyond two hours after dosing. Clopidogrel is a prodrug, which is activated in two steps, first by the enzymes CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP2B6, then by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP3A. The thiophene ring is converted to a thiolactone, which undergoes ring-opening. The active metabolite has three sites that are stereochemically relevant, making a total of eight possible isomers. These are: a stereocentre at C4 (attached to the —SH thiol group), a double bond at C3—C16, and the original stereocentre at C7. Only one of the eight structures is an active antiplatelet drug. This has the following configuration: Z configuration at the C3—C16 double bond, the original S configuration at C7, and, although the stereocentre at C4 cannot be directly determined, as the thiol group is too reactive, work with the active metabolite of the related drug prasugrel suggests the R-configuration of the C4 group is critical for P2Y12 and platelet-inhibitory activity. The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 0.5 to 1.0 h, and acts by forming a disulfide bridge with the platelet ADP receptor. Patients with a variant allele of CYP2C19 are 1.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die or have complications than patients with the high-functioning allele. Following an oral dose of 14C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, about 50% was excreted in the urine and 46% in the feces in the five days after dosing. Effect of food: Administration of clopidogrel bisulfate with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite. Absorption and distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses of 75-milligram clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (about 3 mg/L) of the main circulating metabolite occurring around one hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of clopidogrel. Absorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is not saturable in vitro up to a concentration of 110 μg/mL. Metabolism and elimination: In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed. In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning, later updated, to Plavix, alerting that the drug can be less effective in people unable to metabolize the drug to convert it to its active form. === Pharmacogenetics === CYP2C19 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the biotransformation of many clinically useful drugs, including antidepressants, barbiturates, proton-pump inhibitors, and antimalarial and antitumor drugs. Clopidogrel is one of the drugs metabolized by this enzyme. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning on clopidogrel in 2010 about CYP2C19-poor metabolizers. People with variants in cytochrome P-450 2C19 (CYP2C19) have lower levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, less inhibition of platelets, and a 3.58-times greater risk for major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, and stroke; the risk was greatest in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. A published review showed that some mutations of CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2B6, and CYP1A2 genes could affect the clinical efficacy and safety of clopidogrel treatment. For instance, patients carrying the mutations CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2B6*5 alleles may not respond to clopidogrel due to poor platelet inhibition efficacy revealed among them. === Mechanism of action === The active metabolite of clopidogrel specifically and irreversibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein fibrin. Platelet inhibition can be demonstrated two hours after a single dose of oral clopidogrel, but the onset of action is slow, so a loading dose of either 600 or 300 mg is administered when a rapid effect is needed. == Society and culture == === Economics === Plavix is marketed worldwide in nearly 110 countries, with sales of US$6.6 billion in 2009. It was the second-top-selling drug in the world in 2007 and was still growing by over 20% in 2007. US sales were US$3.8 billion in 2008. Before the expiry of its patent, clopidogrel was the second best-selling drug in the world. In 2010, it grossed over US$9 billion in global sales. In 2006, generic clopidogrel was briefly marketed by Apotex, a Canadian generic pharmaceutical company before a court order halted further production until resolution of a patent infringement case brought by Bristol-Myers Squibb. The court ruled that Bristol-Myers Squibb's patent was valid and provided protection until November 2011. The FDA extended the patent protection of clopidogrel by six months, giving exclusivity that would expire in May 2012. The FDA approved generic versions of clopidogrel in May 2012. === Names === Generic clopidogrel is marketed by many companies worldwide under many brand names. == Veterinary uses == Clopidogrel has been shown to be effective at decreasing platelet aggregation in cats, so its use in prevention of feline aortic thromboembolism has been advocated. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2012).

However, its antiplatelet effect and safety in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are unclear. This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy, dose-exploring phase II trial comparing the antiplatelet activity and safety of vicagrel at different doses vs. those of clopidogrel in patients with CAD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The primary endpoint was inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation (%IPA) after loading and maintenance doses (LD/MD) at 28 days. Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs) and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium-defined any bleeding. Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and the influence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms were explored in subgroup analysis. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients diagnosed with stable CAD (51.97%), unstable angina (40.86%), and myocardial infarction (7.17%) were randomized to receive vicagrel 20/5 mg (LD/MD), 24/6 mg, or 30/7.5 mg or clopidogrel 300/75 mg in combination with aspirin. %IPAs on Day 28 were 30.19%, 35.02%, 45.61%, and 32.55% for vicagrel 20/5, 24/6, and 30/7.5 mg and clopidogrel, respectively, and were comparable across all groups (P = 0.0694). The plasma concentration of the vicagrel active metabolite M15-2 had a similar area under curve and Tmax to those of clopidogrel. There were no significant differences in AEs (4.35%, 0%, 1.45%, and 5.56% for vicagrel 20/5, 24/6, and 30/7.5 mg and clopidogrel, P = 0.6667) or any bleeding (13.04%, 14.06%, 11.59%, and 11.11% for vicagrel 20/5, 24/6, and 30/7.5 mg and clopidogrel, respectively, P = 0.95) across four groups. %IPAs and PK profiles of vicagrel did not vary significantly among different CYP2C19 metabolizers. Vicagrel had comparable antiplatelet effect and safety to clopidogrel in patients with CAD undergoing PCI. As an analog of clopidogrel and prasugrel, vicagrel is completely hydrolyzed to intermediate thiolactone metabolite 2-oxo-clopidogrel (also the precursor of active thiol metabolite H4) in human intestine, predominantly by AADAC and CES2; however, other unknown vicagrel hydrolases remain to be identified. In this study, recombinant human Raf kinase inhibitor protein (rhRKIP) and pooled human intestinal S9 (HIS9) fractions and microsome (HIM) preparations were used as the different enzyme sources; prasugrel as a probe drug for RKIP (a positive control), vicagrel as a substrate drug of interest, and the rate of the formation of thiolactone metabolites 2-oxo-clopidogrel and R95913 as metrics of hydrolase activity examined, respectively. In addition, an IC Vicagrel, a novel acetate analogue of clopidogrel, exerts more potent antiplatelet effect than clopidogrel in rodents. Relevant evidence indicated that aspirin and vicagrel are the drug substrate for carboxylesterase 2. Accordingly, it is deduced that concomitant use of aspirin could attenuate the bioactivation of and platelet response to vicagrel. To clarify whether there could be such an important drug-drug interaction, the differences in both the formation of vicagrel active metabolite H4 and the inhibition of adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation by vicagrel were measured and compared between mice treated with vicagrel alone or in combination with aspirin. The plasma H4 concentration was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the inhibition of platelet aggregation by vicagrel was assessed by whole-blood platelet aggregation. Compared with vicagrel (2.5 mg·kg) alone, concurrent use of aspirin (5, 10, or 20 mg·kg) significantly decreased systemic exposure of H4, an average of 38% and 41% decrease in Cmax and AUC0-∞ in mice when in combination with aspirin at 10 mg·kg, respectively. Furthermore, concomitant use of aspirin (10 mg·kg) and vicagrel (2.5 mg·kg) resulted in an average of 66% reduction in the inhibition of adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation by vicagrel. We conclude that aspirin significantly attenuates the formation of vicagrel active metabolite H4 and platelet response to vicagrel in mice, and that such an important drug-drug interaction would appear in clinical settings if vicagrel is taken with aspirin concomitantly when marketed in the future.",Vicagrel,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.014684110297821e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00047469791024923325), ('ICAL', -7.986990567587782e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003190429415553808)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([wlns.com](https://www.wlns.com/business/press-releases/cision/20240104CN04232/jiangsu-vcare-files-nda-for-vicagrel-capsules-with-us-fda/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=167, start_index=9, title='Jiangsu Vcare Files NDA for Vicagrel Capsules with US FDA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.wlns.com/business/press-releases/cision/20240104CN04232/jiangsu-vcare-files-nda-for-vicagrel-capsules-with-us-fda/?utm_source=openai')])"

Specifically, altiratinib inhibits not only mechanisms of tumor initiation and progression, but also drug resistance mechanisms in the tumor and microenvironment through balanced inhibition of MET, TIE2 (TEK), and VEGFR2 (KDR) kinases. This profile was achieved by optimizing binding into the switch control pocket of all three kinases, inducing type II inactive conformations. Altiratinib durably inhibits MET, both wild-type and mutated forms, in vitro and in vivo. Through its balanced inhibitory potency versus MET, TIE2, and VEGFR2, altiratinib provides an agent that inhibits three major evasive (re)vascularization and resistance pathways (HGF, ANG, and VEGF) and blocks tumor invasion and metastasis. Altiratinib exhibits properties amenable to oral administration and exhibits substantial blood-brain barrier penetration, an attribute of significance for eventual treatment of brain cancers and brain metastases. Chronic toxoplasmosis is caused by Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoites. This study assessed six candidate small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) against bradyzoites (ME49 strain), the reactivated form of the parasite resulting from the rupture of brain cysts. Bradyzoites were obtained from mouse brain cysts, cultured in ARPE-19 cells, and treated with afatinib and neratinib (HER2/HER4 inhibitors), ACTB-1003 and regorafenib (VEGFR-2 inhibitors), or altiratinib and foretinib (c-MET inhibitors). The effects on the growth of T. gondii were analyzed by western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Changes in the host cells were assessed using markers for cell viability, apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. All inhibitors blocked the growth of bradyzoites, although afatinib was less effective. Afatinib enhanced autophagy signals, while ACTB-1003 and neratinib affected mitochondrial biosynthesis and mitophagy. Altiratinib demonstrated an effect against bradyzoites at the lowest concentration with minimal impact on the host cells.

These side effects arise when drugs affect untargeted tissues due to poor target specificity. In photopharmacology, light controls the timing and the location of drug delivery, improving treatment specificity and pharmacokinetic control. Photopharmaceuticals have not seen widespread adoption in part because researchers do not always have access to reliable and reproducible light delivery devices at prices which fit within the larger research budget.  Researchers present a photomodulator, a device designed to facilitate in vivo photopharmacology. They demonstrate the in vivo capabilities of the photomodulator by photoreleasing raseglurant, an mGluR5 inhibitor, to treat pain in an acute rat model and follow this study by showing how to reconfigure the photomodulator to work wirelessly and interface with other biomedical devices. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13534-023-00334-3. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability. Patients with FXS do not only suffer from cognitive problems, but also from abnormalities/deficits in procedural memory formation. It has been proposed that a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) leads to altered long-term plasticity by deregulation of various translational processes at the synapses, and that part of these impairments might be rescued by the inhibition of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). We recently developed the Erasmus Ladder, which allows us to test, without any invasive approaches, simultaneously, both procedural memory formation and avoidance behavior during unperturbed and perturbed locomotion in mice. Here, we investigated the impact of a potent and selective mGluR5 inhibitor (Fenobam) on the behavior of Fmr1 KO mice during the Erasmus Ladder task. Fmr1 KO mice showed deficits in associative motor learning as well as avoidance behavior, both of which were rescued by intraperitoneal administration of Fenobam. While the Fmr1 KO mice did benefit from the treatment, control littermates suffered from a significant negative side effect in that their motor learning skills, but not their avoidance behavior, were significantly affected. On the basis of these studies in the FXS animal model, it may be worthwhile to investigate the effects of mGluR inhibitors on both the cognitive functions and procedural skills in FXS patients. However, the use of mGluR inhibitors appears to be strongly contraindicated in healthy controls or non-FXS patients with intellectual disability. ADX10059, a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) negative allosteric modulator, has been shown to reduce gastro-oesophageal reflux events and oesophageal acid exposure in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and healthy subjects.   To evaluate the effects of ADX10059 monotherapy for 2 weeks on symptom control in patients with GERD. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial in GERD patients who were responders to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Following PPIs withdrawal, a 2-week baseline washout period was followed by 2-week treatment with either ADX10059 120 mg or placebo b.d. The primary clinical efficacy endpoint was the number of GERD symptom-free days in treatment week 2 compared with the last 7 days of baseline. The effect on reflux events using 24-h impedance-pH monitoring was also determined in a subset of 24 patients. The full analysis set comprised 103 patients ADX10059 (N= 50), Placebo (N=53). In treatment week 2, ADX10059 significantly increased GERD symptom-free days (P=0.045) and heartburn-free days (P=0.037), reduced antacid use (P=0.017), improved total symptom score (P=0.048) including subscale heartburn/regurgitation (P=0.007) and sleep disturbance because of GERD (P= 0.022). ADX10059 significantly reduced total (P=0.034) and acidic reflux events (P=0.003). ADX10059 was well tolerated. Most common adverse events for ADX10059 were mild to moderate dizziness 16% and vertigo 12% (placebo 4% and 2%).

It is related to chloroquine and mefloquine. Although available from compounding pharmacies, as of August 2020 approved formulations are not available in the United States. == Medical uses == The main uses of mepacrine are as an antiprotozoal, antirheumatic, and an intrapleural sclerosing agent. Mepacrine is used off label as a primary antimicrobial agent for patients with metronidazole-resistant giardiasis and patients who should not receive or cannot tolerate metronidazole. Giardiasis with a high level of drug resistance may even require a combination of mepacrine and metronidazole to cure. Mepacrine is also used off-label for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, indicated in the treatment of discoid and subcutaneous lupus manifestations, particularly in patients who are unable to take hydroxychloroquine. As an sclerosing agent, it is used as pneumothorax prophylaxis in patients at high risk of recurrence, e.g., in those with cystic fibrosis. Mepacrine is not the drug of choice because side effects are common, including toxic psychosis, and may cause permanent damage. See mefloquine for more information. In addition to medical applications, mepacrine is an effective in vitro research tool for the epifluorescent visualization of cells, especially platelets. Mepacrine is a green fluorescent dye taken up by most cells. Platelets store mepacrine in dense granules. == Mechanism == Its mechanism of action against protozoa is uncertain, but it is thought to act against the protozoan's cell membrane. It is known to act as a histamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor. It also inhibits NF-κB and activates p53. == History == === Antiprotozoal === Mepacrine was initially approved in the 1930s as an antimalarial drug. It was used extensively during the second World War by Allied forces fighting in North Africa and the Far East to prevent malaria. This antiprotozoal is also approved for the treatment of giardiasis (an intestinal parasite), and has been researched as an inhibitor of phospholipase A2. Scientists at Bayer in Germany first synthesised mepacrine in 1931. The product was one of the first synthetic substitutes for quinine although later superseded by chloroquine. === Anthelmintics === In addition it has been used for treating tapeworm infections. === Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease === Mepacrine has been shown to bind to the prion protein and prevent the formation of prion aggregates in vitro, and full clinical trials of its use as a treatment for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease are under way in the United Kingdom and the United States. Small trials in Japan have reported improvement in the condition of patients with the disease, although other reports have shown no significant effect, and treatment of scrapie in mice and sheep has also shown no effect. Possible reasons for the lack of an in vivo effect include inefficient penetration of the blood–brain barrier, as well as the existence of drug-resistant prion proteins that increase in number when selected for by treatment with mepacrine. === Non-surgical sterilization for women === The use of mepacrine for non-surgical sterilization for women has also been studied. The first report of this method claimed a first year failure rate of 3.1%. However, despite a multitude of clinical studies on the use of mepacrine and female sterilization, no randomized, controlled trials have been reported to date and there is some controversy over its use. Pellets of mepacrine are inserted through the cervix into a woman's uterine cavity using a preloaded inserter device, similar in manner to IUCD insertion. The procedure is undertaken twice, first in the proliferative phase, 6 to 12 days following the first day of the menstrual cycle and again one month later. The sclerosing effects of the drugs at the utero-tubal junctions (where the Fallopian tubes enter the uterus) results in scar tissue forming over a six-week interval to close off the tubes permanently. In the United States, this method has undergone Phase I clinical testing. The FDA has waived the necessity for Phase II clinical trials because of the extensive data pertaining to other uses of mepacrine. The next step in the FDA approval process in the United States is a Phase III large multi-center clinical trial. The method is currently used off-label. Many peer reviewed studies suggest that mepacrine sterilization (QS) is potentially safer than surgical sterilization. Nevertheless, in 1998 the Supreme Court of India banned the import or use of the drug, allegedly based on reports that it could cause cancer or ectopic pregnancies. === Skin dye === During World War II, Caucasian American operatives involved in Sino-American Cooperative Organization activities the Second Sino-Japanese War yellowed their skin using mepacrine tablets in order better blend in with the native Chinese population. == See also == Chloroquine Amodiaquine Pamaquine Mefloquine == References == == External links == National Institute on Aging (NIA) trial",Atabrine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0002517383254598826), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01423549372702837)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([dermnetnz.org](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/quinacrine?utm_source=openai), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mepacrine?utm_source=openai), [medicinesfaq.com](https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/atabrine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=247, start_index=9, title='Quinacrine', type='url_citation', url='https://dermnetnz.org/topics/quinacrine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=247, start_index=9, title='Mepacrine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mepacrine?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=247, start_index=9, title='Atabrine: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, FAQ - MedicinesFAQ', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/atabrine?utm_source=openai')])"
