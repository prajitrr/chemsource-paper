1290,"('Carbimazole', 'Athyromazole', 'Carbimazol', 'Neomercazole', 'Carbethoxymethimazole')",Medical,"Carbimazole (brand names Neo-Mercazole, Anti-Thyrox, etc.) is used to treat hyperthyroidism. Carbimazole is a pro-drug as after absorption it is converted to the active form, methimazole. Methimazole prevents thyroid peroxidase enzyme from iodinating and coupling the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, hence reducing the production of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (thyroxine). It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Medical therapy for hyperthyroidism typically involves either titrating the dose of carbimazole until the patient becomes euthyroid or maintaining a high dose of carbimazole to suppress endogenous thyroid production, and then replacing thyroid hormone with levothyroxine (""block and replace""). Treatment is usually given for 18–24 months followed by a trial withdraw. The onset of anti-thyroid effect is rapid but the onset of clinical effects on thyroid hormone levels in the blood is much slower. This is because the large store of pre-formed T3 and T4 in the thyroid gland and bound to thyroid binding globulin (99% bound) has to be depleted before any beneficial clinical effect occurs. == Adverse effects == Whilst rashes and pruritus are common, these can often be treated with antihistamines without stopping the carbimazole. For those patients where sensitivity reactions cannot be controlled, propylthiouracil may be used as an alternative; cross-sensitivity between these drugs is rare. Its most serious rare side effect is bone marrow suppression causing neutropenia and agranulocytosis. This may occur at any stage during treatment and without warning; monitoring of white cell count is not useful. Patients are advised to immediately report symptoms of infection, such as sore throat or fever, so that a full blood count test may be arranged. If this confirms a low neutrophil count, discontinuation of the drug leads to recovery. However failure to report suggestive symptoms or delays in considering the possibility of immunosuppression and its testing, can lead to fatalities. === Precautions === Some people are allergic to azole(s). Some azole drugs have adverse side-effects. Some azole drugs may disrupt estrogen production in pregnancy, affecting pregnancy outcome. Carbimazole should be used judiciously in pregnancy as it crosses the placenta. It has (rarely) been associated with congenital defects, including aplasia cutis of the neonate but is not contra-indicated. However, it more predictably may cause fetal hypothyroidism so (in minimal doses) it can be used in order to control maternal hyperthyroidism. There are reported cases of goiter and choanal atresia in fetus. Furthermore, breast feeding is possible but only if lowest effective dose is used and neonatal development is closely monitored. For the above reasons, it is preferable to use PTU in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, with the possibility of changing to carbimazole for the second and third trimesters. == Brand names == Neo-mercazole Vidalta Thyrocab Neomerdin == References == == Further reading ==",Neomercazole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.747018051100895e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002590635558590293)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbimazole?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Carbimazole', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbimazole?utm_source=openai')])"
1291,"('Zotarolimus', 'A 179578', 'Zotarilumus', 'Zotarolimus [usan:inn]', 'Zotarolimus (abt-578)')",Medical,"Zotarolimus (INN, codenamed ABT-578) is an immunosuppressant. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of sirolimus (rapamycin). It was designed for use in stents with phosphorylcholine as a carrier. Zotarolimus, or ABT-578, was originally used on Abbott's coronary stent platforms to reduce early inflammation and restenosis; however, Zotarolimus failed Abbott's primary endpoint to bring their stent/drug delivery system to market. The drug was sold/distributed to Medtronic for use on their stent platforms, which is the same drug they use today. Coronary stents reduce early complications and improve late clinical outcomes in patients needing interventional cardiology. The first human coronary stent implantation was first performed in 1986 by Puel et al. However, there are complications associated with stent use, development of thrombosis which impedes the efficiency of coronary stents, haemorrhagic and restenosis complications are problems associated with stents. These complications have prompted the development of drug-eluting stents. Stents are bound by a membrane consisting of polymers which not only slowly release zotarolimus and its derivatives into the surrounding tissues but also do not invoke an inflammatory response by the body. Medtronic are using zotarolimus as the anti-proliferative agent in the polymer coating of their Endeavor and Resolute products. == Background == The inherent growth inhibitory properties of many anti-cancer agents make these drugs ideal candidates for the prevention of restenosis. However, these same properties are often associated with cytotoxicity at doses which block cell proliferation. Therefore, the unique cytostatic nature of the immunosuppressant rapamycin was the basis for the development of zotarolimus by Johnson and Johnson. Rapamycin was originally approved for the prevention of renal transplant rejection in 1999. More recently, Abbott Laboratories developed a compound from the same class, zotarolimus (formerly ABT-578), as the first cytostatic agent to be used solely for delivery from drug-eluting stents to prevent restenosis. == Drug-eluting stents == Drug-eluting stents have revolutionized the field of interventional cardiology and have provided a significant innovation for preventing coronary artery restenosis. Polymer coatings that deliver anti-proliferative drugs to the vessel wall are key components of these revolutionary medical devices. The development of stents which elute the potent anti-proliferative agent, zotarolimus, from a synthetic phosphorylcholine-based polymer known for its biocompatible profile. Zotarolimus is the first drug developed specifically for local delivery from stents for the prevention of restenosis and has been tested extensively to support this indication. Clinical experience with the PC polymer is also extensive, since more than 120,000 patients have been implanted to date with stents containing this non-thrombogenic coating. == Structure and properties == Zotarolimus is an analog made by substituting a tetrazole ring in place of the native hydroxyl group at position 42 in rapamycin that is isolated and purified as a natural product from fermentation. This site of modification was found to be the most tolerant position to introduce novel structural changes without impairing biologic activity. The compound is extremely lipophilic, with a very high octanol-water partition coefficient, and therefore has limited water solubility. These properties are highly advantageous for designing a drug-loaded stent containing zotarolimus in order to obtain a slow sustained release of drug from the stent directly into the wall of coronary vessels. The poor water solubility prevents rapid release into the circulation, since elution of drug from the stent will be partly dissolution rate-limited. The slow rate of release and subsequent diffusion of the molecule facilitates the maintenance of therapeutic drug levels eluting from the stent. In addition, its lipophilic character favors crossing cell membranes to inhibit neointimal proliferation of target tissue. The octanol-water partition coefficients of a number of compounds, recently obtained in a comparative study, indicate that zotarolimus is the most lipophilic of all DES drugs == Restenosis == Zotarolimus is used to counteract restenosis. Restenosis is typically described by clinical trials in a binary approach, otherwise known as ""binary restenosis"" or just ""binary stenosis."" Binary restenosis is defined as a >50% stenosis in the vessel diameter (diameter stenosis), or >50% loss of the acute luminal gain, also known as ""late loss"" following the ""acute gain"" in lumen diameter after stenting. The term ""binary"" means that patients are placed in 2 groups, those who have >50% stenosis, and those who have <50% stenosis. An occlusion, or the blocking of all blood flow through a vessel, is considered 100% stenosis. Previously, restenosis was thought to arise due to the development of neointimal thickening as a result of smooth muscle stimulation. However, it is now thought the blood vessel's dilated segment shrinking is the mechanism. This explains why stenting, which increases the luminal area, is so effective in decreasing the occurrence of restenosis. Vessel restenosis is typically detected by angiography, but can also be detected by duplex ultrasound and other imaging techniques. == Restenosis prevention == The major advancement in restenosis prevention is the use of stents. The Stent Restenosis Study (STRESS) indicated that stents lower restenosis incidence to 32% compared to other medical techniques which combine to only lower it to 42%. == Physiological effects == The key biologic event associated with the restenotic process is clearly the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in response to the expansion of a foreign body against the vessel wall. This proliferative response is initiated by the early expression of growth factors such as PDGF isoforms, bFGF, thrombin, which bind to cellular receptors. However, the key to understanding the mechanism by which compounds like zotarolimus inhibit cell proliferation is based on events which occur downstream of this growth factor binding. The signal transduction events which culminate in cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase are initiated as a result of ligand binding to an immunophilin known as FK binding protein-12. The FK designation was based on early studies conducted with tacrolimus, formerly known as FK-506, which binds this cytoplasmic protein with high affinity. Subsequent investigations showed that rapamycin also binds to this intracellular target, forming an FKBP12–rapamycin complex which is not in itself inhibitory, but does have the capacity to block an integral protein kinase known as target of rapamycin (TOR). TOR was first discovered in yeast and later identified in eukaryotic cells, where it was designated as mTOR, the mammalian target of rapamycin. The importance of mTOR is based on its ability to phosphorylate a number of key proteins, including those associated with protein synthesis (p70s6kinase) and initiation of translation (4E-BP1). Of particular significance is the role that mTOR plays in the regulation of p27kip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases such as cdk2. The binding of agents like rapamycin and zotarolimus to mTOR is thought to block mTOR's crucial role in these cellular events, resulting in arrest of the cell cycle, and ultimately, cell proliferation. == References == == External links == LC labs product page with data & refs",Zotarolimus,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.0011100899428129196), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5760456323623657), (' INDUSTR', -5.200166469876422e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0008715168805792928), ('ICAL', -3.2186455882765586e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16024035215377808)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/medtronic-inc-receives-fda-approval-for-endeavor-r-zotarolimus-eluting-coronary-stent-system?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=162, start_index=9, title='Medtronic, Inc.

It reduces the accumulation of intracellular sorbitol which is believed to be the cause of diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy It is well tolerated, with the most commonly reported adverse effects being gastrointestinal issues such as nausea and vomiting, as well as increases in certain liver enzymes. Chemically, epalrestat is unusual in that it is a drug that contains a rhodanine group. Aldose reductase is the key enzyme in the polyol pathway whose enhanced activity is the basis of diabetic neuropathy. Aldose reductase inhibitors (ARI) target this enzyme. Out of the many ARIs developed, ranirestat and fidarestat are in the trial stage. Others have been discarded due to unacceptable adverse effects or weak efficacy. Epalrestat is the only ARI commercially available. It is easily absorbed into the neural tissue and inhibits the enzyme with minimum side effects. == Evidence == It has been demonstrated in animal experiments that there is an improvement in sorbitol levels and Na+/K+ ATPase activity leading to improved nerve conduction velocity. Diabetic rats treated with epalrestat showed improvement in morphological abnormalities of nerves. In a placebo controlled double blind trial of 196 patients, it was shown that Epalrestat in a dose of 150 mg/day improved the effects of diabetic neuropathy like upper limb spontaneous pain, motor nerve conduction velocity, thresholds of vibratory sensation and autonomic nerve function as compared to a placebo. These effects were significantly better in those with poorer control of diabetes.

We used an isolated organ bath preparation for mouse uterine horns and a primary culture of mouse myometrial smooth muscle cells to analyze the cellular mechanisms involved in the contractile action of this drug in the myometrium. Ethodin at a concentration of 10 microM and Compound 48/80 (1 microg/ml) evoked contractions of uterine horns in an isolated organ bath preparation. Uterine contractile responses showed a transient increase in contractile tension that lasted 2 to 3 min. Tachyphylaxis was observed after four or five successive stimuli, which consisted in additions and washings of the drug at an interval of 10 min. The primary smooth muscle mouse myometrium cells contained a high proportion of relaxed cells that varied widely in length (5-160 microm). Cell lengths decreased in response to the application of serotonin (10 microM) and oxytocin (0.1 microM) but were not affected after the addition of ethodin (10 microM). However, the cells contracted after a purified fraction of mast cells that had been degranulated by the action of the drug ethodin, which was added to the culture medium. These results provide some evidence related to the mechanism of myometrial contractile action of ethodin and support the hypothesis that mast cells may be involved in the regulation of myometrium contractility. 1. Ethodin (Rivanol, 6,9-diamino-2-oxyethyl acridine lactate), has been described as an effective drug to induce uterine contractions similar to those in a physiologic labor in still-birth with uterine inertia.

It is also the sex pheromone in the wild silk moth (Bombyx mandarina). Discovered by Adolf Butenandt in 1959, it was the first pheromone to be characterized chemically. Minute quantities of this pheromone can be used per acre of land to confuse male insects about the location of their female partners. It can thus serve as a lure in traps to remove insects effectively without spraying crops with large amounts of pesticides. Butenandt named the substance after the moth's Latin name Bombyx mori. In vivo it appears that bombykol is the natural ligand for a pheromone binding protein, BmorPBP, which escorts the pheromone to the pheromone receptor. == Biosynthesis == Bombykol is known to be derived from acetyl-CoA via the C-16 fatty acyl palmitoyl-CoA. Palmitoyl-CoA is converted to bombykol in steps that involve desaturation and reductive modification of the carbonyl carbon. Compared to other Type I pheromones, bombykol biosynthesis does not need chain-shortening or any other kind of modification of the terminal hydroxyl group. A desaturase enzyme encoded by the gene Bmpgdesat1 (Desat1), produces the monoene (11Z)-hexadecenoyl-CoA as well as the diene (10E,12Z)-10,12-hexadecadienoyl-CoA. This desaturase is the only enzyme necessary to catalyze these two consecutive desaturation steps. The bombykol acyl precursor (10E,12Z)-10,12-hexadecadienoate is primarily found as a triacylglycerol ester in the cytoplasmic lipid droplets of pheromone gland cells of the moth. And when the adult females emerge from their pupae, the neurohormone PBAN (pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide) start signaling events that help control the lipolysis of the stored triacylglycerols, releasing (10E,12Z)-10,12-hexadecadienoate for its final reductive modification. The mechanism of the lipolytic release of (10E,12Z)-10,12-hexadecadienoate from triacylglycerols is not completely known but the candidate lipase-encoding genes have been identified. == References ==",Bombykol,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.011050650849938393)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.313965380191803), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -3.6954811548639555e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07896961271762848)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombykol,https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/b/bombykol.html,https://commonchemistry.cas.org/detail?cas_rn=765-17-3 ', [])"
1297,"('Erythorbic acid', 'Isoascorbic acid', 'Araboascorbic acid', 'Isovitamin c', 'Erycorbin')","Food, Medical","Erythorbic acid (isoascorbic acid, D-araboascorbic acid) is a stereoisomer (C5 epimer) of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). It is synthesized by a reaction between methyl 2-keto-D-gluconate and sodium methoxide. It can also be synthesized from sucrose or by strains of Penicillium that have been selected for this feature. It is denoted by E number E315, and is widely used as an antioxidant in processed foods. == Health effects == Clinical trials have been conducted to investigate aspects of the nutritional value of erythorbic acid. One such trial investigated the effects of erythorbic acid on vitamin C metabolism in young women; no effect on vitamin C uptake or clearance from the body was found. A later study found that erythorbic acid is a potent enhancer of nonheme-iron absorption, just like ascorbate. This is thought to be due to it exerting the same iron-reducing and iron-chelating activity as ascorbic acid. Neither of these reactions is mediated by an enzyme, which would confer some chiral selectivity. It is twice as effective as ascorbic acid in enhancing non-heme iron absorption. Americans are estimated to ingest 200 mg of erythorbic acid per day, making it a very important factor in understanding iron absorption. == Uses == Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the use of sulfites as a preservative in foods intended to be eaten fresh (such as salad bar ingredients), the use of erythorbic acid as a food preservative has increased. It is also used as a preservative in cured meats and frozen vegetables. Much like ascorbic acid, it increases nitrosylation of the central iron atom of muscle myoglobin, resulting in the formation of reddish-brown nitrosomyoglobin and the characteristic pink color of nitrosohemochrome or nitrosyl-heme upon cooking. Again like ascorbic acid, it reduces the formation of nitrosamines. == History == It was first synthesized in 1933 by the German chemists Kurt Maurer and Bruno Schiedt. == Production == Erythorbic acid is very easily produced by fermentation, being obtainable in just one step compared to ascorbic acid's two. A number of Penicillium naturally produce this chemical from glucose. This is the original process developed in the 1960s, but it has low volumetric efficiency and glucose yield compared to the modern method. Today the industrial process is quite similar to the Reichstein process used for ascorbic acid, only chirally flipped. Microbial fermentation first produces a 2-keto-sugar acid, e.g. by Pseudomonas fluorescens AR4 converting glucose to 2-keto-D-gluconate. Then chemical rearrangement produces the product. == Economics == Like ascorbic acid, the production of erythorbic acid is concentrated in China. Its price is less volatile than that of ascorbic acid, making it an attractive alternative in non-nutritive uses in times of high ascorbic acid prices. == Related compounds == The structurally similar C5 sugar acid, D-erythroascorbic acid, is made by baker's yeast and other fungi, acting as an antioxidant in their own cells.

As a therapy, it is used to prevent and treat scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissue, the formation of collagen, and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters. It is required for the functioning of several enzymes and is important for immune system function. It also functions as an antioxidant. Vitamin C may be taken by mouth or by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Various health claims exist on the basis that moderate vitamin C deficiency increases disease risk, such as for the common cold, cancer or COVID-19. There are also claims of benefits from vitamin C supplementation in excess of the recommended dietary intake for people who are not considered vitamin C deficient. Vitamin C is generally well tolerated. Large doses may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, trouble sleeping, and flushing of the skin. The United States Institute of Medicine recommends against consuming large amounts.: 155–165 Most animals are able to synthesize their own vitamin C. However, apes (including humans) and monkeys (but not all primates), most bats, most fish, some rodents, and certain other animals must acquire it from dietary sources because a gene for a synthesis enzyme has mutations that render it dysfunctional.

Partly for its discovery, Albert Szent-Györgyi was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. == Chemistry == The name ""vitamin C"" always refers to the l-enantiomer of ascorbic acid and its oxidized form, dehydroascorbate (DHA). Therefore, unless written otherwise, ""ascorbate"" and ""ascorbic acid"" refer in the nutritional literature to l-ascorbate and l-ascorbic acid respectively. Ascorbic acid is a weak sugar acid structurally related to glucose. In biological systems, ascorbic acid can be found only at low pH, but in solutions above pH 5 it is predominantly found in the ionized form, ascorbate. Many analytical methods have been developed for ascorbic acid detection. For example, vitamin C content of a food sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring the volume of the sample required to decolorize a solution of dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) and then calibrating the results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin C. == Deficiency == Plasma vitamin C is the most widely applied test for vitamin C status. Adequate levels are defined as near 50 μmol/L. Hypovitaminosis of vitamin C is defined as less than 23 μmol/L, and deficiency as less than 11.4 μmol/L. For people 20 years of age or above, data from the US 2017–18 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed mean serum concentrations of 53.4 μmol/L. The percent of people reported as deficient was 5.9%. Globally, vitamin C deficiency is common in low and middle-income countries, and not uncommon in high income countries. In the latter, prevalence is higher in males than in females. Plasma levels are considered saturated at about 65 μmol/L, achieved by intakes of 100 to 200 mg/day, which are well above the recommended intakes. Even higher oral intake does not further raise plasma nor tissue concentrations because absorption efficiency decreases and any excess that is absorbed is excreted in urine. === Diagnostic testing === Vitamin C content in plasma is used to determine vitamin status. For research purposes, concentrations can be assessed in leukocytes and tissues, which are normally maintained at an order of magnitude higher than in plasma via an energy-dependent transport system, depleted slower than plasma concentrations during dietary deficiency and restored faster during dietary repletion,: 103–109 but these analysis are difficult to measure, and hence not part of standard diagnostic testing. == Diet == === Recommended consumption === Recommendations for vitamin C intake by adults have been set by various national agencies: 40 mg/day: India National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad 45 mg/day or 300 mg/week: the World Health Organization 80 mg/day: the European Commission Council on nutrition labeling 90 mg/day (males) and 75 mg/day (females): Health Canada 2007 90 mg/day (males) and 75 mg/day (females): United States National Academy of Sciences: 134–152 100 mg/day: Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition 110 mg/day (males) and 95 mg/day (females): European Food Safety Authority In 2000, the chapter on Vitamin C in the North American Dietary Reference Intake was updated to give the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) as 90 milligrams per day for adult men, 75 mg/day for adult women, and setting a Tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults of 2,000 mg/day.: 134–152 The table (right) shows RDAs for the United States and Canada for children, and for pregnant and lactating women,: 134–152 as well as the ULs for adults. For the European Union, the EFSA set higher recommendations for adults, and also for children: 20 mg/day for ages 1–3, 30 mg/day for ages 4–6, 45 mg/day for ages 7–10, 70 mg/day for ages 11–14, 100 mg/day for males ages 15–17, 90 mg/day for females ages 15–17. For pregnancy 100 mg/day; for lactation 155 mg/day. Cigarette smokers and people exposed to secondhand smoke have lower serum vitamin C levels than nonsmokers. The thinking is that inhalation of smoke causes oxidative damage, depleting this antioxidant vitamin.: 152–153 The US Institute of Medicine estimated that smokers need 35 mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers, but did not formally establish a higher RDA for smokers.: 152–153 The US National Center for Health Statistics conducts biannual National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. Some results are reported as What We Eat In America. The 2013–2014 survey reported that for adults ages 20 years and older, men consumed on average 83.3 mg/d and women 75.1 mg/d. This means that half the women and more than half the men are not consuming the RDA for vitamin C. The same survey stated that about 30% of adults reported they consumed a vitamin C dietary supplement or a multi-vitamin/mineral supplement that included vitamin C, and that for these people total consumption was between 300 and 400 mg/d. ==== Tolerable upper intake level ==== In 2000, the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences set a Tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults of 2,000 mg/day. The amount was chosen because human trials had reported diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances at intakes of greater than 3,000 mg/day. This was the Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL), meaning that other adverse effects were observed at even higher intakes. ULs are progressively lower for younger and younger children.: 155–165 In 2006, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also pointed out the disturbances at that dose level, but reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for vitamin C, as did the Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition in 2010. === Food labeling === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For vitamin C labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 60 mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 90 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. European Union regulations require that labels declare energy, protein, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, sugars, and salt. Voluntary nutrients may be shown if present in significant amounts. Instead of Daily Values, amounts are shown as percent of Reference Intakes (RIs). For vitamin C, 100% RI was set at 80 mg in 2011. == Sources == Although also present in other plant-derived foods, the richest natural sources of vitamin C are fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C is the most widely taken dietary supplement. === Plant sources === The following table is approximate and shows the relative abundance in different raw plant sources. The amount is given in milligrams per 100 grams of the edible portion of the fruit or vegetable: === Animal sources === Compared to plant sources, animal-sourced foods do not provide so great an amount of vitamin C, and what there is is largely destroyed by the heat used when it is cooked. For example, raw chicken liver contains 17.9 mg/100 g, but fried, the content is reduced to 2.7 mg/100 g. Vitamin C is present in human breast milk at 5.0 mg/100 g. Cow's milk contains 1.0 mg/100 g, but the heat of pasteurization destroys it. === Food preparation === Vitamin C chemically decomposes under certain conditions, many of which may occur during the cooking of food. Vitamin C concentrations in various food substances decrease with time in proportion to the temperature at which they are stored. Cooking can reduce the vitamin C content of vegetables by around 60%, possibly due to increased enzymatic destruction. Longer cooking times may add to this effect. Another cause of vitamin C loss from food is leaching, which transfers vitamin C to the cooking water, which is decanted and not consumed. === Supplements === Vitamin C dietary supplements are available as tablets, capsules, drink mix packets, in multi-vitamin/mineral formulations, in antioxidant formulations, and as crystalline powder. Vitamin C is also added to some fruit juices and juice drinks. Tablet and capsule content ranges from 25 mg to 1500 mg per serving. The most commonly used supplement compounds are ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate. Vitamin C molecules can also be bound to the fatty acid palmitate, creating ascorbyl palmitate, or else incorporated into liposomes. === Food fortification === Countries fortify foods with nutrients to address known deficiencies. While many countries mandate or have voluntary programs to fortify wheat flour, maize (corn) flour or rice with vitamins, none include vitamin C in those programs. As described in Vitamin C Fortification of Food Aid Commodities (1997), the United States provides rations to international food relief programs, later under the auspices of the Food for Peace Act and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. Vitamin C is added to corn-soy blend and wheat-soy blend products at 40 mg/100 grams. (along with minerals and other vitamins). Supplemental rations of these highly fortified, blended foods are provided to refugees and displaced persons in camps and to beneficiaries of development feeding programs that are targeted largely toward mothers and children. The report adds: ""The stability of vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is of concern because this is one of the most labile vitamins in foods. Its main loss during processing and storage is from oxidation, which is accelerated by light, oxygen, heat, increased pH, high moisture content (water activity), and the presence of copper or ferrous salts. To reduce oxidation, the vitamin C used in commodity fortification is coated with ethyl cellulose (2.5 percent). Oxidative losses also occur during food processing and preparation, and additional vitamin C may be lost if it dissolves into cooking liquid and is then discarded."" == Food preservation additive == Ascorbic acid and some of its salts and esters are common additives added to various foods, such as canned fruits, mostly to slow oxidation and enzymatic browning. It may be used as a flour treatment agent used in breadmaking. As food additives, they are assigned E numbers, with safety assessment and approval the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority. The relevant E numbers are: E300 ascorbic acid (approved for use as a food additive in the UK, US Canada, Australia and New Zealand) E301 sodium ascorbate (approved for use as a food additive in the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) E302 calcium ascorbate (approved for use as a food additive in the UK, US Canada, Australia and New Zealand) E303 potassium ascorbate (approved in Australia and New Zealand, but not in the UK, US or Canada) E304 fatty acid esters of ascorbic acid such as ascorbyl palmitate (approved for use as a food additive in the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) The stereoisomers of Vitamin C have a similar effect in food despite their lack of efficacy in human scurvy. They include erythorbic acid and its sodium salt (E315, E316). == Pharmacology == Pharmacodynamics is the study of how the drug – in this instance vitamin C – affects the organism, whereas pharmacokinetics is the study of how an organism affects the drug. === Pharmacodynamics === Pharmacodynamics includes enzymes for which vitamin C is a cofactor, with function potentially compromised in a deficiency state, and any enzyme cofactor or other physiological function affected by administration of vitamin C, orally or injected, in excess of normal requirements. At normal physiological concentrations, vitamin C serves as an enzyme substrate or cofactor and an electron donor antioxidant. The enzymatic functions include the synthesis of collagen, carnitine, and neurotransmitters; the synthesis and catabolism of tyrosine; and the metabolism of microsomes. In nonenzymatic functions it acts as a reducing agent, donating electrons to oxidized molecules and preventing oxidation in order to keep iron and copper atoms in their reduced states. At non-physiological concentrations achieved by intravenous dosing, vitamin C may function as a pro-oxidant, with therapeutic toxicity against cancer cells. Vitamin C functions as a cofactor for the following enzymes: Three groups of enzymes (prolyl-3-hydroxylases, prolyl-4-hydroxylases, and lysyl hydroxylases) that are required for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine in the synthesis of collagen. These reactions add hydroxyl groups to the amino acids proline or lysine in the collagen molecule via prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, both requiring vitamin C as a cofactor. The role of vitamin C as a cofactor is to oxidize prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase from Fe2+ to Fe3+ and to reduce it from Fe3+ to Fe2+. Hydroxylation allows the collagen molecule to assume its triple helix structure, and thus vitamin C is essential to the development and maintenance of scar tissue, blood vessels, and cartilage. Two enzymes (ε-N-trimethyl-L-lysine hydroxylase and γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase) are necessary for synthesis of carnitine. Carnitine is essential for the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for ATP generation. Hypoxia-inducible factor-proline dioxygenase enzymes (isoforms: EGLN1, EGLN2, and EGLN3) allows cells to respond physiologically to low concentrations of oxygen. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase participates in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine from dopamine. Peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase amidates peptide hormones by removing the glyoxylate residue from their c-terminal glycine residues. This increases peptide hormone stability and activity. As an antioxidant, ascorbate scavenges reactive oxygen and nitrogen compounds, thus neutralizing the potential tissue damage of these free radical compounds. Dehydroascorbate, the oxidized form, is then recycled back to ascorbate by endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione.: 98–99 In the eye, ascorbate is thought to protect against photolytically generated free-radical damage; higher plasma ascorbate is associated with lower risk of cataracts. Ascorbate may also provide antioxidant protection indirectly by regenerating other biological antioxidants such as α-tocopherol back to an active state.: 98–99 In addition, ascorbate also functions as a non-enzymatic reducing agent for mixed-function oxidases in the microsomal drug-metabolizing system that inactivates a wide variety of substrates such as drugs and environmental carcinogens.: 98–99 === Pharmacokinetics === Ascorbic acid is absorbed in the body by both active transport and passive diffusion. Approximately 70%–90% of vitamin C is active-transport absorbed when intakes of 30–180 mg/day from a combination of food sources and moderate-dose dietary supplements such as a multi-vitamin/mineral product are consumed. However, when large amounts are consumed, such as a vitamin C dietary supplement, the active transport system becomes saturated, and while the total amount being absorbed continues to increase with dose, absorption efficiency falls to less than 50%. Active transport is managed by Sodium-Ascorbate Co-Transporter proteins (SVCTs) and Hexose Transporter proteins (GLUTs). SVCT1 and SVCT2 import ascorbate across plasma membranes. The Hexose Transporter proteins GLUT1, GLUT3 and GLUT4 transfer only the oxydized dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) form of vitamin C. The amount of DHA found in plasma and tissues under normal conditions is low, as cells rapidly reduce DHA to ascorbate. SVCTs are the predominant system for vitamin C transport within the body. In both vitamin C synthesizers (example: rat) and non-synthesizers (example: human) cells maintain ascorbic acid concentrations much higher than the approximately 50 micromoles/liter (μmol/L) found in plasma. For example, the ascorbic acid content of pituitary and adrenal glands can exceed 2,000 μmol/L, and muscle is at 200–300 μmol/L. The known coenzymatic functions of ascorbic acid do not require such high concentrations, so there may be other, as yet unknown functions. A consequence of all this high concentration organ content is that plasma vitamin C is not a good indicator of whole-body status, and people may vary in the amount of time needed to show symptoms of deficiency when consuming a diet very low in vitamin C. Excretion (via urine) is as ascorbic acid and metabolites. The fraction that is excreted as unmetabolized ascorbic acid increases as intake increases. In addition, ascorbic acid converts (reversibly) to DHA and from that compound non-reversibly to 2,3-diketogulonate and then oxalate. These three metabolites are also excreted via urine. During times of low dietary intake, vitamin C is reabsorbed by the kidneys rather than excreted. This salvage process delays onset of deficiency. Humans are better than guinea pigs at converting DHA back to ascorbate, and thus take much longer to become vitamin C deficient. == Synthesis == Most animals and plants are able to synthesize vitamin C through a sequence of enzyme-driven steps, which convert monosaccharides to vitamin C. Yeasts do not make l-ascorbic acid but rather its stereoisomer, erythorbic acid. In plants, synthesis is accomplished through the conversion of mannose or galactose to ascorbic acid. In animals, the starting material is glucose. In some species that synthesize ascorbate in the liver (including mammals and perching birds), the glucose is extracted from glycogen; ascorbate synthesis is a glycogenolysis-dependent process. In humans and in animals that cannot synthesize vitamin C, the enzyme l-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), which catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis, is highly mutated and non-functional. === Animal synthesis === There is some information on serum vitamin C concentrations maintained in animal species that are able to synthesize vitamin C. One study of several breeds of dogs reported an average of 35.9 μmol/L. A report on goats, sheep and cattle reported ranges of 100–110, 265–270 and 160–350 μmol/L, respectively. The biosynthesis of ascorbic acid in vertebrates starts with the formation of UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucuronic acid is formed when UDP-glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD+ as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a UMP and glucuronokinase, with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to d-glucuronic acid. The aldehyde group of this compound is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme glucuronate reductase and the cofactor NADPH, yielding l-gulonic acid. This is followed by lactone formation—utilizing the hydrolase gluconolactonase—between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. l-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other Haplorrhini primates; see Unitary pseudogenes) and the cofactor FAD+. This reaction produces 2-oxogulonolactone (2-keto-gulonolactone), which spontaneously undergoes enolization to form ascorbic acid. Reptiles and older orders of birds make ascorbic acid in their kidneys. Recent orders of birds and most mammals make ascorbic acid in their liver. ==== Non-synthesizers ==== Some mammals have lost the ability to synthesize vitamin C, including simians and tarsiers, which together make up one of two major primate suborders, Haplorhini. This group includes humans. The other more primitive primates (Strepsirrhini) have the ability to make vitamin C. Synthesis does not occur in some species in the rodent family Caviidae, which includes guinea pigs and capybaras, but does occur in other rodents, including rats and mice. Synthesis does not occur in most bat species, but there are at least two species, frugivorous bat Rousettus leschenaultii and insectivorous bat Hipposideros armiger, that retain (or regained) their ability of vitamin C production. A number of species of passerine birds also do not synthesize, but not all of them, and those that do not are not clearly related; it has been proposed that the ability was lost separately a number of times in birds. In particular, the ability to synthesize vitamin C is presumed to have been lost and then later re-acquired in at least two cases. The ability to synthesize vitamin C has also been lost in about 96% of extant fish (the teleosts). On a milligram consumed per kilogram of body weight basis, simian non-synthesizer species consume the vitamin in amounts 10 to 20 times higher than what is recommended by governments for humans. This discrepancy constituted some of the basis of the controversy on human recommended dietary allowances being set too low. However, simian consumption does not indicate simian requirements. Merck's veterinary manual states that daily intake of vitamin C at 3–6 mg/kg prevents scurvy in non-human primates. By way of comparison, across several countries, the recommended dietary intake for adult humans is in the range of 1–2 mg/kg. ==== Evolution of animal synthesis ==== Ascorbic acid is a common enzymatic cofactor in mammals used in the synthesis of collagen, as well as a powerful reducing agent capable of rapidly scavenging a number of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Given that ascorbate has these important functions, it is surprising that the ability to synthesize this molecule has not always been conserved. In fact, anthropoid primates, Cavia porcellus (guinea pigs), teleost fishes, most bats, and some passerine birds have all independently lost the ability to internally synthesize vitamin C in either the kidney or the liver. In all of the cases where genomic analysis was done on an ascorbic acid auxotroph, the origin of the change was found to be a result of loss-of-function mutations in the gene that encodes L-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of the ascorbic acid pathway outlined above. One explanation for the repeated loss of the ability to synthesize vitamin C is that it was the result of genetic drift; assuming that the diet was rich in vitamin C, natural selection would not act to preserve it. In the case of the simians, it is thought that the loss of the ability to make vitamin C may have occurred much farther back in evolutionary history than the emergence of humans or even apes, since it evidently occurred soon after the appearance of the first primates, yet sometime after the split of early primates into the two major suborders Haplorrhini (which cannot make vitamin C) and its sister suborder of non-tarsier prosimians, the Strepsirrhini (""wet-nosed"" primates), which retained the ability to make vitamin C. According to molecular clock dating, these two suborder primate branches parted ways about 63 to 60 million years ago. Approximately three to five million years later (58 million years ago), only a short time afterward from an evolutionary perspective, the infraorder Tarsiiformes, whose only remaining family is that of the tarsier (Tarsiidae), branched off from the other haplorrhines. Since tarsiers also cannot make vitamin C, this implies the mutation had already occurred, and thus must have occurred between these two marker points (63 to 58 million years ago). It has also been noted that the loss of the ability to synthesize ascorbate strikingly parallels the inability to break down uric acid, also a characteristic of primates. Uric acid and ascorbate are both strong reducing agents. This has led to the suggestion that, in higher primates, uric acid has taken over some of the functions of ascorbate. === Plant synthesis === There are many different biosynthesis pathways to ascorbic acid in plants. Most proceed through products of glycolysis and other metabolic pathways. For example, one pathway utilizes plant cell wall polymers. The principal plant ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathway seems to be via l-galactose. The enzyme l-galactose dehydrogenase catalyzes the overall oxidation to the lactone and isomerization of the lactone to the C4-hydroxyl group, resulting in l-galactono-1,4-lactone. l-Galactono-1,4-lactone then reacts with the mitochondrial flavoenzyme l-galactonolactone dehydrogenase to produce ascorbic acid. l-Ascorbic acid has a negative feedback on l-galactose dehydrogenase in spinach. Ascorbic acid efflux by embryos of dicot plants is a well-established mechanism of iron reduction and a step obligatory for iron uptake. All plants synthesize ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid functions as a cofactor for enzymes involved in photosynthesis, synthesis of plant hormones, as an antioxidant and regenerator of other antioxidants. Plants use multiple pathways to synthesize vitamin C. The major pathway starts with glucose, fructose or mannose (all simple sugars) and proceeds to l-galactose, l-galactonolactone and ascorbic acid. This biosynthesis is regulated following a diurnal rhythm. Enzyme expression peaks in the morning to supporting biosynthesis for when mid-day sunlight intensity demands high ascorbic acid concentrations. Minor pathways may be specific to certain parts of plants; these can be either identical to the vertebrate pathway (including the GLO enzyme), or start with inositol and get to ascorbic acid via l-galactonic acid to l-galactonolactone. === Industrial synthesis === Vitamin C can be produced from glucose by two main routes. The no longer utilized Reichstein process, developed in the 1930s, used a single fermentation followed by a purely chemical route. The modern two-step fermentation process, originally developed in China in the 1960s, uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages. The Reichstein process and the modern two-step fermentation processes both use glucose as the starting material, convert that to sorbitol, and then to sorbose using fermentation. The two-step fermentation process then converts sorbose to 2-keto-l-gulonic acid (KGA) through another fermentation step, avoiding an extra intermediate. Both processes yield approximately 60% vitamin C from the glucose starting point. Researchers are exploring means for one-step fermentation. China produces about 70% of the global vitamin C market. The rest is split among European Union, India and North America. The global market is expected to exceed 141 thousand metric tons in 2024. Cost per metric ton (1000 kg) in US dollars was $2,220 in Shanghai, $2,850 in Hamburg and $3,490 in the US. == Health effects == Vitamin C has a definitive role in treating scurvy, which is a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency. Beyond that, a role for vitamin C as prevention or treatment for various diseases is disputed, with reviews often reporting conflicting results. No effect of vitamin C supplementation reported for overall mortality. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and on the World Health Organization's Model Forumulary. In 2022, it was the 226th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. === Scurvy === Scurvy is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. Without this vitamin, collagen made by the body is too unstable to perform its function and several other enzymes in the body do not operate correctly. Early symptoms are malaise and lethargy, progressing to shortness of breath, bone pain and susceptibility to bruising. As the disease progressed, it is characterized by spots on and bleeding under the skin and bleeding gums. The skin lesions are most abundant on the thighs and legs. A person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized. In advanced scurvy there is fever, old wounds may become open and suppurating, loss of teeth, convulsions and, eventually, death. Until quite late in the disease the damage is reversible, as healthy collagen replaces the defective collagen with vitamin C repletion. Notable human dietary studies of experimentally induced scurvy were conducted on conscientious objectors during World War II in Britain and on Iowa state prisoners in the late 1960s to the 1980s. Men in the prison study developed the first signs of scurvy about four weeks after starting the vitamin C-free diet, whereas in the earlier British study, six to eight months were required, possibly due to the pre-loading of this group with a 70 mg/day supplement for six weeks before the scorbutic diet was fed. Men in both studies had blood levels of ascorbic acid too low to be accurately measured by the time they developed signs of scurvy. These studies both reported that all obvious symptoms of scurvy could be completely reversed by supplementation of only 10 mg a day. Treatment of scurvy can be with vitamin C-containing foods or dietary supplements or injection.: 101 === Sepsis === People in sepsis may have micronutrient deficiencies, including low levels of vitamin C. An intravenous intake of doses much higher than the RDA, such as 3 g/d or more, appears to be needed to maintain normal plasma concentrations in people with sepsis, as the body's demand for vitamin C may increase significantly due to the heightened inflammatory response and oxidative stress. Sepsis mortality may be reduced with administration of intravenous vitamin C. === Common cold === Research on vitamin C in the common cold has been divided into effects on prevention, duration, and severity. Oral intakes of more than 200 mg/day taken on a regular basis was not effective in prevention of the common cold. Restricting analysis to trials that used at least 1000 mg/day also saw no prevention benefit. However, taking a vitamin C supplement on a regular basis did reduce the average duration of the illness by 8% in adults and 14% in children, and also reduced the severity of colds. Vitamin C taken on a regular basis reduced the duration of severe symptoms but had no effect on the duration of mild symptoms. Therapeutic use, meaning that the vitamin was not started unless people started to feel the beginnings of a cold, had no effect on the duration or severity of the illness. Vitamin C distributes readily in high concentrations into immune cells, promotes natural killer cell activities, promotes lymphocyte proliferation, and is depleted quickly during infections, effects suggesting a prominent role in immune system function. The European Food Safety Authority concluded there is a cause and effect relationship between the dietary intake of vitamin C and functioning of a normal immune system in adults and in children under three years of age. === COVID-19 === During March through July 2020, vitamin C was the subject of more US FDA warning letters than any other ingredient for claims for prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. In April 2021, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines stated that ""there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin C for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19."" In an update posted December 2022, the NIH position was unchanged: There is insufficient evidence for the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin C for the treatment of COVID-19 in nonhospitalized patients. There is insufficient evidence for the Panel to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin C for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. For people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 there are reports of a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause, in-hospital mortality with the administration of vitamin C relative to no vitamin C. There were no significant differences in ventilation incidence, hospitalization duration or length of intensive care unit stay between the two groups. The majority of the trials incorporated into these meta-analyses used intravenous administration of the vitamin. Acute kidney injury was lower in people treated with vitamin C treatment. There were no differences in the frequency of other adverse events due to the vitamin. The conclusion was that further large-scale studies are needed to affirm its mortality benefits before issuing updated guidelines and recommendations. === Cancer === Higher vitamin C intake appears to reduce the risk for lung cancer. There is no evidence that vitamin C supplementation reduces the risk of prostate cancer, colorectal cancer or breast cancer. === Cardiovascular disease === There is no evidence that vitamin C supplementation decreases the risk cardiovascular disease, although there may be an association between higher circulating vitamin C levels or dietary vitamin C and a lower risk of stroke. There is a positive effect of vitamin C on endothelial dysfunction when taken at doses greater than 500 mg per day. (The endothelium is a layer of cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels.) === Blood pressure === Serum vitamin C was reported to be 15.13 μmol/L lower in people with hypertension compared to normotensives. The vitamin was inversely associated with both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Oral supplementation of the vitamin resulted in a very modest but statistically significant decrease in SBP in people with hypertension. The proposed explanation is that vitamin C increases intracellular concentrations of tetrahydrobiopterin, an endothelial nitric oxide synthase cofactor that promotes the production of nitric oxide, which is a potent vasodilator. Vitamin C supplementation might also reverse the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine 1, and there is also evidence cited that vitamin C directly enhances the biological activity of nitric oxide === Type 2 diabetes === There are contradictory reviews. From one, vitamin C supplementation cannot be recommended for management of type 2 diabetes. However, another reported that supplementation with high doses of vitamin C can decrease blood glucose, insulin and hemoglobin A1c. === Iron deficiency === One of the causes of iron-deficiency anemia is reduced absorption of iron. Iron absorption can be enhanced through ingestion of vitamin C alongside iron-containing food or supplements. Vitamin C helps to keep iron in the reduced ferrous state, which is more soluble and more easily absorbed. It also chelates iron into a soluble complex. It specifically helps the absorption of non-heme iron, which is found in non-meat sources and absorbed via DMT1. === Alzheimer's disease === Lower plasma vitamin C concentrations were reported in people with Alzheimer's disease. Reviews do not present reporting on supplement intervention clinical trials. === Eye health === Higher dietary intake of vitamin C was associated with lower risk of age-related cataracts. Vitamin C supplementation did not prevent age-related macular degeneration. === Periodontal disease === Low intake and low serum concentration were associated with greater progression of periodontal disease. == Adverse effects == Oral intake of dietary supplements vitamin C in excess of requirements is poorly absorbed, and excess amounts in the blood are rapidly excreted in the urine, so it exhibits low acute toxicity. More than two to three grams, consumed orally, may cause nausea, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. These effects are attributed to the osmotic effect of unabsorbed vitamin C passing through the intestine.: 156 In theory, high vitamin C intake may cause excessive absorption of iron. A summary of reviews of supplementation in healthy subjects did not report this problem, but left as untested the possibility that individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis might be adversely affected.: 158 There is a longstanding belief among the mainstream medical community that vitamin C increases risk of kidney stones. ""Reports of kidney stone formation associated with excess ascorbic acid intake are limited to individuals with renal disease"".: 156–157 A 2003 review stated that ""data from epidemiological studies do not support an association between excess ascorbic acid intake and kidney stone formation in apparently healthy individuals"", although one large, multi-year trial published in 2013 did report a nearly two-fold increase in kidney stones in men who regularly consumed a vitamin C supplement. There is extensive research on the purported benefits of intravenous vitamin C for treatment of sepsis, severe COVID-19 and cancer. Reviews list trials with doses as high as 24 grams per day. Concerns about possible adverse effects are that intravenous high-dose vitamin C leads to a supraphysiological level of vitamin C followed by oxidative degradation to dehydroascorbic acid and hence to oxalate, increasing the risk of oxalate kidney stones and oxalate nephropathy. The risk may be higher in people with renal impairment, as kidneys efficiently excrete excess vitamin C. Second, treatment with high dose vitamin C should be avoided in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency as it can lead to acute hemolysis. Third, treatment might interfere with the accuracy of glucometer measurement of blood glucose levels, as both vitamin C and glucose have similar molecular structure, which could lead to false high blood glucose readings. Despite all these concerns, meta-analyses of patients in intensive care for sepsis, septic shock, COVID-19 and other acute conditions reported no increase in new-onset kidney stones, acute kidney injury or requirement for renal replacement therapy for patients receiving short-term, high-dose, intravenous vitamin C treatment. This suggests that intravenous vitamin C is safe under these short-term applications. == History == Scurvy was known to Hippocrates, described in book two of his Prorrheticorum and in his Liber de internis affectionibus, and cited by James Lind. Symptoms of scurvy were also described by Pliny the Elder: (i) Pliny. ""49"". Naturalis historiae. Vol. 3.; and (ii) Strabo, in Geographicorum, book 16, cited in the 1881 International Encyclopedia of Surgery. === Scurvy at sea === In the 1497 expedition of Vasco da Gama, the curative effects of citrus fruit were known. In the 1500s, Portuguese sailors put in to the island of Saint Helena to avail themselves of planted vegetable gardens and wild-growing fruit trees. Authorities occasionally recommended plant food to prevent scurvy during long sea voyages. John Woodall, the first surgeon to the British East India Company, recommended the preventive and curative use of lemon juice in his 1617 book, The Surgeon's Mate. In 1734, the Dutch writer Johann Bachstrom gave the firm opinion, ""scurvy is solely owing to a total abstinence from fresh vegetable food, and greens."" Scurvy had long been a principal killer of sailors during the long sea voyages. According to Jonathan Lamb, ""In 1499, Vasco da Gama lost 116 of his crew of 170; In 1520, Magellan lost 208 out of 230; ... all mainly to scurvy."" The first attempt to give scientific basis for the cause of this disease was by a ship's surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind. While at sea in May 1747, Lind provided some crew members with two oranges and one lemon per day, in addition to normal rations, while others continued on cider, vinegar, sulfuric acid or seawater, along with their normal rations, in one of the world's first controlled experiments. The results showed that citrus fruits prevented the disease. Lind published his work in 1753 in his Treatise on the Scurvy. Fresh fruit was expensive to keep on board, whereas boiling it down to juice allowed easy storage, but destroyed the vitamin (especially if it was boiled in copper kettles). It was 1796 before the British navy adopted lemon juice as standard issue at sea. In 1845, ships in the West Indies were provided with lime juice instead, and in 1860 lime juice was used throughout the Royal Navy, giving rise to the American use of the nickname ""limey"" for the British. Captain James Cook had previously demonstrated the advantages of carrying ""Sour krout"" on board by taking his crew on a 1772–75 Pacific Ocean voyage without losing any of his men to scurvy. For his report on his methods the British Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1776. The name antiscorbutic was used in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for foods known to prevent scurvy. These foods included lemons, limes, oranges, sauerkraut, cabbage, malt, and portable soup. In 1928, the Canadian Arctic anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson showed that the Inuit avoided scurvy on a diet largely of raw meat. Later studies on traditional food diets of the Yukon First Nations, Dene, Inuit, and Métis of Northern Canada showed that their daily intake of vitamin C averaged between 52 and 62 mg/day. === Discovery === Vitamin C was discovered in 1912, isolated in 1928 and synthesized in 1933, making it the first vitamin to be synthesized. Shortly thereafter Tadeus Reichstein succeeded in synthesizing the vitamin in bulk by what is now called the Reichstein process. This made possible the inexpensive mass-production of vitamin C. In 1934, Hoffmann–La Roche bought the Reichstein process patent, trademarked synthetic vitamin C under the brand name Redoxon, and began to market it as a dietary supplement. In 1907, a laboratory animal model which would help to identify the antiscorbutic factor was serendipitously discovered by the Norwegian physicians Axel Holst and Theodor Frølich, who when studying shipboard beriberi, fed guinea pigs their test diet of grains and flour and were surprised when scurvy resulted instead of beriberi. Unknown at that time, this species did not make its own vitamin C (being a caviomorph), whereas mice and rats do. In 1912, the Polish biochemist Casimir Funk developed the concept of vitamins. One of these was thought to be the anti-scorbutic factor. In 1928, this was referred to as ""water-soluble C"", although its chemical structure had not been determined. From 1928 to 1932, Albert Szent-Györgyi and Joseph L. Svirbely's Hungarian team, and Charles Glen King's American team, identified the anti-scorbutic factor. Szent-Györgyi isolated hexuronic acid from animal adrenal glands, and suspected it to be the antiscorbutic factor. In late 1931, Szent-Györgyi gave Svirbely the last of his adrenal-derived hexuronic acid with the suggestion that it might be the anti-scorbutic factor. By the spring of 1932, King's laboratory had proven this, but published the result without giving Szent-Györgyi credit for it. This led to a bitter dispute over priority. In 1933, Walter Norman Haworth chemically identified the vitamin as l-hexuronic acid, proving this by synthesis in 1933. Haworth and Szent-Györgyi proposed that L-hexuronic acid be named a-scorbic acid, and chemically l-ascorbic acid, in honor of its activity against scurvy. The term's etymology is from Latin, ""a-"" meaning away, or off from, while -scorbic is from Medieval Latin scorbuticus (pertaining to scurvy), cognate with Old Norse skyrbjugr, French scorbut, Dutch scheurbuik and Low German scharbock. Partly for this discovery, Szent-Györgyi was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize in Medicine, and Haworth shared that year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1957, J. J. Burns showed that some mammals are susceptible to scurvy as their liver does not produce the enzyme l-gulonolactone oxidase, the last of the chain of four enzymes that synthesize vitamin C. American biochemist Irwin Stone was the first to exploit vitamin C for its food preservative properties. He later developed the idea that humans possess a mutated form of the l-gulonolactone oxidase coding gene. Stone introduced Linus Pauling to the theory that humans needed to consume vitamin C in quantities far higher than what was considered a recommended daily intake in order to optimize health. In 2008, researchers discovered that in humans and other primates the red blood cells have evolved a mechanism to more efficiently utilize the vitamin C present in the body by recycling oxidized l-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) back into ascorbic acid for reuse by the body. The mechanism was not found to be present in mammals that synthesize their own vitamin C. === History of large dose therapies === Vitamin C megadosage is a term describing the consumption or injection of vitamin C in doses comparable to or higher than the amounts produced by the livers of mammals which are able to synthesize vitamin C. An argument for this, although not the actual term, was described in 1970 in an article by Linus Pauling. Briefly, his position was that for optimal health, humans should be consuming at least 2,300 mg/day to compensate for the inability to synthesize vitamin C. The recommendation also fell into the consumption range for gorillas — a non-synthesizing near-relative to humans. A second argument for high intake is that serum ascorbic acid concentrations increase as intake increases until it plateaus at about 190 to 200 micromoles per liter (μmol/L) once consumption exceeds 1,250 milligrams. As noted, government recommendations are a range of 40 to 110 mg/day and normal plasma is approximately 50 μmol/L, so ""normal"" is about 25% of what can be achieved when oral consumption is in the proposed megadose range. Pauling popularized the concept of high dose vitamin C as prevention and treatment of the common cold in 1970. A few years later he proposed that vitamin C would prevent cardiovascular disease, and that 10 grams/day, initially administered intravenously and thereafter orally, would cure late-stage cancer. Mega-dosing with ascorbic acid has other champions, among them chemist Irwin Stone and the controversial Matthias Rath and Patrick Holford, who both have been accused of making unsubstantiated treatment claims for treating cancer and HIV infection. The idea that large amounts of intravenous ascorbic acid can be used to treat late-stage cancer or ameliorate the toxicity of chemotherapy is — some forty years after Pauling's seminal paper — still considered unproven and still in need of high quality research. == Research directions == === Cancer research === There is research investigating whether high dose intravenous vitamin C administration as a co-treatment will suppress cancer stem cells, which are responsible for tumor recurrence, metastasis and chemoresistance. === Skin aging research === There is also ongoing research on topical application of vitamin C to prevent signs of skin aging. Human skin physiologically contains small amounts of vitamin C, which supports collagen synthesis, decreases collagen degradation, and assists in antioxidant protection against UV-induced photo-aging, including photocarcinogenesis. This knowledge is often used as a rationale for the marketing of vitamin C as a topical ""serum"" ingredient to prevent or treat facial skin aging, melasma (dark pigmented spots), and wrinkles; however, these claims are unsubstantiated and are not supported by research conducted so far; the supposed efficacy of topical treatment as opposed to oral intake is poorly understood. The purported mechanism on supposed benefit of topical vitamin C application to slow skin aging is that vitamin C functions as an antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals from sunlight exposure, air pollutants or normal metabolic processes. The clinical trial literature is characterized as insufficient to support health claims; one reason being put forward was that ""All the studies used vitamin C in combination with other ingredients or therapeutic mechanisms, thereby complicating any specific conclusions regarding the efficacy of vitamin C."" ==== Pneumonia ==== Further research is needed to determine if prophylactic vitamin C treatment is helpful for preventing or treating pneumonia. == Notes == == References == == External links ==",Ascoltin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.07916979491710663), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.08926659822463989), (',', -0.20146937668323517), (' PERSONAL', -0.03724312409758568), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.43498197197914124), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0487959086894989)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.306760805164231e-05)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1299,"('Darunavir', 'Prezista', 'Darunavirum', 'Darunavirum [inn-latin]', 'Derunavir')",Medical,"Darunavir (DRV), sold under the brand name Prezista among others, is an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It is often used with low doses of ritonavir or cobicistat to increase darunavir levels. It may be used for prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is taken by mouth once to twice a day. Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, rash and vomiting. Severe side effects include allergic reactions, liver problems, and skin rashes such as toxic epidermal necrolysis. While poorly studied in pregnancy it appears to be safe for the baby. It is of the protease inhibitor (PI) class and works by blocking HIV protease. Darunavir was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2006. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It is available in the fixed-dose combination medication darunavir/cobicistat (Prezcobix, Rezolsta), and in the fixed-dose combination medication darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Symtuza). == Medical uses == Darunavir is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults and children three years of age and older when co-administered with ritonavir, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Darunavir is an Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council (DHHS) recommended treatment option for adults and adolescents, regardless of whether they have received HIV treatment in the past. In a study of people that had never received HIV treatment, darunavir was as effective as lopinavir/ritonavir at 96 weeks with a once-daily dosing. It was approved by the FDA in October 2008, for people not previously treated for HIV. Darunavir does not cure HIV/AIDS. == Adverse effects == Darunavir is generally well tolerated by people. Rash is the most common side effect (7% of patients). Other common side effects are diarrhea (2.3%), headache (3.8%), abdominal pain (2.3%), constipation (2.3%), and vomiting (1.5%). Darunavir can also cause allergic reactions, and people allergic to ritonavir can also have a reaction to darunavir. High blood sugar, diabetes or worsening of diabetes, muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, and increased bleeding in people with hemophilia have been reported in patients taking protease inhibitor medicines like darunavir. Changes in body fat have been seen in some patients taking medicines for HIV, including loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen and other internal organs, breast enlargement, and fatty lumps on the back of the neck. The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known. === Drug interactions === Darunavir may interact with medications commonly taken by people with HIV/AIDS such as other antiretrovirals, and antacids such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists. St. John's wort may reduce the effectiveness of darunavir by increasing the breakdown of darunavir by the metabolic enzyme CYP3A. == Mechanism of action == Darunavir is a nonpeptidic inhibitor of protease (PR) that lodges itself in the active site of PR through a number of hydrogen bonds. It was developed to increase interactions with HIV-1 protease and to be more resistant against HIV-1 protease mutations. With a Kd (dissociation constant) of 4.5 x 10−12 M, darunavir has a much stronger interaction with PR and its dissociation constant is 1/100 to 1/1000 of other protease inhibitors. This strong interaction comes from increased hydrogen bonds between darunavir and the backbone of the PR active site (Figure 2). Darunavir's structure allows it to create more hydrogen bonds with the PR active site than most PIs that have been developed and approved by the FDA. Furthermore, the backbone of HIV-1 protease maintains its spatial conformation in the presence of mutations. Because darunavir interacts with this stable portion of the protease, the PR-PI interaction is less likely to be disrupted by a mutation. === Catalytic site === The chemical activity of the HIV-1 protease depends on two residues in the active site, Asp25 and Asp25', one from each copy of the homodimer. Darunavir interacts with these catalytic aspartates and the backbone of the active site through hydrogen bonds, specifically binding to residues Asp25, Asp25', Asp 29, Asp 30, Asp 30', and Gly 27 (Figure 3). This interaction prevents viral replication, as it competitively inhibits the viral polypeptides from gaining access to the active site and strongly binds to the enzymatic portions of this protein. == History == Darunavir was approved for use in the United States in June 2006 and for use in the European Union in February 2007. The development of first-generation clinical inhibitors was founded on creating more protease-ligand interactions through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The first HIV protease inhibitor approved by the FDA was saquinavir, which was designed to target wild-type HIV-1 protease. However, this inhibitor is no longer effective due to resistance-causing mutations on the HIV-1 protease structure. The HIV genome has high plasticity, so has been able to become resistant to multiple HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Since saquinavir, the FDA has approved several PIs, including darunavir. == Society and culture == === Economics === In the US and UK, healthcare costs were estimated to be lower with boosted darunavir than with investigator-selected control protease inhibitors in treatment-experienced patients. == References == ,",Prezista,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.2914423829643056e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015253110323101282)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1300,"('Methyldopa (hydrate)', 'Œ±-methyldopa (hydrate)', 'Methyldopa', 'Alphamethyldopa', 'Aldomet')",Medical,"Methyldopa, also known as α-methyl-L-DOPA and sold under the brand name Aldomet among others, is a medication used for high blood pressure. It is one of the preferred treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy. For other types of high blood pressure including very high blood pressure resulting in symptoms other medications are typically preferred. It can be given by mouth or injection into a vein. Onset of effects is around 5 hours and they last about a day. Common side effects include sleepiness. More severe side effects include red blood cell breakdown, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Methyldopa is in the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist family of medication. It works by stimulating the brain to decrease the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Methyldopa was discovered in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Methyldopa is used in the clinical treatment of the following disorders: Hypertension (or high blood pressure) Gestational hypertension (or pregnancy-induced hypertension) and pre-eclampsia. == Side effects == Methyldopa is capable of inducing a number of adverse side effects, which range from mild to severe. Nevertheless, they are generally mild when the dose is less than 1 gram per day. Side effects may include: Psychological Depression Suicidal ideation Nightmares Apathy, anhedonia, or dysphoria Anxiety, especially social anxiety Decreased alertness, awareness, and wakefulness Impaired attention and concentration Fatigue Malaise Drowsiness Restlessness Cognitive and memory impairment Derealization or depersonalization, as well as mild psychosis Sexual dysfunction including impaired libido, desire, and drive Physiological Dizziness, lightheadedness, or vertigo Miosis or pupil constriction Xerostomia or dry mouth Gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea or constipation Headache or migraine Myalgia or muscle aches, arthralgia or joint pain, or paresthesia (""pins and needles"") Restless legs syndrome (RLS) Parkinsonian symptoms such as muscle tremors, rigidity, hypokinesia, or balance or postural instability Akathisia, ataxia, dyskinesia, as well as even tardive dyskinesia or dystonia Bell's palsy or facial paralysis Sexual dysfunction Hyperprolactinemia Gynecomastia in males, amenorrhoea or absence of menstrual cycles in females Bradycardia Hypotension Orthostatic hypotension Hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, or liver dysfunction or damage Pancreatitis Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia or deficiency in red blood cells (RBCs) Myelotoxicity or bone marrow suppression, potentially leading to thrombocytopenia, blood platelet deficiency, leukopenia, or white blood cell deficiency Hypersensitivity (e.g., lupus erythematosus, myocarditis, or pericarditis) Lichenoid reactions (e.g., skin lesions or rashes) Pallor === Withdrawal === Rebound hypertension via withdrawal on account of tolerance upon the abrupt discontinuation of methyldopa has been reported. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action of methyldopa is not fully clear. It may reduce the dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission in the central and peripheral nervous system and it indirectly affects norepinephrine (noradrenaline) synthesis by way of inhibiting dopamine synthesis. Methyldopa acts on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which are found on the pre synaptic nerve terminal. This inhibits the release of norepinephrine from the presynaptic neuron. The S-enantiomer of methyldopa is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (LAAD), which converts L-DOPA into dopamine. L-DOPA can cross the blood–brain barrier and thus methyldopa may have similar effects. LAAD converts it into alpha-methyldopamine, a false prescursor to norepinephrine, which in turn reduces synthesis of norepinephrine in the vesicles. Dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) converts alpha-methyldopamine into alpha-methylnorepinephrine, which is an agonist of the presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptor causing inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Methyldopa has been found to be a monoamine depleting agent. == Pharmacokinetics == Maximum decrease in blood pressure occurs 4–6 hours after oral dosage. The half-life of methyldopa is 105 minutes. Methyldopa exhibits variable absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver and intestines and is excreted in urine. == History == When methyldopa was first introduced, it was the mainstay of antihypertensive treatment, but its use has declined on account of relatively severe adverse side effects, with increased use of other safer and more tolerable agents such as alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Additionally, it has yet to be associated with reducing adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke, or overall all-cause mortality reduction in clinical trials. Nonetheless, one of methyldopa's still current indications is in the management of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), as it is relatively safe in pregnancy compared to many other antihypertensives which may affect the fetus. == See also == Difluoromethyldopa D-DOPA (dextrodopa) L-DOPA (levodopa; trade names Sinemet, Pharmacopa, Atamet, Stalevo, Madopar, Prolopa, etc.) L-DOPS (droxidopa) Dopamine (Intropan, Inovan, Revivan, Rivimine, Dopastat, Dynatra, etc.) Norepinephrine (noradrenaline; Levophed, etc.) Epinephrine (adrenaline; Adrenalin, EpiPed, Twinject, etc.) MK-872 HCl salt: [55943-64-1] α-Methyltyrosine α-Methyl-5-hydroxytryptophan == References == == External links ==",Aldomet,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.583032467868179e-06), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044431351125240326)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1301,"('Inarigivir soproxil', 'Sb 9200', 'Sb-9200', 'Inarigivir soproxil (usan)', 'Inarigivir soproxil [usan]')",Medical," SB 9200 is a novel, first-in-class oral modulator of innate immunity that is believed to act via the activation of the RIG-I and NOD2 pathways. SB 9200 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses including hepatitis C virus (HCV), norovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza and has demonstrated activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro and in vivo. In phase I clinical trials in chronically infected HCV patients, SB 9200 has been shown to reduce HCV RNA by up to 1.9 log SB 9200, an oral prodrug of the dinucleotide SB 9000, is being developed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and represents a novel class of antivirals. SB 9200 is thought to activate the viral sensor proteins, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) resulting in interferon (IFN) mediated antiviral immune responses in virus-infected cells. Additionally, the binding of SB 9200 to these sensor proteins could also sterically block the ability of the viral polymerase to access pre-genomic RNA for nucleic acid synthesis. The immune stimulating and direct antiviral properties of SB 9200 were evaluated in woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) by daily, oral dosing at 15 and 30 mg/kg for 12 weeks. Prolonged treatment resulted in 2.2 and 3.7 log10 reductions in serum WHV DNA and in 0.5 and 1.6 log10 declines in serum WHV surface antigen from pretreatment level with the lower or higher dose of SB 9200, respectively. SB 9200 treatment also resulted in lower hepatic levels of WHV nucleic acids and antigen and reduced liver inflammation. Following treatment cessation, recrudescence of viral replication was observed but with dose-dependent delays in viral relapse. The antiviral effects were associated with dose-dependent and long-lasting induction of IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes in blood and liver, which correlated with the prolonged activation of the RIG-I/NOD2 pathway and hepatic presence of elevated RIG-I protein levels. These results suggest that in addition to a direct antiviral activity, SB 9200 induces antiviral immunity during chronic hepadnaviral infection via activation of the viral sensor pathway. SB 9200, an orally bioavailable dinucleotide, activates the viral sensor proteins, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) causing the induction of the interferon (IFN) signaling cascade for antiviral defense. The present study evaluated the overall antiviral response in woodchucks upon induction of immune response, first with SB 9200 followed by Entecavir (ETV) versus reduction of viral burden with ETV followed by SB 9200 immunomodulation. Woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) were treated orally with SB 9200 (30 mg/kg/day) and ETV (0.5 mg/kg/day). Group 1 received ETV for 4 weeks followed by SB 9200 for 12 weeks. Group 2 received SB 9200 for 12 weeks followed by ETV for 4 weeks. At the end of treatment in Group 2, average reductions of 6.4 log10 in serum WHV DNA and 3.3 log10 in WHV surface antigen were observed whereas in Group 1, average reductions of 4.2 log10 and 1.1 log10 in viremia and antigenemia were noted. Both groups demonstrated marked reductions in hepatic WHV nucleic acid levels which were more pronounced in Group 2. Following treatment cessation and the 8-week follow-up, recrudescence of viral replication was observed in Group 1 while viral relapse in Group 2 was significantly delayed. The antiviral effects observed in both groups were associated with temporally different induction of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-stimulated genes in blood and liver. These results suggest that the induction of host immune responses by pretreatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV resulted in antiviral efficacy that was superior to that obtained using the strategy of viral reduction with ETV followed by immunomodulation.",Sb 9200,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.676292231422849e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00011300401820335537), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024808840826153755)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0007099286303855479)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28303593/,https://www.sohu.com/a/618723417_533680,https://www.biocentury.com/article/220122/sb-9200-phase-i-data ', [])"
1302,"('Ajmaline', 'Cardiorythmine', 'Ajmalan-17,21-diol, (17r,21a)-', 'Ajmalin', 'Gilurytmal')",Medical,"Ajmaline (also known by trade names Gilurytmal, Ritmos, and Aritmina) is an alkaloid that is classified as a 1-A antiarrhythmic agent. It is often used to induce arrhythmic contraction in patients suspected of having Brugada syndrome. Individuals suffering from Brugada syndrome will be more susceptible to the arrhythmogenic effects of the drug, and this can be observed on an electrocardiogram as an ST elevation. The compound was first isolated by Salimuzzaman Siddiqui in 1931 from the roots of Rauvolfia serpentina. He named it ajmaline, after Hakim Ajmal Khan, one of the most illustrious practitioners of Unani medicine in South Asia. Ajmaline can be found in most species of the genus Rauvolfia as well as Catharanthus roseus. In addition to Southeast Asia, Rauvolfia species have also been found in tropical regions of India, Africa, South America, and some oceanic islands. Other indole alkaloids found in Rauvolfia include reserpine, ajmalicine, serpentine, corynanthine, and yohimbine. While 86 alkaloids have been discovered throughout Rauvolfia vomitoria, ajmaline is mainly isolated from the stem bark and roots of the plant. Due to the low bioavailability of ajmaline, a semisynthetic propyl derivative called prajmaline (trade name Neo-gilurythmal) was developed that induces similar effects to its predecessor but has better bioavailability and absorption. == Biosynthesis == Ajmaline is widely dispersed among 25 plant genera, but is of significant concentration in the Apocynaceae family. Ajmaline is a monoterpenoid indole alkaloid, composed of an indole from tryptophan and a terpenoid from iridoid glucoside secologanin. Secologanin is introduced from the triose phosphate/pyruvate pathway. Tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) remodels tryptophan into tryptamine. Strictosidine synthase (STR), uses a Pictet–Spengler reaction to form strictosidine from tryptamine and secologanin. Strictosidine is oxidized by P450-dependent sarpagan bridge enzymes (SBE); to make polyneuridine aldehyde. Of the sarpagan-type alkaloids, polyneuridine is a key entry into the ajmalan-type alkaloids. Polyneuridine Aldehyde is methylated by polyneuridine aldehydeesterase (PNAE), to synthesize 16-epi-vellosimine, which is acetylated to vinorine by vinorine synthase (VS). Vinorine is oxidized by vinorine hydroxylase (VH) to make vomilenine. Vomilenine reductase (VR) conducts a reduction of vomilenine to 1,2-dihydrovomilenine, using the cofactor NADPH. 1,2-dihydrovomilenine, is reduced by 1,2-dihydrovomilenine reductase (DHVR) to 17-O-acetylnorajmaline, with the same cofactor as VR: NADPH. 17-O-acetylnorajmaline is deacetylated by acetylajmalan esterase (AAE), to form norajmaline. Finally, norajmaline methyl transferase (NAMT) methylates norajmaline resulting in our desired compound: ajmaline. == Mechanism of action == Ajmaline was first discovered to lengthen the refractory period of the heart by blocking sodium ion channels, but it has also been noted that it is also able to interfere with the hERG (human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene) potassium ion channel. In both cases, Ajmaline causes the action potential to become longer and ultimately leads to bradycardia. When ajmaline reversibly blocks hERG, repolarization occurs more slowly because it is harder for potassium to get out due to less unblocked channels, therefore making the RS interval longer. Ajmaline also prolongs the QR interval since it can also act as sodium channel blocker, therefore making it take longer for the membrane to depolarize in the first case. In both cases, ajmaline causes the action potential to become longer. Slower depolarization or repolarization results in a lengthened QT interval (the refractory period), and therefore makes it take more time for the membrane potential to get below the threshold level so the action potential can be re-fired. Even if another stimulus is present, action potential cannot occur again until after complete repolarization. Ajmaline causes action potentials to be prolonged, therefore slowing down firing of the conducting myocytes which ultimately slows the beating of the heart. == Diagnosis of Brugada syndrome == Brugada syndrome is a genetic disease that can result in mutations in the sodium ion channel (gene SCN5A) of the myocytes in the heart. Brugada syndrome can result in ventricular fibrillation and potentially death. It is a major cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in young, otherwise healthy people. While the characteristic patterns of Brugada syndrome on an electrocardiogram may be seen regularly, often the abnormal pattern is only seen spontaneously due to unknown triggers or after challenged by particular drugs. Ajmaline is used intravenously to test for Brugada syndrome since they both affect the sodium ion channel. In an afflicted person who was induced with ajmaline, the electrocardiogram would show the characteristic pattern of the syndrome where the ST segment is abnormally elevated above the baseline. Due to complications that could arise with the ajmaline challenge, a specialized doctor should perform the administration in a specialized center capable of extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support. == See also == Salimuzzaman Siddiqui (1897–1994) Pakistani organic chemist Hellmuth Kleinsorge (1920–2001) German medical doctor == References ==",Ajmaline,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.16025978326797485), (' FOOD', -0.061974965035915375)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00018714107864070684), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31330564618110657)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajmaline?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Ajmaline', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajmaline?utm_source=openai')])"

The compound is used in a wide variety of research applications because it mimics cAMP and can induce normal physiological responses when added to cells in experimental conditions. cAMP is only able to elicit minimal responses in these situations. The neurite outgrowth instigated by bucladesine in cell cultures has been shown to be enhanced by nardosinone. == Bucladesine and seizure == The effect of bucladesine as a cAMP analog has been studied on the pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure in the wild-type mice. The data showed that bucladesine (300nM/mouse) reduced the seizure latency and threshold. In addition they found that combination of bucladesine and pentoxyfillin has additive effect on seizure latency and threshold. == Bucladesine and morphine withdrawal syndrome == Bucladesine (50-100nM/mouse) showed significant attenuation in the morphine withdrawal syndrome in the wild-type mice.

1304,"('Nestoron', 'Elcometrine', 'Nestorone', 'Segesterone acetate', 'Segesterone acetate [usan]')",Medical,"Segesterone acetate (SGA), sold under the brand name Nestorone among others, is a progestin medication which is used in birth control and in the treatment of endometriosis. It is available both alone and in combination with an estrogen as segesterone acetate/ethinylestradiol. It is not effective by mouth and must be given by other routes, most typically as a vaginal ring or implant that is placed into fat. Side effects of segesterone acetate are similar to those of other progestins. Segesterone acetate is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has some affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and has no other important hormonal activity. Segesterone acetate was developed by the Population Council and was introduced for medical use by 2000. It is under development in the United States and Europe as a gel in combination with estradiol or testosterone for use as a method of birth control in women and in men, respectively. In August 2018, a first-of-its-kind one-year contraceptive vaginal ring containing segesterone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol was approved in the United States. == Medical uses == Segesterone acetate is used as a hormonal contraceptive and in the treatment of endometriosis. == Side effects == Side effects of segesterone acetate are similar to those of other progestins. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Segesterone acetate acts primarily as a high-affinity agonist of the progesterone receptor (272% of the affinity of progesterone and 136% of that of promegestone). It does not bind significantly to the androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, or mineralocorticoid receptor. As such, segesterone acetate does not have estrogenic, androgenic, antiandrogenic, or antimineralocorticoid activity. However, segesterone acetate does have significant affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (38% of that of dexamethasone), but in spite of its relatively high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, it either does not have any glucocorticoid effects or shows glucocorticoid effects only at exceptionally high doses in animals. Segesterone acetate has no antiglucocorticoid activity in animals either. The ovulation-inhibiting dosage of parenteral segesterone acetate has been reported to be 150 μg per day, while the endometrial transformation dosage has been reported to be 600 μg per cycle. Segesterone acetate has antigonadotropic effects and functional antiestrogenic effects via its progestogenic activity similarly to other progestogens. In healthy young men, segesterone acetate alone at a dose of 2 to 3 mg/day as a transdermal gel (delivering 200–300 μg/day SGA) for 2 weeks suppressed testosterone levels from ~581 ng/dL to ~276 ng/dL (–52%). === Pharmacokinetics === Segesterone acetate is only weakly active orally, and is instead given as a subcutaneous implant. The oral bioavailability of segesterone acetate has been reported to be only 10%. However, it has also been reported that the medication is more than 100-fold as potent when delivered via subcutaneous implant relative to oral administration in rats. It has been estimated that segesterone acetate administered at a dose of 2 to 3 mg/day in the form of a transdermal gel delivers approximately 200 to 300 μg/day segesterone acetate based on a transdermal bioavailability of about 10 to 12%. Segesterone acetate is bound to albumin. It does not bind to sex hormone-binding globulin. Segesterone, the deacetylated form of segesterone acetate, is a metabolite of the medication. The biological half-life of parenteral segesterone acetate has been reported to be 24 to 72 hours. One study specifically reported a biological half-life of 26.8 hours. It has been reported that the biological half-life of segesterone acetate with oral administration is only 1 to 2 hours. In contrast to all of the preceding however, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label for Annovera, a one-year vaginal ring containing ethinylestradiol and segesterone acetate, lists a circulating half-life of segesterone acetate of 4.5 hours. == Chemistry == Segesterone acetate, also known as 16-methylene-17α-acetoxy-19-norprogesterone or as 16-methylene-17α-acetoxy-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic norpregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is a combined derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 19-norprogesterone, or a derivative of gestronol (17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone). The medication is the C17α acetate ester of segesterone, which, in contrast, was never marketed. Other 19-norprogesterone derivatives include demegestone, gestonorone caproate (norhydroxyprogesterone caproate), nomegestrol acetate, promegestone, and trimegestone. Segesterone acetate is a derivative of 16-methylene-17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate, and is the analogue of methenmadinone acetate without the C19 methyl group or the C6 double bond. A derivative of segesterone acetate with even greater progestogenic potency in comparison to segesterone acetate is 18-methylsegesterone acetate. == History == Segesterone acetate was developed by the Population Council. It has been marketed since at least 2000. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Segesterone acetate is the generic name of the drug and its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name. It is also known by its brand names Nestorone and Elcometrine, as well as by its former developmental code names ST-1435, AC-6844, and CS-0411. === Brand names === Segesterone acetate is marketed alone under the brand names Nestorone and Elcometrine and in combination with ethinylestradiol as segesterone acetate/ethinylestradiol under the brand name Annovera among others. === Availability === Segesterone acetate is available alone in several South American countries, including Brazil. It is available in the United States and Canada as a contraceptive vaginal ring in combination with ethinylestradiol. == Research == A combination of segesterone acetate and the estrogen estradiol is under development in a transdermal gel formulation for use as a contraceptive in women by the Population Council in conjunction with Antares Pharma in the United States and Europe. As of December 2017, it is in phase III clinical trials for this indication. The medication has the tentative brand name NestraGel. A combination of segesterone acetate and the estrogen ethinylestradiol in a vaginal ring formulation for use as a one-year contraceptive was developed by the Population Council in multiple regions including Latin America, Europe, and Australia. It completed phase III clinical trials and was approved in the United States in August 2018. A combination of segesterone acetate and the androgen testosterone is under development as a transdermal gel formulation for use as a hormonal contraceptive in men by the Population Council. As of December 2017, it is in phase II clinical studies for this purpose. In a trial, 100 couples used segesterone/testosterone dermal gel as the sole contraception method, which resulted in no pregnancy. Side effects were described as mild, comprising acne, weight gain and nocturnal sweating. == References ==",Segesterone acetate,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.894321920000948e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0003407612966839224)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segesterone_acetate,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21294-segesterone-acetate-ethinyl-estradiol-vaginal-ring,https://ir.therapeuticsmd.com/news-releases/news-release-details/therapeuticsmd-announces-fda-approval-annoveratm-segesterone ', [])"
1305,"('Sulbutiamine', 'Bisibuthiamine', 'Bisibutiamine', 'Youvitan (tn)', 'Sulbutiamine (inn)')",Medical,"Sulbutiamine sold under the brand names Arcalion, Enerion, and Sulbuxin is a synthetic derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1). In France, it is used to treat symptoms of weakness or fatigue. In Uruguay, it is prescribed when there is thiamine deficiency, mainly in patients with asthenia, overwork, apathy, depressive states, memory disorders, and iatrogenic disorders of wakefulness. It is also sold as a dietary supplement. Sulbutiamine was discovered in Japan as part of an effort to develop useful thiamine derivatives. == Uses == Sulbutiamine is used to treat asthenia (weakness), though is not clear if it is effective in alleviating drowsiness. It is also used to treat thiamine deficiency and poor concentration. Being a potent cholinergic, sulbutiamine is a popular nootropic, with users reporting enhanced memory, focus, and improved mood and motivation. Endurance athletes may use it to try to enhance their performance. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects found in clinical trials are usually limited to headache and gastrointestinal discomfort when high doses are used. While daily use can result in tolerance and paradoxical drowsiness, increasing the dose is strongly discouraged and side effects can include diarrhea, bladder infections, bronchitis, back pain, abdominal pain, insomnia, constipation, gastroenteritis, headache, vertigo, and sore throat. == History == Efforts to develop thiamine derivatives with better bioavailability than thiamine were conducted in the 1950s, mainly in Japan. These efforts led to the discovery of allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) in garlic, which became a model for medicinal chemistry efforts to create other thiamine disulfides. The results included sulbutiamine, fursultiamine (thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide) and benfotiamine. These compounds are hydrophobic, easily pass from the intestines to the bloodstream, and are reduced to thiamine by cysteine or glutathione.: 302 It was first marketed in France by Servier in 1973 under the brand name Arcalion. The drug registration went through a validation procedure in France in the 1980s, which found that the use for treatment of fatigue was not supported by data. In January 1989, 100 mg tablet doses were discontinued in favour of 200 mg tablets. == Research == Because thiamine deficiency causes problems with memory and other cognitive functions, thiamine and analogs like sulbutiamine have been studied in clinical trials in the 1980s and 1990s for age-associated cognitive decline. Sulbutiamine has been explored in clinical trials as a potential treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Studies have also been undertaken to assess its impact on reversing age-related changes in the circadian system. The pharmacology of sulbutiamine has been studied in various mice and rats; as of 2014 it appeared that sulbutiamine might be more effective in raising thiamine phosphate levels in the brain than benfotiamine and fursultiamine, but this has not been fully verified.: 303 University of Oxford studies indicate that it helps prevent apoptotic cell death, caused by trophic factor deprivation, in retinal ganglion cells.

The L-isomer of aspartic acid is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids, i.e., the building blocks of proteins. D-aspartic acid is one of two D-amino acids commonly found in mammals. Apart from a few rare exceptions, D-aspartic acid is not used for protein synthesis but is incorporated into some peptides and plays a role as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. Like all other amino acids, aspartic acid contains an amino group and a carboxylic acid. Its α-amino group is in the protonated –NH+3 form under physiological conditions, while its α-carboxylic acid group is deprotonated −COO− under physiological conditions. Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain (CH2COOH) which reacts with other amino acids, enzymes and proteins in the body. Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form, −COO−. It is a non-essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it as needed. It is encoded by the codons GAU and GAC. In proteins aspartate sidechains are often hydrogen bonded to form asx turns or asx motifs, which frequently occur at the N-termini of alpha helices. Aspartic acid, like glutamic acid, is classified as an acidic amino acid, with a pKa of 3.9; however, in a peptide this is highly dependent on the local environment, and could be as high as 14. The one-letter code D for aspartate was assigned arbitrarily, with the proposed mnemonic asparDic acid. == Discovery == Aspartic acid was first discovered in 1827 by Auguste-Arthur Plisson and Étienne-Ossian Henry by hydrolysis of asparagine, which had been isolated from asparagus juice in 1806. Their original method used lead hydroxide, but various other acids or bases are now more commonly used instead. == Forms and nomenclature == There are two forms or enantiomers of aspartic acid. The name ""aspartic acid"" can refer to either enantiomer or a mixture of two. Of these two forms, only one, ""L-aspartic acid"", is directly incorporated into proteins. The biological roles of its counterpart, ""D-aspartic acid"" are more limited. Where enzymatic synthesis will produce one or the other, most chemical syntheses will produce both forms, ""DL-aspartic acid"", known as a racemic mixture. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === In the human body, aspartate is most frequently synthesized through the transamination of oxaloacetate. The biosynthesis of aspartate is facilitated by an aminotransferase enzyme: the transfer of an amine group from another molecule such as alanine or glutamine yields aspartate and an alpha-keto acid. === Chemical synthesis === Industrially, aspartate is produced by amination of fumarate catalyzed by L-aspartate ammonia-lyase. Racemic aspartic acid can be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate, (C6H4(CO)2NC(CO2Et)2). == Metabolism == In plants and microorganisms, aspartate is the precursor to several amino acids, including four that are essential for humans: methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and lysine. The conversion of aspartate to these other amino acids begins with reduction of aspartate to its ""semialdehyde"", O2CCH(NH2)CH2CHO. Asparagine is derived from aspartate via transamidation: −O2CCH(NH2)CH2CO2− + GC(O)NH3+ → O2CCH(NH2)CH2CONH3+ + GC(O)O (where GC(O)NH2 and GC(O)OH are glutamine and glutamic acid, respectively) == Other biochemical roles == Aspartate has many other biochemical roles. It is a metabolite in the urea cycle and participates in gluconeogenesis. It carries reducing equivalents in the malate-aspartate shuttle, which utilizes the ready interconversion of aspartate and oxaloacetate, which is the oxidized (dehydrogenated) derivative of malic acid. Aspartate donates one nitrogen atom in the biosynthesis of inosine, the precursor to the purine bases. In addition, aspartic acid acts as a hydrogen acceptor in a chain of ATP synthase. Dietary L-aspartic acid has been shown to act as an inhibitor of Beta-glucuronidase, which serves to regulate enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin and bile acids. === Interactive pathway map === Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. === Neurotransmitter === Aspartate (the conjugate base of aspartic acid) stimulates NMDA receptors, though not as strongly as the amino acid neurotransmitter L-glutamate does.

It is similar to the ribonucleoside cytidine, but with one hydroxyl group removed from the C2' position. Deoxycytidine can be phosphorylated at C5' of the deoxyribose by deoxycytidine kinase, converting it to deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP), a DNA precursor. dCMP can be converted to dUMP and dTMP. It can also be used as a precursor for 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a treatment for MDS patients. This compound slows the cell cycle by interfering with the methylation of the P15/INK4B gene, increasing the expression of P15/INK4B protein which subdues the transformation of MDS to leukemia. Deoxycytidine can also serve as a biomarker for tumor diagnosis. Deoxycytidine can be used as a biomarker for breast cancer patients and healthy individuals. 5-(Hydroxymethyl)-2′-deoxycytidine (5-hmdC), 5-(formyl)-2′-deoxycytidine (5-fodC), and 5-(carboxyl)-2′-deoxycytidine (5-cadC) are intermediates in the DNA demethylation pathway and can act as biomarkers. 5-hmdC levels were significantly reduced in urine samples of breast cancer patients, while 5-fodC and 5-cadC levels were elevated. == References ==",Deoxycytidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.018437055870890617), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.011048642918467522), (' MED', -2.3080716346157715e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.4344443380832672), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('OUS', -7.152555099310121e-07), (',', -0.0006789048202335835), ('ĠMED', -0.003315192647278309), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.16038770973682404)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1310,"('Bacitracin',)",Medical,"Bacitracin is a polypeptide antibiotic. It is a mixture of related cyclic peptides produced by Bacillus licheniformis bacteria, that was first isolated from the variety ""Tracy I"" (ATCC 10716) in 1945. These peptides disrupt Gram-positive bacteria by interfering with cell wall and peptidoglycan synthesis. Bacitracin is primarily used as a topical preparation, as it can cause kidney damage when used internally. It is generally safe when used topically, but in rare cases may cause hypersensitivity, allergic or anaphylactic reactions, especially in people allergic to neomycin. In 2022, it was the 323rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 100,000 prescriptions. == Medical uses == Bacitracin is used in human medicine as a polypeptide antibiotic and is ""approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in chickens and turkeys,"" though use in animals contributes to antibiotic resistance. As bacitracin zinc salt, in combination with other topical antibiotics (usually polymyxin B and neomycin) as an ointment (""triple antibiotic ointment,"" with the brand name Neosporin), it is used for topical treatment of a variety of localized skin and eye infections, as well as for the prevention of wound infections. A non-ointment form of ophthalmic solution is also available for eye infections. === Spectrum of activity and susceptibility data === Bacitracin is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. It targets Gram-positive bacteria, especially those that cause skin infections. The following represents susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus – ≤0.03 μg/mL – 700 μg/mL Staphylococcus epidermidis – 0.25 μg/mL – >16 μg/mL Streptococcus pyogenes – 0.5 μg/mL – >16 μg/mL == Mechanism of action == Bacitracin interferes with the dephosphorylation of C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate, and a related molecule known as bactoprenol pyrophosphate; both of these lipids function as membrane carrier molecules that transport the building-blocks of the peptidoglycan bacterial cell wall outside of the inner membrane. == History == Bacitracin was isolated by Balbina Johnson, a bacteriologist at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Its name derives from the fact that a compound produced by a microbe in young Margaret Tracy's (1936–1994) leg injury showed antibacterial activity. One strain isolated from tissue debrided from a compound fracture of the tibia was particularly active. We named this growth-antagonistic strain for the patient, ""Tracy I."" When cell-free filtrates of broth cultures of this bacillus proved to possess strong antibiotic activity and to be non-toxic, further study seemed warranted. We have called this active principle ""Bacitracin. Bacitracin was approved by the US FDA in 1948. == Synthesis == Bacitracin is synthesised via nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), which means that ribosomes are not directly involved in its synthesis. The three-enzyme operon is called BacABC, not to be confused with BacABCDE of bacilycin synthesis. == Composition == Bacitracin is composed of a mixture of related compounds with varying degrees of antibacterial activity. Notable fractions include bacitracin A, A1, B, B1, B2, C, D, E, F, G, and X. Bacitracin A has been found to have the most antibacterial activity.

Stachydrine hydrochloride (SH), an alkaloid component in Panzeria alaschanica Kupr, exhibits potent antitumor activity in breast cancer. However, the anti-HCC effects of SH remain unknown. Our study assessed the therapeutic effect of SH on HCC and tried to clarify the mechanisms by which it ameliorates HCC. No studies involving using SH for anti-HCC activity and molecular mechanism have been reported yet. We examined the cell viability of SH on HCC cells by MTT assay. The effect of SH on cell autophagy in HCC cells was verified by Western blot and Immunofluorescence test. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell-cycle arrest effects. Cell senescence was detected using β-Gal staining and Western blot, respectively. An inhibitor or siRNA of autophagy, i.e., CQ and si LC-3B, were applied to confirm the role of autophagy acted in the anti-cancer function of SH. Protein expression in signaling pathways was detected by Western blot. Besides, molecular docking combined with cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) was used for analysis. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model were built to explore the inhibitory effect of SH in HCC in vivo. In vitro studies showed that SH possessed an anti-HCC effect by inducing autophagy, cell-cycle arrest and promoting cell senescence. Specifically, SH induced autophagy with p62 and LC-3B expression. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that SH caused an obvious cell-cycle arrest, accompanied by the decrease and increase in Cyclin D1 and p27 levels, respectively. Additionally, SH induced cell senescence with the induction of p21 in HCC cell lines. Mechanistically, SH treatment down-regulated the LIF and up-regulated p-AMPK. Moreover, PDX model in NSG mice was conducted to support the results in vitro. This study is the first to report the inhibitory function of SH in HCC, which may be due to the induction of autophagy and senescence. This study provides novel insights into the anti-HCC efficacy of SH and it might be a potential lead compound for further development of drug candidates for HCC. Our previous studies revealed the protection of stachydrine hydrochloride (STA) against cardiopathological remodeling. One of the underlying mechanisms involves the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Ⅱ (CaMKII). However, the way STA influences CaMKII needs to be further investigated. The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2)-coupled reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction putatively induces the oxidative activation of CaMKII, resulting in the occurrence of pathological cardiac remodeling and dysfunction in experimental models of mice. Thus, in this study, we assessed the role of the NOX2-ROS signal axis in STA cardioprotection. The transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced heart failure model of mice, the phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic model of neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes, and the H Traditional Chinese medicine Leonurus japonicus Houtt. has a long history in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Stachydrine hydrochloride, the main bioactive ingredient extracted from Leonurus japonicus Houtt., has been shown to have cardioprotective effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of stachydrine hydrochloride haven't been comprehensively studied so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of stachydrine hydrochloride in heart failure and elucidate its possible mechanisms of action. In vivo, transverse aorta constriction was carried out in C57BL/6J mice, and thereafter, 7.2 mg/kg telmisartan (a selective AT1R antagonist as positive control) and 12 mg/kg stachydrine hydrochloride was administered daily intragastrically for 4 weeks. Cardiac function was evaluated by assessing morphological changes as well as echocardiographic and haemodynamic parameters. In vitro, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or adult mice cardiomyocytes were treated with stachydrine hydrochloride and challenged with phenylephrine (α-AR agonist). Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of C57BL/6J mice by Langendorff crossflow perfusion system. Intracellular calcium was measured by an ion imaging system. The length and movement of sarcomere were traced to evaluate the systolic and diastolic function of single myocardial cells. Stachydrine hydrochloride improved the cardiac function and calcium transient amplitudes, and inhibited the SR leakage and the amount of sparks in cardiac myocytes isolated from TAC mice. We also demonstrated that stachydrine hydrochloride could ameliorated phenylephrine-induced enhance in sarcomere contraction, calcium transients and calcium sparks. Moreover, our data shown that stachydrine hydrochloride blocked the hyper-phosphorylation of CaMKII, RyR2, PLN, and prevented the disassociation of FKBP12.6 from RyR2. Our results suggest that stachydrine hydrochloride exerts beneficial therapeutic effects against heart failure.

1317,"('Naproxen', '(s)-naproxen', 'Naprosyn', 'Equiproxen', 'Naproxene')",Medical,"Naproxen, sold under the brand name Aleve among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain, menstrual cramps, and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and fever. It is taken orally. It is available in immediate and delayed release formulations. Onset of effects is within an hour and lasts for up to twelve hours. Naproxen is also available in salt form, naproxen sodium, which has better solubility when taken orally. Common side effects include dizziness, headache, bruising, allergic reactions, heartburn, and stomach pain. Severe side effects include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and stomach ulcers. The heart disease risk may be lower than with other NSAIDs. It is not recommended in people with kidney problems. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy. Naproxen is a nonselective COX inhibitor. As an NSAID, naproxen appears to exert its anti-inflammatory action by reducing the production of inflammatory mediators called prostaglandins. It is metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites. Naproxen was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1976. In the United States it is available over-the-counter and as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 88th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Naproxen's medical uses are related to its mechanism of action as an anti-inflammatory compound. Naproxen is used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions and symptoms that are due to excessive inflammation, such as pain and fever (naproxen has fever-reducing, or antipyretic, properties in addition to its anti-inflammatory activity). Naproxen's anti-inflammatory properties may relieve pain caused by inflammatory conditions such as migraine, osteoarthritis, kidney stones, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, ankylosing spondylitis, menstrual cramps, tendinitis, and bursitis. Naproxen has also proven effective for acute post-operative pain. Naproxen sodium is used as a ""bridge therapy"" in medication-overuse headache to slowly take patients off other medications. === Available formulations === Naproxen sodium is available as both an immediate-release and an extended-release tablet. The extended-release formulations (sometimes called ""sustained release"", or ""enteric coated"") take longer to take effect than the immediate-release formulations and therefore are less useful when immediate pain relief is desired. Extended-release formulations are more useful for the treatment of chronic, or long-lasting, conditions, in which long-term pain relief is desirable. === Pregnancy and lactation === As with all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), naproxen use should be avoided in pregnancy due to the importance of prostaglandins in vascular and renal function in the fetus. NSAIDs should especially be avoided in the third trimester. Small amounts of naproxen are excreted in breast milk. However, adverse effects are uncommon in infants breastfed from a mother taking naproxen. == Adverse effects == Common adverse effects include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, rash, bruising, and gastrointestinal upset. Heavy use is associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease and kidney failure. Naproxen may cause muscle cramps in the legs in 3% of people. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. === Gastrointestinal === As with other non-COX-2 selective NSAIDs, naproxen can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, ulcers and stomach bleeding. Naproxen should be taken orally with, or just after food, to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Persons with a history of ulcers or inflammatory bowel disease should consult a doctor before taking naproxen. In U.S. markets, naproxen is sold with boxed warnings about the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding. Naproxen poses an intermediate risk of stomach ulcers compared with ibuprofen, which is low-risk, and indometacin, which is high-risk. To reduce stomach ulceration risk, it is often combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (a medication that reduces stomach acid production) during long-term treatment of those with pre-existing stomach ulcers or a history of developing stomach ulcers while on NSAIDs. === Cardiovascular === COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs have been linked to increases in the number of serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarctions and strokes. Naproxen is, however, associated with the smallest overall cardiovascular risks. Cardiovascular risk must be considered when prescribing any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The drug had roughly 50% of the associated risk of stroke compared with ibuprofen and was also associated with a reduced number of myocardial infarctions compared with control groups. A study found that high-dose naproxen induced near-complete suppression of platelet thromboxane throughout the dosing interval and appeared not to increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, whereas other non-aspirin high-dose NSAID regimens had only transient effects on platelet COX-1 and were associated with a small but definite vascular hazard. Conversely, naproxen was associated with higher rates of upper gastrointestinal bleeding complications compared with other NSAIDs. == Interactions == === Drug–drug interactions === Naproxen may interact with antidepressants, lithium, methotrexate, probenecid, warfarin and other blood thinners, heart or blood pressure medications, including diuretics, or steroid medicines such as prednisone. NSAIDs such as naproxen may interfere with and reduce the efficacy of SSRI antidepressants, as well as increase the risk of bleeding greater than the individual bleeding risk of either class of agent, when taken together. Naproxen is not contraindicated in the presence of SSRIs, though concomitant use of the medications should be done with caution. Alcohol consumption increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when combined with NSAIDs like naproxen in a dose-dependent manner (that is, the higher the dose of naproxen, the higher the risk of bleeding). The risk is highest for people who are heavy drinkers. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Naproxen works by reversibly inhibiting both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes as a non-selective coxib. === Pharmacokinetics === Naproxen is a minor substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen, and both the parent drug and the desmethyl metabolite undergo further metabolism to their respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites. An analysis of two clinical trials shows that naproxen's time to peak plasma concentration occurs between 2 and 4 hours after oral administration, though naproxen sodium reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1–2 hours. === Pharmacogenetics === The pharmacogenetics of naproxen has been studied to better understand its adverse effects. In 1998, a small pharmacokinetic (PK) study failed to show that differences in a patient's ability to clear naproxen from the body could account for differences in a patient's risk of experiencing the adverse effect of a serious gastrointestinal bleed while taking naproxen. However, the study failed to account for differences in the activity of CYP2C9, a drug-metabolizing enzyme that is necessary for clearing naproxen. Studies on the relationship between CYP2C9 genotype and NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeds have shown that genetic variants in CYP2C9 that reduce the clearance of major CYP2C9 substrates (like naproxen) increase the risk of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeds, especially for homozygous defective variants. == Chemistry == Naproxen is a member of the 2-arylpropionic acid (profen) family of NSAIDs. The free acid is an odorless, white to off-white crystalline substance. Naproxen free base is lipid-soluble and practically insoluble in water, while naproxen sodium and many other salts are freely soluble in water, often soluble in methanol, and sparingly soluble in alcohol; check the specific solubility of each salt before use. Naproxen has a melting point of 152–155 °C, while naproxen salts tend to have higher melting points. === Synthesis === Naproxen has been industrially produced by Syntex starting from 2-naphthol as follows: == Society and culture == === Brand names === Naproxen and naproxen sodium are marketed under various brand names, including Accord, Aleve, Anaprox, Antalgin, Apranax, Feminax Ultra, Flanax, Inza, Maxidol, Nalgesin, Naposin, Naprelan, Naprogesic, Naprosyn, Narocin, Pronaxen, Proxen, Soproxen, and Xenifar. It is also available as the combination naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium in delayed-release tablets under the brand name Vimovo. === Access restrictions === Syntex first marketed naproxen in 1976, as the prescription drug Naprosyn. They first marketed naproxen sodium under the brand name Anaprox in 1980. It remains a prescription-only drug in much of the world. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug in 1994. OTC preparations of naproxen in the U.S. are mainly marketed by Bayer HealthCare under the brand name Aleve and generic store brand formulations in 220 mg tablets. In Australia, packets of 275 mg tablets of naproxen sodium are Schedule 2 pharmacy medicines, with a maximum daily dose of five tablets or 1375 mg. In the United Kingdom, 250 mg tablets of naproxen were approved for OTC sale under the brand name Feminax Ultra in 2008, for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea in women aged 15 to 50. In the Netherlands, 220 mg and 275 mg tablets are available OTC in drugstores, 550 mg is OTC only at pharmacies. Aleve became available over the counter in some provinces in Canada on 14 July 2009, but not British Columbia, Quebec or Newfoundland and Labrador; it subsequently became available OTC in British Columbia in January 2010. == Ecological effects == Naproxen has been found in groundwater and drinking water in concentrations high enough to have adverse effects on invertebrates including fungi, algae, bacteria and fishes. Naproxen is not thoroughly removed by conventional water treatment methods, and its degradation pathways in the environment are limited. Some methods more successfully remove naproxen from wastewater, including metal-organic complexes and porous carbon. Although the levels are generally low enough to not be acutely toxic, sub-lethal effects may still occur, such as reduced photosynthetic ability. == Research == Naproxen may have antiviral activity against influenza. In laboratory research, it blocks the RNA-binding groove of the nucleoprotein of the virus, preventing the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex—thus taking the viral nucleoproteins out of circulation. == Veterinary use == === Horses === Naproxen is given by mouth to horses at a dose of 10 mg/kg and has shown to have a wide safety margin (no toxicity when given at three times the recommended dose for 42 days). It is more effective for myositis than the commonly used NSAID phenylbutazone, and has shown especially good results for treatment of equine exertional rhabdomyolysis, a disease of muscle breakdown; it is less commonly used for musculoskeletal disease. == References == == External links ==",Equiproxen,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.011048642918467522)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00218129507265985), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01117329765111208)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.01814994215965271)])","('MEDICAL; ([catalog.md](https://www.catalog.md/drugs/equiproxen.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='Equiproxen.

1318,"('Benzydamine (hydrochloride)', 'Benzidamine', 'Benzindamine', 'Benzydaminum', 'Bencidamina')",Medical," Benzydamine for oromucosal use is indicated in the relief of pain and irritation of the mouth and throat. It is an indazole derivative, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, with combined local anesthetic and analgesic properties, and antiseptic activity, marketed under the brand name ""Tantum Verde"". The aim of this study was to explore knowledge and prescriptive/advising attitudes among general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists (PHs) with regard to the topical treatment of sore throat and other irritative/inflammatory conditions of the oropharynx, with a focus on benzydamine. These findings could be important to increase awareness on benzydamine efficacy in sore throat and stomatological conditions, and to reinforce knowledge on the characteristics of benzydamine and its mechanisms of action among healthcare professionals (pediatricians, otolaryngologists, oncologists, etc.). An online questionnaire survey was performed among PHs and GPs in four European countries (Italy, Germany, Russia and Poland). Both GPs and PHs proved to have an excellent knowledge and mastery of the constituents effective against oral symptoms. Among all the principles, benzydamine hydrochloride is the most recognized as certainly suitable for the topical treatment of sore throat symptoms and various inflammatory/irritative conditions of the oral cavity. It is recommended by about 90% of PHs and prescribed by 80% of GPs, mainly to solve the ailments caused by sore throats and stomatitis, especially for its anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anesthetic characteristics. Also in the pediatric field, benzydamine hydrochloride is recommended: among GPs, a high percentage (about 40%) prescribes it like the remedies based on dichlorobenzyl alcohol-sodium benzoate, which are instead more often recommended by PHs (44% against 37%). Although the public has a lot of confidence in this treatment, GPs and PHs do not recommend/prescribe benzydamine as a first-line treatment of sore throat and other irritative/inflammatory conditions of the oropharynx. To increase the knowledge of benzydamine among these healthcare professionals, it would be important to emphasize its characteristics and the different irritative/inflammatory conditions of the oropharynx in which it can be used. Sore throat is a common postoperative complaint. The etiology of postoperative sore throat (POST) is considered the result of damage to airway mucosa after insertion of a laryngeal mask airway device or endotracheal tube. This paper proposes benzydamine hydrochloride (BH), a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with additional analgesic and local anesthetic properties, for POST prevention. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE™, Cochrane, and other relevant databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the outcome of topical application of BH vs non-application in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Using a random effects model, meta-analyses were conducted to assess the relative risks of the incidence of POST within 24 hr following the surgical procedure. The secondary outcomes included postoperative nausea and vomiting, dry mouth, coughing, and local irritation. We reviewed five trials that included 824 patients in total. Our results indicated that the incidence of POST was significantly reduced in the BH group, with risk ratios (RRs) of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20 to 0.68) at zero to one hour, 0.39 (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.57) at one to two hours, 0.42 (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.81) at four to six hours, 0.29 (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.88) at six to 12 hr, and 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.56) at 12 to 24 hr, compared with the control groups. Patients reported local irritation, but no major BH-related complications were observed. Our results indicate that the incidence of POST can be significantly reduced by prophylactic BH topical application to the oral cavity or airway devices. Further RCTs are required to overcome the limitations of heterogeneity and to determine the optimal dosage and application of BH for managing POST. Postoperative sore throat has a negative impact on patient satisfaction and recovery. Benzydamine hydrochloride is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug available for topical use. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of topical application of benzydamine to prevent postoperative sore throat in adults undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify relevant randomised controlled trials and pooled the data using a random effects model. The primary outcomes were the incidence and severity of sore throat 24 h after surgery/extubation, and adverse events. The quality of evidence was assessed using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Thirteen randomised controlled trials involving 1842 patients were included. Compared with control patients who did not receive analgesia, benzydamine was associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative sore throat, with a risk ratio (95%CI) of 0.31 (0.20-0.47), but not with significantly reduced severity, the standardised mean difference (95%CI) being -0.27 (-0.63 to 0.08). There were no significant adverse events related to benzydamine. Benzydamine was also associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative sore throat when compared with lidocaine, with a risk ratio (95%CI) of 0.18 (0.07-0.43).

It has a rapid action in reducing swelling when applied to mucous membranes. It is a sympathomimetic agent with marked alpha adrenergic activity that acts on alpha-receptors in the arterioles of the conjunctiva to produce constriction, resulting in decreased congestion. It was patented in 1934 and came into medical use in 1942. == Medical uses == === Nasal administration === Nasal decongestant. === Ophthalmic drug administration === Eye drops (brand names Clear Eyes, and Cleari) narrowing swollen blood vessels (ophthalmic arteries, and ophthalmic veins) to relieve red eye. Temporary red eye can safely be treated when the cause of the redness is established (e.g. cannabis induced conjunctival vasodilation). However, continuous use is not recommended without knowing an underlying condition. == Side effects == A few warnings and contraindications that apply to all naphazoline-containing substances intended for medicinal use are: Hypersensitivity to naphazoline Use in infants and children can result in central nervous system depression, leading to coma and marked reduction in body temperature Should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disease including cardiac arrhythmia and in patients with diabetes, especially those with a tendency toward diabetic ketoacidosis A possible association with stroke has been suggested. === Nasal administration === Extended use may cause rhinitis medicamentosa, a condition of rebound nasal congestion. === Ophthalmic drug administration === Known side-effect: Stinging Discomfort Irritation Increased red eyes Blurred vision Mydriasis Punctate keratitis Lacrimation (tears) Increased intraocular pressure == Contraindications == Patients taking MAO inhibitors can experience a severe hypertensive crisis if given a sympathomimetic drug such as naphazoline HCl Drug interactions can occur with anaesthetics that sensitize the myocardium to sympathomimetics (e.g. cyclopropane or halothane cautiously) Exercise caution when applying prior to use of phenylephrine. == Pharmacology == Naphazoline is a mixed α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor agonist. == Chemistry == The non-hydrochloride form of Naphazoline has the molecular formula C14H14N2 and a molar mass of 210.28 g/mol.

It belongs to a class of antiplatelets named glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Tirofiban is a small molecule inhibitor of the protein-protein interaction between fibrinogen and the platelet integrin receptor GP IIb/IIIa and is the first drug candidate whose origins can be traced to a pharmacophore-based virtual screening lead. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Tirofiban is indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events (combined endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia/repeat cardiac procedure) in people with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. == Contraindications and precautions == Tirofiban is contraindicated in patients with: Known hypersensitivity to any component of tirofiban. History of thrombocytopenia with prior exposure to tirofiban. Active internal bleeding, or history of bleeding diathesis, major surgical procedure or severe physical trauma within the previous month. == Adverse reactions == Bleeding is the most commonly reported adverse reaction. === Use in pregnancy === Tirofiban has been demonstrated to cross the placenta in pregnant rats and rabbits. Although the doses employed in these studies were a multiple of those used in human beings. no adverse effects on the offspring in both animals have been seen. However, there are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, tirofiban should be used during pregnancy only if clearly indicated. Nursing mothers: It is not known whether tirofiban is excreted in human milk. However, significant levels of tirofiban are excreted in rat milk. Therefore, nursing should be discontinued during the period of drug administration and the milk discarded. Nursing may resume 24 hours after cessation of treatment with tirofiban. === Pediatric use === Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. === Other precautions and laboratory exams === The activated partial thromboplastin time is the most reliable coagulation parameter and should be obtained regularly during treatment, particular if a bleeding episode occurs that may be associated with tirofiban therapy. Other important hematological parameters are platelet count, clotting time, hematocrit and hemoglobin. Proper technique regarding artery site access for sheath placement and removal of sheath should be followed. Arterial sheaths should be removed when the patient's activated clotting time is < 180 seconds or 2 to 6 hours following withdrawal of heparin. == Side effects == The following side effects were noted under treatment with tirofiban and heparin (and aspirin, if tolerated). Other drugs were used as necessary. The major adverse effect is bleeding on local sites of clinical intervention and systemically (regarding parts of the body or the whole body system). Major bleeding has occurred in 1.4% of patients and minor bleeding in 10.5%. Transfusions were required to terminate bleeding and to improve bleeding-related anemia in 4.0% of all patients. Geriatric patients have experienced more bleeding episodes than younger, women more than men. Thrombocytopenia was more often seen in the tirofiban + heparin group (1.5%) than in the heparin control group (0.8%). This adverse effect was usually readily reversible within days. Positive fecal and urine hemoglobin tests have also been reported. Post-marketing events have been the occurrence of intracranial bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding, pulmonary hemorrhage and spinal-epidural hematoma. Fatal bleeding have been reported rarely. Sometimes, thrombocytopenia was associated with chills, low-grade fever or bleeding complications (see above). Cases of hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis have occurred. == Interactions == The concomitant application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants may increase the risk of serious bleeding events. The decision whether maintenance therapy with these drugs should be discontinued during tirofiban treatment has to be made by the responsible clinician. == Pharmacology == Tirofiban has a rapid onset and short duration of action after proper IV administration. Coagulation parameters turn to normal 4 to 8 hours after the drug is withdrawn. == Chemistry == Tirofiban is a synthetic, non-peptide inhibitor of the interaction of fibrinogen with the integrin glycoprotein IIb/IIIa on human platelets. The Merck chemistry team of George Hartman, Melissa Egbertson and Wasyl Halczenko developed tirofiban from a lead compound discovered in focused screening of small molecule replacements of the key arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (Arg-Gly-Asp) subunit of fibrinogen. Computation of the distance between the charged Arg and Asp sites in fibrinogen provided guidance leading to directed screening success. Tirofiban constitutes an antithrombotic, specifically an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Tirofiban is a modified version of a molecule found in the venom of the saw-scaled viper Echis carinatus. == History == The drug is marketed under the brand name Aggrastat in the US by Medicure Pharma, in China by Eddingpharm, and in the rest of the world by Correvio International Sàrl.

1321,"('Phenylalanine', 'H-d-phe-oh', '(2r)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid', 'Sabiden', 'Phenylalanine d-form')","Food, Medical","Phenylalanine (symbol Phe or F) is an essential α-amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. It can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the biological pigment melanin. It is encoded by the messenger RNA codons UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is found naturally in the milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement as it is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins. The one-letter symbol F was assigned to phenylalanine for its phonetic similarity. == History == The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula, C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) seedlings. In 1882, Erlenmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia. The genetic codon for phenylalanine was first discovered by J. Heinrich Matthaei and Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1961. They showed that by using mRNA to insert multiple uracil repeats into the genome of the bacterium E. coli, they could cause the bacterium to produce a polypeptide consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the coding relationship that links information stored in genomic nucleic acid with protein expression in the living cell. == Dietary sources == Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans. Another common source of phenylalanine is anything sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame, such as diet drinks, diet foods and medication; the metabolism of aspartame produces phenylalanine as one of the compound's metabolites. == Dietary recommendations == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33 mg/kg body weight/day. In 2005 the DRI is set to 27 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine), the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendation of 2007 is 25 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine). == Other biological roles == L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids. L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of serotonin and other aromatic amino acids as well as nitric oxide due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, iron or tetrahydrobiopterin. The corresponding enzymes for those compounds are the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family and nitric oxide synthase. === In plants === Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the synthesis of flavonoids. Lignan is derived from phenylalanine and from tyrosine. Phenylalanine is converted to cinnamic acid by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. == Biosynthesis == Phenylalanine is biosynthesized via the shikimate pathway. == Phenylketonuria == The genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Individuals with this disorder are known as ""phenylketonurics"" and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood. Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L. A (rare) ""variant form"" of phenylketonuria called hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by the inability to synthesize a cofactor called tetrahydrobiopterin, which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood), but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation. Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity. A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener aspartame. This compound is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: ""Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine."" In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of ""aspartame or E951"" and they must be labeled with a warning ""Contains a source of phenylalanine."" In Brazil, the label ""Contém Fenilalanina"" (Portuguese for ""Contains Phenylalanine"") is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods. == D-, L- and DL-phenylalanine == The stereoisomer D-phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional organic synthesis, either as a single enantiomer or as a component of the racemic mixture. It does not participate in protein biosynthesis although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been processed. The biological functions of D-amino acids remain unclear, although D-phenylalanine has pharmacological activity at niacin receptor 2. DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities, which have been supported by clinical trials. DL-Phenylalanine is a mixture of D-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of DL-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by D-phenylalanine of enkephalin degradation by the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. Enkephalins act as agonists of the mu and delta opioid receptors, and agonists of these receptors are known to produce antidepressant effects. The mechanism of DL-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may also be accounted for in part by the precursor role of L-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, though clinical trials have not found an antidepressant effect from L-phenylalanine alone. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. D-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A small amount of D-phenylalanine appears to be converted to L-phenylalanine. D-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the blood–brain barrier less efficiently than L-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of D-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system. L-Phenylalanine is an antagonist at α2δ Ca2+ calcium channels with a Ki of 980 nM. In the brain, L-phenylalanine is a competitive antagonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor and at the glutamate binding site of AMPA receptor. At the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor L-phenylalanine has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 573 μM estimated by Schild regression which is considerably lower than brain L-phenylalanine concentration observed in untreated human phenylketonuria. L-Phenylalanine also inhibits neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex with IC50 of 980 μM, a brain concentration seen in classical phenylketonuria, whereas D-phenylalanine has a significantly smaller effect. == Commercial synthesis == L-Phenylalanine is produced for medical, feed, and nutritional applications, such as aspartame, in large quantities by utilizing the bacterium Escherichia coli, which naturally produces aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine. The quantity of L-phenylalanine produced commercially has been increased by genetically engineering E. coli, such as by altering the regulatory promoters or amplifying the number of genes controlling enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the amino acid. == Derivatives == Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, used in neutron capture therapy. 4-Azido-L-phenylalanine is a protein-incorporated unnatural amino acid used as a tool for bioconjugation in the field of chemical biology. == See also == Phenylalaninol == References == == External links == Phenylalanine mass spectrum Phenylalanine at ChemSynthesis",Phenylalanine,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.14810946583747864), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.16026119887828827), (' MED', -0.18695473670959473), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.04397212713956833), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0005589353386312723), ('ĠEND', -0.05735839903354645), ('OG', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.5759968161582947), ('ĠMED', -0.10625773668289185), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01817091554403305)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.31326526403427124), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -2.15310683415737e-05)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=6, title='Phenylalanine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylalanine?utm_source=openai')])"
1322,"('Jnj39758979', '(r)-4-(3-amino-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-6-isopropyl-pyrimidin-2-ylamine')",Medical," The histamine H4 receptor (H(4)R) has been shown to have preclinical involvement in both inflammatory and pruritic responses. JNJ-39758979 [(R)-4-(3-amino-pyrrolidin-1-yl)-6-isopropyl-pyrimidin-2-ylamine] is a potent and selective H(4)R antagonist with a Ki at the human receptor of 12.5 ± 2.6 nM and greater than 80-fold selectivity over other histamine receptors. The compound also exhibited excellent selectivity versus other targets. JNJ-39758979 showed dose-dependent activity in models of asthma and dermatitis consistent with other H(4)R antagonists. Preclinical toxicity studies of up to 6 months in rats and 9 months in monkeys indicated an excellent safety profile, supporting the clinical testing of the compound. An oral formulation of JNJ-39758979 was studied in a phase 1 human volunteer study to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. The compound was well tolerated, with the exception of dose-dependent nausea, and no safety issues were noted in the phase 1 study. JNJ-39758979 exhibited good pharmacokinetics upon oral dosing with a plasma half-life of 124-157 hours after a single oral dose. In addition, dose-dependent inhibition of histamine-induced eosinophil shape change was detected, suggesting that the H4R was inhibited in vivo. In conclusion, JNJ-39758979 is a potent and selective H(4)R antagonist that exhibited good preclinical and phase 1 safety in healthy volunteers with evidence of a pharmacodynamics effect in humans.

However, nominally significant improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV The findings suggest potential benefit of H This trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the H4 R-antagonist JNJ-39758979 in adult Japanese patients with moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). Eligible patients were randomly assigned to JNJ-39758979 300 mg, 100 mg or placebo once daily for 6 weeks in this phase 2a, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study. Primary efficacy was assessed via week-6 Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores. Secondary efficacy assessments included Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) pruritus assessments (Pruritus Categorical Response Scale [PCRS], Pruritus Numeric Rating Scales [PNRS], Pruritus Interference Numeric Rating Scale [PINRS] and Subject's Global Impressions of Change in Pruritus [SGICP]). Eighty-eight of 105 planned patients were randomized before the study was stopped and unblinded for safety reasons. The study did not meet the primary end-point. However, numerical improvements (i.e. decreases) in median EASI were observed with JNJ-39758979 100 mg (-3.7) and 300 mg (-3.0) versus placebo (-1.3) at week 6. Nominally significant improvements across PRO PCRS, PNRS and SGICP assessments were consistently observed, particularly with JNJ-39758979 300 mg. Safety, including adverse events (AE), was comparable between JNJ-39758979 and placebo with the exception of two patients (both receiving JNJ-39758979 300 mg) with serious AE of neutropenia, leading to premature study discontinuation. No deaths were reported. Except for neutropenia, no clinically relevant changes in laboratory values were observed.

1323,"('Busulfan', 'Myleran', 'Busulphan', 'Sulphabutin', 'Leucosulfan')",Medical,"Busulfan (Myleran, GlaxoSmithKline, Busulfex IV, Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.) is a chemotherapy drug in use since 1959. It is a cell cycle non-specific alkylating antineoplastic agent, in the class of alkyl sulfonates. Its chemical designation is 1,4-butanediol dimethanesulfonate. == History == Busulfan was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in 1999. Busulfan was the mainstay of the chemotherapeutic treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) until it was displaced by the new gold standard, imatinib, though it is still in use to a degree as a result of the drug's relative low cost. == Indications == Busulfan is used in pediatrics and adults in combination with cyclophosphamide or fludarabine/clofarabine as a conditioning agent prior to bone marrow transplantation, especially in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and other leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative disorders. Busulfan can control tumor burden but cannot prevent transformation or correct cytogenic abnormalities. The drug was recently used in a study to examine the role of platelet-transported serotonin in liver regeneration. == Availability == Myleran is supplied in white film coated tablets with 2 mg of busulfan per tablet. After 2002, a great interest has appeared for intravenous presentations of busulfan. Busulfex is supplied as an intravenous solution with 6 mg/ml busulfan. Busulfex has proved equally effective as oral busulfan, with presumedly less toxic side effects. Pharmacokinetic and dynamic studies support this use, that has prompted its usage in transplantation regimes, particularly in frail patients. Fludarabine + busulfan is a typical example of this use. == Side effects == Toxicity may include interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (""busulfan lung""), hyperpigmentation, seizures, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), emesis, and wasting syndrome. Busulfan also induces impotence in males (kills germ cells), thrombocytopenia, a condition of lowered blood platelet count and activity, and sometimes medullary aplasia. Seizures and VOD are serious concerns with busulfan therapy and prophylaxis is often utilized to avoid these effects. Hepatic VOD is a dose-limiting toxicity. Symptoms of VOD include weight gain, elevated bilirubin, painful hepatomegaly, and edema. The reason busulfan causes VOD is mostly unknown and can be deadly. Ursodiol may be considered for prophylaxis of veno-occlusive disease. Antiemetics are often administered prior to busulfan to prevent vomiting (emesis). Phenytoin may be used concurrently to prevent the seizures. Levetiracetam, has shown efficacy for the prophylaxis against busulfan-induced seizures. Benzodiazepines can also be used for busulfan-induced seizures. Busulfan is listed by the IARC as a Group 1 carcinogen. == Dosing, administration, and pharmacokinetics == As an adjunct therapy with cyclophosphamide for conditioning prior to bone marrow transplantation in adults and children >12 kg, intravenous (IV) busulfan (Bulsulfex) is dosed at 0.8 mg/kg every six hours for 16 doses (four days). IV busulfan is usually administered over two hours. Both IV and oral formulations require prophylactic antiemetic agents administered prior to the busulfan dose and scheduled antiemetics administered thereafter. Oral bioavailability of busulfan shows a large interindividual variation. Taking busulfan on an empty stomach is recommended to reduce the risk of nausea and emesis. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved within one hour of oral administration. About 30% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins, such as albumin. Busulfan therapeutic drug monitoring is completed based on trough (pre-dose) levels with a target six-hour area under the curve (AUC) of between 900 and 1500 micromolxmin. AUCs (six-hour) >1500 micromolxmin are associated with hepatic VOD and subsequent dose reduction should be considered. AUCs (six-hour) <900 micromolxmin are associated with incomplete bone marrow ablation and subsequent dose escalation should be considered. Dose adjustments are performed using first order kinetics, such that the adjusted dose = current dose × (target AUC/actual AUC). == Drug interactions == Busulfan is metabolized via glutathione conjugation in the liver to inactive metabolites. Itraconazole can decrease busulfan clearance by up to 25%, resulting in AUC levels >1500 micromolxmin and increased risk of hepatic VOD. Concomitant use of acetaminophen within 72 hours of busulfan use can reduce busulfan clearance (resulting in increased busulfan AUC), as acetaminophen is also metabolized via glutathione and may deplete stores. Phenytoin increases hepatic clearance of busulfan (resulting in decreased busulfan AUC). However, clinical studies of busulfan were completed with patients taking phenytoin, so no empiric dose adjustment is necessary if patients are taking phenytoin with busulfan. == Pharmacology == Busulfan is an alkylsulfonate. It is an alkylating agent that forms DNA-DNA interstrand crosslinks between the DNA bases guanine and adenine and between guanine and guanine. This occurs through an SN2 reaction in which the relatively nucleophilic guanine N7 attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group. DNA crosslinking prevents DNA replication. Because the intrastrand DNA crosslinks cannot be repaired by cellular machinery, the cell undergoes apoptosis. == Complexation == The molecular recognition of ureido-cyclodextrin with busulfan was investigated. The formation of complexes was observed with electrostatic interactions between urea and the sulfonate part of busulfan. Another structure was used for this complexation type, two disaccharidyl units connected by urea linkers to a diazacrown ether organizing platform. == References == == External links == ""Busulfan"".

1325,"('Phenacetin', 'Acetophenetidin', 'N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)acetamide', 'Acetphenetidin', 'Acetophenetidine')",Medical,"Phenacetin ( ; acetophenetidin, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)acetamide) is a pain-relieving and fever-reducing drug, which was widely used following its introduction in 1887. It was withdrawn from medicinal use as dangerous from the 1970s (e.g., withdrawn in Canada in 1973, and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1983). == History == Phenacetin was introduced in 1887 in Elberfeld, Germany by German company Bayer, and was used principally as an analgesic; it was one of the first synthetic fever reducers to go on the market. It is also known historically to be one of the first non-opioid analgesics without anti-inflammatory properties. Although paracetamol (acetaminophen) was produced earlier, a historical accident saw it ignored after Joseph von Mering's 1893 assessment. Prior to World War One, Britain imported phenacetin from Germany. During the war, a team including Jocelyn Field Thorpe and Martha Annie Whiteley developed a synthesis in Britain. == Known mechanism of action == Phenacetin's analgesic effects are due to its actions on the sensory tracts of the spinal cord. In addition, phenacetin has a depressant action on the heart, where it acts as a negative inotrope. It is an antipyretic, acting on the brain to decrease the temperature set point. It is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (subacute type) and intercostal neuralgia. In vivo, one of two reactions occur. Usually phenacetin's ether is cleaved to leave paracetamol (acetaminophen), which is the clinically relevant analgesic. A minority of the time the acetyl group is removed from the amine, producing carcinogenic p-phenetidine. This reaction is quite rare, however, as evidenced by the fact that the drug was on the market for almost 100 years before a statistical link was established, when Canada, followed by the United States, withdrew it from the market. == Preparation == The first synthesis was reported in 1878 by Harmon Northrop Morse. Morse's cited article describes the synthesis of paracetamol from 4-aminophenol and acetic acid. Phenacetin may be synthesized as an example of the Williamson ether synthesis: ethyl iodide, paracetamol, and anhydrous potassium carbonate are heated in 2-butanone to give the crude product, which is recrystallized from water. == Uses == === Medical === Phenacetin was widely used until the third quarter of the twentieth century, often in the form of an A.P.C., or ""aspirin-phenacetin-caffeine"" compound analgesic, as a remedy for fever and pain. An early formulation (1919) was Vincent's APC in Australia. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration ordered the withdrawal of drugs containing phenacetin in November 1983, due to its carcinogenic and kidney-damaging properties. It was also banned in India. As a result, some branded, and previously phenacetin-based, preparations continued to be sold, but with the phenacetin replaced by safer alternatives. A popular brand of phenacetin was Roche's Saridon, which was reformulated in 1983 to contain propyphenazone, paracetamol and caffeine. Coricidin was also reformulated without phenacetin. Paracetamol is a metabolite of phenacetin with similar analgesic and antipyretic effects, but the new formulation has not been found to have phenacetin's carcinogenicity. === Other === Phenacetin has been used as a cutting agent to adulterate cocaine in the UK and Canada, due to the similar physical properties. There, it has been given the nickname ""magic"". Due to its low cost, phenacetin is used for research into the physical and refractive properties of crystals. It is an ideal compound for this type of research. In Canada, phenacetin is used as a laboratory reagent, and in a few hair dye preparations (as a stabilizer for hydrogen peroxide). While it is considered a prescription drug, no marketed drugs contain phenacetin. == Safety == Phenacetin, and products containing phenacetin, have been shown in an animal model to have the side effect and after-effect of carcinogenesis. In humans, many case reports have implicated products containing phenacetin in urothelial neoplasms, especially urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis. Phenacetin is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as carcinogenic to humans. In one prospective series, phenacetin was associated with an increased risk of death due to urologic or renal diseases, death due to cancers, and death due to cardiovascular diseases. In addition, people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may experience acute hemolysis, or dissolution of blood cells, while taking this drug. Acute hemolysis is possible in the case of patients who develop an IgM response to phenacetin leading to immune complexes that bind to erythrocytes in blood. The erythrocytes are then lysed when the complexes activate the complement system. Chronic use of phenacetin is known to lead to analgesic nephropathy characterized by renal papillary necrosis. This is a condition which results in destruction of some or all of the renal papillae in the kidneys. It is believed that the metabolite p-phenetidine is at least partly responsible for these effects. One notable death that can possibly be attributed to the use of this drug was that of the aviation pioneer Howard Hughes. He had been using phenacetin extensively for the treatment of chronic pain; it was stated during his autopsy that phenacetin use may have been the cause of his kidney failure. Askit Powders, a once-popular headache cure on the UK market, have been associated with kidney failure in chronic users due to containing phenacetin until 1966, when they were reformulated to remove it. == In popular culture == A 1974 episode of the Yorkshire Television series Justice, ""Duty of Care"", features a court case that resulted from a woman dying of phenacetin poisoning, as a result of taking A.P.C. for five years. This explained that phenacetin caused renal papillary necrosis. In the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance chapter 4, ""APCs for headaches"" is included in a list of valuable things to take on motorcycle trips. == See also == Bucetin == References == == External links == Carcinogen report from the NIH IARC report Safety (MSDS) data for phenacetin Archived 2006-09-24 at the Wayback Machine",Acetophenetidine,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.2703585922718048)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.01820802316069603), ('ICAL', -1.3351351299206726e-05), (',', -0.12699702382087708), ('ĠINDU', -0.009894846007227898), ('ST', -4.768360213347478e-06), ('RI', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.06201489642262459)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.24621398746967316), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.011047935113310814), (' INDUSTR', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/acetophenetidin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=94, start_index=6, title='Acetophenetidin | drug | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/acetophenetidin?utm_source=openai')])"
1326,"('Procarbazine (hydrochloride)', 'Procarbazine', 'Procarbazin', 'Ibenzmethyzin', 'Natulan')",Medical,"Procarbazine is a chemotherapy medication used for the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma and brain cancers. For Hodgkin's it is often used together with chlormethine, vincristine, and prednisone while for brain cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme it is used with lomustine and vincristine. It is typically taken by mouth. Common side effect include low blood cell counts and vomiting. Other side effects include tiredness and depression. It is not recommended in people with severe liver or kidney problems. Use in pregnancy is known to harm the baby. Procarbazine is in the alkylating agents family of medication. How it works is not clearly known. Procarbazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United Kingdom a month of treatment cost the National Health Service 450 to 750 pounds. == Medical uses == When used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma, it is often delivered as part of the BEACOPP regimen that includes bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine (tradename Oncovin), prednisone, and procarbazine. The first combination chemotherapy developed for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), MOPP also included procarbazine (ABVD has supplanted MOPP as standard first line treatment for HL, with BEACOPP as an alternative for advanced/unfavorable HL). Alternatively, when used to treat certain brain tumors (malignant gliomas), it is often dosed as PCV when combined with lomustine (often called CCNU) and vincristine. Dose should be adjusted for kidney disease or liver disease. == Side effects == Very common (greater than 10% of people experience them) adverse effects include loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Other side effects of unknown frequency include reduction in leukocytes, reduction in platelets, reduction in neutrophils, which can lead to increased infections including lung infections; severe allergy-like reactions that can lead to angioedema and skin reactions; lethargy; liver complications including jaundice and abnormal liver function tests; reproductive effects including reduction in sperm count and ovarian failure. When combined with ethanol, procarbazine may cause a disulfiram-like reaction in some people. It weakly inhibits MAO in the gastrointestinal system, so it can cause hypertensive crises if associated with the ingestion of tyramine-rich foods such as aged cheeses; this appears to be rare. Procarbazine rarely causes chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive, enduring, often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. == Pharmacology == Procarbazine works, in part, as an alkylating agent and methylates guanine at the O-6 position (much like dacarbazine also does). Guanine is one of the four nucleotides that makes up DNA. The methylated DNA is prone to breakage, and RNA and protein synthesis is inhibited. Proliferating cancer cells need to replicate their DNA and undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to DNA strand breaks. Normal or non-proliferating cells are more apt to repair the DNA damage, but still some of the healthy cells will be damaged. Procarbazine is metabolized in the liver to an azo-derivative and then further metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system to an active azoxy-derivative. == References == == External links == MOPP Treatment Regimen PCV Information Procarbazine Drug Information Provided by Lexi-Comp – Merck Manual RX Listing for Matulane ""Procarbazine"".

1327,"('Palonosetron (hydrochloride)', 'Palonosetron', 'Aloxi', 'Palonosetron [inn]', 'Aloxi (tn)')",Medical,"Palonosetron, sold under the brand name Aloxi, is a medication used for the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is a 5-HT3 antagonist. Palonosetron is administered intravenously, or as a single oral capsule. It has a longer duration of action than other 5-HT3 antagonists. The oral formulation was approved on August 22, 2008, for prevention of acute CINV alone, as a large clinical trial did not show oral administration to be as effective as intravenous use against delayed CINV. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The oral combination netupitant/palonosetron is approved for both acute and delayed CINV. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects are headache, which occurs in 4–11% of patients, and constipation in up to 6% of patients. In less than 1% of patients, other gastrointestinal disorders occur, as well as sleeplessness, first- and second-degree atrioventricular block, muscle pain and shortness of breath. Palonosetron is similarly well tolerated as other 5-HT3 antagonists, and slightly less than placebo. == Interactions == Palonosetron does not relevantly inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 liver enzymes. There are case reports about serotonin syndrome when the drug is combined with serotonergic substances, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), two common types of antidepressants. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist, commonly known as a setron. These drugs act by blocking serotonin from binding to the 5-HT3 receptor. === Pharmacokinetics === Orally taken palonosetron is absorbed well from the gut and has a bioavailability of 97%. Highest blood plasma levels are reached after 5.1±1.7 hours, independently of food intake, and plasma protein binding is 62%. 40% of the substance are eliminated in the unchanged form, and a further 45–50% are metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. The two main metabolites, the N-oxide and a hydroxy derivative, have less than 1% of palonosetron's antagonistic effect and are thus practically inactive. Palonosetron and its metabolites are mainly (to 80–93%) eliminated via the kidney. Biological half-life in healthy persons was 37±12 hours in a study, and 48±19 hours in cancer patients. In 10% of patients, half-life is over 100 hours. Most other marketed setrons have half-lives in the range of about two to 15 hours. == Chemistry == The substance is solid at room temperature and melts at 87 to 88 °C (189 to 190 °F). The infusions and capsules contain palonosetron hydrochloride, which is also a solid. The hydrochloride is easily soluble in water, soluble in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol and isopropyl alcohol. The molecule has two asymmetric carbon atoms. It is used in form of the pure (S,S)-stereoisomer. == Society and culture == === Economics === Palonosetron was developed by Helsinn around 2001. In January 2003, Helsinn filed a provisional patent application on palonosetron. Over the next 10 years, Helsinn filed four patent applications that claimed priority to the January 2003 date. Relevant here, Helsinn filed its fourth patent application in 2013. That patent (the ’219 patent) covers a fixed dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in a 5 ml solution. While developing the drug, Helsinn entered into a confidential licensing agreement with a company called MGI to sell palonosetron in the United States. This licensing agreement contained chemical information about palonosetron and dosage requirements. However, Helsinn did not file for a patent on palonosetron until two years after they had signed their agreement with MGI. [1] In 2011 Teva Pharmaceuticals - a generic drug manufacturer- challenged the validity of Helsinn's patent(s) by filing an application for a generic version of palonosetron with the FDA. Teva claimed that, because Helsinn disclosed/sold the 0.25 mg dose of palonosetron to MGI in 2003, which is more than a year (actually about 2 years) before the priority date of its '219 patent, this ""secret"" sale barred Helsinn from receiving a patent. This conclusion results from the language of the America Invents Act, which bars patents on inventions, which were “in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention,” 35 U. S. C. §102(a)(1). The District Court held that the AIA's “on sale” provision did not apply, because the public disclosure of the agreements did not disclose the 0.25 mg dose. The Federal Circuit reversed, holding that the sale was publicly disclosed, regardless of whether the details of the invention were publicly disclosed in the terms of the sale agreements. The SCOTUS agreed with the Federal Circuit, that in this case a commercial sale to a third party, who is required to keep the invention confidential, nevertheless placed the invention “on sale” under USC §102(a).[2] == References ==",Aloxi,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.1219027985353023e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015143604250624776)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/aloxi.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=74, start_index=9, title='Aloxi: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/aloxi.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is specifically the 2-methyl ether of 2-hydroxyestradiol. 2-Methoxyestradiol prevents the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need in order to grow (angiogenesis), hence it is an angiogenesis inhibitor. It also acts as a vasodilator and induces apoptosis in some cancer cell lines. 2-Methoxyestradiol is derived from estradiol, although it interacts poorly with the estrogen receptors (2,000-fold lower activational potency relative to estradiol). However, it retains activity as a high-affinity agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) (10 nM, relative to 3–6 nM for estradiol). == Clinical development == 2-Methoxyestradiol was being developed as an experimental drug candidate with the tentative brand name Panzem. It has undergone Phase 1 clinical trials against breast cancer. A phase II trial of 18 advanced ovarian cancer patients reported encouraging results in October 2007. Preclinical models also suggest that 2-methoxyestradiol could also be effective against inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Several studies have been conducted showing 2-methoxyestradiol is a microtubule inhibitor and is inhibitory against prostate cancer in rodents. As of 2015, all clinical development of 2-methoxyestradiol has been suspended or discontinued. This is significantly due to the very poor oral bioavailability of the molecule and also due to its extensive metabolism. Analogues have been developed in an attempt to overcome these problems. An example is 2-methoxyestradiol disulfamate (STX-140), the C3 and C17β disulfamate ester of 2-methoxyestradiol. == Clinical effects == 2-Methoxyestradiol was found to increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in men by 2.5-fold at a dose of 400 mg/day and by 4-fold at a dose of 1,200 mg/day. Conversely, it did not seem to suppress testosterone levels. A study in 2000 indicated that 2-Methoxyestradiol induces G2/M cycle arrest, apoptosis and the disruption of thyroid follicles. This process results in the release of thyroid antigens that may play a role in high incidence of thyroid autoantibodies and autoimmune thyroid disease in women. == See also == 2-Methoxyestriol 2-Methoxyestrone 4-Methoxyestradiol 4-Methoxyestrone MP-2001 == References ==",Panzem,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, INFO', [('END', -0.6691904067993164), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.5759773850440979), (' INFO', -0.25200942158699036)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.021848926320672035), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), (',', -0.006741398945450783), ('ĠEND', -0.004766174592077732), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('OUS', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001644212519749999)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3868710398674011)])","('INFO; ', [])"
1329,"('Carnosine', 'Beta-alanyl-l-histidine', 'Karnozin', 'Ignotine', 'Karnozzn')","Endogenous, Medical","Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) is a dipeptide molecule, made up of the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine. It is highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues. Carnosine was discovered by Russian chemist Vladimir Gulevich. Carnosine is naturally produced by the body in the liver from beta-alanine and histidine. Like carnitine, carnosine is composed of the root word carn, meaning ""flesh"", alluding to its prevalence in meat. There are no plant-based sources of carnosine. Carnosine is readily available as a synthetic nutritional supplement. Carnosine can chelate divalent metal ions. Carnosine is also considered a geroprotectant. Products containing carnosine are also used in topical preparations to reduce wrinkles on the skin. Carnosine may increase the Hayflick limit in human fibroblasts, it also appears to reduce the rate of telomere shortening. This could potentially promote the growth of certain cancers that thrive due to telomere preservation. == Biosynthesis == Carnosine is synthesized within the body from beta-alanine and histidine. Beta-alanine is a product of pyrimidine catabolism and histidine is an essential amino acid. Since beta-alanine is the limiting substrate, supplementing just beta-alanine effectively increases the intramuscular concentration of carnosine. == Physiological effects == === pH buffer === Carnosine has a pKa value of 6.83, making it a good buffer for the pH range of animal muscles. Since beta-alanine is not incorporated into proteins, carnosine can be stored at relatively high concentrations (millimolar). Occurring at 17–25 mmol/kg (dry muscle), carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is an important intramuscular buffer, constituting 10-20% of the total buffering capacity in type I and II muscle fibres. === Anti-oxidant === Carnosine has been shown to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as alpha-beta unsaturated aldehydes formed from peroxidation of cell membrane fatty acids during oxidative stress. It also buffers pH in muscle cells, and acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. It is also a zwitterion, a neutral molecule with a positive and negative end. === Antiglycating === Carnosine acts as an antiglycating agent, reducing the rate of formation of advanced glycation end-products (substances that can be a factor in the development or worsening of many degenerative diseases, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney failure, and Alzheimer's disease), and ultimately reducing development of atherosclerotic plaque build-up. === Geroprotective === Carnosine is considered as a geroprotector. Carnosine can increase the Hayflick limit in human fibroblasts, as well as appearing to reduce the telomere shortening rate. Carnosine may also slow aging through its anti-glycating properties (chronic glycolyating is speculated to accelerate aging). === Other === Carnosine can chelate divalent metal ions. It has been suggested that binding Ca2+ may displace protons, thereby providing a link between Ca2+ and H+ buffering. However, there is still controversy as to how much Ca2+ is bound to carnosine under physiological conditions. == See also == Acetylcarnosine, a similar molecule used to treat lens cataracts Anserine, another dipeptide antioxidant (found in birds) Carnosine synthase, an enzyme that helps carnosine production Carnosinemia, a disease of excess carnosine due to an enzyme defect/deficiency == References ==",Carnosine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -8.458980300929397e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00017982252757064998), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.318681188422488e-05), (' FOOD', -0.3485187292098999), (',', -3.8889261304575484e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.00018268341955263168), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('EN', -0.023646606132388115), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('OUS', -1.1920922133867862e-06), (',', -0.0003194298769813031), ('ĠFOOD', -0.07882849127054214), (',', -0.018175246194005013), ('ĠPERSON', -0.11032810062170029), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5759811401367188)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -3.547789674485102e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS,FOOD,PERSONAL CARE;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34203479/,https://www.mdedge.com/dermatology/article/102556/aesthetic-dermatology/carnosine/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnosine ', [])"

Although 0118 is a topomimetic of galectin-1-targeting angiostatic amphipathic peptide Anginex, we had yet to prove that 0118 targets galectin-1. Galectin-1 is involved in pathological disorders like tumor endothelial cell adhesion and migration and therefore presents a relevant target for therapeutic intervention against cancer. Here, (15)N-(1)H HSQC NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that 0118 indeed targets galectin-1 at a site away from the lectin's carbohydrate binding site and thereby attenuates lactose binding to the lectin. Flow cytometry and agglutination assays show that 0118 attenuates binding of galectin-1 to cell surface glycans, and the inhibition of cell proliferation by 0118 is found to be correlated with the cellular expression of the lectin. In general, our data indicate that 0118 targets galectin-1 as an allosteric inhibitor of glycan/carbohydrate binding. This work contributes to the clinical development of antitumor calixarene compound 0118. Calixarene 0118 is a potent anti-angiogenic agent that effectively inhibited tumor growth in preclinical studies, and is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial. We have designed two close mimetics of calixarene 0118 containing a terminal alkynyl-functional group, and developed an optimized semi-automated procedure for radiolabeling with 2-[(18)F]fluoroethylazide using click chemistry. Following semi-preparative HPLC purification and formulation, the lower-rim modified analog [(18)F]6 and the equatorially labeled [(18)F]13 were obtained in >97% radiochemical purity and overall decay-corrected isolated radiochemical yields of 18.7 ± 2.7% (n = 4) and 10.2 ± 5.0% (n = 4), respectively, in a total synthesis time of about 2 h. Preliminary in vivo studies in nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts revealed highest accumulation of both tracers in the liver, followed by spleen, kidney, lung and bone, with no substantial uptake in the tumor. Still, these first-in-class radiotracers are a valuable tool for pharmacokinetic profiling and improvement of calixarene-based anti-angiogenic therapeutics in the future, as similar radiolabeling strategies may be applied to other compounds in the calixarene series. The cold reference compounds of the radiotracers were characterized in terms of cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative effects on HUVEC cells and on MA148 human ovarian carcinoma cells, along with the respective precursors, a small series of 0118 analogs modified with short-chain linear alkyl substituents, and a PEG3-spaced calixarene dimer.

Under standard conditions, it is a colorless liquid. It is hydrophobic, and thus insoluble in water, but miscible with oils. As the pyrophosphate ester, farnesol is a precursor to many terpenes and terpenoids. == Uses == Farnesol is present in many essential oils such as citronella, neroli, cyclamen, lemon grass, tuberose, rose, musk, balsam, and tolu. It is used in perfumery to emphasize the odors of sweet, floral perfumes. It enhances perfume scent by acting as a co-solvent that regulates the volatility of the odorants. It is especially used in lilac and peony perfumes. Farnesol and its ester derivatives are important precursors for a variety of other compounds used as fragrances and vitamins. === Cosmetics === Farnesol is used as a deodorant in cosmetic products. Farnesol is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery, because some people may become sensitised to it. == Natural source and synthesis == === In nature === The pyrophosphate ester of farnesol is the building blocks of possibly all acyclic sesquiterpenoids. These compounds are doubled to form 30-carbon squalene, which is the precursor for steroids in plants, animals, and fungi. Farnesyl pyrophosphate is produced from the reaction of geranyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate. Farnesyl pyrophosphate is the precursor to farnesol and farnesene. Farnesol is used by the fungus Candida albicans as a quorum sensing molecule that inhibits filamentation. === Commercial production === Obtaining farnesol from natural sources is uneconomical. In industry, farnesol is produced from linalool. == History of the name == Farnesol was named (ca. 1900–1905) after the Farnese acacia tree (Vachellia farnesiana), since the flowers from the tree were the commercial source of the floral essence in which the chemical was identified. This particular acacia species, in turn, is named after Cardinal Odoardo Farnese (1573–1626) of the Italian Farnese family who (from 1550 though the 17th century) maintained some of the first private European botanical gardens in the Farnese Gardens in Rome. The addition of the -ol suffix implies an alcohol.

We systemically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to August 2020. Statistical heterogeneities were computed using Cochrane's Q test and I From 341citations, seven trials were included into our meta-analysis. Our findings demonstrated that beraprost sodium intake significantly decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (WMD = -5.62, 95% CI [-8.49, -2.74], P < 0.001) and cystatin C (WMD = -0.57, 95% CI [-0.68, -0.46], P < 0.001). Beraprost sodium intake had no significant effect on fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and creatinine (Cr) in patients with diabetes receiving beraprost sodium in comparison with the controls. Our meta-analysis revealed that beraprost sodium administration significantly decreased BUN and cystatin C levels in patients with diabetes. However, no significant effect was observed on the cardiometabolic profile. Beraprost sodium (BPS) is a stable orally active prostacyclin analogue with vasodilatory and anti-platelet effects, and has been widely used as therapeutics for pulmonary artery hypertension and chronic arterial obstruction. In order to elucidate its effects on endothelium, we first examined the short-term effects of BPS on nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation using bovine aortic endothelial cells. Short-term treatment of BPS induced NO production as well as eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179 mediated via cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. The effects of BPS on capillary-like tube formation were next determined using human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs)/normal human dermal fibroblasts co-culture system. BPS was observed to induce capillary-like tube formation mediated via cAMP/PKA pathway, but not via NO generation. Finally, we performed DNA microarray analyses using RNA extracted from BPS treated HUVECs. Interestingly, BPS up-regulated several genes involved in angiogenesis, anti-atherosclerosis, and endothelial function, while down-regulated several genes involved in atherosclerosis. Our data therefore indicate that BPS may be useful not only for patients with pulmonary artery hypertension and chronic arterial obstruction, but also for general atherosclerotic patients complicated with endothelial dysfunction. Further studies are needed to clarify molecular mechanisms of these BPS effects including the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a fatal condition that affects many dogs. In humans, PH is often treated with beraprost sodium (BPS). However, the effectiveness of BPS for canine PH has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and cardiovascular response of BPS in canine patients with PH of various causes.

1336,"('Oxcarbazepine', 'Gp 47680', 'Trileptal', 'Oxcarbamazepine', 'Oxcarbazepina')",Medical,"Oxcarbazepine, sold under the brand name Trileptal among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy. For epilepsy it is used for both focal seizures and generalized seizures. It has been used both alone and as add-on therapy in people with bipolar disorder who have had no success with other treatments. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, double vision and trouble with walking. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, pancreatitis, suicide ideation, and an abnormal heart beat. While use during pregnancy may harm the baby, use may be less risky than having a seizure. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding. In those with an allergy to carbamazepine there is a 25% risk of problems with oxcarbazepine. How it works is not entirely clear. Oxcarbazepine was patented in 1969 and came into medical use in 1990. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 167th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Neurology === Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant used to reduce the occurrence of epileptic episodes, and is not intended to cure epilepsy. Oxcarbazepine is used alone or in combination with other medications for the treatment of focal (partial) seizures in adults. In pediatric populations, it can be used by itself for the treatment of partial seizures for children 4 years and older, or in combination with other medications for children 2 years and older. There is some evidence to support its effectiveness in reducing seizure frequency when used as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy but there are concerns over tolerability. === Psychiatry === Oxcarbazepine (brand name Trileptal), has been historically used off-label by psychiatrists as a mood stabilizer. However, due to the limited data supporting efficacy it is typically reserved for patients for whom other medications have not worked or are contraindicated. == Side effects == Side effects are dose-dependent. The most common include dizziness, blurred or double vision, nystagmus, ataxia, fatigue, headaches, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, difficulty in concentration, and mental sluggishness. The incidence of movement disorders appears to be lower compared to carbamazepine. Other, rare, side effects of oxcarbazepine include severe low blood sodium (hyponatremia), anaphylaxis / angioedema, hypersensitivity (especially if experienced with carbamazepine), toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and thoughts of suicide. Measurement of serum sodium levels should be considered in maintenance treatment or if symptoms of hyponatremia develop. Low blood sodium is seen in 20–30% of people taking oxcarbazepine, and 8–12% of those experience severe hyponatremia. Some side effects, such as headaches, are more pronounced shortly after a dose is taken and tend to fade with time (60 to 90 minutes). Other side effects include stomach pain, tremor, rash, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, and dry mouth. Photosensitivity is a potential side-effect and people could experience severe sunburns as a result of sun exposure. Oxcarbazepine may lead to hypothyroxinemia. The well-known reduction in free and total thyroxine concentration may be due to both peripheral and central mechanisms. == Pregnancy == Oxcarbazepine is pregnancy category C in the US. There is limited data supporting its safety in pregnancy. Several alternative medications with similar efficacy profiles provide significantly more robust data to support safety during pregnancy. However limited recent research shows similar rates of fetal malformations in exposed pregnancies to the general non-teratogen exposed population. Careful consideration of the risks, benefits, alternatives, and expert advise is needed when considering Oxcarbazepine use during pregnancy. Historically Oxcarbazepine was considered to be teratogenic in humans due to animal studies which have shown increased fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats and rabbits exposed to oxcarbazepine during pregnancy. Additionally it's similar structure of to carbamazepine, raised concern as it is teratogenic in humans (pregnancy category D). == Breastfeeding == Oxcarbazepine and its metabolite licarbazepine are both present in human breast milk and thus, some of the active drug can be transferred to a nursing infant. When considering whether to continue this medication in nursing mothers, the impact of the drug's side effect profile on the infant should be weighed against its anti-epileptic benefit for the mother. == Interactions == Oxcarbazepine, licarbazepine and many other common drugs influence each other through interaction with the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. This leads to a cluster of dozens of common drugs interacting with one another to varying degrees, some of which are especially noteworthy. Oxcarbazepine and licarbazepine are potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and thus have the potential to increase plasma concentration of drugs, which are metabolized through this pathway. Other antiepileptics, which are CYP2C19 substrates and thus may be metabolised at a reduced rate when combined with oxcarbazepine, include diazepam, hexobarbital, mephenytoin, methylphenobarbital, nordazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone. In addition, oxcarbazepine and licarbazepine are CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inducers and thus have the potential to decrease the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 substrates, including calcium channel antagonists against high blood pressure and oral contraceptives. However, whether the extent of CYP3A4/5 induction at therapeutic doses reaches clinical significance is unclear. == Pharmacology == Oxcarbazepine is a prodrug, which is largely metabolized to its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy derivative licarbazepine (sometimes abbreviated MHD). Oxcarbazepine and MHD exert their action by blocking voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thus leading to the stabilization of hyper-excited neural membranes, suppression of repetitive neuronal firing and diminishment propagation of synaptic impulses. Furthermore, anticonvulsant effects of these compounds could be attributed to enhanced potassium conductance and modulation of high-voltage activated calcium channels. === Pharmacokinetics === Oxcarbazepine has high bioavailability upon oral administration. In a study in humans, only 2% of oxcarbazepine remained unchanged, 70% were reduced to licarbazepine; the rest were minor metabolites. The half-life of oxcarbazepine is considered to be about 2 hours, whereas licarbazepine has a half-life of nine hours. Through its chemical difference to carbamazepine metabolic epoxidation is avoided, reducing hepatic risks. Licarbazepine is metabolised by conjugation with Glucuronic acid. Approximately 4% are oxidised to the inactive 10,11-dihydroxy derivative. Elimination is almost completely renal, with faeces accounting to less than 4%. 80% of the excreted substances are to be attributed to licarbazepine or its glucuronides. === Pharmacodynamics === Both oxcarbazepine and licarbazepine were found to show anticonvulsant properties in seizure models done on animals. These compounds had protective functions whenever tonic extension seizures were induced electrically, but such protection was less apparent whenever seizures were induced chemically. There was no observable tolerance during a four weeks course of treatment with daily administration of oxcarbazepine or licarbazepine in electroshock test on mice and rats. Most of the antiepileptic activity can be attributed to licarbazepine. Aside from its reduction in side effects, it is presumed to have the same main mechanism as carbamazepine, sodium channel inhibition, and is generally used to treat the same conditions. === Pharmacogenetics === The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele B*1502 has been associated with an increased incidence of Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in people treated with carbamazepine, and thus those treated with oxcarbazepine might have similar risks. People of Asian descent are more likely to carry this genetic variant, especially some Malaysian populations, Koreans (2%), Han Chinese (2–12%), Indians (6%), Thai (8%), and Philippines (15%). Therefore, it has been suggested to consider genetic testing in these people prior to initiation of treatment. === Structure === Oxcarbazepine is a structural derivative of carbamazepine, with a ketone in place of the carbon–carbon double bond on the dibenzazepine ring at the 10 position (10-keto). This difference helps reduce the impact on the liver of metabolizing the drug, and also prevents the serious forms of anemia or agranulocytosis occasionally associated with carbamazepine. Aside from this reduction in side effects, it is thought to have the same mechanism as carbamazepine — sodium channel inhibition (presumed to be the main mechanism of action) – and is generally used to treat the same conditions. Oxcarbazepine is a prodrug which is activated to licarbazepine in the liver. == History == First made in 1966, it was patent-protected by Geigy in 1969 through DE 2011087 . It was approved for use as an anticonvulsant in Denmark in 1990, Spain in 1993, Portugal in 1997, and eventually for all other EU countries in 1999. It was approved in the US in 2000. In September 2010, Novartis, of which Geigy are part of its corporate roots, pleaded guilty to marketing Trileptal for the unapproved uses of neuropathic pain and bipolar disorder. == Research == Antiepileptics are a key pharmacological therapy used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Research has investigated the use of oxcarbazepine as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder, with further evidence needed to fully assess its suitability. Oxcarbazepine used in conjunction with lithium has been shown to be effective in the maintenance phase. It may be beneficial in trigeminal neuralgia. == References ==",Trileptal,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2159273865108844e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016783259343355894)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/trileptal.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=78, start_index=9, title='Trileptal: Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/trileptal.html?utm_source=openai')])"
1337,"('Brilliant blue fcf', 'Acid blue 9', 'Fd&c blue no. 1', 'Brilliant blue', 'Fd&c blue no. 1 aluminum lake')","Food, Medical, Personal Care","Brilliant blue FCF (Blue 1) is a synthetic organic compound used primarily as a blue colorant for processed foods, medications, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. It is classified as a triarylmethane dye and is known under various names, such as FD&C Blue No. 1 or acid blue 9. It is denoted by E number E133 and has a color index of 42090. It has the appearance of a blue powder and is soluble in water and glycerol, with a maximum absorption at about 628 nanometers. It is one of the oldest FDA-approved color additives, having been permanently listed for use in food and ingested drugs in 1969. It is generally considered nontoxic and safe for consumption. == Production == Brilliant blue FCF is a synthetic dye produced by the condensation of 2-formylbenzenesulfonic acid and the appropriate aniline followed by oxidation. It can be combined with tartrazine (E102) to produce various shades of green. It is usually a disodium salt. The diammonium salt has CAS number 2650-18-2. Calcium and potassium salts are also permitted. It can also appear as an aluminium lake. The chemical formula is C37H34N2Na2O9S3. Related dyes are C.I. acid green 3 (CAS#4680-78-8) and acid green 9 (CAS#4857-81-2). In these dyes, the 2-sulfonic acid group is replaced by H and Cl, respectively. Many attempts have been made to find similarly colored natural dyes that are as stable as brilliant blue FCF. Blue pigments must possess many chemical traits, including pi-bond conjugation, aromatic rings, heteroatoms and heteroatom groups, and ionic charges in order to absorb low energy red light. Most natural blue dyes are either unstable, blue only in alkaline conditions, or toxic; good candidates for further research into use as natural dyes include anthocyanin and trichotomine derivatives. No replacement for brilliant blue FCF has been found for use in beverages. == Applications == Like many other color additives, the primary use of Blue No. 1 is to correct or enhance natural coloring or to give colorless compounds a vivid hue. In the United States, of the two approved blue dyes (the other being Indigo carmine, or FD&C Blue #2), brilliant blue FCF is the more common of the two. As a blue color, brilliant blue FCF is often found in cotton candy, ice cream, canned processed peas, packet soups, bottled food colorings, icings, ice pops, blueberry flavored products, children's medications, dairy products, sweets soft drinks, and drinks, especially the liqueur Blue Curaçao. It is also used in soaps, shampoos, mouthwash and other hygiene and cosmetics applications. Brilliant blue FCF is extensively used as a water tracer agent. Due to its ability to retain color for long periods of time, brilliant blue FCF outperforms other dye tracers. Additionally, brilliant blue FCF has a low toxicity level that is favorable for the environment. However, brilliant blue FCF has different impacts on varying soils. Brilliant blue FCF is attracted to and sorbed in acidic soils due to its large size and ionic charge. Soil composition and flow velocity also affect the level of sorption of brilliant blue FCF. Brilliant blue FCF dye within beverages items—such as soda—can be used in the blue bottle experiment. In such foods, both the dye and reducing agents are incorporated in the same solution. When the solution is blue, oxygen is present. On the addition of NaOH, a reaction occurs that removes the oxygen, turning the solution clear. The dye turns back to blue once it is reoxidized by swirling the solution, incorporating oxygen from the air as an oxidizing agent. == Health and safety == When applied to the tongue or to shaven skin, brilliant blue FCF can be absorbed directly into the bloodstream. However, it is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and 95% of the ingested dye can be found in the feces. Due to its nontoxic properties, brilliant blue FCF has been used as a biological stain. When dissolved in an acidic medium, this dye has been used to stain cell walls, bacteria, and fungal cells. The dye does not inhibit the growth of any of these species. For similar reasons, brilliant blue FCF is also being utilized in hemostatic medical devices, most notably the Hemopatch—designed to be placed on bleeding tissues and coagulate the blood. A low concentration of brilliant blue FCF is placed on the backside of the Hemopatch at 1 cm increments, allowing surgeons to cut precisely and indicate the side of the Hemopatch that is an active hemostatic agent for correct placement. Brilliant blue FCF is an approved food colorant and pharmacologically inactive substance for drug formulations in the EU and the United States. It is also legal in other countries. In a 1979 clinical trial of patients with perennial asthma, brilliant blue FCF, tested alongside two other non-azobenzene dyes (Erythrosine & Indigotin), was found to have no effect on pulmonary function in 42 of 43 participants. This indicates that brilliant blue FCF is highly unlikely to cause allergic reactions in individuals with pre-existing moderate asthma. But, a case study of a 55-year-old man in 1996 reporting occupational asthma when exposed to Indigotine (a derivative of Indigotin) at work found reduced pulmonary function could be recapitulated under laboratory conditions upon exposure; suggesting that there may be some people sensitive to non-azobenzene dyes or just Indigotin particularly. In 2003, the U.S. FDA issued a public health advisory to warn health care providers of the potential toxicity of this synthetic dye in enteral feeding solutions. The following legal limits apply in the EU (E 133) and other countries: 150–300 mg/kg depending on the type of food. Safety limit for foods and drugs: 0.1 mg/day per kg body weight. The acceptable daily intake for brilliant blue FCF is 6 mg/kg. == Biomedical research == Brilliant blue FCF and similar dyes such as brilliant blue G are inhibitors to purinergic receptors—receptors that are responsible for inflammatory responses and other cell process. Scientists who were conducting in-vivo studies of compounds to lessen the severity of inflammation following experimental spinal cord injury had previously tested a compound called OxATP to block a key ATP receptor in spinal neurons. However, OxATP has toxic side effects and must be injected directly into the spinal cord; in searching for alternatives they noted that brilliant blue FCF has a similar structure. This led them to test a related dye, brilliant blue G (also known as Coomassie brilliant blue) in rats, which improved recovery from spinal cord injury while temporarily turning them blue. When human washed platelets are evaluated using turbidimetry it was found that brilliant blue FCF affects platelet aggregation by blocking the Panx1 channels. These inhibitory effects on collagen-induced shape change and maximal aggregation were shown by high (1 mM) concentrations of the dye but not by lower concentrations (100 μM). The 1 mM effective concentration is 1.59 times greater than the approximately 0.63 mM maximal allowable brilliant blue FCF concentration according to the European Food Safety Authority. Scientists are performing studies to better understand the effects of brilliant blue FCF during vein graft explantation. Brilliant blue FCF hinders the purinergic receptors, limiting cell proliferation that may lead to intimal hyperplasia. The effects of brilliant blue FCF were tested on rat aortic cells. It was found that brilliant blue FCF had a positive impact in limiting the development of intimal hyperplasia following a vein graft procedure. == References == == Further reading == == External links == The Chemistry of Colors Some more details, other common names FDA Public Health Advisory on use in enteral feeding The Feingold Diet; Dubious Benefits, Subtle Risks",Acid blue 9,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.31417661905288696), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -0.16193555295467377), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' PERSONAL', -9.758300438988954e-05), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.1272488236427307), (' INDUSTR', -0.00023119196703191847), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.05970766395330429), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0006569849792867899), ('ĠMED', -0.6113153696060181), ('ICAL', -2.50339189733495e-06), (',', -0.0002658013836480677), ('ĠPERSON', -0.0025015748105943203), ('AL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), ('ĠCARE', -7.521823135903105e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2519625723361969)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.5759434103965759), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -9.088346359931165e-07), (' FOOD', -0.0002546641044318676), (',', -0.001170225441455841), (' PERSONAL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_blue_FCF?utm_source=openai), [cosmeticsinfo.org](https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/acid-blue-9/?utm_source=openai), [dyeindustry.com](https://www.dyeindustry.com/info/the-application-range-of-acid-blue-95685057.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=335, start_index=33, title='Brilliant blue FCF', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_blue_FCF?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=335, start_index=33, title='Acid Blue 9 - Cosmetics Info', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/acid-blue-9/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=335, start_index=33, title='The application range of Acid Blue 9 - Knowledge', type='url_citation', url='https://www.dyeindustry.com/info/the-application-range-of-acid-blue-95685057.html?utm_source=openai')])"

1339,"('Dexmedetomidine (hydrochloride)', 'Medetomidine (hydrochloride)', '(s)-medetomidine (hydrochloride)', 'Dexmedetomidinum', 'Dexmedetomidina')",Medical," OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of IM administration of a tiletamine hydrochloride-zolazepam hydrochloride (TZ) combination with either dexmedetomidine hydrochloride or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (SS) on the motor response to claw clamping, selected cardiorespiratory variables, and quality of recovery from anesthesia in alpacas. ANIMALS 5 adult sexually intact male alpacas. PROCEDURES Each alpaca was given the TZ combination (2 mg/kg) with dexmedetomidine (5 [D5], 10 [D10], 15 [D15], or 20 [D20] µg/kg) or SS IM at 1-week intervals (5 experiments); motor response to claw clamping was assessed, and characteristics of anesthesia, recovery from anesthesia, and selected cardiorespiratory variables were recorded. RESULTS Mean ± SEM duration of lack of motor response to claw clamping was longest when alpacas received treatments D15 (30.9 ± 5.9 minutes) and D20 (40.8 ± 5.9 minutes). Duration of lateral recumbency was significantly longer with dexmedetomidine administration. The longest time (81.3 ± 10.4 minutes) to standing was observed when alpacas received treatment D20. Following treatment SS, 4 alpacas moved in response to claw clamping at the 5-minute time point. Heart rate decreased from pretreatment values in all alpacas when dexmedetomidine was administered. Treatments D10, D15, and D20 decreased Pao2, compared with treatment SS, during the first 15 minutes. During recovery, muscle stiffness and multiple efforts to regain a sternal position were observed in 3 SS-treated and 1 D5-treated alpacas; all other recoveries were graded as excellent. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In TZ-anesthetized alpacas, dexmedetomidine (10, 15, and 20 µg/kg) administered IM increased the duration of lack of motor response to claw clamping, compared with the effect of SS. Liver injury seriously threatens the health of people. Meanwhile, dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (DEX) can protect against liver injury. However, the mechanism by which Dex mediates the progression of liver injury remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the function of DEX in oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated hepatocytes and its underlying mechanism. In order to investigate the function of DEX in liver injury, WRL-68 cells were treated with OGD. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Inflammatory cytokines levels were measured by ELISA assay. The interaction between miR-194 and TUG1 or SIRT1 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter. Gene and protein levels were measured by qPCR or western blotting. DEX notably reversed OGD-induced inflammation and apoptosis in WRL-68 cell. Meanwhile, the effect of OGD on TUG1, SIRT1 and miR-194 expression in WRL-68 cells was reversed by DEX treatment. However, TUG1 knockdown or miR-194 overexpression reversed the function of DEX in OGD-treated WRL-68 cells. Moreover, TUG1 could promote the expression of SIRT1 by sponging miR-194. Furthermore, knockdown of TUG1 promoted OGD-induced cell growth inhibition and inflammatory responses, while miR-194 inhibitor or SIRT1 overexpression partially reversed this phenomenon. DEX could suppress OGD-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and inflammation by mediation of TUG1/miR-194/SIRT1 axis. Therefore, this study might provide a scientific basis for the application of DEX on liver injury treatment. Dexmendetomidine hydrochloride (DEX) is a new common adrenergic receptor agonist, which not only keeps children calm but also has analgesic effect. Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride will enable children to maintain the natural non-REM sleep, which can be stimulated sedation or language arousal. The aim of this study is to observe the sedative effect and adverse drug reactions of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection and propofol injection in MRI examination. In this study, no children in the experimental group were required to add sedative drugs, and 2 cases in the control group were treated with sedative drugs. In experimental group, it used dexmedetomidine hydrochloride as (1.64±0.91) g/kg; in control group, dosage of narcotic drugs as (5.26±1.82) g/kg, and the total complication rate of the children in the experimental group was lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). After returning to the ward, the doses of phenobarbital sedation were dexmedetomidine group (4.28±1.53) mg/kg and propofol group (6.40±1.71) mg/kg. There was significant difference between the two groups. The total complication rate in the experimental group was lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). The quality of MRI in the test group was significantly higher than that in the control group, which showed that dexmedetomidine hydrochloride could provide a satisfactory sedative effect in the MRI examination of children.

1340,"('Medetomidine', 'Medetomidina', 'Medetomidinum', 'Medetomidinum [latin]', 'Medetomidina [spanish]')",Medical,"Medetomidine is a veterinary anesthetic drug with potent sedative effects and emerging illicit drug adulterant. It is a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers, levomedetomidine and dexmedetomidine, the latter being the isomer with the pharmacologic effect as an alpha 2- adrenergic agonist. Effects can be reversed using atipamezole. It was developed by Orion Pharma. It is approved for dogs in the United States, and distributed in the United States by Pfizer Animal Health and by Novartis Animal Health in Canada under the product name Domitor. Starting in 2022 Medetomidine has been detected in the US in samples of illicit drugs and associated with overdoses. The free base form of medetomidine is sold as an antifouling substance for marine paints. == History == Medetomidine was developed by Orion Pharma and launched in 2007. == Pharmacology == Medetomidine is a racemic mixture of two optical or stereoisomers, levomedetomidine and dexmedetomidine. The latter causes the alpha 2- adrenergic agonist effects. It is often used as the hydrochloride salt, medetomidine hydrochloride, a crystalline white solid that can be administered as an intravenous drug solution with sterile water. == Veterinary use == In veterinary anesthesia, medetomidine is used as both a surgical and analgesic in combinations with opioids (butorphanol, buprenorphine etc.) as premedication (before a general anesthetic) in healthy cats and dogs. It is sometimes used in combination with butorphanol and ketamine (given IM) to produce general anaesthesia for short periods in healthy, but fractious felines, that will not allow an intravenous induction agent to be given providing a good degree of muscle relaxation. It has also been used in combination with morphine (or methadone), lidocaine and ketamine in constant rate infusion analgesia in canines. It is often used in so called microdoses for this analgesic effect. It is thought that this family of drugs has a degree of analgesic action, though this is, in comparison to the sedative effect, minor. It can be given by intramuscular injection (IM), subcutaneous injection (SC) or intravenous injection (IV). When delivered intravenously, a significantly decreased dose is used. Some authors suggest a sublingual route is also effective. It is not recommended for diabetics and is contraindicated in patients with cardiac disease. Due to its potent sedative effects it is commonly used in more aggressive animals, where a drug combination with a lesser effect (such as acepromazine plus an opioid, or an opioid plus a benzodiazepine) would not allow the administration of the inductive agent without risk to the veterinarian. As such the use of alpha-two agonists is only recommended in healthy animals. === Side effects === Following administration, marked peripheral vasoconstriction and bradycardia are noted. Often the dosage of induction agents (e.g. propofol) may be drastically reduced, as may the volumes of anesthetic gases (i.e. halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane) used to maintain general anesthesia. Its effects can be reversed using atipamezole distributed as Antisedan by Pfizer. IV use of atipamezole is not licensed, IM is the preferred route. Yohimbine may also be used in an emergency situation, but is not licensed. == Use in marine paint == The free base form of medetomidine is sold as Selektope as an antifouling substance in marine paints. It is mainly effective against barnacles, as shown in vitro with Balanus improvisus. It has also shown effect on other hard fouling like tube worms. When the barnacle cyprid larva encounters a surface containing medetomidine the molecule interacts with the octopamine receptor in the larva. This causes the settling larva to increase its kicking to more than 100 kicks per minute, which makes becoming sessile nearly impossible. When the larva swims away from the surface, the effect disappears (reversible effect). The larva regains its pre-exposure function and can settle somewhere else. == Illicit use in humans == === Component of street drugs === Medetomidine has been found as a component in street drug mixtures in the US starting in 2022, containing synthetic opioids in a similar manner as xylazine-fentanyl, such mixtures have been nicknamed ""tranq"" (short for tranquilizer). The combination of α2 adrenergic agonists with opioids are believed to greatly increase the sedative effects of each drug, which some drug users may perceive as a better or more potent product. The Center for Forensic Science Research and Education (CFSRE) first identified a synthetic opioid blend containing fentanyl and medetomidine sold in Maryland in July, 2022. Additional detections in late 2023 found similar medetomidine mixtures in Missouri, Colorado, Pennsylvania, California, and Maryland found in both drug material and the blood of patients experiencing overdoses. In January 2024 drug mixtures containing medetomidine were identified in the Canadian city of Toronto, ON. In April, 2024 and May, 2024 medetomidine was found in a mixture containing fentanyl and xylazine in Philadelphia, PA and Pittsburgh, PA. Cases of overdose in Chicago from medetomidine/fentanyl mixtures have been reported In May, 2024. Massachusetts reported its first cases in August 2024. Medetomidine does not respond to naloxone, complicating the medical response to overdoses. During summer 2024 there were ""mass overdose events"" linked to medetomidine adulterated drugs in Chicago and Philadelphia. Emergency room doctors in Philadelphia reported waves of overdose patients coming in with unusually low heart rates. Public health advisories were issued. Experts warned that it was not business as usual for first responders, emergency room personnel or drug users. One researcher compared experimenting with the current drug supply to ""playing Russian roulette"". === Other criminal use === Medetomidine was found in combination with the mu-opioid antagonist and kappa-opioid agonist Butorphanol and sedative dopamine antagonist tranquilizer Azaperone in the blood of a 49-year old female homicide victim from Colorado that went missing after a bike ride in 2020. Such a mixture wouldn't be used for recreational use and would instead likely produce dysphoria with heavy sedative effects that may render a person immobile or unable to defend themselves. == References == == Further reading == Harari J (1996).

1341,"('Pazopanib', 'Pazopanib (gw-786034)', 'Gw 786034', 'Gw 78603', 'Pazopanib [inn:ban]')",Medical,"Pazopanib, sold under the brand name Votrient, is an anti-cancer medication marketed worldwide by Novartis. It is a potent and selective multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tumour growth and inhibits angiogenesis. It has been approved for renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma by numerous regulatory administrations worldwide. == Medical uses == It is approved by numerous regulatory administrations worldwide, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (19 October 2009), the European Union's European Medicines Agency (EMA) (14 June 2010), the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (14 June 2010) and Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) (30 June 2010), for use as a treatment for advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma and advanced soft tissue sarcomas. In Australia and New Zealand, it is subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and by Pharmac respectively, under a number of conditions, including: The medication is used to treat clear cell renal cell carcinoma, the most common histological subtype. The treatment phase is continuing treatment beyond three months. The patient has been issued an authority prescription for pazopanib. The patient must have stable or responding disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST). This treatment must be the sole tyrosine kinase inhibitor subsidised for this condition. Pazopanib has also demonstrated initial therapeutic properties in patients with aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor), ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer. However, plans to apply to the EMA for a variation to include advanced ovarian cancer have been withdrawn and a license will not be sought in any country. == Contraindications == The only contraindication is hypersensitivity to pazopanib or any of its excipients. Cautions include: Hypertension, including hypertensive crises have been reported. QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes have been reported. Thrombotic microangiopathy has been reported. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported. Haemolytic uremic syndrome has been reported. Haematologic parameter alterations have been reported in 31–37% of patients. Events of cardiac dysfunction (decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and congestive heart failure) have been observed. Fatal haemorrhage, arterial and venous thrombotic events and perforations in the gastrointestinal tract have been observed in randomized clinical trials. It has one black box warning by the US FDA, namely severe hepatotoxicity including fatalities. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects of pazopanib are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea (occurs in about half of patients), changes in hair colour, hypertension (which usually occurs during the first few weeks of treatment), appetite loss, hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, electrolyte abnormalities (including hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia), laboratory anomalies (including increased AST, ALT and protein in the urine), oedema, hair loss or discolouration, taste changes, abdominal pain, rash, fatigue and bone marrow suppression (including leucopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia). It has been associated with a low, but real risk of potentially fatal liver damage. == Overdose == The treatment for overdose is purely supportive and the symptoms include grade 3 hypertension and fatigue. == Interactions == Drug interactions include: Co-administration with strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) may increase pazopanib serum levels as it is a CYP3A4 substrate. CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine) decrease pazopanib serum levels. It is a p-glycoprotein (PGP) substrate and hence PGP inhibitors such as quinidine may interact with pazopanib. Pazopanib is not a substrate for either of the liver enzymes OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Pazopanib has inhibitory potency towards OATP1B1 but not for OATP1B3. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Pazopanib is a multiple kinase inhibitor that limits tumor growth by targeting angiogenesis via inhibition of enzymes including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), c-KIT and FGFR. === Pharmacokinetics === After oral intake of a single tablet, pazopanib has a bioavailability of 21% with a range of 14–39% between people. It reaches highest concentrations in the blood plasma after median 3.5 hours; the range in studies was 1.0 to 11.9 hours. When taken regularly, the area under the curve (AUC) increases 1.23- to 4-fold as compared to a single dose. Taking the drug together with food approximately doubles the AUC as well as the highest plasma concentrations (Cmax); and crushing the tablet increases the AUC 1.46-fold, as well doubling the Cmax. When in the bloodstream, more than 99.5% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. The liver enzyme mainly responsible for metabolizing the drug is CYP3A4; and there are minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. Metabolites identified in tests with human liver cells and microsomes include various hydroxyl derivatives and possibly a carboxylic acid. Only 6% of the circulating substance is in the form of metabolites, and all but one of them are 10- to 20-fold less active than pazopanib itself. Consequently, the metabolites are not considered important for the drug's therapeutic effect. Pazopanib is eliminated with a biological half-life of 30.9±4 hours on average (range 21–51 hours) mainly via the faeces. Less than 4% are eliminated via the urine. == References == == External links == ""Pazopanib"". Drug Information Portal. U.S. National Library of Medicine. ""Pazopanib hydrochloride"".

1342,"('Benznidazol', 'Ro 07-1051', 'Ro 71051', 'Radanil', 'Benzonidazole')",Medical,"Benznidazole is an antiparasitic medication used in the treatment of Chagas disease. While it is highly effective in early disease, the effectiveness decreases in those who have long-term infection. It is the first-line treatment given its moderate side effects compared to nifurtimox. It is taken by mouth. Side effects are fairly common. They include rash, numbness, fever, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping. Rare side effects include bone marrow suppression which can lead to low blood cell levels. It is not recommended during pregnancy or in people with severe liver or kidney disease. Benznidazole is in the nitroimidazole family of medication and works by the production of free radicals. Benznidazole came into medical use in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. As of 2012, Laboratório Farmacêutico do Estado de Pernambuco, a government run pharmaceutical company in Brazil was the only producer. == Medical uses == Benznidazole has a significant activity during the acute phase of Chagas disease, with a success rate of up to 80%. Its curative capabilities during the chronic phase are, however, limited. Some studies have found parasitologic cure (a complete elimination of T. cruzi from the body) in children during the early stage of the chronic phase, but overall failure rate in chronically infected individuals is typically above 80%. Some studies indicate treatment with benznidazole during the chronic phase, even if incapable of producing parasitologic cure because it reduces electrocardiographic changes and delays worsening of the clinical condition of the patient. Benznidazole has proven to be effective in the treatment of reactivated T. cruzi infections caused by immunosuppression, such as in people with AIDS or in those under immunosuppressive therapy related to organ transplants. === Children === Benznidazole can be used in children, with the same 5–7 mg/kg per day weight-based dosing regimen that is used to treat adult infections. A formulation for children up to two years of age is available. It was added to the WHO Essential Medicines List for Children in 2013. Children are found to be at a lower risk of adverse events compared to adults, possibly due to increased hepatic clearance of the drug. The most prevalent adverse effects in children were found to be gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic in nature. However, the incidence of severe dermatologic and neurologic adverse events is lower in the pediatric population compared to adults. It use for Chagas in children was approved by the FDA in the US in 2017. === Pregnant women === Studies in animals have shown that benznidazole can cross the placenta. Due to its potential for teratogenicity, use of benznidazole in pregnancy is not recommended. == Side effects == Side effects tend to be common and occur more frequently with increased age. The most common adverse reactions associated with benznidazole are allergic dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy. It is reported that up to 30% of people will experience dermatitis when starting treatment. Benznidazole may cause photosensitization of the skin, resulting in rashes. Rashes usually appear within the first 2 weeks of treatment and resolve over time. In rare instances, skin hypersensitivity can result in exfoliative skin eruptions, edema, and fever. Peripheral neuropathy may occur later on in the treatment course and is dose dependent. It is not permanent, but takes time to resolve. Other adverse reactions include anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, and dysgeusia, and bone marrow suppression. Gastrointestinal symptoms usually occur during the initial stages of treatment and resolves over time. Bone marrow suppression has been linked to the cumulative dose exposure. == Contraindications == Benznidazole should not be used in people with severe liver and/or kidney disease. Pregnant women should not use benznidazole because it can cross the placenta and cause teratogenicity. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Benznidazole is a nitroimidazole antiparasitic with good activity against acute infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, commonly referred to as Chagas disease. Like other nitroimidazoles, benznidazole's main mechanism of action is to generate radical species which can damage the parasite's DNA or cellular machinery. The mechanism by which nitroimidazoles do this seems to depend on whether or not oxygen is present. This is particularly relevant in the case of Trypanosoma species, which are considered facultative anaerobes. Under anaerobic conditions, the nitro group of nitroimidazoles is believed to be reduced by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase complex to create a reactive nitro radical species. The nitro radical can then either engage in other redox reactions directly or spontaneously give rise to a nitrite ion and imidazole radical instead. The initial reduction takes place because nitroimidazoles are better electron acceptors for ferredoxin than the natural substrates. In mammals, the principal mediators of electron transport are NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH, which have a more positive reduction potential and so will not reduce nitroimidazoles to the radical form. This limits the spectrum of activity of nitroimidazoles so that host cells and DNA are not also damaged. This mechanism has been well-established for 5-nitroimidazoles such as metronidazole, but it is unclear if the same mechanism can be expanded to 2-nitroimidazoles (including benznidazole). In the presence of oxygen, by contrast, any radical nitro compounds produced will be rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen, yielding the original nitroimidazole compound and a superoxide anion in a process known as ""futile cycling"". In these cases, the generation of superoxide is believed to give rise to other reactive oxygen species. The degree of toxicity or mutagenicity produced by these oxygen radicals depends on cells' ability to detoxify superoxide radicals and other reactive oxygen species. In mammals, these radicals can be converted safely to hydrogen peroxide, meaning benznidazole has very limited direct toxicity to human cells. In Trypanosoma species, however, there is a reduced capacity to detoxify these radicals, which results in damage to the parasite's cellular machinery. === Pharmacokinetics === Oral benznidazole has a bioavailability of 92%, with a peak concentration time of 3–4 hours after administration. 5% of the parent drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, which implies that clearance of benznidazole is mainly through metabolism by the liver. Its elimination half-life is 10.5-13.6 hours. == Interactions == Benznidazole and other nitroimidazoles have been shown to decrease the rate of clearance of 5-fluorouracil (including 5-fluorouracil produced from its prodrugs capecitabine, doxifluridine, and tegafur). While co-administration of any of these drugs with benznidazole is not contraindicated, monitoring for 5-fluorouracil toxicity is recommended in the event they are used together. The GLP-1 receptor agonist lixisenatide may slow down the absorption and activity of benznidazole, presumably due to delayed gastric emptying. Because nitroimidazoles can kill Vibrio cholerae cells, use is not recommended within 14 days of receiving a live cholera vaccine. Alcohol consumption can cause a disulfiram like reaction with benznidazole. == References ==",Benzonidazole,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.585470999998506e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044919890933670104)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/benznidazole-oral-route/description/drg-20406525,https://www.drugs.com/benznidazole.html,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a617043.html ', [])"
1343,"('Dicyclomine (hydrochloride)', 'Dicycloverine (hydrochloride)', 'Dicyclomine', 'Dicycloverin', 'Dicycloverine')",Medical,"Dicycloverine, also known as dicyclomine, sold under the brand name Bentyl among others, is a medication that is used to treat spasms of the intestines such as those that occur in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle. While it has been used in baby colic and enterocolitis, evidence does not support these uses. Common side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, weakness, sleepiness, and lightheadedness. Serious side effects may include psychosis and breathing problems in babies. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe while use during breastfeeding is not recommended. How it works is not entirely clear. Dicycloverine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1950. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 176th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Irritable bowel syndrome === Dicycloverine is used to treat the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, specifically hypermotility, in adults. As of 2016, clinical guidelines recommended dicycloverine and other antispasmodics for IBS with diarrhea as a first line treatment. === Anxiety === Dicycloverine can also be helpful for the treatment of anxiety, but this is an off-label use. == Contraindications == This medicine should not be used for people who have an obstructive GI or urinary condition, severe ulcerative colitis, reflux, any unstable cardiac condition, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, and anyone who is acutely bleeding. It should not be given to children or infants with colic due to the risks of convulsions, difficult breathing, irritability, and restlessness, and there is little evidence to support the efficacy in such use in any case. Dicycloverine is known to impair thinking and coordination. The effect on the baby during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not well understood. == Adverse effects == Dicycloverine can cause a range of anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, nausea, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion, severe constipation, stomach pain, heart palpitations, difficulty urinating, and seizures. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Dicycloverine is a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptor antagonist. It blocks the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors on smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract, relaxing the smooth muscle. == History == Dicycloverine was first synthesized chemically in the United States circa 1945 by scientists at William S. Merrell Company. It was first marketed in 1952 for gastrointestinal disorders, including colic in infants. The INN name ""dicycloverine"" was recommended in 1959. It was included in the combination drug for morning sickness called Bendectin, along with doxylamine and vitamin B6 which was launched in the US in 1956; dicycloverine was removed from the formulation in 1976 after Merrell determined that it added no value. Bendectin became the subject of many lawsuits due to allegations that it had caused birth defects similar to thalidomide, which Merrell had also marketed in the US and Canada. In the 1980s, several governments restricted its use in infants due to reports of convulsions, difficult breathing, irritability, and restlessness in infants given the drug. In 1994, the US Federal Trade Commission ordered Marion Merrell Dow, which had acquired Rugby Darby—the only generic manufacturer of dicycloverine in the US—to promise to grant licenses to its intellectual property on the drug to any company that wanted it, based on antitrust concerns. The US market for the medication at that time was around $8 million; Dow had 60% of it and Rugby had 40%. The next year, Hoechst Marion Roussel, which by that time had acquired the business, granted a license to Endo Pharmaceuticals. By 2000 several other generic competitors had started selling the medication. The case was part of the reshaping of the US pharmaceutical market that occurred in the 1990s, to favor generic entry. == Society and culture == Rarely, there have been reports of dicycloverine abuse. Dicycloverine is an antagonist at σ1 and 5-HT2A receptor sites, though its affinities for these targets are roughly one-fifth to one-tenth as strong as its affinities for CHRM1 and CHRM4 (its clinical targets). It is also a relatively non-polar tertiary amine, able to cross the blood–brain barrier, leading to delirium at high concentrations. == References == == External links ==",Dicycloverine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2516897186287679e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016091958968900144)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicycloverine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Dicycloverine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicycloverine?utm_source=openai')])"
1344,"('Metronidazole benzoate', 'Benzoyl metronidazole', 'Benzoylmetronidazole', 'Klion suspension', 'Flagyl s')",Medical,"Metronidazole, sold under the brand name Flagyl among others, is an antibiotic and antiprotozoal medication. It is used either alone or with other antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and bacterial vaginosis. It is effective for dracunculiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and amebiasis. It is an option for a first episode of mild-to-moderate Clostridioides difficile colitis if vancomycin or fidaxomicin is unavailable. Metronidazole is available orally (by mouth), as a cream or gel, and by slow intravenous infusion (injection into a vein). Common side effects include nausea, a metallic taste, loss of appetite, and headaches. Occasionally seizures or allergies to the medication may occur. Some state that metronidazole should not be used in early pregnancy, while others state doses for trichomoniasis are safe. Metronidazole is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. Metronidazole began to be commercially used in 1960 in France. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available in most areas of the world. In 2022, it was the 133rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Metronidazole has activity against some protozoans and most anaerobic bacteria (both Gram-negative and Gram-positive classes) but not the aerobic bacteria. Metronidazole is primarily used to treat: bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (along with other antibacterials like ceftriaxone), pseudomembranous colitis, aspiration pneumonia, rosacea (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, lung abscess, periodontal disease, amoebiasis, oral infections, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella species. It is also often used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery. Metronidazole is bitter and so the liquid suspension contains metronidazole benzoate. This may require hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract and some sources speculate that it may be unsuitable in people with diarrhea or feeding-tubes in the duodenum or jejunum. === Bacterial vaginosis === Drugs of choice for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis include metronidazole and clindamycin. An effective treatment option for mixed infectious vaginitis is a combination of clotrimazole and metronidazole. === Trichomoniasis === The 5-nitroimidazole drugs (metronidazole and tinidazole) are the mainstay of treatment for infection with Trichomonas vaginalis. Treatment for both the infected patient and the patient's sexual partner is recommended, even if asymptomatic. Therapy other than 5-nitroimidazole drugs is also an option, but cure rates are much lower. === Giardiasis === Oral metronidazole is a treatment option for giardiasis, however, the increasing incidence of nitroimidazole resistance is leading to the increased use of other compound classes. === Dracunculus === In the case of Dracunculus medinensis (Guinea worm), metronidazole merely facilitates worm extraction rather than killing the worm. === C. difficile colitis === Initial antibiotic therapy for less-severe Clostridioides difficile infection colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) consists of metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin by mouth. In 2017, the IDSA generally recommended vancomycin and fidaxomicin over metronidazole. Vancomycin by mouth has been shown to be more effective in treating people with severe C. difficile colitis. === E. histolytica === Entamoeba histolytica invasive amebiasis is treated with metronidazole for eradication, in combination with diloxanide to prevent recurrence. Although it is generally a standard treatment it is associated with some side effects. === Preterm births === Metronidazole has also been used in women to prevent preterm birth associated with bacterial vaginosis, amongst other risk factors including the presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN). Metronidazole was ineffective in preventing preterm delivery in high-risk pregnant women (selected by history and a positive fFN test) and, conversely, the incidence of preterm delivery was found to be higher in women treated with metronidazole. === Hypoxic radiosensitizer === In addition to its anti-biotic properties, attempts were also made to use a possible radiation-sensitizing effect of metronidazole in the context of radiation therapy against hypoxic tumors. However, the neurotoxic side effects occurring at the required dosages have prevented the widespread use of metronidazole as an adjuvant agent in radiation therapy. However, other nitroimidazoles derived from metronidazole such as nimorazole with reduced electron affinity showed less serious neuronal side effects and have found their way into radio-onological practice for head and neck tumors in some countries. === Perioral dermatitis === Canadian Family Physician has recommended topical metronidazole as a third-line treatment for the perioral dermatitis either along with or without oral tetracycline or oral erythromycin as first and second line treatment respectively. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of those treated with the drug) associated with systemic metronidazole therapy include: nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and metallic taste in the mouth. Intravenous administration is commonly associated with thrombophlebitis. Infrequent adverse effects include: hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itch, flushing, fever), headache, dizziness, vomiting, glossitis, stomatitis, dark urine, and paraesthesia. High doses and long-term systemic treatment with metronidazole are associated with the development of leucopenia, neutropenia, increased risk of peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system toxicity. Common adverse drug reaction associated with topical metronidazole therapy include local redness, dryness and skin irritation; and eye watering (if applied near eyes). Metronidazole has been associated with cancer in animal studies. In rare cases, it can also cause temporary hearing loss that reverses after cessation of the treatment. Some evidence from studies in rats indicates the possibility it may contribute to serotonin syndrome, although no case reports documenting this have been published to date. === Mutagenesis and carcinogenesis === In 2016 metronidazole was listed by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. Although some of the testing methods have been questioned, oral exposure has been shown to cause cancer in experimental animals and has also demonstrated some mutagenic effects in bacterial cultures. The relationship between exposure to metronidazole and human cancer is unclear. One study found an excess in lung cancer among women (even after adjusting for smoking), while other studies found either no increased risk, or a statistically insignificant risk. Metronidazole is listed as a possible carcinogen according to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). A study in those with Crohn's disease also found chromosomal abnormalities in circulating lymphocytes in people treated with metronidazole. === Stevens–Johnson syndrome === Metronidazole alone rarely causes Stevens–Johnson syndrome, but is reported to occur at high rates when combined with mebendazole. === Neurotoxicity === Several studies in the human and animal models have recorded the neurotoxicity of metronidazole. One possible mechanism underlying this toxicity is that metronidazole may interference with postsynaptic central monoaminergic neurotransmission and immunomodulation. Additionally other research suggests that the role of nitric oxide isoforms and inflammatory cytokines may also play a role. == Drug interactions == === Alcohol === Consuming alcohol while taking metronidazole has been suspected in case reports to cause a disulfiram-like reaction with effects that can include nausea, vomiting, flushing of the skin, tachycardia, and shortness of breath. People are often advised not to drink alcohol during systemic metronidazole therapy and for at least 48 hours after completion of treatment. However, some studies call into question the mechanism of the interaction of alcohol and metronidazole, and a possible central toxic serotonin reaction for the alcohol intolerance is suggested. Metronidazole is also generally thought to inhibit the liver metabolism of propylene glycol (found in some foods, medicines, and in many electronic cigarette e-liquids), thus propylene glycol may potentially have similar interaction effects with metronidazole. === Other drug interactions === Metronidazole is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2C9 belonging to the cytochrome P450 family. As a result, metronidazole may interact with medications metabolized by this enzyme. Examples of such medications are lomitapide and warfarin, to name a few. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Metronidazole is of the nitroimidazole class. It is a prodrug that inhibits nucleic acid synthesis by forming nitroso radicals, which disrupt the DNA of microbial cells. Metronidazole activates by receiving an electron from the reduced ferredoxin produced by pyruvate synthase (PFOR) in anaerobic organisms, equivalent to pyruvate dehydrogenase in aerobic organisms, thus turning into a highly reactive radical anion. After the radical loses the electron to its target, it recycles back to the unactivated form of metronidazole, ready to be activated again. This function only occurs when metronidazole is partially reduced, and because oxygen competes with metronidazole for the electron, this reduction requires a local environment with low oxygen concentration that usually happens only in anaerobic bacteria and protozoans. Therefore, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or aerobic bacteria. Elevation of oxygen level in the organism will decrease its rate of generating the activated metronidazole, but also increase the rate of recycling back to the unactivated metronidazole. === Pharmacokinetics === Oral metronidazole is approximately 80% bioavailable via the gut and peak blood plasma concentrations occur after one to two hours. Food may slow down absorption but does not diminish it. Of the circulating substance, about 20% is bound to plasma proteins. It penetrates well into tissues, the cerebrospinal fluid, the amniotic fluid and breast milk, as well as into abscess cavities. About 60% of the metronidazole is metabolized by oxidation to the main metabolite hydroxymetronidazole and a carboxylic acid derivative, and by glucuronidation. The metabolites show antibiotic and antiprotozoal activity in vitro. Metronidazole and its metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidneys (77%) and to a lesser extent via the faeces (14%). The biological half-life of metronidazole in healthy adults is eight hours, in infants during the first two months of their lives about 23 hours, and in premature babies up to 100 hours. The biological activity of hydroxymetronidazole is 30% to 65%, and the elimination half-life is longer than that of the parent compound. The serum half-life of hydroxymetronidazole after suppository was 10 hours, 19 hours after intravenous infusion, and 11 hours after a tablet. === Resistance === Resistance in parasites is found in T. vaginilis, and G. lamblia, but not E. histolytica, and two major methods are observed. The first method involves an impaired oxygen scavenging capability that increase the local concentration of oxygen, leading to the decreased activation and increased recycling of metronidazole. The second method is associated with lowered levels of pyruvate synthase and ferredoxin, the latter due to the lowered transcription of the ferredoxin gene. Strains employing the second method will still respond to a higher dosage of metronidazole. Resistance in bacteria is documented in Bacteriodes spp. that resistant to nitroimidazoles including metronidazole. In the resistant strains, 5-nitroimidazole reductase is identified as the culprit that actively reduces metronidazole to inactive forms. Currently eleven types are identified which are encoded by nimA through nimK respectively. The gene is encoded either in the chromosome or the episome. Other mechanisms may include reduced drug activation, efflux pumps, altered redox potential and biofilm formation. In the recent years it is observed that the resistance to metronidazole is increasingly common, complicating its clinical effectiveness. == History == The drug was initially developed by Rhône-Poulenc in the 1950s and licensed to G.D. Searle. Searle was acquired by Pfizer in 2003. The original patent expired in 1982, but evergreening reformulation occurred thereafter. == Brand name == In India, it is sold under the brand name Metrogyl and Flagyl. In Bangladesh, it is available as Amodis, Amotrex, Dirozyl, Filmet, Flagyl, Flamyd, Metra, Metrodol, Metryl, etc. In Pakistan, it is sold under the brand name of Flagyl and Metrozine. In the United States it is sold under the brand name Noritate. == Synthesis == 2-Methylimidazole (1) may be prepared via the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis, or from ethylenediamine and acetic acid, followed by treatment with lime, then Raney nickel. 2-Methylimidazole is nitrated to give 2-methyl-4(5)-nitroimidazole (2), which is in turn alkylated with ethylene oxide or 2-chloroethanol to give metronidazole (3): == Research == Metronidazole is researched for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Studies have shown that metronidazole can decrease the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide by activated immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. Metronidazole's immunomodulatory properties are thought to be related to its ability to decrease the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor that regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by immune cells and play a key role in the immune response. Chemokines are a type of cytokines that act as chemoattractants, meaning they attract and guide immune cells to specific sites in the body where they are needed. Cell adhesion molecules play an important role in the immune response by facilitating the interaction between immune cells and other cells in the body, such as endothelial cells, which form the lining of blood vessels. By inhibiting NF-κB activation, metronidazole can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β. Metronidazole has been studied in various immunological disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, periodontitis, and rosacea. In these conditions, metronidazole has been suspected to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects that could be beneficial in the treatment of these conditions. Despite the success in treating rosacea with metronidazole, the exact mechanism of why metronidazole in rosacea is efficient is not precisely known, i.e., which properties of metronidazole help treat rosacea: antibacterial or immunomodulatory or both, or other mechanism is involved. Increased ROS production in rosacea is thought to contribute to the inflammatory process and skin damage, so metronidazole's ability to decrease ROS may explain the mechanism of action in this disease, but this remains speculation. Metronidazole is also researched as a potential anti-inflammatory agent in periodontitis treatment. == Veterinary use == Metronidazole is used to treat infections of Giardia in dogs, cats, and other companion animals, but it does not reliably clear infection with this organism and is being supplanted by fenbendazole for this purpose in dogs and cats. It is also used for the management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal infections, periodontal disease, and systemic infections in cats and dogs. Another common usage is the treatment of systemic and/or gastrointestinal clostridial infections in horses. Metronidazole is used in the aquarium hobby to treat ornamental fish and as a broad-spectrum treatment for bacterial and protozoan infections in reptiles and amphibians. In general, the veterinary community may use metronidazole for any potentially susceptible anaerobic infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests it only be used when necessary because it has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats, as well as to prevent antimicrobial resistance. The appropriate dosage of metronidazole varies based on the animal species, the condition being treated and the specific formulation of the product. == References == == External links == ""Metronidazole and Tinidazole"".

1347,"('Saccharin', 'O-benzoic sulfimide', 'O-sulfobenzimide', 'Saccharine', 'Saccharimide')","Food, Medical","Saccharin, also called saccharine, benzosulfimide, or E954, or used in saccharin sodium or saccharin calcium forms, is a non-nutritive artificial sweetener. Saccharin is a sultam that is about 500 times sweeter than sucrose, but has a bitter or metallic aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. It is used to sweeten products, such as drinks, candies, baked goods, tobacco products, excipients, and for masking the bitter taste of some medicines. It appears as white crystals and is odorless. == Etymology == Saccharin derives its name from the word ""saccharine"", meaning ""sugary"". The word saccharine is used figuratively, often in a derogative sense, to describe something ""unpleasantly over-polite"" or ""overly sweet"". Both words are derived from the Greek word σάκχαρον (sakkharon) meaning ""gravel"". Similarly, saccharose is an obsolete name for sucrose (table sugar). == Properties == Saccharin is heat-stable. It does not react chemically with other food ingredients; as such, it stores well. Blends of saccharin with other sweeteners are often used to compensate for each sweetener's weaknesses and faults. A 10:1 cyclamate–saccharin blend is common in countries where both these sweeteners are legal; in this blend, each sweetener masks the other's offtaste. Saccharin is often used with aspartame in diet carbonated soft drinks, so some sweetness remains should the fountain syrup be stored beyond aspartame's relatively short shelf life. In its acid form, saccharin is not water-soluble. The form used as an artificial sweetener is usually its sodium salt. The calcium salt is also sometimes used, especially by people restricting their dietary sodium intake. Both salts are highly water-soluble: 0.67 g/ml in water at room temperature. == Safety and health effects == In the 1970s, studies performed on laboratory rats found an association between consumption of high doses of saccharin and the development of bladder cancer. However, further study determined that this effect was due to a mechanism that is not relevant to humans (deposition of crystals; see § History section). Epidemiological studies have shown no evidence that saccharin is associated with bladder cancer in humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) originally classified saccharin in Group 2B (""possibly carcinogenic to humans"") based on the rat studies, but downgraded it to Group 3 (""not classifiable as to the carcinogenicity to humans"") upon review of the subsequent research. Saccharin has no food energy and no nutritional value. It is safe to consume for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. People with sulfonamide allergies can experience allergic reactions to saccharin, although it has been suggested that this may be due to a general predisposition to allergic reactions rather than a specific cross-reaction between antimicrobial sulfonamides and non-antimicrobial ones (like saccharin). == History == Saccharin was produced first in 1879, by Constantin Fahlberg, a chemist working on coal tar derivatives in Ira Remsen's laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his hand one evening, and connected this with the compound benzoic sulfimide on which he had been working that day. Fahlberg and Remsen published articles on benzoic sulfimide in 1879 and 1880. In 1884, then working on his own in New York City, Fahlberg applied for patents in several countries, describing methods of producing this substance that he named saccharin. Two years later, he began production of the substance in a factory in a suburb of Magdeburg in Germany. Fahlberg would soon grow wealthy, while Remsen merely grew irritated, believing he deserved credit for substances produced in his laboratory. On the matter, Remsen commented, ""Fahlberg is a scoundrel. It nauseates me to hear my name mentioned in the same breath with him."" Although saccharin was commercialized not long after its discovery, until sugar shortages during World War I, its use had not become widespread. Its popularity further increased during the 1960s and 1970s among dieters, since saccharin is a calorie-free sweetener. In the United States, saccharin is often found in restaurants in pink packets; the most popular brand is ""Sweet'n Low"". Due to the difficulty of importing sugar from the West Indies during World War I, the British Saccharin Company was founded in 1917 to produce saccharin at its Paragon Works near Accrington, Lancashire. Production was licensed and controlled by the Board of Trade in London. Production continued on the site until 1926. === Government regulation === Starting in 1907, the United States Food and Drug Administration began investigating saccharin as a result of the Pure Food and Drug Act. Harvey Wiley, then the director of the bureau of chemistry for the FDA, viewed it as an illegal substitution of a valuable ingredient, sugar, by a less valuable ingredient. In a clash that had career consequences, Wiley told President Theodore Roosevelt, ""Everyone who ate that sweet corn was deceived. He thought he was eating sugar, when in point of fact he was eating a coal tar product totally devoid of food value and extremely injurious to health."" But Roosevelt himself was a consumer of saccharin, and, in a heated exchange, Roosevelt angrily answered Wiley by stating, ""Anybody who says saccharin is injurious to health is an idiot."" The episode proved the undoing of Wiley's career. In 1911, Food Inspection Decision 135 stated that foods containing saccharin were adulterated. However, in 1912, Food Inspection Decision 142 stated that saccharin was not harmful. More controversy was stirred in 1969 with the discovery of files from the FDA's investigations of 1948 and 1949. These investigations, which had originally argued against saccharin use, were shown to prove little about saccharin being harmful to human health. In 1977, the FDA made an attempt to completely ban the substance, following studies showing that the substance caused bladder cancer in rats. The attempted ban was unsuccessful due to public opposition that was encouraged by industry advertisements, and instead the following label was mandated: ""Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals"". That requirement was dropped in 2000 following new research that concluded humans reacted differently than rats and were not at risk of cancer at typical intake levels. (See also: § Warning label addition and removal below.) The sweetener has continued to be widely used in the United States and is now the third-most popular artificial sweetener behind sucralose and aspartame. In the European Union, saccharin is also known by the E number (additive code) E954. The current status of saccharin is that it is allowed in most countries, and countries such as Canada have lifted their previous ban of it as a food additive. The claims that it is associated with bladder cancer were shown to be unfounded in experiments on primates. (It is, however, prohibited to mail saccharin tablets or packets to France.) Saccharin was formerly on California's list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer for the purposes of Proposition 65, but it was delisted in 2001. ==== Warning label addition and removal ==== In 1958, the United States Congress amended the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 with the Delaney clause to mandate that the Food and Drug Administration not approve substances that ""induce cancer in man, or, after tests, [are] found to induce cancer in animals."" Studies in laboratory rats during the early 1970s linked saccharin with the development of bladder cancer in rodents. As a consequence, all food containing saccharin was labeled with a warning meeting the requirement of the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act of 1977. However, in 2000, the warning labels were removed because scientists learned that rodents, unlike humans, have a unique combination of high pH, high calcium phosphate, and high protein levels in their urine. One or more of the proteins that are more prevalent in male rats combine with calcium phosphate and saccharin to produce microcrystals that damage the lining of the bladder. Over time, the rat's bladder responds to this damage by overproducing cells to repair the damage, which leads to tumor formation. Since this does not occur in humans, there is no elevated risk of bladder cancer. The delisting of saccharin led to legislation repealing the warning label requirement for products containing saccharin. In 2001, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the state of California reversed their positions on saccharin, declaring it safe for consumption. The FDA's decision followed a 2000 determination by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Toxicology Program to remove saccharin from its list of carcinogens. The Environmental Protection Agency has officially removed saccharin and its salts from their list of hazardous constituents and commercial chemical products. In a release in December 2010, the EPA stated that saccharin is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health. == Chemistry == === Preparation === Saccharin can be produced in various ways. The original route by Remsen and Fahlberg starts with toluene; another route begins with o-chlorotoluene. Sulfonation of toluene by chlorosulfonic acid gives the ortho and para substituted sulfonyl chlorides. The ortho isomer is separated and converted to the sulfonamide with ammonia. Oxidation of the methyl substituent gives the carboxylic acid, which cyclicizes to give saccharin free acid: In 1950, an improved synthesis was developed at the Maumee Chemical Company of Toledo, Ohio. In this synthesis, the methyl anthranilate successively reacts with nitrous acid (from sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid), sulfur dioxide, chlorine, and then ammonia to yield saccharin: === Properties and reactions === The free acid of saccharin has a low pKa of 1.6 (the acidic hydrogen being that attached to the nitrogen). Saccharin can be used to prepare exclusively disubstituted amines from alkyl halides via a nucleophilic substitution, followed by a Gabriel synthesis. == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Saccharin at Wikimedia Commons",Saccharine,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0003326049481984228), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.16028404235839844), (' INDUSTR', -0.6971596479415894), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.0021820086985826492), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.25201669335365295), ('ĠINDU', -0.04460325092077255), ('ST', -2.1457441107486375e-05), ('RI', -2.50339189733495e-06), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.023329302668571472)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=85, start_index=6, title='Saccharin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin?utm_source=openai')])"
1348,"('Creatine', 'Creatin', 'Kreatin', 'N-amidinosarcosine', 'Krebiozon')","Endogenous, Food, Medical, Personal Care","Creatine ( or ) is an organic compound with the nominal formula (H2N)(HN)CN(CH3)CH2CO2H. It exists in various tautomers in solutions (among which are neutral form and various zwitterionic forms). Creatine is found in vertebrates, where it facilitates recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), primarily in muscle and brain tissue. Recycling is achieved by converting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP via donation of phosphate groups. Creatine also acts as a buffer. == History == Creatine was first identified in 1832 when Michel Eugène Chevreul isolated it from the basified water-extract of skeletal muscle. He later named the crystallized precipitate after the Greek word for meat, κρέας (kreas). In 1928, creatine was shown to exist in equilibrium with creatinine. Studies in the 1920s showed that consumption of large amounts of creatine did not result in its excretion. This result pointed to the ability of the body to store creatine, which in turn suggested its use as a dietary supplement. In 1912, Harvard University researchers Otto Folin and Willey Glover Denis found evidence that ingesting creatine can dramatically boost the creatine content of the muscle. In the late 1920s, after finding that the intramuscular stores of creatine can be increased by ingesting creatine in larger than normal amounts, scientists discovered phosphocreatine (creatine phosphate), and determined that creatine is a key player in the metabolism of skeletal muscle. It is naturally formed in vertebrates. The discovery of phosphocreatine was reported in 1927. In the 1960s, creatine kinase (CK) was shown to phosphorylate ADP using phosphocreatine (PCr) to generate ATP. It follows that ATP - not PCr - is directly consumed in muscle contraction. CK uses creatine to ""buffer"" the ATP/ADP ratio. While creatine's influence on physical performance has been well documented since the early twentieth century, it came into public view following the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. An August 7, 1992 article in The Times reported that Linford Christie, the gold medal winner at 100 meters, had used creatine before the Olympics (however, it should also be noted that Christie was found guilty of doping later in his career). An article in Bodybuilding Monthly named Sally Gunnell, who was the gold medalist in the 400-meter hurdles, as another creatine user. In addition, The Times also noted that 100 meter hurdler Colin Jackson began taking creatine before the Olympics. At the time, low-potency creatine supplements were available in Britain, but creatine supplements designed for strength enhancement were not commercially available until 1993 when a company called Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS) introduced the compound to the sports nutrition market under the name Phosphagen. Research performed thereafter demonstrated that the consumption of high glycemic carbohydrates in conjunction with creatine increases creatine muscle stores. == Metabolic role == Creatine is a naturally occurring non-protein compound and the primary constituent of phosphocreatine, which is used to regenerate ATP within the cell. 95% of the human body's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle, while the remainder is distributed in the blood, brain, testes, and other tissues. The typical creatine content of skeletal muscle (as both creatine and phosphocreatine) is 120 mmol per kilogram of dry muscle mass, but can reach up to 160 mmol/kg through supplementation. Approximately 1–2% of intramuscular creatine is degraded per day and an individual would need about 1–3 grams of creatine per day to maintain average (unsupplemented) creatine storage. An omnivorous diet provides roughly half of this value, with the remainder synthesized in the liver and kidneys. Creatine is not an essential nutrient. It is an amino acid derivative, naturally produced in the human body from the amino acids glycine and arginine, with an additional requirement for S-adenosyl methionine (a derivative of methionine) to catalyze the transformation of guanidinoacetate to creatine. In the first step of the biosynthesis, the enzyme arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT, EC:2.1.4.1) mediates the reaction of glycine and arginine to form guanidinoacetate. This product is then methylated by guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT, EC:2.1.1.2), using S-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor. Creatine itself can be phosphorylated by creatine kinase to form phosphocreatine, which is used as an energy buffer in skeletal muscles and the brain. A cyclic form of creatine, called creatinine, exists in equilibrium with its tautomer and with creatine. === Phosphocreatine system === Creatine is transported through the blood and taken up by tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and skeletal muscle, through an active transport system. The concentration of ATP in skeletal muscle is usually 2–5 mM, which would result in a muscle contraction of only a few seconds. During times of increased energy demands, the phosphagen (or ATP/PCr) system rapidly resynthesizes ATP from ADP with the use of phosphocreatine (PCr) through a reversible reaction catalysed by the enzyme creatine kinase (CK). The phosphate group is attached to an NH center of the creatine. In skeletal muscle, PCr concentrations may reach 20–35 mM or more. Additionally, in most muscles, the ATP regeneration capacity of CK is very high and is therefore not a limiting factor. Although the cellular concentrations of ATP are small, changes are difficult to detect because ATP is continuously and efficiently replenished from the large pools of PCr and CK. A proposed representation has been illustrated by Krieder et al. Creatine has the ability to increase muscle stores of PCr, potentially increasing the muscle's ability to resynthesize ATP from ADP to meet increased energy demands. Creatine supplementation appears to increase the number of myonuclei that satellite cells will 'donate' to damaged muscle fibers, which increases the potential for growth of those fibers. This increase in myonuclei probably stems from creatine's ability to increase levels of the myogenic transcription factor MRF4. === Genetic deficiencies === Genetic deficiencies in the creatine biosynthetic pathway lead to various severe neurological defects. Clinically, there are three distinct disorders of creatine metabolism, termed cerebral creatine deficiencies. Deficiencies in the two synthesis enzymes can cause L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency caused by variants in GATM and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency, caused by variants in GAMT. Both biosynthetic defects are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. A third defect, creatine transporter defect, is caused by mutations in SLC6A8 and is inherited in a X-linked manner. This condition is related to the transport of creatine into the brain. === Vegans and vegetarians === Vegan and vegetarian diets are associated with lower levels of muscle creatine, and athletes on these diets may benefit from creatine supplementation. == Pharmacokinetics == Most of the research to-date on creatine has predominantly focused on the pharmacological properties of creatine, yet there is a lack of research into the pharmacokinetics of creatine. Studies have not established pharmacokinetic parameters for clinical usage of creatine such as volume of distribution, clearance, bioavailability, mean residence time, absorption rate, and half life. A clear pharmacokinetic profile would need to be established prior to optimal clinical dosing. === Dosing === ==== Loading phase ==== An approximation of 0.3 g/kg/day divided into 4 equal spaced intervals has been suggested since creatine needs may vary based on body weight. It has also been shown that taking a lower dose of 3 grams a day for 28 days can also increase total muscle creatine storage to the same amount as the rapid loading dose of 20 g/day for 6 days. However, a 28-day loading phase does not allow for ergogenic benefits of creatine supplementation to be realized until fully saturated muscle storage. This elevation in muscle creatine storage has been correlated with ergogenic benefits discussed in the research section. However, higher doses for longer periods of time are being studied to offset creatine synthesis deficiencies and mitigating diseases. ==== Maintenance phase ==== After the 5–7 day loading phase, muscle creatine stores are fully saturated and supplementation only needs to cover the amount of creatine broken down per day. This maintenance dose was originally reported to be around 2–3 g/day (or 0.03 g/kg/day), however, some studies have suggested 3–5 g/day maintenance dose to maintain saturated muscle creatine. === Absorption === Endogenous serum or plasma creatine concentrations in healthy adults are normally in a range of 2–12 mg/L. A single 5 gram (5000 mg) oral dose in healthy adults results in a peak plasma creatine level of approximately 120 mg/L at 1–2 hours post-ingestion. Creatine has a fairly short elimination half life, averaging just less than 3 hours, so to maintain an elevated plasma level it would be necessary to take small oral doses every 3–6 hours throughout the day. == Exercise and sport == Creatine supplements are marketed in ethyl ester, gluconate, monohydrate, and nitrate forms. Creatine supplementation for sporting performance enhancement is considered safe for short-term use but there is a lack of safety data for long term use, or for use in children and adolescents. Some athletes choose to cycle on and off creatine. A 2018 review article in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition said that creatine monohydrate might help with energy availability for high-intensity exercise. Creatine use can increase maximum power and performance in high-intensity anaerobic repetitive work (periods of work and rest) by 5% to 15%. Creatine has no significant effect on aerobic endurance, though it will increase power during short sessions of high-intensity aerobic exercise. Creatine is proven to boost the recovery and work capacity of an athlete, and multi-applicable capabilities upon athletes have given it a lot of interest over the course of the past decade. A survey of 21,000 college athletes showed that 14% of athletes take creatine supplements to try to improve performance. Compared to normal athletes, those with creatine supplementation have been shown to produce better athletic performance. Non-athletes report taking creatine supplements to improve appearance. == Research == === Cognitive performance === Creatine is sometimes reported to have a beneficial effect on brain function and cognitive processing, although the evidence is difficult to interpret systematically and the appropriate dosing is unknown. The greatest effect appears to be in individuals who are stressed (due, for instance, to sleep deprivation) or cognitively impaired. A 2018 systematic review found that ""generally, there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration"", whereas for other cognitive domains ""the results were conflicting"". Another 2023 review initially found evidence of improved memory function. However, it was later determined that faulty statistics lead to the statistical significance and after fixing the ""double counting"", the effect was only significant in older adults. A 2023 review study ""...supported claims that creatine supplementation can increases [sic] brain creatine content but also demonstrated somewhat equivocal results for effects on cognition. It does, however, provide evidence to suggest that more research is required with stressed populations, as supplementation does appear to significantly affect brain content. === Muscular disease === A meta-analysis found that creatine treatment increased muscle strength in muscular dystrophies, and potentially improved functional performance. Creatine treatment does not appear to improve muscle strength in people who have metabolic myopathies. High doses of creatine lead to increased muscle pain and an impairment in activities of daily living when taken by people who have McArdle disease. According to a clinical study focusing on people with various muscular dystrophies, using a pure form of creatine monohydrate can be beneficial in rehabilitation after injuries and immobilization. === Mitochondrial diseases === ==== Parkinson's disease ==== Creatine's impact on mitochondrial function has led to research on its efficacy and safety for slowing Parkinson's disease. As of 2014, the evidence did not provide a reliable foundation for treatment decisions, due to risk of bias, small sample sizes, and the short duration of trials. ==== Huntington's disease ==== Several primary studies have been completed but no systematic review on Huntington's disease has been completed yet. === ALS === It is ineffective as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. === Testosterone === A 2021 systemic review of studies found that ""the current body of evidence does not indicate that creatine supplementation increases total testosterone, free testosterone, DHT or causes hair loss/baldness"". == Adverse effects == Side effects include: Weight gain due to extra water retention to the muscle Potential muscle cramps / strains / pulls Upset stomach Diarrhea Dizziness One well-documented effect of creatine supplementation is weight gain within the first week of the supplement schedule, likely attributable to greater water retention due to the increased muscle creatine concentrations by means of osmosis. A 2009 systematic review discredited concerns that creatine supplementation could affect hydration status and heat tolerance and lead to muscle cramping and diarrhea. Despite weight gain due to water retention and potential cramps being two seemingly ""common"" side effects, new research indicates that these side effects are likely not the result of creatine usage. In addition, the initial water retention is attributed to more short-term creatine use (the ""loading"" phase). Studies have shown that creatine usage does not necessarily affect total body water relative to muscle mass in the long-term. === Renal function === A 2019 systematic review published by the National Kidney Foundation investigated whether creatine supplementation had adverse effects on renal function. They identified 15 studies from 1997 to 2013 that looked at standard creatine loading and maintenance protocols of 4–20 g/day of creatine versus placebo. They utilized serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and serum urea levels as a measure of renal damage. While in general creatine supplementation resulted in slightly elevated creatinine levels that remained within normal limits, supplementation did not induce renal damage (P value< 0.001). Special populations included in the 2019 Systematic review included type 2 diabetic patients and post-menopausal women, bodybuilders, athletes, and resistance trained populations. The study also discussed 3 case studies where there were reports that creatine affected renal function. In a joint statement between the American College of Sports Medicine, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and Dietitians in Canada on performance enhancing nutrition strategies, creatine was included in their list of ergogenic aids and they do not list renal function as a concern for use. The most recent position stand on creatine from the Journal of International Society of Sports Nutrition states that creatine is safe to take in healthy populations from infants to the elderly to performance athletes. They also state that long term (5 years) use of creatine has been considered safe. It is important to mention that kidneys themselves, for normal physiological function, need phosphocreatine and creatine and indeed kidneys express significant amounts of creatine kinases (BB-CK and u-mtCK isoenzymes). At the same time, the first of two steps for endogenous creatine synthesis takes place in the kidneys themselves. Patients with kidney disease and those undergoing dialysis treatment generally show significantly lower levels of creatine in their organs, since the pathological kidneys are both hampered in creatine synthesis capability and are in back-resorption of creatine from the urine in the distal tubules. In addition, dialysis patients lose creatine due to wash out by the dialysis treatment itself and thus become chronically creatine depleted. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that dialysis patients generally consume less meat and fish, the alimentary sources of creatine. Therefore, to alleviate chronic creatine depletion in these patients and allow organs to replenish their stores of creatine, it was proposed in a 2017 article in Medical Hypotheses to supplement dialysis patients with extra creatine, preferably by intra-dialytic administration. Such a supplementation with creatine in dialysis patients is expected to significantly improve the health and quality of the patients by improving muscle strength, coordination of movement, brain function and to alleviate depression and chronic fatigue that are common in these patients. == Safety == === Contamination === A 2011 survey of 33 supplements commercially available in Italy found that over 50% of them exceeded the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in at least one contaminant. The most prevalent of these contaminants was creatinine, a breakdown product of creatine also produced by the body. Creatinine was present in higher concentrations than the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in 44% of the samples. About 15% of the samples had detectable levels of dihydro-1,3,5-triazine or a high dicyandiamide concentration. Heavy metals contamination was not found to be a concern, with only minor levels of mercury being detectable. Two studies reviewed in 2007 found no impurities. === Food and cooking === When creatine is mixed with protein and sugar at high temperatures (above 148 °C), the resulting reaction produces carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCAs). Such a reaction happens when grilling or pan-frying meat. Creatine content (as a percentage of crude protein) can be used as an indicator of meat quality. == Dietary considerations == Creatine-monohydrate is suitable for vegetarians and vegans, as the raw materials used for the production of the supplement have no animal origin. == See also == Beta-Alanine Creatine methyl ester == References == == External links == Creatine bound to proteins in the PDB",Krebiozon,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.014782710932195187)])","('INFO, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('INFO', -0.08952049165964127), (',', -0.14542746543884277), ('ĠEND', -0.6148280501365662), ('OG', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.03813252970576286), ('ĠFOOD', -0.02402421273291111), (',', -0.4746515154838562), ('ĠMED', -0.12058819830417633), ('ICAL', -3.099436753473128e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5763561725616455)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.31326204538345337), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([experts.illinois.edu](https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/the-krebiozen-hoax-how-a-mysterious-cancer-drug-shook-organized-m?utm_source=openai), [retractionwatch.com](https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/20/deceit-delusion-and-a-classic-medical-fraud-an-excerpt-from-a-new-book-about-a-cancer-treatment-hoax/?utm_source=openai), [news.illinois.edu](https://news.illinois.edu/new-book-explores-the-history-of-the-phony-cancer-drug-krebiozen/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=475, start_index=6, title='The Krebiozen Hoax: How a Mysterious Cancer Drug Shook Organized Medicine - Illinois Experts', type='url_citation', url='https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/the-krebiozen-hoax-how-a-mysterious-cancer-drug-shook-organized-m?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=475, start_index=6, title='“Deceit, delusion, and a classic medical fraud”: An excerpt from a new book about a cancer treatment hoax – Retraction Watch', type='url_citation', url='https://retractionwatch.com/2024/08/20/deceit-delusion-and-a-classic-medical-fraud-an-excerpt-from-a-new-book-about-a-cancer-treatment-hoax/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=475, start_index=6, title='New book explores the history of the phony cancer drug Krebiozen – News Bureau', type='url_citation', url='https://news.illinois.edu/new-book-explores-the-history-of-the-phony-cancer-drug-krebiozen/?utm_source=openai')])"
1349,"('Quizartinib', 'Quizartinib (ac220)', 'Ac 220', 'Quizartinib hcl', 'Quizartinib freebase')",Medical,"Quizartinib, sold under the brand name Vanflyta, is an anti-cancer medication used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. It is a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Its molecular target is FLT3, also known as CD135 which is a proto-oncogene. FLT3 mutations are among the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukemia due to internal tandem duplication of FLT3, and the presence of this mutation is a marker of adverse outcome. The most common side effects of include low white blood cell counts with or without fever, reduced levels of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium or calcium) in blood, increased levels of liver or muscles enzymes, diarrhea, ulcers or redness inside the mouth (mucositis), nausea, abdominal pain, sepsis (serious infection throughout the body and organs), headache, vomiting, and upper respiratory tract infection. It was approved for medical use in Japan in October 2019, in the United States in July 2023, and the European Union in November 2023. == Medical uses == Quizartinib is indicated, in combination with standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction and cytarabine consolidation, and as maintenance monotherapy following consolidation chemotherapy, for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD)-positive. == Adverse effects == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label includes a boxed warning noting QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and cardiac arrest. Quizartinib may cause harm to an unborn baby (embryo-fetal toxicity). == Mechanism of action == Quizartinib selectively inhibits class III receptor tyrosine kinases, including FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3/STK1), colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R/FMS), stem cell factor receptor (SCFR/KIT), and platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs). Mutations cause constant activation of the FLT3 pathway resulting in inhibition of ligand-independent leukemic cell proliferation and apoptosis. == History == Efficacy of quizartinib with chemotherapy was evaluated in QuANTUM-First (NCT02668653), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 539 participants with newly diagnosed FLT3 internal tandem duplication positive acute myeloid leukemia. FLT3 internal tandem duplication status was determined prospectively with a clinical trial assay and verified retrospectively with the companion diagnostic LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive quizartinib (n=268) or placebo (n=271) with induction and consolidation therapy and as maintenance monotherapy according to the initial assignment. There was no re-randomization at the initiation of post-consolidation therapy. Participants who proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation initiated maintenance therapy after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recovery. The main efficacy outcome measure was overall survival, measured from randomization date until death by any cause. The primary analysis was conducted after a minimum follow-up of 24 months after the last patient was randomized. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for the quizartinib arm [hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.98; 2‑sided p=0.0324]. The CR rate in the quizartinib arm was 55% (95% CI: 48.7, 60.9) with a median duration of 38.6 months (95% CI: 21.9, NE), and the CR rate in those receiving placebo was 55% (95% CI: 49.2, 61.4) with a median duration of 12.4 months (95% CI: 8.8, 22.7). The FDA granted the application for quizartinib priority review, fast track, and orphan drug designations. === Clinical trials === It reported good results in 2012, from a phase II clinical trial for refractory acute myeloid leukemia - in participants who went on to have a stem cell transplant. As of July 2023, it has completed seventeen clinical trials, and another eleven are active. == Society and culture == === Legal status === The application for quizartinib was denied in the European Union in 2019. In September 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Vanflyta, intended for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) that is FLT3-ITD positive. The applicant for this medicinal product is Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH. Quizartinib was approved for medical use in Japan in October 2019, in the United States in July 2023, and the European Union in November 2023. === Brand names === Quizartinib is the international nonproprietary name.

1350,"('Chlorogenic acid', 'Heriguard', 'Chlorogenate', 'Hlorogenic acid', 'Cis-chlorogenic acid')","Food, Medical","Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is the ester of caffeic acid and (−)-quinic acid, functioning as an intermediate in lignin biosynthesis. The term chlorogenic acids refers to a related polyphenol family of esters, including hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid) with quinic acid. Despite the ""chloro"" of the name, chlorogenic acids contain no chlorine. Instead, the name comes from the Greek χλωρός (khloros, light green) and -γένος (genos, a suffix meaning ""giving rise to""), pertaining to the green color produced when chlorogenic acids are oxidized. == Structural properties == Structurally, chlorogenic acid is the ester formed between caffeic acid and the 3-hydroxyl of L-quinic acid. Isomers of chlorogenic acid include the caffeoyl ester at other hydroxyl sites on the quinic acid ring: 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (cryptochlorogenic acid or 4-CQA) and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (neochlorogenic acid or 5-CQA). The epimer at position 1 has not yet been reported. Structures having more than one caffeic acid group are called isochlorogenic acids, and can be found in coffee. There are several isomers, such as 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid. and cynarine (1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid) == Biosynthesis and natural occurrence == The biosynthetic precursor to chlorogenic acid is 4-coumaroyl-CoA, containing a single hydroxyl group on the aryl ring, which in turn is produced from cinnamic acid. The hydroxylation of the coumaryl ester, i.e. installing the second hydroxy group, is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. Chlorogenic acid can be found in the bamboo Phyllostachys edulis, as well as in many other plants, such as the shoots of common heather (Calluna vulgaris). === In food === Chlorogenic acid and the related compounds cryptochlorogenic acid, and neochlorogenic acid have been found in the leaves of Hibiscus sabdariffa. Isomers of chlorogenic acid are found in potatoes. Chlorogenic acid is present in the flesh of eggplants, peaches, prunes and coffee beans. == Research and safety == There is not enough evidence to determine whether chlorogenic acid is safe or effective for human health, and its use in high doses, such as excessive consumption of green coffee, may have adverse effects. Chlorogenic acid has not been approved as a prescription drug or food additive recognized as a safe ingredient for foods or beverages. Chlorogenic acid is under preliminary research for its possible biological effects, such as regulation of blood pressure, although there is insufficient evidence for its effectiveness. == Nomenclature == The atom-numbering of chlorogenic acid can be ambiguous. The order of numbering of atoms on the quinic acid ring was reversed in 1976 following IUPAC guidelines, with the consequence that 3-CQA became 5-CQA, and 5-CQA became 3-CQA. Both numbering systems remain in use, as of 2016. == References ==",Hlorogenic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0004324573092162609), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INFO', [('FO', -0.04906516894698143), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.474126398563385), ('ĠINFO', -0.06351377815008163), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002083561266772449)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/c/chlorogenic-acid.html,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6155416/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorogenic_acid ', [])"

1353,"('Emamectin (benzoate)', 'Emamectin b1a', 'Emamectin', 'Emamectin benzoate')",Medical,"Emamectin is the 4″-deoxy-4″-methylamino derivative of abamectin, a 16-membered macrocyclic lactone produced by the fermentation of the soil actinomycete Streptomyces avermitilis. It is generally prepared as the salt with benzoic acid, emamectin benzoate, which is a white or faintly yellow powder. Emamectin is widely used in the US and Canada as an insecticide because of its chloride channel activation properties. == History == Emamectin, produced by the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis, belongs to the avermectin family of compounds all of which exhibit toxicity for nematodes, arthropods, and several other pests. The benzoate salt of emamectin in particular has found widespread use as an insecticide and is approved by the EPA for use in prevention of emerald ash borer in ash trees. Emamectin is derived from avermectin B1, also known as abamectin, a mixture of the natural avermectin B1a and B1b. Emamectin has also shown promising applications in the eradication of fish lice and in fish farming. Emamectin was invented by Regina D. Leseota, Pradip K. Mookerjee, John Misselbrook, and Robert F. Peterson Jr. and patented on September 25, 2001, approved August 22, 2002. It was developed as a pesticide by Merck & Co. as investigative compound MK-0244 It was first marketed in 1997 in Palestine and Japan. == Preparation == Emamectin is derived from abamectin by replacement of an epi-amino-methyl (NHCH3) group by a hydroxyl (-OH) group at the 4″-position. Emamectin, like abamectin, is a mixture of two homologue compounds termed B1a and B1b which differ on the C-25 side-chain by one methylene (CH2) group. B1a contains a sec-butyl group while B1b has an isopropyl group. Emamectin is a mixture, typically consisting of 10% B1b and 90% B1a. Avermectin biosynthesis is classified into three stages: the formation of the polyketide-derived initial aglycone, modification of the initial aglycone to produce avermectin aglycones, and glycosylation of avermectin aglycones to generate avermectins. == Uses == Emamectin is widely used in controlling lepidopterous pests (order of insects that as larvae are caterpillars and as adults have four broad wings including butterflies, moths, and skippers) in agricultural products in the US, Japan, Canada, and recently Taiwan. The low-application rate of the active ingredient needed (about 15 g/ha (6 g/acre)) and broad-spectrum applicability as an insecticide has gained emamectin significant popularity among farmers. Emamectin has been shown to possess a greater ability to reduce the colonization success of engraver beetles and associated wood borers in loblolly pines (Pinus taeda). A 2006 study regarding bolt-injections of four types of pesticides found emamectin to be the greatest reducer against these species with respect to the amount of larval feeding, length, and number of egg galleries. Formation of long vertical lesions in the phloem and xylem surrounding emamectin injection points were found indicating some level of tree-toxicity to the emamectin. A water-soluble preparation of emamectin in polysorbate, acetone, and methanol was shown to prevent the wilting of Japanese black pines inoculated with pine-wood nematodes (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus). Previous treatment of B. xylophilus infections involved eradicating the local population of Japanese pine sawyers associated with the spread of the nematode. Emamectin has also been successfully employed by fish farmers in the control of sea lice in Atlantic salmon. The United Kingdom, Chile, Ireland, Iceland, Finland, the Faroe Islands, Spain, and Norway are currently registered to use emamectin in their fish feed. Removal of the afflicting sea louse represents an increase in the integrity of their salmonid product due to the subsequent reduction of bacterial and viral pathogens possibly carried by the sea lice. Emamectin has shown efficacy against all life-cycle stages of Lepeophtheirus salmonis (salmon louse) and Caligus elongatus (sea louse), preventing maturation to the reproductive stage. A related dihydroxy avermectin B1 compound, ivermectin, is utilized orally in humans as an acaricide and insecticide for the treatment of strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis. Veterinarians also employ ivermectin in the treatment of heartworms in dogs and other infestations. == Structure and properties == Emamectin, like other avermectins, is a hydrophobic 16-membered macrocyclic lactone. Emamectin differs from avermectins B1a and B1b by the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 4″-epimethylamino group rather than the 4″-position. Avermectins are pentacyclic polyketide-derived compounds linked to a disaccharide of the methylated deoxysugar oleandrose. The determination of the active-site for avermectins is difficult due to poor solubility and lipophilicity of these compounds. == Toxicology and metabolism == Emamectin works as a chloride channel activator by binding gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor and glutamate-gated chloride channels disrupting nerve signals within arthropods. The compound stimulates the release of GABA from the synapses between nerve cells and while additionally increasing GABA's affinity for its receptor on the post-junction membrane of muscle cells in insects and arthropods. The stronger binding of GABA increases the cells permeability to chloride ions within the cell due to the hypotonic concentration gradient. Neurotransmission is thereby reduced by subsequent hyperpolarisation and the elimination of signal transduction. == References ==",Emamectin benzoate,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -1.0206720617134124e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.0019496734021231532), ('DU', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01139041781425476)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21539242/?utm_source=openai), [xerces.org](https://www.xerces.org/systemic-insecticides/emamectin-benzoate?utm_source=openai), [cotton.org](https://www.cotton.org/beltwide/proceedings/1997/abstracts/456.cfm?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=12, title='Emamectin benzoate (Affirm). a modern insecticide for the control of lepidoptera larvae on fruits, grapes and vegetables crops', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21539242/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=12, title='Emamectin benzoate | Xerces Society', type='url_citation', url='https://www.xerces.org/systemic-insecticides/emamectin-benzoate?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=12, title='Emamectin Benzoate: A Novel Avermectin Derivative for Control of Lepidopterous Pests in Cotton', type='url_citation', url='https://www.cotton.org/beltwide/proceedings/1997/abstracts/456.cfm?utm_source=openai')])"

1355,"('Decanedioic acid', 'Sebacic acid', 'Sebacic acids', 'Sebacinsaure', 'Decanedicarboxylic acid')","Endogenous, Food, Medical, Personal Care","Sebacic acid is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid with the chemical formula HO2C(CH2)8CO2H. It is a white flake or powdered solid. Sebaceus is Latin for tallow candle, sebum is Latin for tallow, and refers to its use in the manufacture of candles. Sebacic acid is a derivative of castor oil. In the industrial setting, sebacic acid and its homologues such as azelaic acid can be used as a monomer for nylon 610, plasticizers, lubricants, hydraulic fluids, cosmetics, candles, etc. It can be used as a surfactant in the lubricating oil industry to increase the antirust properties of lubricating oils on metals. == Production and reactions == Sebacic acid is produced from castor oil by cleavage of ricinoleic acid, which is obtained from castor oil. Octanol and glycerin are byproducts. It can also be obtained from decalin via the a hydroperoxide, which rearranges to give a hydroxycyclodecanone, which dehydrates to give cyclodecenone, a precursor to sebacic acid. Sebacic acid has also been produced commercially by Kolbe electrolysis of adipic acid. == Potential medical significance == Sebum is a secretion by skin sebaceous glands. It is a waxy set of lipids composed of triglycerides (≈41%), wax esters (≈26%), squalene (≈12%), and free fatty acids (≈16%). Included in the free fatty acid secretions in sebum are polyunsaturated fatty acids and sebacic acid. Sebacic acid is also found in other lipids that coat the skin surface. Human neutrophils can convert sebacic acid to its 5-oxo analog, i.e., 5-oxo-6E,8Z-octadecenoic acid, a structural analog of 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid and like this oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid is an exceptionally potent activator of eosinophils, monocytes, and other pro-inflammatory cells from humans and other species. This action is mediated by the OXER1 receptor on these cells. It is suggested that sebacic acid is converted to its 5-oxo analog during, and thereby stimulates pro-inflammatory cells to contribute to the worsening of, various inflammatory skin conditions. == References ==",Sebacic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE', [('IND', -0.05426403880119324), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.0007106438861228526), (' END', -0.34973829984664917), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.3135020434856415), (' PERSONAL', -3.5716304410016164e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE, ENDOGENOUS', [('IN', -0.04735108092427254), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0001951265730895102), ('ĠPERSON', -0.6242069602012634), ('AL', 0.0), ('ĠCARE', 0.0), (',', -0.005243833642452955), ('ĠEND', -0.028661755844950676), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01427533384412527)])","('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('IND', -0.0022111583966761827), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.10020710527896881), (' FOOD', -3.35706390615087e-05)])","('INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebacic_acid?utm_source=openai), [arkema.com](https://www.arkema.com/usa/en/product/fluorochemicals/sebacic-acid/?utm_source=openai), [ewg.org](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/723501-SEBACIC_ACID/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=302, start_index=27, title='Sebacic acid', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebacic_acid?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=302, start_index=27, title='Sebacic acid - Biobased carboxylic acid directyl processed from castor oil. | Arkema USA', type='url_citation', url='https://www.arkema.com/usa/en/product/fluorochemicals/sebacic-acid/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=302, start_index=27, title='EWG Skin Deep® | What is SEBACIC ACID', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/723501-SEBACIC_ACID/?utm_source=openai')])"
1356,"('Phenytoin', 'Diphenylhydantoin', 'Dilantin', 'Phenytoine', 'Epamin')",Medical,"Phenytoin (PHT), sold under the brand name Dilantin among others, is an anti-seizure medication. It is useful for the prevention of tonic-clonic seizures (also known as grand mal seizures) and focal seizures, but not absence seizures. The intravenous form, fosphenytoin, is used for status epilepticus that does not improve with benzodiazepines. It may also be used for certain heart arrhythmias or neuropathic pain. It can be taken intravenously or by mouth. The intravenous form generally begins working within 30 minutes and is effective for roughly 24 hours. Blood levels can be measured to determine the proper dose. Common side effects include nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, poor coordination, increased hair growth, and enlargement of the gums. Potentially serious side effects include sleepiness, self harm, liver problems, bone marrow suppression, low blood pressure, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and atrophy of the cerebellum. There is evidence that use during pregnancy results in abnormalities in the baby. It appears to be safe to use when breastfeeding. Alcohol may interfere with the medication's effects. Phenytoin was first made in 1908 by the German chemist Heinrich Biltz and found useful for seizures in 1936. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Phenytoin is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 260th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Seizures === Tonic-clonic seizures: Mainly used in the prophylactic management of tonic-clonic seizures with complex symptomatology (psychomotor seizures). A period of 5–10 days of dosing may be required to achieve anticonvulsant effects. Focal seizures: Mainly used to protect against the development of focal seizures with complex symptomatology (psychomotor and temporal lobe seizures). Also effective in controlling focal seizures with autonomic symptoms. Absence seizures: Not used in treatment of pure absence seizures due to risk for increasing frequency of seizures. However, can be used in combination with other anticonvulsants during combined absence and tonic-clonic seizures. Seizures during surgery: A 2018 meta-analysis found that early antiepileptic treatment with either phenytoin or phenobarbital reduced the risk of seizure in the first week after neurosurgery for brain tumors. Status epilepticus: Considered after failed treatment using a benzodiazepine due to slow onset of action. Though phenytoin has been used to treat seizures in infants, as of 2023, its effectiveness in this age group has been evaluated in only one study. Due to the lack of a comparison group, the evidence is inconclusive. === Other === Abnormal heart rhythms: may be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and sudden episodes of atrial tachycardia after other antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion has failed. It is a class Ib antiarrhythmic. Digoxin toxicity: Intravenous phenytoin formulation is a medication of choice for arrhythmias caused by cardiac glycoside toxicity. Trigeminal neuralgia: Second choice drug to carbamazepine. === Special considerations === Phenytoin has a narrow therapeutic index. Its therapeutic range for both anticonvulsant and antiarrhythmic effect is 10–20 μg/mL. Avoid giving intramuscular formulation unless necessary due to skin cell death and local tissue destruction. Elderly patients may show earlier signs of toxicity. In the obese, ideal body weight should be used for dosing calculations. Pregnancy: Pregnancy category D due to risk of fetal hydantoin syndrome and fetal bleeding. However, optimal seizure control is very important during pregnancy so drug may be continued if benefits outweigh the risks. Due to decreased drug concentrations as a result of plasma volume expansion during pregnancy, dose of phenytoin may need to be increased if only option for seizure control. Breastfeeding: The manufacturer does not recommend breastfeeding since low concentrations of phenytoin are excreted in breast milk. Liver disease: Do not use oral loading dose. Consider using decreased maintenance dose. Kidney disease: Do not use oral loading dose. Can begin with standard maintenance dose and adjust as needed. Intravenous use is contraindicated in patients with sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, Stokes-Adams syndrome, or hypersensitivity to phenytoin, other hydantoins or any ingredient in the respective formulation. == Side effects == Common side effects include nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, poor coordination, increased hair growth, and enlargement of the gums. Potentially serious side effects include sleepiness, self harm, liver problems, bone marrow suppression, low blood pressure, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. There is evidence that use during pregnancy results in abnormalities in the baby. Its use appears to be safe during breastfeeding. Alcohol may interfere with the medication's effects. === Heart and blood vessels === Severe low blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms can be seen with rapid infusion of IV phenytoin. IV infusion should not exceed 50 mg/min in adults or 1–3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg/min, whichever is slower) in children. Heart monitoring should occur during and after IV infusion. Due to these risks, oral phenytoin should be used if possible. === Neurological === At therapeutic doses, phenytoin may produce nystagmus on lateral gaze. At toxic doses, patients experience vertical nystagmus, double vision, sedation, slurred speech, cerebellar ataxia, and tremor. If phenytoin is stopped abruptly, this may result in increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. Phenytoin may accumulate in the cerebral cortex over long periods of time which can cause atrophy of the cerebellum. The degree of atrophy is related to the duration of phenytoin treatment and is not related to dosage of the medication. Phenytoin is known to be a causal factor in the development of peripheral neuropathy. === Blood === Folate is present in food in a polyglutamate form, which is then converted into monoglutamates by intestinal conjugase to be absorbed by the jejunum. Phenytoin acts by inhibiting this enzyme, thereby causing folate deficiency, and thus megaloblastic anemia. Other side effects may include: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, decreased white blood cell count, and a low platelet count. === Pregnancy === Phenytoin is a known teratogen, since children exposed to phenytoin are at a higher risk of birth defects than children born to women without epilepsy and to women with untreated epilepsy. The birth defects, which occur in approximately 6% of exposed children, include neural tube defects, heart defects and craniofacial abnormalities, including broad nasal bridge, cleft lip and palate, and smaller than normal head. The effect on IQ cannot be determined as no study involves phenytoin as monotherapy, however poorer language abilities and delayed motor development may have been associated with maternal use of phenytoin during pregnancy. This syndrome resembles the well-described fetal alcohol syndrome. and has been referred to as ""fetal hydantoin syndrome"". Some recommend avoiding polytherapy and maintaining the minimal dose possible during pregnancy, but acknowledge that current data fails to demonstrate a dose effect on the risk of birth defects. Data now being collected by the Epilepsy and Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry may one day answer this question definitively. === Cancer === There is no good evidence to suggest that phenytoin is a human carcinogen. However, lymph node abnormalities have been observed, including malignancies. === Mouth === Phenytoin has been associated with drug-induced gingival enlargement (overgrowth of the gums), probably due to above-mentioned folate deficiency; indeed, evidence from a randomized controlled trial suggests that folic acid supplementation can prevent gingival enlargement in children who take phenytoin. Plasma concentrations needed to induce gingival lesions have not been clearly defined. Effects consist of the following: bleeding upon probing, increased gingival exudate, pronounced gingival inflammatory response to plaque levels, associated in some instances with bone loss but without tooth detachment. === Skin === Hypertrichosis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, purple glove syndrome, rash, exfoliative dermatitis, itching, excessive hairiness, and coarsening of facial features can be seen in those taking phenytoin. Phenytoin therapy has been linked to the life-threatening skin reactions Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These conditions are significantly more common in patients with a particular HLA-B allele, HLA-B*1502. This allele occurs almost exclusively in patients with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, including South Asian Indians. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized to its inactive form by the enzyme CYP2C9. Variations within the CYP2C9 gene that result in decreased enzymatic activity have been associated with increased phenytoin concentrations, as well as reports of drug toxicities due to these increased concentrations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notes on the phenytoin drug label that since strong evidence exists linking HLA-B*1502 with the risk of developing SJS or TEN in patients taking carbamazepine, consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients carrying this allele. === Immune system === Phenytoin has been known to cause drug-induced lupus. Phenytoin is also associated with induction of reversible IgA deficiency. === Psychological === Phenytoin may increase risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. People on phenytoin should be monitored for any changes in mood, the development or worsening depression, and/or any thoughts or behavior of suicide. === Bones === Chronic phenytoin use has been associated with decreased bone density and increased bone fractures. Phenytoin induces metabolizing enzymes in the liver. This leads to increased metabolism of vitamin D, thus decreased vitamin D levels. Vitamin D deficiency, as well as low calcium and phosphate in the blood cause decreased bone mineral density. == Interactions == Phenytoin is an inducer of the CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 families of the P450 enzyme responsible for the liver's degradation of various drugs. A 1981 study by the National Institutes of Health showed that antacids administered concomitantly with phenytoin ""altered not only the extent of absorption but also appeared to alter the rate of absorption. Antacids administered in a peptic ulcer regimen may decrease the AUC of a single dose of phenytoin. Patients should be cautioned against concomitant use of antacids and phenytoin."" Warfarin and trimethoprim increase serum phenytoin levels and prolong the serum half-life of phenytoin by inhibiting its metabolism. Consider using other options if possible. In general, phenytoin can interact with the following drugs: Antidepressants drugs Antifungal drugs such as fluconazole, ketoconazole antibiotics such as metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin Cortones (such as betamethasone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and prednisolone L-DOPA (phenytoin can cause the beneficial effect of levodopa to disappear.) == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Phenytoin is believed to protect against seizures by causing voltage-dependent block of voltage gated sodium channels. This blocks sustained high frequency repetitive firing of action potentials. This is accomplished by reducing the amplitude of sodium-dependent action potentials through enhancing steady-state inactivation. Sodium channels exist in three main conformations: the resting state, the open state, and the inactive state. Phenytoin binds preferentially to the inactive form of the sodium channel. Because it takes time for the bound drug to dissassociate from the inactive channel, there is a time-dependent block of the channel. Since the fraction of inactive channels is increased by membrane depolarization as well as by repetitive firing, the binding to the inactive state by phenytoin sodium can produce voltage-dependent, use-dependent and time-dependent block of sodium-dependent action potentials. The primary site of action appears to be the motor cortex where spread of seizure activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of post-tetanic potentiation at synapses which prevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas. Phenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. === Pharmacokinetics === Phenytoin elimination kinetics show mixed-order, non-linear elimination behaviour at therapeutic concentrations. Where phenytoin is at low concentration it is cleared by first order kinetics, and at high concentrations by zero order kinetics. A small increase in dose may lead to a large increase in drug concentration as elimination becomes saturated. The time to reach steady state is often longer than 2 weeks. == History == Phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin) was first synthesized by German chemist Heinrich Biltz in 1908. Biltz sold his discovery to Parke-Davis, which did not find an immediate use for it. In 1938, other physicians, including H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam, discovered phenytoin's usefulness for controlling seizures, without the sedative effects associated with phenobarbital. According to Goodman and Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics: In contrast to the earlier accidental discovery of the antiseizure properties of potassium bromide and phenobarbital, phenytoin was the product of a search among nonsedative structural relatives of phenobarbital for agents capable of suppressing electroshock convulsions in laboratory animals. It was approved by the FDA in 1953 for use in seizures. Jack Dreyfus, founder of the Dreyfus Fund, became a major proponent of phenytoin as a means to control nervousness and depression when he received a prescription for Dilantin in 1966. He has claimed to have supplied large amounts of the drug to Richard Nixon throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, although this is disputed by former White House aides and Presidential historians. Dreyfus' experience with phenytoin is outlined in his book, A Remarkable Medicine Has Been Overlooked. Despite more than $70 million in personal financing, his push to see phenytoin evaluated for alternative uses has had little lasting effect on the medical community. This was partially because Parke-Davis was reluctant to invest in a drug nearing the end of its patent life, and partially due to mixed results from various studies. In 2008, the drug was put on the FDA's Potential Signals of Serious Risks List to be further evaluated for approval. The list identifies medications with which the FDA has identified potential safety issues, but has not yet identified a causal relationship between the drug and the listed risk. To address this concern, the Warnings and Precautions section of the labeling for Dilantin injection was updated to include additional information about Purple glove syndrome in November 2011. == Society and culture == === Economics === Phenytoin is available as a generic medication. Since September 2012, the marketing licence in the UK has been held by Flynn Pharma Ltd, of Dublin, Ireland, and the product, although identical, has been called Phenytoin Sodium xxmg Flynn Hard Capsules. (The xxmg in the name refers to the strength—for example ""Phenytoin sodium 25 mg Flynn Hard Capsules""). The capsules are still made by Pfizer's Goedecke subsidiary's plant in Freiburg, Germany, and they still have Epanutin printed on them. After Pfizer's sale of the UK marketing licence to Flynn Pharma, the price of a 28-pack of 25 mg phenytoin sodium capsules marked Epanutin rose from 66p (about $0.88) to £15.74 (about $25.06). Capsules of other strengths also went up in price by the same factor—2,384%, costing the UK's National Health Service an extra £43 million (about $68.44 million) a year. The companies were referred to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) who found that they had exploited their dominant position in the market to charge ""excessive and unfair"" prices. The CMA imposed a record £84.2 million fine on the manufacturer Pfizer, and a £5.2 million fine on the distributor Flynn Pharma and ordered the companies to reduce their prices. === Brand names === Phenytoin is marketed under many brand names worldwide. In the US, Dilantin is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer. == Research == Tentative evidence suggests that topical phenytoin is useful in wound healing in people with chronic skin wounds. A meta-analysis also supported the use of phenytoin in managing various ulcers. Phenytoin is incorporated into compounded medications to optimize wound treatment, often in combination with misoprostol. Some clinical trials have explored whether phenytoin can be used as neuroprotector in multiple sclerosis. == References == == Further reading == == External links == English translation of 1908 German article on phenytoin synthesis by Heinrich Biltz Archived 18 October 2020 at the Wayback Machine",Epamin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.019465960562229156), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.011174594983458519)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0005530327325686812)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/epamin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='EPAMIN - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/epamin?utm_source=openai')])"
1357,"('Taxifolin', 'Dihydroquercetin', 'Distylin', 'Taxifoliol', '(2r,3r)-dihydroquercetin')","Food, Medical","Taxifolin (5,7,3',4'-flavan-on-ol), also known as dihydroquercetin, belongs to the subclass flavanonols in the flavonoids, which in turn is a class of polyphenols. It is extracted from plants such as Siberian larch and milk thistle. == Stereocenters == Taxifolin has two stereocenters on the C-ring, as opposed to quercetin which has none. For example, (+)-taxifolin has (2R,3R)-configuration, making it one out of four stereoisomers that comprise two pairs of enantiomers. == Natural occurrences == Taxifolin is found in non-glutinous rice boiled with adzuki bean (adzuki-meshi). It can be found in conifers like the Siberian larch, Larix sibirica, in Russia, in Pinus roxburghii, in Cedrus deodara and in the Chinese yew, Taxus chinensis var. mairei. It is also found in the silymarin extract from the milk thistle seeds. Taxifolin is present in vinegars aged in cherry wood. Taxifolin, and flavonoids in general, can be found in many beverages and products. Specifically, taxifolin is found in plant-based foods like fruit, vegetables, wine, tea, and cocoa. == Pharmacology == Taxifolin is not mutagenic and less toxic than the related compound quercetin. It acts as a potential chemopreventive agent by regulating genes via an ARE-dependent mechanism. Taxifolin has shown to inhibit the ovarian cancer cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. However, in this same study, taxifolin was the least effective flavonoid in the inhibition of VEGF expression. There is also a strong correlation (with a correlation coefficient of 0.93) between the antiproliferative effects of taxifolin derivatives on murine skin fibroblasts and human breast cancer cells. Taxifolin has shown to have anti-proliferative effects on many types of cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell lipogenesis. By inhibiting the fatty acid synthase in cancer cells, taxifolin is able to prevent the growth and spread of cancer cells. Taxifolin also stops the effects of overexpression of P-glycoprotein, which prevents the development of chemoresistance. Taxifolin does this via inhibition of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin. The capacity of taxifolin to stimulate fibril formation and promote stabilization of fibrillar forms of collagen can be used in medicine. Also taxifolin inhibited the cellular melanogenesis as effectively as arbutin, one of the most widely used hypopigmenting agents in cosmetics. Taxifolin also enhances the efficacy of conventional antibiotics such as levofloxacin and ceftazidime in vitro, which have potential for combinatory therapy of patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Like other flavonoids, taxifolin is able to function as an antifungal agent by blocking multiple pathways that promote the growth and proliferation of fungi. Taxifolin has also been found to reduce inhibitor of intestinal mobility especially when antagonized by verapamil. Taxifolin has also been shown to be anti-hyperlipidemic by maintaining the normal lipid profile of the liver and keeping lipid excretion at normal levels. Taxifolin prevents hyperlipidemia by reducing the esterification of cellular cholesterol, phospholipid, and triacylglycerol synthesis. Taxifolin, as well as many other flavonoids, has been found to act as a non-selective antagonist of the opioid receptors, albeit with somewhat weak affinity. Taxifolin shows promising pharmacological activities in the management of inflammation, tumors, microbial infections, oxidative stress, cardiovascular, and liver disorders Taxifolin has been found to act as an agonist of the adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2). == Metabolism == The enzyme taxifolin 8-monooxygenase uses taxifolin, NADH, NADPH, H+, and O2 to produce 2,3-dihydrogossypetin, NAD+, NADP+, and H2O. The enzyme leucocyanidin oxygenase uses leucocyanidin, alpha-ketoglutarate, and O2 to produce cis-dihydroquercetin, taxifolin, succinate, CO2, and H2O. === Glycosides === Astilbin is the 3-O-rhamnoside of taxifolin. Taxifolin deoxyhexose can be found in açai fruits. Taxifolin 3-O-glucoside isomers have been separated from Chamaecyparis obtusa. (-)-2,3-trans-Dihydroquercetin-3'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, a taxifolin glucoside has been extracted from the inner bark of Pinus densiflora and can act as an oviposition stimulant in the cerambycid beetle Monochamus alternatus.

It was formed in 1983, as a spin-off of the computer services division of Sun Oil Company. The name of the company originally was an acronym which stood for Sun Guaranteed Access to Recovered Data, a reference to the disaster recovery business it helped pioneer. SunGard was ranked at 480th in the U.S. Fortune 500 list in the year 2012. In August 2005, the company was acquired by seven private equity firms for $11.3 billion and de-listed from the NYSE. SunGard was one of the title sponsors of the Tinkoff pro cycling team until the end of 2011. In August 2015, FIS announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire SunGard. == Business == SunGard provided software and processing for financial services, K-12 and Higher Education, and the public sector. It also provided continuity-assurance and production data center hosting services, now part of SunGard AS. SunGard had offices in many parts of the world outside of the United States including Paris, South Africa, Tunis, Stockholm, and the United Kingdom. == Acquisitions == SunGard historically grew by acquisition. Past mergers included Performance Pathways, Vericenter, InFlow, Strohl Systems, Comdisco Continuity Services, and Guardian iT PLC on the availability side, Systems & Computer Technology Corp. (SCT) on the higher education side, and Kiodex. Inc., GL Trade, Oshap (Mint, Decalog), TRAX, Carnot AG, Front Capital Systems (Front Arena), Martini, Monis, APT, Dyatron, Reech, VPM, Phase 3 Systems, Infinity, Microhedge, Reconciliation, Automated Securities Clearance India, Opus Renaissance Software Inc., and National Computer Systems Financial Systems Division on the (primarily financial) software and processing side. SunGard completed more than 150 acquisitions over 20 years. Among the largest acquisitions were: In 1997, SunGard Data Systems acquired Infinity Financial Technology, a designer of trading and risk-management software, for about US$390 million, where $313 million were paid in stock and $77 million went in cash. Infinity Financial Technology reported revenues of about $60 million in the fiscal year 1996. In 1999, SunGard acquired Israel's Oshap Technologies (Nasdaq:OSHSF) for $210M in stock, giving SunGard a foothold in both the middleware (via Oshap's subsidiary Mint Communications) and front-office portfolio management systems markets (via Oshap's subsidiary Decalog). In 2001, SunGard acquired Comdisco Inc.’s computer disaster-recovery business after a U.S. appeals court rebuffed a request by the Justice Department to halt the $825 million transaction. In 2004, SunGard acquired Systems & Computer Technology Corp. (SCT) for $590 million in cash. In 2008, SunGard acquired GL Trade, a Paris-based financial services firm for nearly US$1 billion; in a first tranche a 65% stake in GL Trade was acquired for $625 million, including effect of outstanding stock options. The deal encompasses the NYSE Euronext's 40% stake in GL Trade, however 25.4% were in the hand of the founders and 36.6% of the shares were free float. The deal was considered to be financially hazardous, given that GL Trade reported revenues of €203 million and an EBITDA of €26 million (fiscal year 2007). In 2008, SunGard acquired Strohl Systems, an IT company, a direct competitor of SunGard in availability and recovery planning, for an estimated $450 Million cash transaction. Strohl Systems became the software division of SunGard Availability Services, located in King of Prussia, PA In 2010, Sungard acquired 365 Hosting Limited cloud computing and data centre services company == Leveraged buyout 2005 == Formerly listed on the NYSE (ticker symbol SDS) on August 11, 2005, the company was acquired by a consortium of seven private equity investment firms in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. The partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. == De-merger activities == In December 2010, The Capita Group plc acquired SunGard Public Sector Holdings Ltd (part of the business servicing the UK public sector) for £86 million. The new business was known as Capita Secure Information Systems; it has now been renamed Capita Secure Managed Services. In August 2011 Datatel and SunGard's Higher Education group announced a definitive agreement to combine businesses and operate as one company, with Datatel’s current chief executive officer, John Speer, the chief executive officer. Affiliates of private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC acquired the SunGard Higher Education businesses from SunGard Data Systems Inc. for an aggregate cash purchase price of US$1.775 billion and combined the acquired businesses. The combined company was to operate under a new name, Ellucian, as announced at the 2012 annual users' conference. On 7 December 2011 Hellman & Friedman, Datatel and SunGard announced that the proposed combination had cleared Department of Justice review. In March 2012, the finalization of the combination into Ellucian was announced. SunGard's total debt of US$8.08 billion was alleviated by selling this business line; nonetheless, a projected annual revenue shortage of $580 million can be assumed, resulting in a total revenue projection for the fiscal 2011 of $4.7 billion, suggesting a negative revenue trend. In March 2014 SunGard completed the split-off of its Availability Services business, forming the independent company Sungard AS. Andy Stern continued to lead the Sungard AS business. In 2015, SunGard was acquired by the FIS company. In February 2017, Vista Equity Partners acquired SunGard's Public Sector and Education businesses from FIS, and renamed and rebranded SunGard Public Sector as Superion by April 2017, while adding SunGard Education to its own PowerSchool holdings. == References ==",Sungard,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.2519403398036957), ('DU', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019361099693924189)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([furm.com](https://furm.com/trademarks/sungard-73836018?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=12, title='SUNGARD Trademark of SPARTECH CORPORATION - Serial Number 73836018 - Furm', type='url_citation', url='https://furm.com/trademarks/sungard-73836018?utm_source=openai')])"

Perhexiline maleate had been ingested for 24 and 28 mo, respectively. Manifestations of cirrhosis included jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and portal hypertension. Associated manifestations of intolerance to perhexiline maleate included peripheral neuropathy in 1 patient and marked weight loss in both. Histologic lesions resembled those observed in patients with alcoholic liver disease. Ultrastructural lesions included numerous enlarged lysosomes containing myeloid figures. Histochemical stains demonstrated increased phospholipid content of the hepatocytes. These findings are consistent with the view that prolonged administration of perhexiline maleate may induce both histologic lesions resembling those of alcoholic liver disease and ultrastructural and histochemical lesions resembling those of phospholipidosis. 5 patients treated with perhexiline maleate, 200-400 mg/day for at least 6 months, exhibited evidence of hepatitis. The picture was very similar to acute alcoholic hepatitis, clinically, biologically and histologically with presence of necrosis, Mallory's hyaline, polynuclear infiltration and to a lesser degree, steatosis. Association with peripheral neuropathy, hypoglycemia, and renal failure appears strikingly frequently. The evolution was severe since 3 patients died within 6 months, even after treatment withdrawal.

However, high, rather than low, concentrations of ApN are unexpectedly found in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) via an as yet unknown mechanism, and the role of ApN in CKD is unclear. Herein, we investigated the effect of ApN overexpression on progressive renal injury resulting from deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA) and angiotensin II (ANG II) infusion using a transgenic, inducible ApN-overexpressing mouse model. Three groups of mice [wild type receiving no infusion (WT) and WT and cytochrome P450 1a1 (cyp1a1)-ApN transgenic mice (ApN-Tg) receiving DOCA+ANG II infusion (WT/DOCA+ANG II and ApN-Tg/DOCA+ANG II)] were assigned to receive normal food containing 0.15% of the transgene inducer indole-3-carbinol (I3C) for 3 wk.

GLIMMER was a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study in adults with PBC and moderate-to-severe pruritus (≥4 on 0-10 numerical rating scale [NRS]). After 4 weeks of single-blind placebo, patients with NRS ≥3 were randomized (3:1) to double-blind linerixibat/placebo for 12 weeks (to week 16), followed by single-blind placebo (to week 20). The primary objective was to investigate dose-related changes in mean worst daily itch (MWDI) score. One hundred forty-seven patients received placebo (n = 36) or linerixibat (once daily: 20 mg, n = 16; 90 mg, n = 23; 180 mg, n = 27; twice daily: 40 mg, n = 23; 90 mg, n = 22). Linerixibat groups exhibited ≥2-point mean reductions in MWDI from baseline at week 16; however, differences from placebo were not significant. Post hoc analysis of change from baseline in monthly itch score over the treatment period (Phase 3 endpoint) showed significant differences between placebo and linerixibat 180 mg once daily (P = .0424), 40 mg twice daily (P = .0105), and 90 mg twice daily (P = .0370). A significant relationship between total daily dose and response was observed post hoc in the per protocol population (P = .0542). Consistent with mechanism of action, diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event, and incidence increased with dose. Linerixibat effect on itch was not significantly different versus placebo in the primary intent-to-treat analysis but was associated with a significant dose-dependent reduction in itch in the per protocol population. A well-tolerated dose was identified for Phase 3 investigation for cholestatic pruritus in PBC. gov ID: NCT02966834. Establishing the two stereocenters in the benzothiazepine ring of linerixibat (GSK2330672) has been a long-standing problem at GSK. Our solution rests on an episulfonium-controlled Ritter reaction followed by a sulfoxide-directed reduction. A rationale for both steps is based on a mixture of literature precedent and computational experiments. Transition state modeling suggests the sulfoxide-directed reduction proceeds through electronic repulsion between the lone pair of electrons on sulfur and the incoming borohydride anion. Total serum bile acid (TSBA) levels are elevated in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and may mediate cholestatic pruritus. Linerixibat, an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor, improved pruritus in patients with PBC. We explored the relationship between linerixibat dose, TSBA concentration, and pruritus. Data from Phase 1/2 trials were used to develop a population kinetic-pharmacodynamic model to characterize the linerixibat dose-TSBA relationship. Individual Bayesian parameter estimates for participants in the GLIMMER study were used to derive the area under the TSBA concentration curve over 24 h (AUC Linerixibat dose dependently reduced TSBA AUC Linerixibat treatment leads to rapid, dose-dependent TSBA reductions.

1364,"('Eptifibatide', 'Integrelin', 'Integrilin', 'Eptifibatide acetate', 'Intrifiban')",Medical,"Eptifibatide (Integrilin, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, also co-promoted by Schering-Plough/Essex), is an antiplatelet drug of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor class. Eptifibatide is a cyclic heptapeptide derived from a disintegrin protein (P22827) found in the venom of the southeastern pygmy rattlesnake (Sistrurus miliarius barbouri). It belongs to the class of the arginin-glycin-aspartat-mimetics and reversibly binds to platelets. Eptifibatide has a short half-life. The drug is the third inhibitor of GPIIb/IIIa that has found broad acceptance after the specific antibody abciximab and the non-peptide tirofiban entered the global market. == Indications == Eptifibatide is used to reduce the risk of acute cardiac ischemic events (death and/or myocardial infarction) in patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation (e.g., non-Q-wave) myocardial infarction (i.e., non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes) both in patients who are to receive non surgery (conservative) medical treatment and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The drug is usually applied together with aspirin or clopidogrel and (low molecular weight or unfractionated) heparin. Additionally, the usual supportive treatment consisting of applications of nitrates, beta-blockers, opioid analgesics and/or benzodiazepines should be employed as indicated. Angiographic evaluation and other intensive diagnostic procedures may be considered a first line task before initiating therapy with eptifibatide. The drug should exclusively be used in hospitalized patients both because of the serious degree of patients' illness and because of the possible side-effects of eptifibatide. == Contraindications and precautions == Thrombocytopenia : The drug is contraindicated in patients with platelet counts of less than 100,000 per μL because no clinical experience exists regarding such patients. Chronic kidney disease : Eptifibatide undergoes kidney elimination. In such patients with chronic kidney disease where a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor is likely to provide benefit, Abciximab (trade name: Reopro) is an alternative medication. Current bleeding tendencies or abnormally prolonged coagulation parameters observed within 30 days before starting therapy with eptifibatide is intended. Coagulation parameters such as ACT, aPTT, TT, and PT should be followed closely during therapy and afterwards. Allergy to eptifibatide and/or other ingredients. Severe, uncontrolled hypertension. Pregnancy : No experience exists. Pregnant patients should be treated only when clearly needed. Lactation : No human data exists. Breast-feeding should be avoided during treatment in order to prevent damage to the newborn. Geriatric patients : No differences in side effects compared with younger patients have been seen. Nevertheless, geriatric patients should be very closely observed for bleeding and other side-effects. Pediatric patients : Eptifibatide is not indicated in patients below 18 years of age, because no experience exists. == Side effects == People receiving eptifibatide are typically seriously ill and most of them are concomitantly treated with other drugs known to have the potential to cause significant side effects. Therefore, not all side effects listed as follows may be attributable to eptifibatide treatment alone: The major adverse event in the PURSUIT study was severe bleeding. Bleeding occurred as well at sites of clinical intervention (local sites) as at other sites (systemically) like urogenital bleeds. Sometimes, these events were severe enough to require transfusion of blood or plasma concentrates to stop bleeding and counteract anemia. Severe bleeds occurred in 4.4 and 4.7% of patients respectively depending on the infusion rate (0.5 μg/kg/min vs. 0.75 μg/kg/min). A few cases of death due to severe bleeding events attributable to drug therapy were reported. No cases of hemorrhagic stroke were seen. Thrombocytopenia of unknown origin (allergic reaction?) was also noticed in 0.2% of patients. Additionally, hypotension was seen frequently (6%). Cardiovascular failure was also frequent (2%) as were serious arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation 1.5%, atrial fibrillation 6%). Severe allergic (anaphylactic) reactions occurred in almost 0.2% of patients. These reactions can be life-threatening and may be due to the peptide character of eptifibatide. Other side effects were rare and mild in nature and may not be connected to eptifibatide therapy. == Study results == Eptifibatide was licensed due to the positive results of the so-called PURSUIT study encompassing 10,948 patients. In this study all patients had experienced either unstable angina or a non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. Significantly fewer patients developed a myocardial infarction under therapy with eptifibatide. Death rates showed a tendency in favor of eptifibatide, but this superiority was not statistically significant. == Additional information == Sometimes the treating physicians require the patient after discharge from hospital to continue treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel for a few weeks, some months or even for life (as usually is the case with aspirin) to prevent recurrence of symptoms, development of myocardial infarction and/or death related to cardiovascular disease. This advice should be strictly followed. Eptifibatide is one of very many antiplatelet drugs that all have different consequences on the platelet's activity. Eptifibatide has been shown to have salutary effects for patients with Covid related thrombosis. == Inventors == Eptifibatide was discovered by a team led by Robert M.

It has a purity higher than 99.7%. Its molecular formula is C12H22O11. White sugars produced from sugar cane and sugar beet are chemically indistinguishable: it is possible, however, to identify its origin through a carbon-13 analysis. White sugar (and some brown sugar) produced from sugar cane may be refined using bone char by a few sugar cane refiners. Beet sugar has never been processed with bone char and is vegan. In modern times, activated carbon and ion-exchange resin may be used – see Sugar refinery § Purification. From a chemical and nutritional point of view, white sugar does not contain—in comparison to brown sugar—some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, iron and magnesium) present in small quantities in molasses. The only detectable differences are, therefore, the white color and the less intense flavor. == Health Impacts == The overconsumption of white sugar (or any sugar) brings many health consequences. Such as heart disease, obesity, type-2 diabetes, and more.

1366,"('Ly 294002', 'Sf 1101', 'Lys 294002', 'Kinome_3543', 'Biomolki_000029')",Medical," Liver cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. The therapeutic effect of oxaliplatin on liver cancer is often limited by acquired resistance of the cancer cells. Abnormal activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway plays an important role in the acquired resistance of oxaliplatin. The present study investigated the effects of the PI3K inhibitor LY‑294002 and AKT inhibitor MK2206 on the chemosensitivity of oxaliplatin‑resistant liver cancer cells and the molecular mechanism involved. An oxaliplatin‑resistant liver cancer cell line HepG2 Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) may potentially influence intracellular [Ca(2+)](i) concentration by several mechanisms. We have investigated the effects of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002 [2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one] on Ca(2+) signaling in rat airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells using fura-2 and imaging methodology. Wortmannin (1 microM) and LY-294002 (1 and 10 microM) had opposite effects: wortmannin caused a small increase, whereas LY-294002 caused a significant decrease of peak Ca(2+) responses to serotonin (5-HT). LY-294002 (10 microM) diminished 5-HT-induced ASM cell contraction, measured as a change in cell surface area, and inositol phosphate formation, measured by anion exchange chromatography. Thin layer chromatography revealed that the levels of phospholipase C (PLC) substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were not affected. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting have shown that both wortmannin and LY-294002 inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-induced PI3K activation. However, PI3K activation could not be detected after 5-HT stimulation. The specific casein kinase-2 (CK2) inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (10-40 microM) reduced 5-HT-triggered responses to a similar extent as LY-294002. We conclude that LY-294002 modulates Ca(2+) signaling in rat ASM independently of its action on PI3K by acting on, or upstream of, PLC, possibly by inhibiting CK2. Blocker-induced noise analysis of epithelial Na(+) channels (ENaCs) was used to investigate how inhibition of an LY-294002-sensitive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) alters Na(+) transport in unstimulated and aldosterone-prestimulated A6 epithelia. From baseline Na(+) transport rates (I(Na)) of 4.0 +/- 0.1 (unstimulated) and 9.1 +/- 0.9 microA/cm(2) (aldosterone), 10 microM LY-294002 caused, following a relatively small initial increase of transport, a completely reversible inhibition of transport within 90 min to 33 +/- 6% and 38 +/- 2% of respective baseline values. Initial increases of transport could be attributed to increases of channel open probability (P(o)) within 5 min to 143 +/- 17% (unstimulated) and 142 +/- 10% of control (aldosterone) from baseline P(o) averaging near 0.5. Inhibition of transport was due to much slower decreases of functional channel densities (N(T)) to 28 +/- 4% (unstimulated) and 35 +/- 3% (aldosterone) of control at 90 min. LY-294002 (50 microM) caused larger but completely reversible increases of P(o) (215 +/- 38% of control at 5 min) and more rapid but only slightly larger decreases of N(T). Basolateral exposure to LY-294002 induced no detectable effect on transport, P(o) or N(T). We conclude that an LY-294002-sensitive PI 3-kinase plays an important role in regulation of transport by modulating N(T) and P(o) of ENaCs, but only when presented to apical surfaces of the cells.",Ly 294002,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.25193241238594055)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.07530336081981659), ('ICAL', -6.794906312279636e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.5759688019752502)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -1.3663626305060461e-05), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LY294002?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=6, title='LY294002', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LY294002?utm_source=openai')])"
1367,"('Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (sodium salt)', 'Sodium prasterone sulfate', 'Prasterone sulfate', 'Dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate')","Endogenous, Medical","Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, abbreviated as DHEA sulfate or DHEA-S, also known as androstenolone sulfate, is an endogenous androstane steroid that is produced by the adrenal cortex. It is the 3β-sulfate ester and a metabolite of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and circulates in far greater relative concentrations than DHEA. The steroid is hormonally inert and is instead an important neurosteroid and neurotrophin. == Biological activity == === Neurosteroid activity === Similarly to other conjugated steroids, DHEA-S is devoid of hormonal activity, lacking affinity for the steroid hormone receptors. However, DHEA-S retains activity as a neurosteroid and neurotrophin. It has been found to act as a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor (50 nM–1 μM), negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA and glycine receptors, and weak agonist of the sigma-1 receptor (Kd > 50 μM). In addition, DHEA-S has been found to directly bind to and activate the TrkA and p75NTR – receptors of neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) – with high affinity (around 5 nM). === Hormonal activity === Although DHEA-S itself is hormonally inert, it has been thought that it can be converted back into DHEA, which is weakly androgenic and estrogenic, and that DHEA in turn can be transformed into more potent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as well as estrogens like estradiol. As such, it has been thought that DHEA-S is a prohormone with the potential for androgenic and estrogenic effects. However, a 2005 study found that DHEA could be converted into DHEA-S but found no evidence of conversion of DHEA-S into DHEA. === Other activity === DHEA-S has also been found to inhibit the TRPV1 and TRPC5 transient receptor potential channels and to inhibit the P2X receptor. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === DHEA and DHEA-S are produced in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex under the control of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). DHEA is synthesized from cholesterol via the enzymes cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1; P450scc) and 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), with pregnenolone and 17α-hydroxypregnenolone as intermediates. Then, DHEA-S is formed by sulfation of DHEA at the C3β position via the sulfotransferase enzymes SULT2A1 and to a lesser extent SULT1E1. Whereas DHEA is derived mostly from the adrenal cortex but is also secreted to a lesser extent by the gonads (10%), DHEA-S is almost exclusively produced and secreted by the adrenal cortex, with 95 to 100% originating from the adrenal cortex in women. Approximately 10 to 15 mg of DHEA-S is secreted by the adrenal cortex per day in young adults. === Distribution === Unlike DHEA, which is weakly bound to albumin, DHEA-S is strongly bound to albumin (i.e., with very high affinity), and this is the reason for its much longer comparative terminal half-life. In contrast to DHEA, DHEA-S is not bound to any extent to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Whereas DHEA easily crosses the blood–brain barrier into the central nervous system, DHEA-S poorly crosses the blood–brain barrier. === Metabolism === DHEA-S can be converted back into DHEA via steroid sulfatase (STS). In premenopausal women, 40 to 75% of circulating testosterone is derived from peripheral metabolism of DHEA-S, and in postmenopausal women, over 90% of estrogens, mainly estrone, are derived from peripheral metabolism of DHEA-S. A study found that administration of exogenous DHEA-S in women who were pregnant increased circulating levels of estrone and estradiol. DHEA-S serves as a depot for potent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in prostate cancer, which fuel the growth of this cancer. The elimination half-life of DHEA-S is 7 to 10 hours, which is far longer than that of DHEA, which has an elimination half-life of only 15 to 30 minutes. === Elimination === DHEA-S is excreted in the urine via the kidneys. === Levels === DHEA and DHEA-S are the most abundant circulating steroids in the body. Plasma levels of DHEA-S are 100 or more times higher than those of DHEA, 5 to 10 times higher than those of cortisol, 100 to 500 times those of testosterone, and 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than those of estradiol. Levels of DHEA and DHEA-S vary throughout life. They remain low during childhood until adrenarche around 6 to 8 years of age, at which point they markedly increase, eventually peaking at around 20 to 30 years of age. From the third decade of life on, DHEA and DHEA-S levels gradually decrease. By the age of 70, levels of DHEA and DHEA-S are 80 to 85% lower than those of young adults, and in people more than 80 years of age, DHEA and DHEA-S levels can reach 80 to 90% lower than those of younger individuals. DHEA-S levels are higher in men than in women. ==== Reference ranges ==== == Medical use == === Deficiency === The Endocrine Society recommends against the therapeutic use of DHEA-S in both healthy women and those with adrenal insufficiency, as its role is not clear from studies performed so far. The routine use of DHEA-S and other androgens is discouraged in the treatment of women with low androgen levels due to hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, menopause due to ovarian surgery, glucocorticoid use, or other conditions associated with low androgen levels; this is because there are limited data supporting improvement in signs and symptoms with therapy and no long-term studies of risk. In otherwise elderly women, in whom an age-related fall of DHEA-S may be associated with menopausal symptoms and reduced libido, DHEA-S supplementation cannot currently be said to improve outcomes. === Childbirth === As the sodium salt, prasterone sodium sulfate, DHEA-S is used as a pharmaceutical drug in Japan in the treatment of insufficient cervical ripening and cervical dilation during childbirth. == Diagnostic use == DHEA-S levels above 1890 μM or 700 to 800 μg/dL are highly suggestive of adrenal dysfunction because DHEA-S is made by the adrenal glands and also synthesized in the brain. The presence of DHEA-S is therefore used to rule out ovarian or testicular origin of excess androgen. Women with hirsutism commonly present with mildly elevated DHEA-S levels. Common etiologies for hirsutism include ovarian dysfunction (polycystic ovary syndrome) and adrenal dysfunction (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cushing's syndrome, androgen secreting tumors); 90% of these cases are caused by PCOS or are idiopathic in nature. However, severely increased DHEA-S levels (>700 μg/dL) necessitate further workup and are almost stem from benign or malignant adrenal alterations. == Chemistry == DHEA-S, also known as androst-5-en-3β-ol-17-one 3β-sulfate, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid and the C3β sulfate ester of DHEA. == References ==",Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -1.4378848391061183e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.474109947681427), (' MED', -0.00032044618274085224), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.0074268667958676815), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.1576648578047752e-05), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.12711776793003082), ('ĠMED', -0.001727875554934144), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011813811725005507)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -6.704273118884885e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone_sulfate?utm_source=openai)), ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=121, start_index=21, title='Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone_sulfate?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=215, start_index=123, title='Dehydroepiandrosterone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroepiandrosterone?utm_source=openai')])"
1368,"('Virginiamycin m1', 'Pristinamycin iia', 'Ostreogrycin a', 'Streptogramin a', 'Mikamycin a')",Medical,"Streptogramin A is a group of antibiotics within the larger family of antibiotics known as streptogramins. They are synthesized by the bacteria Streptomyces virginiae. The streptogramin family of antibiotics consists of two distinct groups: group A antibiotics contain a 23-membered unsaturated ring with lactone and peptide bonds while group B antibiotics are depsipeptides (lactone-cyclized peptides). While structurally different, these two groups of antibiotics act synergistically, providing greater antibiotic activity than the combined activity of the separate components. These antibiotics have until recently been commercially manufactured as feed additives in agriculture, although today there is increased interest in their ability to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly vancomycin-resistant bacteria. == Biosynthesis == Streptogramin A is a polyketide in nature, but contains some amino acid components as well. Its gene cluster codes for a hybrid PKS-NRPS protein that consists of eight PKS modules and two NRPS modules. Other enzymes are required for tailoring of streptogramin A, particularly for the unusual methylation reaction. The figure below shows the origins of the synthetic components of streptogramin A. The streptogramin A PKS-NRPS is composed of 6 proteins: VirA contains modules 1 though 6; VirF, VirG, and VirH contain modules 6 through 10; VirI is the AT domain that acts for every PKS module; and VirJ contains the TE domain. The starter unit for the biosynthesis of streptogramin A is isobutyryl-CoA, which is given by the amino acid valine after it has undergone transamination and branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenation. Two rounds of chain extension with malonate follow. An NRPS module introduces a glycine residue into the growing polyketide chain, followed by two more rounds of chain extension with malonate. At this point, four enzymes use acetyl-CoA to add a methyl group to position 12 on the macromolecule. The mechanism of the reaction is proposed below. VirC and HMG-CoA synthase bear striking structural similarities and while the mechanism for VirC is not known, it can be proposed to be similar to that of HMG-CoA synthase. Such an elaborate mechanism of methylation is necessary since SAM is not able to insert a methyl group onto a carbonyl carbon. Another round of malonate extension occurs, followed by the malonate's reaction with an adjacent serine extender to form an oxazole ring. This reaction is catalyzed by a cyclization domain on the Ser9 NRPS module. The diagram below shows the biogenesis of the oxazole ring from serine and malonate. Finally, a D-proline residue is added to the chain, followed by hydroxylation and dehydration to form dehydroproline, which is thought to occur through a reverse Michael-type reaction. == Mode of action == By themselves, streptogramins A and B are bacteriostatic. However, when used in conjunction with one another, the streptogramins can inhibit bacterial growth and are bactericidal. Streptogramin A first binds to the peptidyl transferase domain of the 50s ribosomal subunit, preventing the early events of elongation. The binding of streptogramin A causes a conformational change that increases the ribosomal binding activity of streptogramin B 100-fold. Upon binding the ribosome (which streptogramin B can accomplish at any stage of protein synthesis), streptogramin B prevents protein chain extension and can initiate the release of incomplete peptides. When both streptogramins are bound to the ribosome, they form an extremely stable ternary complex. Recently, it has been reported how inhibition of the mitochondrial ribosome by streptogramins A (alone or in combination with streptogramins B) can block glioblastoma stem cell growth, thus allowing for potential repurposing of these antibiotics as antineoplastic agents. In 1999 the FDA had approved Synercid, a drug containing streptogramins A and B in a 7:3 ratio respectively. This intravenously injected drug is used to treat patients with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. == Resistance to streptogramins == Multiple mechanisms of streptogramin resistance have developed despite Synercid's fairly recent development. The three major mechanisms of resistance include active efflux, covalent target modification and antibiotic inactivation enzymes. == References == == Further reading == LeFevre, J.; Glass, T.; Kolpak, M.; Kingston, D.

1371,"('Theanine', 'Glutamic acid œ≥-ethyl amide', 'Nœ≥-ethyl-l-glutamine', 'Theanin', 'Suntheanine')","Food, Medical","Theanine , also known as L-theanine, L-gamma-glutamylethylamide, or N5-ethyl-L-glutamine, is a non-proteinogenic amino acid similar to L-glutamate and L-glutamine. It is produced by certain plants such as Camellia sinensis (the tea plant), and by some fungi. It was discovered in 1949 as a constituent of green tea and isolated from gyokuro leaves in 1950. It constitutes about 1–2% of the dry weight of green tea leaves. The name theanine usually refers to the enantiomer L-theanine, which is the form found in tea leaves from which it is extracted as a powder. The right-handed enantiomer, D-theanine, is less-studied. Theanine is sold as a dietary supplement. It is packaged in gelatin capsules, tablets, and as a powder, and may be an ingredient in branded supplements with caffeine. It is also used as an ingredient in food and beverages. In 1964 Japan approved its unlimited use in all foods (including chocolates, soft drinks, and herb teas) except infant food, while since 2007 it is considered to be safe at doses up to 250 milligrams (mg) per serving by the US Food and Drug Administration. In 2011 the European Food Safety Authority found there was insufficient evidence for a causal relationship between theanine consumption and improved cognitive function, alleviation of psychological stress, maintenance of normal sleep, or reduction of menstrual discomfort. == Structure and properties == The chemical name N5-ethyl-L-glutamine and other synonyms (see box) for theanine reflect its chemical structure. The name theanine, without prefix, is generally understood to imply the L- (S-) enantiomer, derived from the related proteinogenic L-amino acid glutamic acid. Theanine is an analog of this amino acid, and its primary amide, L-glutamine (also a proteinogenic amino acid). Theanine is a derivative of glutamine that is ethylated on the amide nitrogen (as the name N5-ethyl-L-glutamine describes), or alternatively, to the amide formed from ethylamine and L-glutamic acid at its γ- (5-) side chain carboxylic acid group (as the name γ-L-glutamylethylamide describes). Relative to theanine, the opposite (D-, R-) enantiomer is largely absent from the literature, except implicitly. While natural extracts that are not harshly treated are presumed to contain only the biosynthetic L- enantiomeric form, mishandled isolates and racemic chemical preparations of theanines necessarily contain both theanine and its D-enantiomer (and from racemic syntheses, in equal proportion), and studies have suggested that the D-isomer may actually predominate in some commercial supplement preparations. Amino acid racemization in aqueous media is a well-established chemical process promoted by elevated temperature and non-neutral pH values; prolonged heating of Camellia extracts—possible for oversteeped teas and in undisclosed commercial preparative processes—has been reported to result in increasing racemization of theanine to give increasing proportions of the nonnatural D-theanine, up to equal proportions of each enantiomer. == Discovery and distribution == Theanine is found primarily in plant and fungal species. It was discovered as a constituent of tea (Camellia sinensis) in 1949, and in 1950 a laboratory in Kyoto successfully isolated it from gyokuro leaf, which has high theanine content. Theanine is substantially present in black, green, and white teas from Camellia sinensis in quantities of about 1% of the dry weight. Deliberately shading tea plants from direct sunlight, as is done for matcha and gyokuro green tea, increases L-theanine content. The L-enantiomer is the form found in freshly prepared teas and some human dietary supplements. == Digestion and metabolism == As a structural analog of glutamate and glutamine, the theanine in teas or supplements is absorbed in the small intestine after oral ingestion; its hydrolysis to L-glutamate and ethylamine occur both in the intestine and liver, possibly functioning as a donor for glutamate synthesis. == Pharmacology == === In vitro === Theanine is structurally similar to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and binds to glutamate receptors in vitro, though with much lower affinity in comparison. Specifically, it binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors in the micromolar range, including the AMPA and kainate receptors and, to a lesser extent, the NMDA receptor. It acts as an antagonist of the former two sites, and a partial co-agonist of the NMDA receptors. In vitro, theanine also binds to group I mGluRs. In addition, it inhibits glutamine transporters and glutamate transporters, and thus blocks the reuptake of glutamine and glutamate. Theanine may elicit umami taste, a consequence potentially associated with binding to and activation of the T1R1 + T1R3 heterodimer or umami (savory) taste receptor. == Regulatory status == The regulatory status of theanine varies by country. It is sold as a dietary supplement across the United States and European Union. In Japan, L-theanine has been approved for use in all foods, with some restrictions in the case of infant foods. In the United States, the FDA considers it to be GRAS and allows its use as an ingredient in foods and beverages up to a maximum of 250 mg per serving. In 2003, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung, BfR), an agency of their Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, objected to the addition of isolated theanine to beverages. While it was estimated the quantity of green tea consumed by the average Japanese tea drinker per day contains about 20 mg of the substance, there were no studies measuring the amount of theanine being extracted by typical preparation methods, or the percentage lost by discarding the first infusion. Therefore, with the Japanese being exposed to possibly much less than 20 mg per day, it was the opinion of the BfR that pharmacological reactions to drinks typically containing 50 mg of theanine per 500 milliliters could not be excluded—reactions such as impairment of psychomotor skills and amplification of the sedating effects of alcohol and hypnotics. On 13 November 2023, the Inspection by the Administration of Food Safety, Veterinary Medicine and Plant Protection of the Republic of Slovenia banned the sale of Prime energy drinks in Slovenia as they contain L-theanine, which is not allowed in non-alcoholic beverages. Prime Hydration may be freely sold. == Research on supplement use == A 2020 review suggested that L-theanine supplementation of 200–400 milligrams per day may reduce stress and anxiety in people with acute stress, but there was insufficient evidence for the use of L-theanine as a medication to treat stress and anxiety. Evidence from a systematic review of randomised controlled trials suggests that L-theanine supplementation may be more effective than placebo in alleviating psychopathological symptoms associated with anxiety disorders, ADHD, and schizophrenia. Theanine supplements have been marketed with a variety of claims that they improve cognitive performance, reduce stress, improve sleep quality, and alleviate menstrual cramps. Evaluating these claims in 2011, the European Food Safety Authority assessed they were not supported by evidence. == See also == Caffeine gamma-Glutamylmethylamide Green tea Nootropic == References == == Further reading ==",Theanine,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.0010064927628263831), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.07890994846820831), (' PERSONAL', -0.0012364183785393834), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.004874014761298895), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.023347120732069016), ('ĠMED', -0.5173735618591309), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31329983472824097)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=84, start_index=6, title='Theanine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine?utm_source=openai')])"

1373,"('Œ≤-nicotinamide mononucleotide', 'Œ≤-nm', 'Beta-nicotinamide mononucleotide', 'Nicotinamide mononucleotide', 'Nicotinamide ribotide')","Endogenous, Medical","Nicotinamide mononucleotide (""NMN"" and ""β-NMN"") is a nucleotide derived from ribose, nicotinamide, nicotinamide riboside and niacin. In humans, several enzymes use NMN to generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). In mice, it has been proposed that NMN is absorbed via the small intestine within 10 minutes of oral uptake and converted to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) through the Slc12a8 transporter. However, this observation has been challenged, and the matter remains unsettled. Because NADH is a cofactor for processes inside mitochondria, for sirtuins and PARP, NMN has been studied in animal models as a potential neuroprotective and anti-aging agent. The alleged anti-aging effect at the cellular level by inhibiting mitochondrial decay in presence of increased levels of NAD+ makes it popular among anti-aging products. Dietary supplement companies have aggressively marketed NMN products, claiming those benefits. However, no human studies to date have properly proven its anti-aging effects with proposed health benefits only suggested through research done in vitro or through animal models. Single-dose administration of up to 500 mg was shown safe in men in a study at Keio University. One 2021 clinical trial found that NMN improved muscular insulin sensitivity in prediabetic women, while another found that it improved aerobic capacity in amateur runners. A 2023 clinical trial showed that NMN improves performance on a six-minute walking test and a subjective general health assessment. NMN is vulnerable to extracellular degradation by CD38 enzyme, which can be inhibited by compounds such as CD38-IN-78c. == Dietary sources == NMN is found in fruits and vegetables such as edamame, broccoli, cabbage, cucumber and avocado at a concentration of about 1 mg per 100g, making these natural sources impractical to acquire the quantities needed to accomplish the dosing currently being investigated for NMN as a pharmaceutical. == Production == Production of nicotinamide mononucleotide has been redacted since the latter half of 2022 by the FDA because it is under investigation as a pharmaceutical drug. == Different expressions of NMN across human organs == The synthesizing enzymes and consumption enzymes of NMN also exhibit tissue specificity: NMN is widely distributed in tissues and organs throughout the body and has been present in various cells since embryonic development. == Potential benefits and risks == NMN is a precursor for NAD+ biosynthesis, and NMN dietary supplementation has been demonstrated to increase NAD+ concentration and thus has the potential to mitigate aging-related disorders such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses. The potential benefits and risks of NMN supplementation, as of 2023, are currently under investigation. Certain enzymes are sensitive to the intracellular NMN/NAD+ ratio, such as SARM1, a protein responsible for initiating cellular degeneration pathways such as MAP kinase and inducing axonal loss and neuronal death. NMNAT is an enzyme with neurorescuing properties that functions to deplete NMN and produce NAD+, attenuating SARM1 activity and aiding neuronal survival in vitro, an effect that is reversed by applying exogenous NMN which promptly resumed axon destruction. The similar molecule nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) opposes the activating effect of NMN on SARM1, and is a neuroprotector. == References ==",Nicotinamide mononucleotide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('MED', -0.5859659314155579), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.033745281398296356), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -7.600714161526412e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.5491004129871726e-05), (' FOOD', -3.547789674485102e-05)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.38427671790122986), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -6.318072337307967e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -0.20148515701293945), (',', -0.029785824939608574), ('ĠEND', -0.0819239690899849), ('OG', 0.0), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0041276742704212666)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0006497674621641636), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0002613358374219388), (' FOOD', -0.12726730108261108)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_mononucleotide ', [])"
1374,"('Probenecid', 'Probenecid acid', 'Benemid', 'Probecid', 'Benecid')",Medical,"Probenecid, also sold under the brand name Probalan, is a medication that increases uric acid excretion in the urine. It is primarily used in treating gout and hyperuricemia. Probenecid was developed as an alternative to caronamide to competitively inhibit renal excretion of some drugs, thereby increasing their plasma concentration and prolonging their effects. == Medical uses == Probenecid is primarily used to treat gout and hyperuricemia. Probenecid is sometimes used to increase the concentration of some antibiotics and to protect the kidneys when given with cidofovir. Specifically, a small amount of evidence supports the use of intravenous cefazolin once rather than three times a day when it is combined with probenecid. It has also found use as a masking agent, potentially helping athletes using performance-enhancing substances to avoid detection by drug tests. == Adverse effects == Mild symptoms such as nausea, loss of appetite, dizziness, vomiting, headache, sore gums, or frequent urination are common with this medication. Life-threatening side effects such as thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, leukemia and encephalopathy are extremely rare. Theoretically probenecid can increase the risk of uric acid kidney stones. == Drug interactions == Some of the important clinical interactions of probenecid include those with captopril, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, naproxen, cephalosporins, quinolones, penicillins, methotrexate, zidovudine, ganciclovir, lorazepam, and acyclovir. In all these interactions, the excretion of these drugs is reduced due to probenecid, which in turn can lead to increased concentrations of these. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === In gout, probenecid competitively inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid through the organic anion transporter (OAT) at the proximal tubules. This leads to preferential reabsorption of probenecid back into plasma and excretion of uric acid in urine, thus reducing blood uric acid levels and reducing its deposition in various tissues. Probenecid also inhibits pannexin 1. Pannexin 1 is involved in the activation of inflammasomes and subsequent release of interleukin-1β causing inflammation. Inhibition of pannexin 1 thus reduces inflammation, which is the core pathology of gout. === Pharmacokinetics === In the kidneys, probenecid is filtered at the glomerulus, secreted in the proximal tubule and reabsorbed in the distal tubule. Probenicid lowers the concentration of certain drugs in urine drug screens by reducing renal excretion of these drugs. Historically, probenecid has been used to increase the duration of action of drugs such as penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. Penicillins are excreted in the urine at proximal and distal convoluted tubules through the same organic anion transporter (OAT) as seen in gout. Probenecid competes with penicillin for excretion at the OAT, which in turn increases the plasma concentration of penicillin. == History == During World War II, probenecid was used to extend limited supplies of penicillin. This use exploited probenecid's interference with drug elimination (via urinary excretion) in the kidneys and allowed lower doses of penicillin to be used. Probenecid was added to the International Olympic Committee's list of banned substances in January 1988, due to its use as a masking agent. == References ==",Benecid,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.593343616463244e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019401551689952612)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.20141500234603882)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/benecid?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=9, title='BENECID - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/benecid?utm_source=openai')])"
1375,"('Finasteride', 'Proscar', 'Propecia', 'Finastid', 'Prostide')",Medical,"Finasteride, sold under the brand names Proscar and Propecia among others, is a medication used to treat pattern hair loss and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. It can also be used to treat excessive hair growth in women and as gender-affirming treatment in trans women. It is usually taken orally but there are topical formulations for patients with hair loss, designed to minimize systemic exposure by acting specifically on hair follicles. Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor and therefore an antiandrogen. It works by decreasing the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by about 70%. In addition to DHT, finasteride also inhibits the production of several anticonvulsant neurosteroids including allopregnanolone, androstanediol, and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone. Adverse effects from finasteride are rare in men with already enlarged prostates; however, some men experience sexual dysfunction, depression, and breast enlargement. In some men, sexual dysfunction may persist after stopping the medication. It may also hide the early symptoms of certain forms of prostate cancer. Finasteride was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1992. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 73rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Finasteride has been used for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and for the treatment of male pattern hair loss in men. === Enlarged prostate === Physicians sometimes prescribe finasteride for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, informally known as an enlarged prostate. Finasteride may improve the symptoms associated with BPH such as difficulty urinating, getting up during the night to urinate, hesitation at the start and end of urination, and decreased urinary flow. The use of the drug showed significant sexual adverse effects such as erectile dysfunction and less sexual desire, in particular when obstructive symptoms due to an enlarged prostate were present. === Pattern hair loss === Finasteride is also used to treat male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) in men, a condition that develops in up to 80% of Caucasian men aged 70 and over. In the United States, finasteride and minoxidil are the only two FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of male pattern hair loss as of 2017. Treatment with finasteride slows further hair loss and provides about 30% improvement in hair loss after six months of treatment, with effectiveness persisting as long as the drug is taken. Taking finasteride leads to a reduction in scalp and serum DHT levels; by lowering scalp levels of DHT, finasteride can maintain or increase the amount of terminal hairs in the anagen phase by inhibiting and sometimes reversing miniaturization of the hair follicle. Finasteride is most effective on the crown but can reduce hair loss in all areas of the scalp. Finasteride has also been tested for pattern hair loss in women; however, the results were no better than placebo. Finasteride is less effective in the treatment of scalp hair loss than dutasteride. === Prostate cancer === In males aged 55 years old and over finasteride decreases the risk of low-grade prostate cancer but may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer and has no effect on overall survival. A 2010 review found a 25% reduction in the risk of prostate cancer with 5α-reductase inhibitor. A follow-up study of the Medicare claims of participants in a 10-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial suggests the reduction in prostate cancer is maintained even after discontinuation of treatment. However, 5α-reductase inhibitors have been found to increase the risk of developing certain rare but aggressive forms of prostate cancer (27% risk increase), although not all studies have observed this. No impact of 5-α-reductase inhibitor on survival has been found in people with prostate cancer. === Excessive hair growth === Finasteride has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive facial or body hair growth) in women. In a study of 89 women with hyperandrogenism due to persistent adrenarche syndrome, finasteride produced a 93% reduction in facial hirsutism and a 73% reduction of bodily hirsutism after 2 years of treatment. Other studies using finasteride for hirsutism have also found it to be effective. === Transgender hormone therapy === Finasteride is sometimes used in hormone replacement therapy for transgender women due to its antiandrogenic effects, in combination with a form of estrogen. However, little clinical research of finasteride use for this purpose has been conducted and evidence of safety or efficacy is limited. Moreover, caution has been recommended when prescribing finasteride to transgender women, as finasteride may be associated with side effects such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, symptoms that are particularly prevalent in the transgender population and others at high risk already. == Adverse effects == A 2010 Cochrane review of finasteride for BPH found that, in men with a weighted mean age of 62.4, adverse effects are rare in men with already enlarged prostates; ""nevertheless, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo."" As of 2016, fresh evidence suggested such effects, along with disturbed neurosteroid production, may persist after finasteride use is stopped. Finasteride is contraindicated in pregnancy. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that donation of blood or plasma be deferred for at least one month after taking the last dose of finasteride. The FDA has added a warning to 5α-reductase inhibitors concerning an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, as the treatment of BPH lowers PSA (prostate-specific antigen), which could mask the development of prostate cancer. Although overall incidence of male breast cancer in clinical trials for finasteride 5 mg was not increased, there are post-marketing reports of breast cancer in association with its use, though available evidence does not provide clarity as to whether there is a causative relationship between finasteride and these cancers. A 2018 meta-analysis found no higher risk of breast cancer with 5α-reductase inhibitors. Some men develop gynecomastia (breast development or enlargement) following finasteride usage. The risk of gynecomastia with 5α-reductase inhibitors is low at about 1.5%. Depressive symptoms and suicidality have been reported. === Sexual adverse effects === Use of finasteride is associated with an increased risk of sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculatory dysfunction. Sexual adverse effects of finasteride and dutasteride have been linked to lower quality of life and ability to maintain an intimate relationship, and can cause stress in relationships. The adverse effect profiles of finasteride are somewhat different for its indications of hair loss and BPH. ==== Finasteride for androgenetic alopecia (hair loss in men) ==== The most common adverse effects of finasteride taken for hair loss are a decrease in sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and a decrease in the amount of semen.: 17 In addition, finasteride has been reported in case reports to cause sexual problems that persist after stopping the medication. A 2012 update to the FDA label noted reports of decreased sex drive, problems with ejaculation and difficulty achieving an erection which continued after stopping the medication. The update also referenced reports of testicular pain and ""male infertility and/or poor quality of semen."": 17 ==== Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia ==== The most common adverse sexual effects of finasteride for BPH are: trouble getting or keeping an erection, decrease in sex drive, decreased volume of ejaculate, and ejaculation disorders.: 16 A 2010 Cochrane review found that men taking finasteride for BPH (with a mean age of 62.4) are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction (ED), decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder for the first year of treatment. The rates became indistinguishable from placebo after 2–4 years and these side effects usually got better over time. === Long-term === Finasteride may cause persistent adverse sexual, neurological, and physical effects in a subset of men. A 2019 metastudy surveyed the literature on the reversibility of finasteride's side effects. It identified three studies that demonstrated full reversibility of side effects and eleven that described patients with irreversible adverse events. The findings were most convincing in a retrospective review of about 12,000 patients that 1.4% of the cohort developed persistent ED (ED lasting longer than 90 days post-withdrawal). === Post-finasteride syndrome === Reports of long-term, post-discontinuation adverse effects in some fraction of former finasteride users have led to a proposed post-finasteride syndrome (PFS), although some within the medical community question whether there is enough evidence to support a causal relationship between finasteride usage and PFS. Individuals claiming to experience PFS report sexual, neurological, hormonal, and psychological side effects that persist for an extended period after stopping the drug. Reported symptoms include penile atrophy and tissue changes, decreased ejaculate volume and quality, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of penile sensitivity, decreased orgasm sensation, dry skin, metabolic changes, muscle and strength loss, gynecomastia, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, anhedonia, concentration problems, memory impairment and suicidal ideation. A meta-analysis found a significant association between finasteride use and post-discontinuation depression, suicidal ideation, and sexual dysfunction, but the quality of evidence was limited. The status of PFS as a legitimate and distinct medical pathology remains a subject of debate. A 2019 editorial in The BMJ called post-finasteride syndrome ""ill defined and controversial"". Some have argued that it has common features with other self-diagnosed ""mystery syndromes"" such as Morgellons or multiple chemical sensitivity, while others, including some in the biomedical research community, have concluded based on the available evidence, that it represents a real and serious condition. There is no known underlying biological mechanism for the proposed syndrome, and its incidence is unclear. A lack of clear diagnostic criteria and the variable reporting fraction in different healthcare settings make the problem challenging to evaluate. As of 2016, Merck was a defendant in approximately 1,370 product liability lawsuits which had been filed by customers alleging they have experienced persistent sexual side effects following cessation of treatment with finasteride. Most cases were settled by 2018 when Merck paid a lump sum of US$4.3 million to be distributed. As of September 2019, 25 cases remained outstanding in the United States. In 2019, Reuters reported that faulty redactions in court documents revealed allegations from plaintiffs that Merck had known of persistent side effects in their original clinical trials but chose not to disclose them in warning labels. == Overdose == Finasteride has been studied in humans at single doses of up to 400 mg and at continuous dosages of up to 80 mg/day for three months, without adverse effects observed. There is no specific recommended antidote for finasteride overdose. == Interactions == No significant drug interactions have been observed between finasteride and a limited selection of medications. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor. It is specifically a selective inhibitor of the type II and III isoforms of the enzyme. By inhibiting these two isozymes of 5α-reductase, finasteride reduces the formation of the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from its precursor testosterone in certain tissues in the body such as the prostate gland, skin, and hair follicles. As such, finasteride is a type of antiandrogen, or more specifically, an androgen synthesis inhibitor. However, some authors do not define finasteride as an ""antiandrogen,"" a term which can refer more specifically to antagonists of the androgen receptor. Finasteride results in a decrease of circulating DHT levels by about 65–70% with an oral dosage of 5 mg/day and of DHT levels in the prostate gland by up to 80–90% with an oral dosage of 1 or 5 mg/day. In parallel, circulating levels of testosterone increase by approximately 10%, while local concentrations of testosterone in the prostate gland increase by about 7-fold and local testosterone levels in hair follicles increase by around 27–53%. An oral dosage of finasteride of only 0.2 mg/day has been found to achieve near-maximal suppression of DHT levels (68.6% for 0.2 mg/day relative to 72.2% for 5 mg/day). Finasteride does not completely suppress DHT production because it lacks significant inhibitory effects on the 5α-reductase type I isoenzyme, with more than 100-fold less inhibitory potency for type I as compared to type II (IC50Tooltip Half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 313 nM and 11 nM, respectively). This is in contrast to inhibitors of all three isoenzymes of 5α-reductase like dutasteride, which can reduce DHT levels in the entire body by more than 99%. In addition to inhibiting 5α-reductase, finasteride has also been found to competitively inhibit 5β-reductase (AKR1D1). However, its affinity for the enzyme is substantially less than for 5α-reductase (an order of magnitude less than for 5α-reductase type I) and hence is unlikely to be of clinical significance. As of 2012, the tissues in which the different isozymes of 5α-reductase are expressed are not fully clear. This is because different investigators have obtained varying results with different reagents, methods, and tissues examined. However, the different isozymes of 5α-reductase appear to be widely expressed, with notable tissues including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, testes, epididymides, skin, hair follicles, liver, kidneys, and brain, among others. By inhibiting 5α-reductase and thus preventing DHT production, finasteride reduces androgen signaling in tissues like the prostate gland and the scalp. In the prostate, this reduces prostate volume, which improves BPH and reduces the risk of prostate cancer. Finasteride reduces prostate volume by 20 to 30% in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Inhibition of 5α-reductase also reduces epididymal weight, and decreases motility and normal morphology of spermatozoa in the epididymis. Neurosteroids like 3α-androstanediol (derived from DHT) and allopregnanolone (derived from progesterone) activate the GABAA receptor in the brain; because finasteride prevents the formation of neurosteroids, it functions as a neurosteroidogenesis inhibitor and may contribute to a reduction of GABAA activity. Reduction of GABAA receptor activation by these neurosteroids has been implicated in depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction. In accordance with finasteride being a potent 5α-reductase inhibitor but a weak inhibitor of 5β-reductase, the medication decreases circulating levels of 5α-reduced steroids like allopregnanolone but does not reduce concentrations of 5β-reduced steroids like pregnanolone. Pregnanolone acts as a potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator similarly to allopregnanolone. === Pharmacokinetics === The mean oral bioavailability of finasteride is approximately 65%. The absorption of finasteride is not affected by food. At steady-state with 1 mg/day finasteride, mean peak concentrations of finasteride were 9.2 ng/mL (25 nmol/L). Conversely, following a single 5 mg dose of finasteride, mean peak levels of finasteride were 37 ng/mL (99 nmol/L), and plasma concentrations increased by 47–54% following 2.5 weeks of continued daily administration. The volume of distribution of finasteride is 76 L. Its plasma protein binding is 90%. The drug has been found to cross the blood–brain barrier, whereas levels in semen were found to be undetectable. Finasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver, first by hydroxylation via CYP3A4 and then by aldehyde dehydrogenase. It has two major metabolites, which are the tert-butyl side chain monohydroxylated and monocarboxylic acid metabolites. These metabolites show approximately 20% of the inhibitory activity of finasteride on 5α-reductase. Hence, the metabolites of finasteride are not particularly active. The drug has a terminal half-life of 5 to 6 hours in adult men (18–60 years of age) and a terminal half-life of 8 hours or more in elderly men (more than 70 years of age). It is eliminated as its metabolites 57% in the feces and 40% in the urine. == Chemistry == Finasteride, also known as 17β-(N-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-5α-androst-1-en-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and 4-azasteroid. It is an analogue of androgen steroid hormones like testosterone and DHT. As an unconjugated steroid, finasteride is a highly lipophilic compound. == History == In 1942, James Hamilton observed that prepubertal castration prevents the later development of male pattern baldness in mature men. In 1974, Julianne Imperato-McGinley of Cornell Medical College in New York attended a conference on birth defects. She reported on a group of intersex children in the Caribbean who appeared sexually ambiguous at birth, and were initially raised as girls, but then grew external male genitalia and other masculine characteristic after onset of puberty. These children, despite being raised as girls until puberty, were generally heterosexual and were termed ""Guevedoces"" by their local community, which means ""penis at twelve"" in Spanish. Her research group found these children shared a genetic mutation, causing deficiency of the 5α-reductase enzyme and male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which was found to have been the etiology behind abnormalities in male sexual development. Upon maturation, these individuals were observed to have smaller prostates which were underdeveloped, and were also observed to lack incidence of male pattern baldness. In 1975, copies of Imperato-McGinley's presentation were seen by P. Roy Vagelos, who was then serving as Merck's basic research chief. He was intrigued by the notion that decreased levels of DHT led to the development of smaller prostates. Dr. Vagelos then sought to create a drug that could mimic the condition found in these children to treat older men who had benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finasteride was developed by Merck under the code name MK-906. A team led by chemist Gary Rasmusson and biologist Jerry Brooks developed potential 5α-reductase inhibitors based on transition-state inhibitors, using an iterative process of molecular design, testing, and redesign. In 1992, finasteride (5 mg) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of BPH, which Merck marketed under the brand name Proscar. Rasmusson and Brooks were awarded IPO's ""Inventor of the Year"" award in 1993 for their work on finasteride. In 1997, Merck was successful in obtaining FDA approval for a second indication of finasteride (1 mg) for treatment of male pattern hair loss, which was marketed under the brand name Propecia. It was the first 5α-reductase inhibitor to be introduced and was followed by dutasteride in 2001. The first study of finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism in women was published in 1994. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Finasteride is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while finastéride is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française. It is also known by its former developmental code names MK-906, YM-152, and L-652,931. === Brand names === Finasteride is marketed primarily under the brand names Propecia, for pattern hair loss, and Proscar, for BPH, both of which are products of Merck & Co. There is 1 mg of finasteride in Propecia and 5 mg in Proscar. Merck's patent on finasteride for the treatment of BPH expired in June 2006. Merck was awarded a separate patent for the use of finasteride to treat pattern hair loss and it expired in November 2013. Finasteride is also marketed under a variety of other brand names throughout the world. === Athletics === From 2005 to 2009, the World Anti-Doping Agency banned finasteride because it was discovered that the drug could be used to mask steroid abuse. It was removed from the list effective 1 January 2009, after improvements in testing methods made the ban unnecessary. Athletes who used finasteride and were banned from international competition include skeleton racer Zach Lund, bobsledder Sebastien Gattuso, footballer Romário, and ice hockey goaltender José Théodore. === Miscellaneous === The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that donation of blood or plasma be deferred for at least one month after taking the last dose of finasteride. The UK also has a one-month deferral period. == Research == Preliminary research suggests that topical finasteride may be effective in the treatment of pattern hair loss. Topical finasteride, like the oral preparation, reduces serum DHT. DHT may be involved in the cause of acne, and 5α-reductase inhibitors might be effective in the treatment of the condition. A small retrospective study reported that finasteride was effective in the treatment of acne in women with normal testosterone levels. A randomized controlled trial found that finasteride was less effective than flutamide or an ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate birth control pill in the treatment of acne in women with high androgen levels. Androgens and estrogens may be involved in the cause of hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa). Two case series have reported that finasteride is effective in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa in girls and women. Finasteride and other antiandrogens might be useful in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), but more research is needed. == References ==",Prostide,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0012231733417138457), ('ICAL', -1.5497195136049413e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005278934258967638)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -2.7610454708337784e-05)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/prostide?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=88, start_index=9, title='PROSTIDE - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/prostide?utm_source=openai')])"

1377,"('Hydroxyprogesterone', 'Prodix', 'Prodox', 'Gestageno gador', 'Setaderm')","Endogenous, Medical","17α-Hydroxyprogesterone (17α-OHP), also known as 17-OH progesterone (17-OHP), or hydroxyprogesterone (OHP), is an endogenous progestogen steroid hormone related to progesterone. It is also a chemical intermediate in the biosynthesis of many other endogenous steroids, including androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids, as well as neurosteroids. == Biological activity == 17α-OHP is an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) similarly to progesterone, albeit weakly in comparison. In addition, it is an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) as well as a partial agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), albeit with very low potency (EC50 >100-fold less relative to cortisol) at the latter site, also similarly to progesterone. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === 17α-OHP is derived from progesterone via 17α-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP17A1). 17α-OHP increases in the third trimester of pregnancy primarily due to fetal adrenal production. This steroid is primarily produced in the adrenal glands and to some degree in the gonads, specifically the corpus luteum of the ovary. Normal levels are 3-90 ng/dl in children, and in women, 20-100 ng/dl prior to ovulation, and 100-500 ng/dl during the luteal phase. === Measurement === Measurements of levels of 17α-OHP are useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia as the typical enzymes that are defective, namely 21-hydroxylase and 11β-hydroxylase, lead to a build-up of 17α-OHP. In contrast, the rare patient with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency will have very low or undetectable levels of 17α-OHP. 17α-OHP levels can also be used to measure contribution of progestational activity of the corpus luteum during pregnancy as progesterone but note, 17α-OHP is also contributed by the placenta. Immunoassays like RIA (radioimmunoassay) or IRMA (immunoradiometric assay) used to clinically determine 17α-OHP are prone to cross-reactivity with the 17α-OHP steroid precursors and their sulphated conjugates. Gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (e.g. LC-MS/MS) achieves greater specificity than immunoassays. Measurement of 17α-OHP by LC-MS/MS improves newborn screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, because 17α-OHP steroid precursors and their sulphated conjugates which are present in the first two days after birth and longer in pre-term neonates, cross-react in immunoassays with 17α-OHP, giving falsely high 17α-OHP levels. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === Although 17α-OHP has not been used as a medication, its pharmacokinetics have been studied and reviewed. == Medical uses == Esters of 17α-OHP, such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate and, to a far lesser extent, hydroxyprogesterone acetate and hydroxyprogesterone heptanoate, have been used in medicine as progestins. == Chemistry == 17α-OHP is the parent compound of a class of progestins referred to as the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives. Among others, this class of drugs includes chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Hydroxyprogesterone is the generic name of 17α-OHP and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name. == See also == 11α-Hydroxyprogesterone 5α-Dihydroprogesterone 20-Dihydroprogesterone 11-Deoxycorticosterone 11-Deoxycortisol 17α-Methylprogesterone 19-Norprogesterone 19-Nortestosterone == References ==",Hydroxyprogesterone,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -3.531315314830863e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -5.860340752406046e-05), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.029435159638524055), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.0251946150674485e-05), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), (',', -0.07925785332918167), ('ĠMED', -0.0019649022724479437), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015348332235589623)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.1602659672498703), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -5.836499985889532e-05), (' END', -1.676292231422849e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS,MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17%CE%B1-Hydroxyprogesterone?utm_source=openai), [rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/hydroxyprogesterone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=213, start_index=20, title='17α-Hydroxyprogesterone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17%CE%B1-Hydroxyprogesterone?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=213, start_index=20, title='Hydroxyprogesterone Overview - Active Ingredient - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/substances/hydroxyprogesterone?utm_source=openai')])"

In U-251 MG and U-87 MG cells, onametostat also affected the spheroid formation at concentrations lower than the currently used chemotherapeutic drug lomustine. In T98-G cell line, treatment with onametostat led to dramatic changes in the transcriptome profile by inducing the cell cycle arrest, suppressing RNA splicing, and down-regulating several major glioblastoma cell survival pathways. Further validation by immunostaining in three cell lines confirmed that onametostat affects cell cycle and causes reduction in nucleolar protein levels.

It was patented in 1966 and approved for medical use in 1977. == Use == === Medical === Etidronic acid is a bisphosphonate used to strengthen bone, treat osteoporosis, and treat Paget's disease of bone. Bisphosphonates primarily reduce osteoclastic activity, which prevents bone resorption, and thus moves the bone resorption/formation equilibrium toward the formation side and hence makes bone stronger on the long run. Etidronate, unlike other bisphosphonates, also prevents bone calcification. For this reason, other bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, are preferred when fighting osteoporosis. To prevent bone resorption without affecting too much bone calcification, etidronate must be administered only for a short time once in a while, for example for two weeks every 3 months. When given on a continuous basis, say every day, etidronate will altogether prevent bone calcification. This effect may be useful and etidronate is in fact used this way to fight heterotopic ossification. But in the long run, if used on a continuous basis, it will cause osteomalacia. ==== Chemical ==== HEDP is used as a retardant in concrete, scale and corrosion inhibition in circulating cool water system, oil field and low-pressure boilers in fields such as electric power, chemical industry, metallurgy, fertilizer, etc. In the light woven industry, HEDP is used as detergent for metal and nonmetal. In dyeing industry, HEDP is used as peroxide stabilizer and dye-fixing agent; In non-cyanide electroplating, HEDP is used as chelating agent. The dosage of 1–10 mg/L is preferred as scale inhibitor, 10–50 mg/L as corrosion inhibitor, and 1000–2000 mg/L as detergent. Usually, HEDP is also used together with polycarboxylic acid (superplasticizer), in which it acts as reducing agent. === Chelating agent and antioxidant === Etidronic acid is a chelating agent and may be added to bind or, to some extent, counter the effects of substances, such as calcium, iron or other metal ions, which may be discharged as a component of grey wastewater and could conceivably contaminate groundwater supplies. As a phosphonate it has corrosion inhibiting properties on unalloyed steel. Etidronic acid also acts to retard rancidification and oxidation of fatty acids. HEDP and its salts are added to detergents and other cleaning agents to prevent the effects of hard water. It is also used in peroxide bleaching to prevent degradation of peroxides by transition metals. Etidronic acid is listed as an ingredient of several cosmetic formulations where it is used for suppressing radical formation, emulsion stabiliser and viscosity control. While etidronic acid has not been limited from inclusion in cosmetics and does have legitimate uses, it is recommended that, as with most cosmetic products (particularly soaps), the product should be thoroughly rinsed from the skin after use. Etidronic acid is also included among swimming pool chemicals. It is used as a stain inhibitor to prevent metal ions coming out of solution and staining the sides of swimming pools.

1381,"('Asparagine', 'Asparagine, dl-', 'H-asn-oh ho', 'Asparagine; asn; asparamide', 'H-dl-asn-oh')","Endogenous, Medical","Asparagine (symbol Asn or N) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain carboxamide, classifying it as a polar (at physiological pH), aliphatic amino acid. It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it. It is encoded by the codons AAU and AAC. The one-letter symbol N for asparagine was assigned arbitrarily, with the proposed mnemonic asparagiNe; == History == Asparagine was first isolated in 1806 in a crystalline form by French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet (then a young assistant). It was isolated from asparagus juice, in which it is abundant, hence the chosen name. It was the first amino acid to be isolated. Three years later, in 1809, Pierre Jean Robiquet identified a substance from liquorice root with properties which he qualified as very similar to those of asparagine, and which Plisson identified in 1828 as asparagine itself. The determination of asparagine's structure required decades of research. The empirical formula for asparagine was first determined in 1833 by the French chemists Antoine François Boutron Charlard and Théophile-Jules Pelouze; in the same year, the German chemist Justus Liebig provided a more accurate formula. In 1846 the Italian chemist Raffaele Piria treated asparagine with nitrous acid, which removed the molecule's amine (–NH2) groups and transformed asparagine into malic acid. This revealed the molecule's fundamental structure: a chain of four carbon atoms. Piria thought that asparagine was a diamide of malic acid; however, in 1862 the German chemist Hermann Kolbe showed that this surmise was wrong; instead, Kolbe concluded that asparagine was an amide of an amine of succinic acid. In 1886, the Italian chemist Arnaldo Piutti (1857–1928) discovered a mirror image or ""enantiomer"" of the natural form of asparagine, which shared many of asparagine's properties, but which also differed from it. Since the structure of asparagine was still not fully known – the location of the amine group within the molecule was still not settled – Piutti synthesized asparagine and thus published its true structure in 1888. == Structural function in proteins == Since the asparagine side-chain can form hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbone, asparagine residues are often found near the beginning of alpha-helices as asx turns and asx motifs, and in similar turn motifs, or as amide rings, in beta sheets. Its role can be thought as ""capping"" the hydrogen bond interactions that would otherwise be satisfied by the polypeptide backbone. Asparagine also provides key sites for N-linked glycosylation, modification of the protein chain with the addition of carbohydrate chains. Typically, a carbohydrate tree can solely be added to an asparagine residue if the latter is flanked on the C side by X-serine or X-threonine, where X is any amino acid with the exception of proline. Asparagine can be hydroxylated in the HIF1 hypoxia-inducible transcription factor. This modification inhibits HIF1-mediated gene activation. == Sources == === Dietary sources === Asparagine is not essential for humans, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates and is not required in the diet. Asparagine is found in: Animal sources: dairy, whey, beef, poultry, eggs, fish, lactalbumin, seafood Plant sources: seaweed (spirulina), potatoes, soy protein isolate, tofu === Biosynthesis and catabolism === The precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate, which a transaminase enzyme converts to aspartate. The enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate producing α-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. Asparagine synthetase uses ATP to activate aspartate, forming β-aspartyl-AMP. Glutamine donates an ammonium group, which reacts with β-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP. In reaction that is the reverse of its biosynthesis, asparagine is hydrolyzed to aspartate by asparaginase. Aspartate then undergoes transamination to form glutamate and oxaloacetate from alpha-ketoglutarate. Oxaloacetate, which enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). === Acrylamide controversy === Heating a mixture of asparagine and reducing sugars or other source of carbonyls produces acrylamide in food. These products occur in baked goods such as French fries, potato chips, and toasted bread. Acrylamide is converted in the liver to glycidamide, which is a possible carcinogen. == Function == Asparagine synthetase is required for normal development of the brain. Asparagine is also involved in protein synthesis during replication of poxviruses. The addition of N-acetylglucosamine to asparagine is performed by oligosaccharyltransferase enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum.

It is non-essential in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it. It is encoded by the codons AAU and AAC. The one-letter symbol N for asparagine was assigned arbitrarily, with the proposed mnemonic asparagiNe; == History == Asparagine was first isolated in 1806 in a crystalline form by French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet (then a young assistant). It was isolated from asparagus juice, in which it is abundant, hence the chosen name. It was the first amino acid to be isolated. Three years later, in 1809, Pierre Jean Robiquet identified a substance from liquorice root with properties which he qualified as very similar to those of asparagine, and which Plisson identified in 1828 as asparagine itself. The determination of asparagine's structure required decades of research. The empirical formula for asparagine was first determined in 1833 by the French chemists Antoine François Boutron Charlard and Théophile-Jules Pelouze; in the same year, the German chemist Justus Liebig provided a more accurate formula. In 1846 the Italian chemist Raffaele Piria treated asparagine with nitrous acid, which removed the molecule's amine (–NH2) groups and transformed asparagine into malic acid. This revealed the molecule's fundamental structure: a chain of four carbon atoms. Piria thought that asparagine was a diamide of malic acid; however, in 1862 the German chemist Hermann Kolbe showed that this surmise was wrong; instead, Kolbe concluded that asparagine was an amide of an amine of succinic acid. In 1886, the Italian chemist Arnaldo Piutti (1857–1928) discovered a mirror image or ""enantiomer"" of the natural form of asparagine, which shared many of asparagine's properties, but which also differed from it. Since the structure of asparagine was still not fully known – the location of the amine group within the molecule was still not settled – Piutti synthesized asparagine and thus published its true structure in 1888. == Structural function in proteins == Since the asparagine side-chain can form hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbone, asparagine residues are often found near the beginning of alpha-helices as asx turns and asx motifs, and in similar turn motifs, or as amide rings, in beta sheets. Its role can be thought as ""capping"" the hydrogen bond interactions that would otherwise be satisfied by the polypeptide backbone. Asparagine also provides key sites for N-linked glycosylation, modification of the protein chain with the addition of carbohydrate chains. Typically, a carbohydrate tree can solely be added to an asparagine residue if the latter is flanked on the C side by X-serine or X-threonine, where X is any amino acid with the exception of proline. Asparagine can be hydroxylated in the HIF1 hypoxia-inducible transcription factor. This modification inhibits HIF1-mediated gene activation. == Sources == === Dietary sources === Asparagine is not essential for humans, which means that it can be synthesized from central metabolic pathway intermediates and is not required in the diet. Asparagine is found in: Animal sources: dairy, whey, beef, poultry, eggs, fish, lactalbumin, seafood Plant sources: seaweed (spirulina), potatoes, soy protein isolate, tofu === Biosynthesis and catabolism === The precursor to asparagine is oxaloacetate, which a transaminase enzyme converts to aspartate. The enzyme transfers the amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate producing α-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. Asparagine synthetase uses ATP to activate aspartate, forming β-aspartyl-AMP. Glutamine donates an ammonium group, which reacts with β-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP. In reaction that is the reverse of its biosynthesis, asparagine is hydrolyzed to aspartate by asparaginase. Aspartate then undergoes transamination to form glutamate and oxaloacetate from alpha-ketoglutarate. Oxaloacetate, which enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). === Acrylamide controversy === Heating a mixture of asparagine and reducing sugars or other source of carbonyls produces acrylamide in food. These products occur in baked goods such as French fries, potato chips, and toasted bread. Acrylamide is converted in the liver to glycidamide, which is a possible carcinogen. == Function == Asparagine synthetase is required for normal development of the brain. Asparagine is also involved in protein synthesis during replication of poxviruses. The addition of N-acetylglucosamine to asparagine is performed by oligosaccharyltransferase enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum. This glycosylation is involved in protein structure and function. == See also == Potassium asparaginate == References == == External links == GMD MS Spectrum",Altheine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.11377208679914474), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -0.0001093841710826382), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.04859384149312973), (' FOOD', -3.7697225252486533e-06)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.8149223923683167), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -3.564294092939235e-05), ('OUS', -3.933898824470816e-06), (',', -0.0007190502947196364), ('ĠFOOD', -0.00023982033599168062), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014766562730073929)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/altheine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=109, start_index=6, title='altheine | Drug Information, Uses, Side Effects, Chemistry | PharmaCompass.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.pharmacompass.com/chemistry-chemical-name/altheine?utm_source=openai')])"

1384,"('Vinpocetine', 'Ethyl apovincaminate', 'Cavinton', 'Ceractin', 'Apovincaminic acid ethyl ester')",Medical,"Vinpocetine (ethyl apovincaminate), sold under the brand name Cavinton among others, is a synthetic derivative of the vinca alkaloid vincamine, differing by the removal of a hydroxyl group and by being the ethyl rather than the methyl ester of the underlying carboxylic acid. Vincamine is extracted from either the seeds of Voacanga africana or the leaves of Vinca minor (lesser periwinkle). == Medical uses == Vinpocetine has been used in many Asian and European countries for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke and dementia for over three decades. The FDA has tentatively ruled that vinpocetine, due to its synthetic nature and proposed therapeutic uses, is ineligible to be marketed as dietary supplement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Despite this, vinpocetine remains widely available in dietary supplements often marketed as nootropics. Vinpocetine does not fully support a benefit in either dementia or stroke. As of 2003, three controlled clinical trials had tested ""older adults with memory problems"". Vinpocetine has also been studied for the prevention and recovery of acquired hearing loss in a phase II, longitudinal and prospective open clinical study on humans. == Side effects == Use during pregnancy may harm the baby or result in miscarriage. Adverse effects of vinpocetine include flushing, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, transient hypo- and hyper-tension, headaches, heartburn, and decreased blood pressure. FDA issued a statement in 2019 warning that ""vinpocetine may cause a miscarriage or harm fetal development"". == Mechanism of action == Vinpocetine’s mechanism of action has been postulated to involve three potential effects: blockage of sodium channels, reduction of cellular calcium influx, and antioxidant activity. Studies have also suggested that vinpocetine can inhibit PDE-1 in isolated rabbit aorta; inhibit IKK in vitro, preventing IκB degradation and the following translocation of NF-κB to the cell nucleus; and increase DOPAC, a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine, in isolated striatal nerve endings of rats. == Dietary supplement == The inclusion of vinpocetine in dietary supplements in the U.S. has come under scrutiny due to the lack of defined dosage parameters, unproven short- and long-term benefits, and risks to human health. In the U.S., vinpocetine supplements are marketed as sports supplements, brain enhancers, and weight loss supplements. A 2015 analysis of 23 brands of vinpocetine dietary supplements sold at GNC and Vitamin Shoppe retail stores reported widespread labeling errors. Only 6 of the 23 supplement labels (26%) provided consumers with accurate dosages of vinpocetine (ranging from 0.3 to 32 mg per recommended daily serving), while 6 of 23 (26%) contained no vinpocetine at all, despite their labels claiming that the ingredient was in them. In total, 9 of the 23 products tested were mislabeled, and 17 of 23 (74%) did not provide any information on the quantity of vinpocetine. In response to the study, then-senator Claire McCaskill, while at the time serving as the top Democrat on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, urged the FDA to suspend sales of vinpocetine supplements and asked 10 retailers to voluntarily stop selling vinpocetine products. McCaskill stated: ""The way we regulate these supplements isn’t working—and it’s putting the lives and well-being of consumers at risk. We’ve seen products with false labels, tainted ingredients, wildly illegal claims, and, now, products containing synthesized ingredients that are classified as prescription drugs in other countries."" === Lawsuits === Procera AVH is a dietary supplement containing undisclosed amounts of vinpocetine in combination with huperzine A and acetyl-l-carnitine. In 2012, manufacturer Brain Research Labs (BRL) agreed to pay $500,000 to settle a class action lawsuit which alleged that the company had falsely marketed Procera AVH as capable of improving brain function, in violation of the Consumer Fraud Act. In July 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled that marketing claims for Procera AVH, which promoted the product as a “solution” to memory loss and cognitive decline, were false, misleading, unsubstantiated, and in violation of the FTC Act. BRL and its affiliated companies Brain Power Partners, Brain Power Founders, and MedHealth Direct (all based in Laguna Beach, California) were fined $91 million. KeyView Labs, the Tampa, Florida-based company that purchased BRL in 2012, was fined $61 million. Also named in the FTC complaint were George Reynolds (aka Josh Reynolds), founder and chief science officer of BRL, and John Arnold, the sole officer and employee of MedHealth. The FTC complaint charged Reynolds with making deceptive expert endorsements for Procera AVH. The defendants in the case ultimately agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle the allegations of deceptive advertising brought by the FTC and California law enforcement officials. In addition, a permanent injunction barred the defendants from making similar deceptive claims about Procera AVH in the future and from misrepresenting the existence, results, or conclusions of any scientific study. == References ==",Cavinton,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -2.5776860184123507e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.3134414851665497), (' INDUSTR', -0.4358573257923126), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007687236065976322), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.6931930780410767)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinpocetine?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Vinpocetine', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinpocetine?utm_source=openai')])"
1385,"('Creatinine', 'Kreatinin', 'Creatinine (van) (8ci)', 'Creatinina', 'Kreatininum')","Endogenous, Medical","Mesoamerican nephropathy (MeN) is an endemic, non-diabetic, non-hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD) characterized by reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with mild or no proteinuria and no features of known primary glomerular diseases. MeN is prevalent in agricultural communities along the Pacific Ocean coastal lowlands Mesoamerica, including southern Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica. Although most cases have been described among agricultural workers, MeN has also been described in other occupations, including miners, brick manufacturers, and fishermen. A common denominator among these occupations is that they are outdoor workers who reside in rural areas in hot and humid climates. The MeN epidemic in Central America extends along a nearly 1000 kilometer stretch of the Pacific coast. Among the countries that this span encompasses, CKD is the second leading cause of death in El Salvador and Nicaragua, third leading cause in Costa Rica, and fourth leading cause in Panama. El Salvador and Nicaragua have the highest rates of kidney disease mortality in the world; among men, the mortality rate from CKD is approximately six-fold higher in El Salvador and five-fold higher in Nicaragua than the median global rate, and 1.5-2 times higher than the rate in Libya, the third-highest country on the list. The disease has devastated many of the communities where it exists and has overwhelmed healthcare systems in affected countries, causing unknown morbidity and tens of thousands of deaths over the last 20 years in Mesoamerica alone. MeN is generally diagnosed in men in their twenties or thirties, and initially presents as a progressive decline in GFR without notable proteinuria. Traditional risk factors for CKD, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus, are generally absent. Despite international research efforts, the specific causes of the disease remain unknown, creating an enormous need for research, patient care and socioeconomic interventions that can only be appropriately addressed through international and interdisciplinary collaboration. The term Mesoamerican Nephropathy has been in use in Central America and Mexico since 2012. Similar epidemics have been identified in both Sri Lanka and India, leading to the use of other terms that are not geographically specific, including Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) or of non-traditional origin (CKDnt) and Chronic Interstitial Nephritis in Agricultural Communities (CINAC). Although the diseases are clinically similar and affect similar populations in each country, whether these are all manifestations of the same disease or different diseases with superficial resemblance remains to be definitively demonstrated. High prevalence of CKD with similar characteristics to MeN may exist outside of Mesoamerica, India, and Sri Lanka, although evidence so far is limited to small studies and clinician reports. == Causes == Although many factors have been proposed as the cause of MeN, most attention has focused on heat stress due to a combination of strenuous work in a hot climate with insufficient hydration. Additional postulated contributing exposures include agrochemicals, metals, and pathogens. These factors are themselves a result of global and national economic and political systems that have led to poverty and social stratification. Discovery of the causes of MeN has been complicated by the fact that there are likely multiple factors that arise from different sources of exposure and/or different times of life. Until recently, progress has also been slowed by a lack of research funding, although more support has become available as awareness of the disease and its toll on the population has increased. A review published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2019 summarizes a proposed mechanism in which heat exposure leads to dehydration and volume depletion and/or an increase in core temperature, which may cause kidney injury directly through tissue dysfunction or indirectly through hyperosmolarity or rhabdomyolysis. Similarly, it is possible that chronic sub-clinical undetected AKI leads to eventual CKD. Another proposed mechanism is increased kidney tubular toxin uptake resulting in direct tubular toxicity, which might also be amplified by heat-associated dehydration. Genetic factors are also likely to play a role. Regardless of what mechanisms are eventually proven to be involved, researchers agree that preventive measures should include measures to ensure safe drinking water, adequate hydration, rest, and shade for workers at risk, as well as to reduce exposure to toxins. A review of the state of knowledge on potential causes and mechanisms as of 2019 can be found in a summary of the Third International Workshop on Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain/Non-Traditional Etiology in Mesoamerica and Other Regions on Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology held in March 2019. === Heat stress, dehydration and disturbances in water and mineral balance. === Heat strain and dehydration is in the spotlight globally due to emerging evidence of their association with adverse renal health issues including chronic kidney disease, especially in working populations. The probability of heat stress is greater when the temperature of the environment surpasses a person's core temperature, a situation common for outdoor workers in tropical settings where temperatures can easily surpass 37 °C. Although the specific mechanism by which heat, dehydration and workload contribute to the causal pathway for MeN remains to be definitively established, the association with MeN has been shown repeatedly. Epidemiological studies in Central America have reported adverse heat stress impacts in agricultural workers, particularly those in the sugarcane industry. In addition to exposure to high temperatures, evidence exists that high sweat rates and limited fluid intake can lead to functional and sub-clinical acute kidney injuries (AKI), and that repetitive AKI may lead to the development of CKD. A well-conducted study on the relationship between workload and incidence of kidney injury in a fieldworker cohort with different levels of physically demanding work over a sugarcane harvest in Nicaragua was published in October 2019. The results provide evidence of dose-effect as well as dose-response relations between high-heat and high workload exposure and both increased episodes of incident acute kidney injury as well as progressive decline in GFR. The role of heat stress in the etiology of MeN is further supported by intervention studies showing mitigation of kidney function decline with efforts to improve rest, hydration, and access to shade among high-risk agricultural workers. Finally, evidence from animal models suggests a potential mechanism or mechanisms for how heat stress may drive development of MeN. === Agrochemicals === Agrochemicals like paraquat have been frequently been proposed as a potential cause or contributor to the development of MeN, although the epidemiological and pathophysiologic evidence is somewhat limited and contradictory. The main limitations of both positive and negative studies remain poor specificity and quantification of pesticide exposure, as well as the cross-sectional nature of most studies and issues with confounding and selection bias. No study has directly investigated interactions between pesticides and other concomitant exposures in agricultural occupations, in particular heat stress and dehydration. Thus, existing studies provide scarce evidence for an association between pesticides and regional MeN epidemics, but a role of nephrotoxic agrochemicals nevertheless should not be conclusively discarded. === Exposure to metals === Exposure to metals such as cadmium, lead, nickel, and mercury has also been proposed as a cause or contributor to MeN, again with limited and contradictory evidence. A number of well conducted studies have shown no association with the development of MeN, although a 2020 case–control study found an association with nickel exposure. There may be regional variation with respect to the role of heavy metals, which appear unlikely to be an important contributor in Mesoamerica but which remain under more active investigation in India and Sri Lanka. === Alcohol and self-medication === Alcohol consumption, including consumption of home-brewed alcohol, as well as self-medication with NSAIDS and other nephrotoxic medications occurs in populations affected by MeN. To what extent such exposures contribute to the epidemic of MeN is not known, as evidence is again contradictory. Some studies have described an association between NSAID use or consumption of a home-brewed alcohol called ""lija"" and MeN, whereas others have found limited evidence that either is an important risk factor. === Infectious causes === The high density of infectious disease vectors and reservoirs, in the context of limited access to clean water, limited resources for detecting and controlling infectious disease outbreaks, and the continued emergence of new pathogens and pathogen variants, is an important consideration when addressing kidney health in tropical and low-resource settings. The presence of these factors in MeN burdened regions lend credence to the hypothesis of an infectious etiology, and there is some evidence in support of infection as a risk factor. However, other published studies investigating infectious agents as a causal factor in MeN have been negative. There may again exist regional variation between Mesoamerica and India / Sri Lanka with respect to the role of infectious causes in CKD development. == Diagnosis == A challenging feature of MeN is that, because the pathophysiology of disease remains relatively poorly understood, the case definition remains broad and likely will include many cases of undiagnosed kidney diseases that ultimately prove to be unrelated to MeN. Recent efforts to provide a case definition have focused on the following features: Suspected disease: Estimated GFR (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 Absence of diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune disease, glomerular disease, congenital kidney disease, obstructive kidney disease as a clear cause of kidney disease (these comorbidities may be present but cannot account for disease development) Residing in a hotspot region Proteinuria < 2g/24h or 2g/g urine creatinine Likely disease: All of the above, plus eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 on 3 month or longer repeat measurement Relative hypokalemia and/or hyperuricemia Kidney ultrasound with loss of corticomedullary differentiation or bilateral small kidney size, without cystic disease or large stone burden Kidney biopsy showing primary tubulointerstitial disease without alternative cause of kidney disease in evidence This case definition may not be as useful for disease outside of Mesoamerica; while there are many similarities between clinical aspects of CKDu in India, Sri Lanka, and MeN in Mesoamerica, there are some important differences as well. Individuals affected in Mesoamerica are younger (aged 20–40 as opposed to 20–60 at the age of onset of CKD). Both regions demonstrate a high male-to-female ratio and significant familial concordance, but the degree of male predominance appears to be greater in Mesoamerica. Most affected individuals in both regions live in rural poverty and work in occupations involving physical labor, including agriculture, fishing, and aquaculture. Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, minimal proteinuria, and sterile pyuria are highly prevalent. Individuals in Mesoamerica often have hyperuricemia and urate crystalluria, but this is observed less frequently India or Sri Lanka, . Kidney biopsy in individuals with MeN demonstrates some consistent features across regions. Biopsies are generally chronic glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage with glomerulosclerosis and chronic glomerular ischemia, without positive findings on immunofluorescence or definitive evidence of primary glomerular lesions. Glomerular enlargement may be observed. Ultrastructural changes evaluated with electron microscopy were mostly consistent with the light microscopic observations. Large dysmorphic lysosomes within tubular epithelial cells have been proposed as a distinctive feature but at present are not considered pathognomonic. In kidney biopsies from individuals with acute kidney injury (AKI) among high-risk patients for MeN, considered possibly a contributing stage to disease, the main findings were described as tubulointerstitial nephritis with varying degrees of acute inflammation and chronic tubulointerstitial changes. In some cases, neutrophils have been found in the tubular lumen of both chronic and acute MeN/CKDu patients, but urine cultures from these patients have been negative. == Treatment == No standard guidelines for the management of MeN patients exist, and treatment strategies employed by health care providers vary widely. Based on clinical consensus from the most recent CENCAM meeting, no specific treatment exists beyond improving access to shade, hydration, and rest among individuals engaging in work that places them at risk for heat stress, as well as emphasizing access to clean air and water and avoidance of nephrotoxic substances. Care of advanced CKD due to MeN should likely be similar to that employed in advanced CKD of other causes. There are anecdotal reports of response to allopurinol (in response to elevated uric acid levels), corticosteroids (in response to acute tubulointerstitial nephritis on kidney biopsy), and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), but the consensus is that there is insufficient evidence to support any of these therapies. == Prognosis == Evidence regarding the prognosis when MeN remains limited. One study suggests that there is substantial variety in progression of disease, with some individuals having slow or no further decline in kidney function following diagnosis, while others rapidly progress to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). == History == High incidence of kidney disease in young agricultural workers, mostly in sugarcane, was first reported in communities in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica in the 1990s, with the first published report appearing in 2002. Early studies suggested that MeN was most prevalent in communities with a large proportion of individuals working in sugarcane and other high-intensity agriculture, as well as in non-agricultural occupations involving heavy manual labor in hot environments at sea level, and was less prevalent among subsistence farmers and in communities located at higher altitudes. A landmark international research meeting devoted to MeN, organized primarily by the Program on Work, Environment and Health in Central America (SALTRA), occurred in 2012. This workshop also led to the creation of the Consortium on the Epidemic of Nephropathy in Central America and Mexico (CENCAM), an international group of researchers and clinicians whose mission is to increase international collaboration for the exploration and research of MeN; contribute to a reduction in the overall prevalence and impact of MeN; and raise awareness and action about MeN in Central America and Mexico. Two additional international workshops were held in 2015 and 2019, and summaries of all three workshops are available. In April 2013, a high-level meeting with regional health ministries, nongovernmental organizations, aid agencies, clinical specialists and researchers was held in San Salvador city, El Salvador, leading the Panamerican Health Organization (PAHO) to finally declare CKDu ""a pressing and extremely serious health problem in the region"". The Declaration described CKD as having ""catastrophic effects associated with toxic-environmental and occupational factors, dehydration and behaviors harmful to renal health"". In it, the Ministers of Health of the Central American Integration System [SICA, the Spanish acronym] declared their commitment to address CKDu comprehensively and to ""strengthening scientific research in the framework of the prevention and control of chronic non-communicable diseases"". This Declaration was subsequently endorsed by PAHO through the Resolution CD52.R1, adopted during the 52nd Directing Council, 65th Session of the Regional Committee of WHO for the Americas, in October 2013. == References ==",Creatinina,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.4744046926498413)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.009535717777907848), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000681883015204221)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

We established a hypothesis that therapy with ciprofloxacin results in faster resolution of mucosal inflammation in comparison with furagin. Rates of urinary secretion of immunoglobulins class A, M and G and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were evaluated before and after initiation of therapy in adult women presenting with acute cystitis confirmed by urine culture. Women were randomised into two groups receiving either ciprofloxacin 250mg twice a day for 3 days (n=13) or furagin 100mg three times a day for 7 days (n=14). Median lengths of follow-up were 4 days and 5 days in the ciprofloxacin and furagin groups, respectively. Treatment with ciprofloxacin resulted in faster eradication of pathogens. No bacteria or nitrates were detected in the ciprofloxacin group, whilst leukocyte esterase was positive in only one case. In the furagin group there were four positive cultures, seven cases with positive nitrates and five cases with positive esterase. Secretion rates of all four substances dropped significantly, but the changes over time were similar in both groups. The human pharmacokinetics of a nitrofurantoin congener furagin was studied after a single oral dose of 200 mg and during a 9-day continuous treatment with a dose of 100 mg t.i.d. The same dose of nitrofurantoin served as a reference medication. In the acute cross-over phase food greatly speeded up and atropine somewhat retarded the absorption of furagin, but the total absorption remained virtually unchanged as judged from the unchanged AUC values. The furagin concentrations in serum remain several hours above the MIC concentrations of many pathogenic bacteria. Despite the high concentrations in serum, the urine levels of furagin were generally lower than those of nitrofurantoin. The 24 hr recoveries in urine were 8--13% for furagin and about 36% for nitrofurantoin. In the prolonged trial furagin was absorbed and excreted in the same way as in the acute trial. On the 9th day the concentrations in serum and urine were higher than on the first day.

Alternatively, Fura-2, Furaptra, Indo-1 and aequorin may be used. An acetomethoxy group obscures the part of the molecule that chelates Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and other ions. After transport into the cells, intracellular esterases remove the acetomethoxy group, the molecule gets trapped inside and gives out strong green fluorescence. As dead cells lack active esterases, only live cells are labeled and counted by flow cytometry. Calcein is now rarely used as a Ca2+ or Mg2+ indicator because its fluorescence is directly sensitive to these ions only at strongly alkaline pH, and thus it is not particularly useful for measuring Ca2+ or Mg2+ in cells. Fluorescence of calcein is quenched strongly by Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ and appreciably by Fe3+ and Mn2+ at physiological pH. This fluorescence quenching response can be exploited for detecting the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and for measuring cell volume changes. Calcein is commonly used for cell tracing and in studies of endocytosis, cell migration, and gap junctions. The acetoxymethyl ester of calcein is also used to detect drug interactions with multidrug resistance proteins (ABC transporters ATP-binding cassette transporter genes) in intact cells as it is an excellent substrate of the multidrug resistance transporter 1 (MDR1) P-glycoprotein and the Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein (MRP1). The calcein AM assay can be used as a model for drug-drug interactions, for screening transporter substrates and/or inhibitors; and also to determine in vitro drug resistance of cells, including samples from patients. Calcein is also used for marking freshly hatched fish and for labeling of bones in live animals. == References ==",Fluorexon,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.3874405324459076), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.2716831862926483), ('DU', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('ST', -2.264974000354414e-06), ('RI', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.07896245270967484), ('ĠMED', -0.055391211062669754), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02331754006445408)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.6381815671920776), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB11184 ', [])"
1388,"('Octreotide (acetate)', 'Octreotide', 'Octreotide acetate', 'Sandostatin', 'Longastatin')",Medical,"Octreotide, sold under the brand name Sandostatin among others, is an octapeptide that mimics natural somatostatin pharmacologically, though it is a more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than the natural hormone. It was first synthesized in 1979 and binds predominantly to the somatostatin receptors SSTR2 and SSTR5. It was approved for use in the United States in 1988. Octreotide was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2022. As of June 2020, octreotide is the first oral somatostatin analog (SSA) approved by the FDA. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Tumors === Octreotide is used for the treatment of growth hormone producing tumors (acromegaly and gigantism), when surgery is contraindicated, pituitary tumors that secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropinoma), diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with carcinoid syndrome, and diarrhea in people with vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors (VIPomas). Octreotide is also used in mild cases of glucagonoma when surgery is not an option. === Bleeding esophageal varices === Octreotide is often given as an infusion for management of acute hemorrhage from esophageal varices in liver cirrhosis on the basis that it reduces portal venous pressure, though current evidence suggests that this effect is transient and does not improve survival. === Radiolabeling === Octreotide is used in nuclear medicine imaging by labeling with indium-111 (Octreoscan) to noninvasively image neuroendocrine and other tumours expressing somatostatin receptors. It has been radiolabeled with carbon-11 as well as gallium-68 (using edotreotide), enabling imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). === Acromegaly === In June 2020, octreotide (Mycapssa) was approved for medical use in the United States with an indication for the long-term maintenance treatment in acromegaly patients who have responded to and tolerated treatment with octreotide or lanreotide. Mycapssa is the first oral somatostatin analog (SSA) approved by the FDA. === Hypoglycemia === Octreotide is also used in the treatment of refractory hypoglycemia or congenital hyperinsulinism in neonates and sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycemia in adults. == Contraindications == Octreotide has not been adequately studied for the treatment of children as well as pregnant and lactating women. The medication is given to these groups only if a risk-benefit analysis is positive. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects are headache, hypothyroidism, cardiac conduction changes, gastrointestinal reactions (including cramps, nausea/vomiting and diarrhoea or constipation), gallstones, reduction of insulin release, hyperglycemia or sometimes hypoglycemia, and (usually transient) injection site reactions. Slow heart rate, skin reactions such as pruritus, hyperbilirubinemia, hypothyroidism, dizziness and dyspnoea are also fairly common (more than 1%). Rare side effects include acute anaphylactic reactions, pancreatitis and hepatitis. Some studies reported alopecia in those who were treated by octreotide. Rats which were treated by octreotide experienced erectile dysfunction in a 1998 study. A prolonged QT interval has been observed, but it is uncertain whether this is a reaction to the medication or the result of an existing illness. == Interactions == Octreotide can reduce the intestinal reabsorption of ciclosporin, possibly making it necessary to increase the dose. People with diabetes mellitus might need less insulin or oral antidiabetics when treated with octreotide, as it inhibits glucagon secretion more strongly and for a longer time span than insulin secretion. The bioavailability of bromocriptine is increased; besides being an antiparkinsonian, bromocriptine is also used for the treatment of acromegaly. == Pharmacology == Since octreotide resembles somatostatin in physiological activities, it can: inhibit secretion of many hormones, such as gastrin, cholecystokinin, glucagon, growth hormone, insulin, secretin, pancreatic polypeptide, TSH, and vasoactive intestinal peptide, reduce secretion of fluids by the intestine and pancreas, reduce gastrointestinal motility and inhibit contraction of the gallbladder, inhibit the action of certain hormones from the anterior pituitary, cause vasoconstriction in the blood vessels, and reduce portal vessel pressures in bleeding varices. It has also been shown to produce analgesic effects, most probably acting as a partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor. === Pharmacokinetics === Octreotide is absorbed quickly and completely after subcutaneous application. Maximal plasma concentration is reached after 30 minutes. The elimination half-life is 100 minutes (1.7 hours) on average when applied subcutaneously; after intravenous injection, the substance is eliminated in two phases with half-lives of 10 and 90 minutes, respectively. == History == Octreotide acetate was approved for use in the United States in 1988. In January 2020, approval of octreotide acetate in the United States was granted to Sun Pharmaceutical under the brand name Bynfezia Pen for the treatment of: the reduction of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (somatomedin C) in adults with acromegaly who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation, and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated doses severe diarrhea/flushing episodes associated with metastatic carcinoid tumors in adults profuse watery diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPomas) in adults == Society and culture == === Legal status === In September 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Mycapssa, intended for the treatment of adults with acromegaly. The applicant for this medicinal product is Amryt Pharmaceuticals DAC. Mycapssa was approved for medical use in the European Union in December 2022. == Research == Octreotide has also been used off-label for the treatment of severe, refractory diarrhea from other causes. It is used in toxicology for the treatment of prolonged recurrent hypoglycemia after sulfonylurea and possibly meglitinide overdose. It has also been used with varying degrees of success in infants with nesidioblastosis to help decrease insulin hypersecretion. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the effect of octreotide as acute treatment (abortive agent) in cluster headache, where it has been shown that administration of subcutaneous octreotide is effective when compared with placebo. Octreotide has also been investigated in people with pain from chronic pancreatitis. It has been used in the treatment of malignant bowel obstruction. Octreotide may be used in conjunction with midodrine to partially reverse peripheral vasodilation in the hepatorenal syndrome. By increasing systemic vascular resistance, these medications reduce shunting and improve renal perfusion, prolonging survival until definitive treatment with liver transplant. Similarly, octreotide can be used to treat refractory chronic hypotension. While successful treatment has been demonstrated in case reports, larger studies have failed to demonstrate efficacy in treating chylothorax. A small study has shown that octreotide may be effective in the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. === Obesity === Octreotide has been used experimentally to treat obesity, particularly obesity caused by lesions in the hunger and satiety centers of the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively. The ventromedial hypothalamus is sometimes injured by ongoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or surgery or radiation to treat posterior cranial fossa tumors. With the ventromedial hypothalamus disabled and no longer responding to peripheral energy balance signals, ""Efferent sympathetic activity drops, resulting in malaise and reduced energy expenditure, and vagal activity increases, resulting in increased insulin secretion and adipogenesis."" ""VMH dysfunction promotes excessive caloric intake and decreased caloric expenditure, leading to continuous and unrelenting weight gain. Attempts at caloric restriction or pharmacotherapy with adrenergic or serotonergic agents have previously met with little or only brief success in treating this syndrome."" In this context, octreotide suppresses the excessive release of insulin and may increase its action, thereby inhibiting excessive adipose storage. In a small clinical trial in eighteen pediatric subjects with intractable weight gain following therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or brain tumors and other evidence of hypothalamic dysfunction, octreotide reduced body mass index (BMI) and insulin response during glucose tolerance test, while increasing parent-reported physical activity and quality of life (QoL) relative to placebo. In a separate placebo-controlled trial of obese adults without known hypothalamic lesions, obese subjects who received long-acting octreotide lost weight and reduced their BMI compared to subjects receiving placebo; post hoc analysis suggested greater effects in participants receiving the higher dose of the medication, and among ""Caucasian subjects having insulin secretion greater than the median of the cohort."" ""There were no statistically significant changes in QoL scores, body fat, leptin concentration, Beck Depression Inventory, or macronutrient intake"", although subjects taking octreotide had higher blood glucose after a glucose tolerance test than those receiving placebo. == References ==",Longastatin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.07893087714910507), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.1330835372209549), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01510127354413271)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB2138033.htm,https://www.invivochem.com/octreotide.html,https://www.medkoo.com/products/5122 ', [])"
