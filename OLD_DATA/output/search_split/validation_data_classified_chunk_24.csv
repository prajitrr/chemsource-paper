2379,"('Oleanolic acid', 'Oleanic acid', 'Caryophyllin', 'Astrantiagenin c', 'Giganteumgenin c')","Food, Medical","Caryophyllene (), more formally (−)-β-caryophyllene (BCP), is a natural bicyclic sesquiterpene that occurs widely in nature. Caryophyllene is notable for having a cyclobutane ring, as well as a trans-double bond in a 9-membered ring, both rarities in nature. == Production == Caryophyllene can be produced synthetically, but it is invariably obtained from natural sources because it is widespread. It is a constituent of many essential oils, especially clove oil, the oil from the stems and flowers of Syzygium aromaticum (cloves), the essential oil of Cannabis sativa, copaiba, rosemary, and hops. It is usually found as a mixture with isocaryophyllene (the cis double bond isomer) and α-humulene (obsolete name: α-caryophyllene), a ring-opened isomer. Caryophyllene is one of the chemical compounds that contributes to the aroma of black pepper. == Basic research == β-Caryophyllene is under basic research for its potential action as an agonist of the cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2 receptor). In other basic studies, β-caryophyllene has a binding affinity of Ki = 155 nM at the CB2 receptors. β-Caryophyllene has the highest cannabinoid activity compared to the ring opened isomer α-caryophyllene humulene which may modulate CB2 activity. To compare binding, cannabinol binds to the CB2 receptors as a partial agonist with an affinity of Ki = 126.4 nM, while delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol binds to the CB2 receptors as a partial agonist with an affinity of Ki = 36 nM. == Safety == Caryophyllene has been given generally recognized as safe (GRAS) designation by the FDA and is approved by the FDA for use as a food additive, typically for flavoring. Rats given up to 700 mg/kg daily for 90 days did not produce any significant toxic effects. Caryophyllene has an LD50 of 5,000 mg/kg in mice. == Metabolism and derivatives == 14-Hydroxycaryophyllene oxide (C15H24O2) was isolated from the urine of rabbits treated with (−)-caryophyllene (C15H24). The X-ray crystal structure of 14-hydroxycaryophyllene (as its acetate derivative) has been reported. The metabolism of caryophyllene progresses through (−)-caryophyllene oxide (C15H24O) since the latter compound also afforded 14-hydroxycaryophyllene (C15H24O) as a metabolite. Caryophyllene (C15H24) → caryophyllene oxide (C15H24O) → 14-hydroxycaryophyllene (C15H24O) → 14-hydroxycaryophyllene oxide (C15H24O2). Caryophyllene oxide, in which the alkene group of caryophyllene has become an epoxide, is the component responsible for cannabis identification by drug-sniffing dogs and is also an approved food additive, often as flavoring. Caryophyllene oxide may have negligible cannabinoid activity. == Natural sources == The approximate quantity of caryophyllene in the essential oil of each source is given in square brackets ([ ]): Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) [3.8–37.5% of cannabis flower essential oil] Black caraway (Carum nigrum) [7.8%] Cloves (Syzygium aromaticum) [1.7–19.5% of clove bud essential oil] Hops (Humulus lupulus) [5.1–14.5%] Basil (Ocimum spp.) [5.3–10.5% O. gratissimum; 4.0–19.8% O. micranthum] Oregano (Origanum vulgare) [4.9–15.7%] Black pepper (Piper nigrum) [7.29%] Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) [4.62–7.55% of lavender oil] Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) [0.1–8.3%] True cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) [6.9–11.1%] Malabathrum (Cinnamomum tamala) [25.3%] Ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata) [3.1–10.7%] Copaiba oil (Copaifera) === Biosynthesis === Caryophyllene is a common sesquiterpene among plant species. It is biosynthesized from the common terpene precursors dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). First, single units of DMAPP and IPP are reacted via an SN1-type reaction with the loss of pyrophosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme GPPS2, to form geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). This further reacts with a second unit of IPP, also via an SN1-type reaction catalyzed by the enzyme IspA, to form farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Finally, FPP undergoes QHS1 enzyme-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to form caryophyllene. == Compendial status == Food Chemicals Codex == Further reading == Ghelardini, C.; Galeotti, N.; Di Cesare Mannelli, L.; Mazzanti, G.; Bartolini, A.

2380,"('Mupirocin', 'Pseudomonic acid', 'Bactroban', 'Mupirocine', 'Pseudomonic acid a')",Medical,"Mupirocin, sold under the brand name Bactroban among others, is a topical antibiotic useful against superficial skin infections such as impetigo or folliculitis. It may also be used to get rid of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) when present in the nose without symptoms. Due to concerns of developing resistance, use for greater than ten days is not recommended. It is used as a cream or ointment applied to the skin. Common side effects include itchiness and rash at the site of application, headache, and nausea. Long term use may result in increased growth of fungi. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding appears to be safe. Mupirocin is chemically a carboxylic acid. It works by blocking a bacteria's ability to make protein, which usually results in bacterial death. Mupirocin was initially isolated in 1971 from Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 162nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Mupirocin is used as a topical treatment for bacterial skin infections (for example, boils, impetigo, or open wounds), which are typically due to infection by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It is also useful in the treatment of superficial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Mupirocin is inactive for most anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, mycoplasma, chlamydia, yeast, and fungi. Intranasal mupirocin before surgery is effective for prevention of post-operative wound infection with Staphylcoccus aureus and preventative intranasal or catheter-site treatment is effective for reducing the risk of catheter site infection in persons treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis. === Resistance === Shortly after the clinical use of mupirocin began, strains of Staphylococcus aureus that were resistant to mupirocin emerged, with nares clearance rates of less than 30% success. Two distinct populations of mupirocin-resistant S. aureus were isolated. One strain possessed low-level resistance (MuL: MIC = 8–256 mg/L), and another possessed high-level resistance (MuH: MIC > 256 mg/L). Resistance in the MuL strains is probably due to mutations in the organism's wild-type isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleS). In E. coli IleS, a single amino acid mutation was shown to alter mupirocin resistance. MuH is linked to the acquisition of a separate Ile synthetase gene, MupA. Mupirocin is not a viable antibiotic against MuH strains. Other antibiotic agents, such as azelaic acid, nitrofurazone, silver sulfadiazine, and ramoplanin have been shown to be effective against MuH strains. Most strains of Cutibacterium acnes, a causative agent in the skin disease acne vulgaris, are naturally resistant to mupirocin. Most strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens are also resistant to mupirocin as they produce the antibiotic and it's possible other species of Pseudomonas may be resistant as well. The mechanism of action of mupirocin differs from other clinical antibiotics, rendering cross-resistance to other antibiotics unlikely. However, the MupA gene may co-transfer with other antibacterial resistance genes. This has been observed already with resistance genes for triclosan, tetracycline, and trimethoprim. It may also result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. A second type of high-level resistant synthetase was discovered in 2012 and termed MupB. It was found in a Canadian MRSA isolate ""MUP87"" and is probably located on a nonconjugative plasmid. == Mechanism of action == Pseudomonic acid (mupirocin) inhibits isoleucine—tRNA ligase in bacteria, leading to depletion of isoleucyl-tRNA and accumulation of the corresponding uncharged tRNA. Depletion of isoleucyl-tRNA results in inhibition of protein synthesis. The uncharged form of the tRNA binds to the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site of ribosomes, triggering the formation of (p)ppGpp, which in turn inhibits RNA synthesis. The combined inhibition of protein synthesis and RNA synthesis results in bacteriostasis. This mechanism of action is shared with furanomycin, an analog of isoleucine. Inhibition of the tRNA ligase/synthase is brought by the structural similarity between the molecule's monic acid ""head"" part and isoleucyl-adenylate (Ile-AMS). The unique 9-hydroxynonanoic acid ""tail"" wraps around the enzyme and further stabilizes the complex, keeping the catalytic part stuck. Mupirocin is able to bind to bacterial and archaeal versions of the enzyme, but not eukaryotic versions. == Biosynthesis == Mupirocin is a mixture of several pseudomonic acids, with pseudomonic acid A (PA-A) constituting greater than 90% of the mixture. Also present in mupirocin are pseudomonic acid B with an additional hydroxyl group at C8, pseudomonic acid C with a double bond between C10 and C11, instead of the epoxide of PA-A, and pseudomonic acid D with a double bond at C4` and C5` in the 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid portion of mupirocin. === Biosynthesis of pseudomonic acid A === The 74 kb mupirocin gene cluster contains six multi-domain enzymes and twenty-six other peptides (Table 1). Four large multi-domain type I polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins are encoded, as well as several single function enzymes with sequence similarity to type II PKSs. Therefore, it is believed that mupirocin is constructed by a mixed type I and type II PKS system. The mupirocin cluster exhibits an atypical acyltransferase (AT) organization, in that there are only two AT domains, and both are found on the same protein, MmpC. These AT domains are the only domains present on MmpC, while the other three type I PKS proteins contain no AT domains. The mupirocin pathway also contains several tandem acyl carrier protein doublets or triplets. This may be an adaptation to increase the throughput rate or to bind multiple substrates simultaneously. Pseudomonic acid A is the product of an esterification between the 17C polyketide monic acid and the 9C fatty acid 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid. The possibility that the entire molecule is assembled as a single polyketide with a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation inserting an oxygen into the carbon backbone has been ruled out because C1 of monic acid and C9' of 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid are both derived from C1 of acetate. === Monic acid biosynthesis === Biosynthesis of the 17C monic acid unit begins on MmpD (Figure 1). One of the AT domains from MmpC may transfer an activated acetyl group from acetyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) to the first ACP domain. The chain is extended by malonyl-CoA, followed by a SAM-dependent methylation at C12 (see Figure 2 for PA-A numbering) and reduction of the B-keto group to an alcohol. The dehydration (DH) domain in module 1 is predicted to be non-functional due to a mutation in the conserved active site region. Module 2 adds another two carbons by the malonyl-CoA extender unit, followed by ketoreduction (KR) and dehydration. Module three adds a malonyl-CoA extender unit, followed by SAM-dependent methylation at C8, ketoreduction, and dehydration. Module 4 extends the molecule with a malonyl-CoA unit followed by ketoreduction. Assembly of monic acid is continued by the transfer of the 12C product of MmpD to MmpA. === Post-PKS tailoring === The keto group at C3 is replaced with a methyl group in a multi-step reaction (Figure 3). MupG begins by decarboxylating a malonyl-ACP. The alpha carbon of the resulting acetyl-ACP is linked to C3 of the polyketide chain by MupH. This intermediate is dehydrated and decarboxylated by MupJ and MupK, respectively. The formation of the pyran ring requires many enzyme-mediated steps (Figure 4). The double bond between C8 and C9 is proposed to migrate to between C8 and C16. Gene knockout experiments of mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE have eliminated PA-A production. PA-B production is not removed by these knockouts, demonstrating that PA-B is not created by hydroxylating PA-A. A knockout of mupW eliminated the pyran ring, identifying MupW as being involved in ring formation. The epoxide of PA-A at C10-11 is believed to be inserted after pyran formation by a cytochrome P450 such as MupO. A gene knockout of mupO abolished PA-A production but PA-B, which also contains the C10-C11 epoxide, remained. === 9-Hydroxy-nonanoic acid biosynthesis === The nine-carbon fatty acid 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid (9-HN) is derived as a separate compound and later esterified to monic acid to form pseudomonic acid. 13C labeled acetate feeding has shown that C1-C6 are constructed with acetate in the canonical fashion of fatty acid synthesis. C7' shows only C1 labeling of acetate, while C8' and C9' show a reversed pattern of 13C labeled acetate. It is speculated that C7-C9 arises from a 3-hydroxypropionate starter unit, which is extended three times with malonyl-CoA and fully reduced to yield 9-HN. It has also been suggested that 9-HN is initiated by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG). This latter theory was not supported by feeding of [3-14C] or [3,6-13C2]-HMG. It is proposed that MmpB to catalyze the synthesis of 9-HN (Figure 5). MmpB contains a KS, KR, DH, 3 ACPs, and a thioesterase (TE) domain. It does not contain an enoyl reductase (ER) domain, which would be required for the complete reduction to the nine-carbon fatty acid. MupE is a single-domain protein that shows sequence similarity to known ER domains and may complete the reaction. == References ==",Bactroban,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.95898348162882e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00409122696146369)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.drugs.com/bactroban.html ', [])"
2381,"('Tolcapone', 'Ro 40-7592', 'Tasmar', '(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)(4-methylphenyl)methanone', '(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)(p-tolyl)methanone')",Medical,"Tolcapone, sold under the brand name Tasmar, is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). It is a selective, potent and reversible nitrocatechol-type inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). It has demonstrated significant liver toxicity, which has led to suspension of marketing authorisations in a number of countries. Tolcapone appears to be peripherally selective, but can still cross into the brain in significant amounts and has been found to inhibit COMT centrally as well. In comparison with entacapone, another nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor, tolcapone has a longer half life (2.9 hours vs. 0.8 hours) and can better penetrate into the brain, acting both in the central nervous system and in the periphery. However, entacapone is less toxic for the liver. == Medical uses == Tolcapone is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa or levodopa/benserazide medications. Levodopa is a prodrug for dopamine, which reduces Parkinson symptoms; carbidopa and benserazide are aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors. Without administration of tolcapone, the beneficial effects of levodopa tend to wear off more quickly, resulting in motor fluctuations. == Contraindications == Combining tolcapone with non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine or tranylcypromine is contraindicated. Tolcapone is also contraindicated for people with liver diseases or increased liver enzymes. == Side effects == Tolcapone has demonstrated significant liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity) that limits the drug's utility. Entacapone is an alternative, largely since it has a more favorable toxicity profile. The hepatotoxicity can be related to elevated levels of transaminases, but studies have shown that minimal risk exists for those without preexisting liver conditions when their enzyme levels were being monitored. No clear mechanism is implicated, but it has been hypothesized that it has something to do with abnormal mitochondrial respiration due to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Other side effects regard the increase in dopaminergic activity, including digestive symptoms. Treatment with tolcapone runs the risk of eliciting or prolonging dyskinesia; this can be counteracted by decreasing the dose of levodopa. This occurs because the administration of tolcapone results in the accumulation of the biological methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in the striatum that induces Parkinson symptoms. Digestive symptoms include nausea and diarrhea; further dopaminergic side effects include orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, sweating and dizziness. Tolcapone causes more severe diarrhea than entacapone; this was the most common reason for therapy termination in studies. Urine discoloration comes from yellow tolcapone metabolites being excreted in the urine and is harmless. == Interactions == While increase of dopamine levels is a desired interaction, tolcapone can theoretically also increase the levels of other drugs metabolised by COMT, such as the AADC inhibitors carbidopa and benzerazide, as well as methyldopa, dobutamine, apomorphine, adrenaline, and isoprenaline. In studies, a slight interaction with benzerazide was seen, but not with carbidopa. Other interactions with this group of drugs have not been studied. A related type of theoretical interactions is with drugs that increase catecholamine concentrations, such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors; these also showed only slight effects in practice. Combination with non-selective MAO inhibitors might be dangerous. Due to its affinity to the liver enzyme CYP2C9, interactions with drugs being metabolised by this enzyme are also possible, but unlikely. No interaction with tolbutamide, a 2C9 substrate, was observed in studies. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Tolcapone selectively and reversibly binds to the catalytic site of COMT in both the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS) with greater affinity than any of the three catecholamines, including levodopa. It thereby prevents the 3-O-methylation of levodopa by COMT in the periphery, which produces 3-O-methyldopa, a major metabolite that competes with levodopa to cross the blood–brain barrier. More of the levodopa that is administered reaches the CNS. Additionally, levodopa that has already reached the CNS, after being converted to dopamine, will not be degraded as quickly when tolcapone inhibits COMT activity. Thus, tolcapone improves the bioavailability and reduces the clearance of levodopa and subsequently dopamine from the CNS. The strength of the binding affinity of tolcapone, represented by the inhibition constant Ki (2.5 nM), can be thought of as the dissociation constant for enzyme and inhibitor complex kinetics. Maximum catalytic activity denotes the efficacy of tolcapone (Vmax = 58.4 pmol/min·mg). === Pharmacokinetics === Tolcapone is quickly absorbed from the gut to about 85%. It has an absolute bioavailability of 65%, which is only slightly decreased when taken with food. The substance reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after about two hours. When in the bloodstream, it is almost completely (>99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. The main inactivation step is glucuronidation; other processes are methylation by COMT, hydroxylation by CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 with subsequent oxidation to a carboxylic acid, and possibly a minor path with reduction to an amine with subsequent acetylation. The half-life of tolcapone is two to three hours, the volume of distribution (Vd) being 0.3 L/kg (21 L in an average 70 kg person). 60% of the metabolites are excreted via the urine and 40% via the feces. Only 0.5% of the drug are excreted in unchanged form via the urine. 99% of tolcapone is in monoanionic form in the body because the physiological pH is 7.4. Tolcapone penetrates the blood–brain barrier much better than two other nitrocatechols, nitecapone and entacapone, because it has higher lipophilicity due to its R-substituent. Partition coefficients quantify the ability of the molecule to cross the blood–brain barrier. LogPIdce= 0.2, –1.4, –0.4 for tolcapone, nitecapone and entacopone respectively. Partition coefficients in this case were measured in 1,2-dichloroethane/H2O solution which caused molecules to be in ionized form. There is no current explanation for how these charged molecules permeate the blood–brain barrier. Tolcapone has been said to enter the central nervous system only minimally and hence would appear to be peripherally selective. However, tolcapone is more lipophilic than other COMT inhibitors like entacapone and may be more likely to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). A imaging study in humans found that tolcapone also inhibited COMT in the brain to a significant degree. == Chemistry == Tolcapone is an intensely yellow, odorless, bitter tasting, non-hygroscopic, crystalline compound with a relative molecular mass of 273.25 g/mol. It melts at 143 to 146 °C (289 to 295 °F), is practically insoluble in water and acids but soluble in 0.1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The pKa values are 4.5 and 10.6 for the two phenyl groups; and the maximum absorption is at 268 nm (in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid / ethanol). Its chemical name is 3,4-dihydroxy-4'-methyl-5-nitrobenzophenone. === Synthesis === A synthesis of tolcapone proposed in 2008, begins with a Grignard reaction between 3-Benzyloxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde and p-tolyl magnesium bromide. The alcohol thus produced is then converted to a ketone using sodium t-butoxide. The benzyl protecting group is removed by palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation in the presence of ammonium formate. A nitro group is introduced at the 5-position adjacent to the hydroxyl group unmasked in the cleavage of the benzyl ether. The synthesis ends with cleavage of the methoxy group using aluminum chloride to yield the product alcohol. == History == Tolcapone was introduced into the European market in August 1997, and subsequently into the United States market in March 1998. Liver toxicity was reported in four people who were administered tolcapone, three people died due to complications. Consequentially, the marketing authorization of tolcapone was suspended from December 1998 until August 2004 when it was lifted. In November 1998, the company that manufactured tolcapone voluntarily removed the drug from the market. The authorization was then renewed in August 2009. As a result of reported complications, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning for tolcapone and label revisions that aimed to regulate the monitoring of those prescribed tolcapone for Parkinson's disease in November 1998. A number of other countries withdrew tolcapone from the market; Australia in February 1999, Bulgaria in April 1999, Iceland in November 1998, Lithuania in December 1998. == Research == === Transthyretin amyloidosis === Because of preliminary data suggesting the drug may have activity, the U.S. FDA in 2013 granted tolcapone ""orphan drug status"" in studies aiming at the treatment of transthyretin familial amyloidosis (ATTR). However, as of 2015 tolcapone was not FDA approved for the treatment of this disease. === Psychiatric disorders === In animal studies, tolcapone shows antidepressant- and anti-anhedonia-like effects, stimulates exploratory behavior, and enhances the locomotor hyperactivity induced by psychostimulants like amphetamine and nomifensine. Tolcapone has been clinically studied in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders such as obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). There is also interest in brain-penetrant COMT inhibitors like tolcapone for the treatment of schizophrenia as well as disorders of diminished motivation like apathy. == References == == External links == ""Tolcapone"".

2382,"('Fexinidazole', 'Hoe-239', 'Fexinidazol', 'Fexinidazolum', 'Fexinidazol [inn-spanish]')",Medical,"Fexinidazole is a medication used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. It is effective against both first and second stage disease. Also a potential new treatment for Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, and trouble sleeping. Other side effects may include QT prolongation, psychosis, and low white blood cells. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breast feeding is safe. Fexinidazole is in the antiparasitic and the nitroimidazole family of medications. It is believed to work by turning on certain enzymes within the parasites that result in their death. Fexinidazole was first described in 1978. It was given a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency in 2018. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Development for sleeping sickness was funded by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative in collaboration with Sanofi. Fexinidazole was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2021. == Medical use == === Sleeping sickness === A trial in Africa found fexinidazole to be 91% effective at treating sleeping sickness. Though less effective than nifurtimox with eflornithine in severe disease, fexinidazole has the benefit that it can be taken by mouth. Fexinidazole is the first drug candidate for the treatment of advanced-stage sleeping sickness in thirty years. === Efficacy and safety === In cell culture, fexinidazole has an IC50 of around 1–4 μM against Trypanosoma brucei. In the mouse model, fexinidazole cures both the first, hemolymphatic, and the second, meningoencephalitic stage of the infection, the latter at 100 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days. In patients, the clinical trials managed by DNDi and supported by Swiss TPH mainly conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo demonstrated that oral fexinidazole is safe and effective for use against first- and early second-stage sleeping sickness. Based on the positive opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency in 2018, the WHO has released new interim guidelines for the treatment of HAT including fexinidazole as the new therapy for first-stage and non-severe second-stage sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (gHAT) Recently, a study of the safety and efficacy of oral fexinidazole in children with gambiense human African trypanosomiasis was accomplished and concluded that orally administered fexinidazole showed high efficacy across all stages of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis infection in children aged 6 years and older and weighing more than 20 kg. The benefit-to-risk ratio of fexinidazole for treating children with gambiense human African trypanosomiasis, regardless of disease stage, is positive. Current interventions for diagnosing, staging, and treating gambiense human African trypanosomiasis require resources, trained personnel, equipment, and hospital infrastructure. These potentially costly procedures are therefore difficult to implement in remote areas or in those that might be mired in conflict, which could prevent the goal of eliminating gambiense human African trypanosomiasis by 2030. Simplified oral treatments such as fexinidazole or single-dose oral treatments such as acoziborole (currently in clinical trials) that can cure both disease stages of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis and circumvent the need for systematic disease staging with lumbar puncture (a procedure associated with complications and anxiety, particularly in children28) would benefit both patients and health-care professionals Furthermore, Damasio et al. evaluated the in vivo oral efficacy of self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) containing fexinidazole in the experimental treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The developed FEX-SEDDS formulation presented as a clear, yellowish liquid without precipitate. In the simulated gastric and intestinal media, the FEX-SEDDS had a size of 97±1 and 106±9 nm, respectively. The FEX retention in droplets after SEDDS dilution in simulated gastrointestinal media was almost 100%. Antileishmanial efficacy studies showed that FEX-SEDDS was the only treatment able to significantly (p < 0.05) reduce the parasite burden in the liver and spleen of animals experimentally infected with Leishmania infantum. == Mechanism of action == The biologically relevant active metabolites in vivo are the sulfoxide and sulfone. == History == Fexinidazole was discovered by the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst AG, but its development as a pharmaceutical was halted in the 1980s. The US Food and Drug Administration granted the application for fexinidazole orphan drug designation. == Society and culture == Fexinidazole Winthrop, a Sanofi-Aventis product developed with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), received a positive endorsement from the European Medicines Agency in 2018, for use in non-European markets. It was approved for the treatment of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in December 2018.

2384,"('Ebastine', 'Kestine', 'Ebastel', 'Ebastin', 'Kestin')",Medical,"Ebastine is a H1 antihistamine with low potential for causing drowsiness. It does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier to a significant amount and thus combines an effective block of the H1 receptor in peripheral tissue with a low incidence of central side effects, i.e. seldom causing sedation or drowsiness. It was patented in 1983 by Almirall S.A and came into medical use in 1990. The substance is often provided in micronised form due to poor water solubility. == Uses == Ebastine is a second-generation H1 receptor antagonist that is indicated mainly for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. It is available in 10 and 20 mg tablets and as fast-dissolving tablets, as well as in pediatric syrup. It has a recommended flexible daily dose of 10 or 20 mg, depending on disease severity. Data from over 8,000 patients in more than 40 clinical trials and studies suggest efficacy of ebastine in the treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis, persistent allergic rhinitis and other indications. == Safety == Ebastine has shown overall safety and tolerability profile with no cognitive/psychomotor impairment and no sedation worse than placebo, and cardiac safety, that is, no QT prolongation. The incidence of most commonly reported adverse events was comparable between the ebastine and placebo groups, which confirms that ebastine has a favourable safety profile. While experiments in pregnant animals showed no risk for the unborn, no such data are available in humans. It is not known whether ebastine passes into the breast milk. == Pharmacokinetic profile == After oral administration, ebastine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 into its active carboxylic acid metabolite, carebastine. This conversion is practically complete. == Brand names == Ebastine is available in different formulations (tablets, fast dissolving tablets and syrup) and commercialized under different brand names around the world, Ebast, Ebatin, Ebatin Fast, Ebatrol, Atmos, Ebet, Ebastel FLAS, Kestine, KestineLIO, KestinLYO, EstivanLYO, Evastel Z, Eteen (EURO Pharma Ltd.), Tebast (SQUARE), Ebasten (ACI), etc. == See also == Desloratadine == References == Comparative in vitro quality evaluation of different brands of Ebastine 10 mg tablets commercially available in Bangladesh (Thesis).

The perturbation of the electronic state in the IA ring accompanied by the elimination of the protic solvent well explains an occurrence of charge transfer (CT) interaction. This inference is supported by the fact that the IA rings are overlapping face to tail in the concentrated solution and the solvation takes place at the IA ring. In the frontier molecular orbital theory, it is possible to consider that the interaction occurs between the HOMO of the solvent-eliminated IA, which acts as a donor, and the LUMO of the solvated IA, which behaves as an accepter. The effect of the CT interaction on the stacking interaction can be measured quantitatively as the red shift or quenching in the reflection and the emission spectra and the signal in the ESR. It is certain that this report gives an important clue about the interrelation between the CT interaction and the hydrophobic environment in the stacking interaction. Riboflavin-2', 3', 4', 5'-tetrabutyrate (B2-But) inhibited, in vitro, ADP (4 micrograms/ml)-induced platelet aggregation when added at the concentration of more than 1 microgram/ml and arachidonic acid (Aa) (1 mM)-induced platelet aggregation when given at the concentration of more than 0.1 microgram/ml. These inhibitions were dose-dependent. Both cyclic AMP and prostaglandin metabolites in the platelets, however, remained unchanged when the amount of B2-But added was between 0.1-10 micrograms/ml. In a volunteer study, 80 mg of B2-But taken in one bolus inhibited both ADP- and Aa-induced platelet aggregation 4 hr after oral administration. The administration of B2-But at this dose was associated with a significant decrease in malondialdehyde formation in plasma. The oral administration of 40 mg (t.i.d.) of B2-But daily did not result in significant changes in ADP- and Aa-induced platelet aggregation. B2-But showed no significant effects on either platelet adhesiveness or collagen-induced platelet aggregation, in vitro or in vivo.

2386,"('Menadione', 'Vitamin k3', 'Menaphthone', 'Kayquinone', 'Thyloquinone')",Medical,"Menadione is a synthetic organic compound with the formula C6H4(CO)2C2H(CH3). It is an analog of 1,4-naphthoquinone with a methyl group in the 2-position. It is sometimes called vitamin K3. Use is allowed as a nutritional supplement in animal feed because of its vitamin K activity. == Biochemistry == Menadione is converted to vitamin K2 (specifically, MK-4) by the prenyltransferase action of vertebrate UBIAD1. This reaction requires the hydroquinone (reduced) form of K3, menadiol, produced by NQO1. Menadione is also a circulating form of vitamin K, produced in small amounts (1–5%) after intestinal absorption of K1 and K2. This circulation explains the uneven tissue distribution of MK-4, especially since menadione can penetrate the blood–brain barrier. The cleavage enzyme is yet to be identified. As K3 is known to be toxic in large amounts, researchers speculate that the cleavage process is closely regulated. == Terminology == The compound is variously known as vitamin K3 and provitamin K3. Proponents of the latter name generally argue that the compound is not a real vitamin due to its artificial status (prior to its identification as a circulating intermediate) and its lack of a 3-methyl side chain preventing it from exerting all the functions (specifically, it cannot act as a cofactor for GGCX in vitro) of the K vitamins. == Uses == It is an intermediate in the chemical synthesis of vitamin K by first reduction to the diol menadiol, which is susceptible to coupling to the phytol. It is a useful intermediate for organic synthesis in general, as it can be made and modified in a number of ways. Menadione can be used to generate reactive oxygen species to perform flow cytometry analysis on. It can also be used in microbiological evaluation to, for example, detect fastidious microorganisms. === Animal feed === In the United States, menadione is used in various types of animal feed and is described as having a history of safe use for this purpose, being used in poultry feed prior to 1958. Low-dose menadione is used as an inexpensive micronutrient for livestock in many countries. Forms of menadione are also included in some pet foods in developed countries as a source of vitamin K. These doses have yielded no reported cases of toxicity from menadione in livestock or pets. Although handling may be hazardous, the European Food Safety Authority found in 2013 that it is an effective source of vitamin K in animal nutrition that does not pose a risk to the environment. === Human use === Despite the fact that it can serve as a precursor to various types of vitamin K, menadione is generally not used as a nutritional supplement in economically developed countries. Menadione for human use at pharmaceutical strength is available in some countries with large lower income populations, such as India. The typical daily dose is 10 mg oral or 2 mg parenteral. It is used in the treatment of hypoprothrombinemia outside of the United States. == Toxicology == Menadione is not believed to be carcinogenic. K3 can cause generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox cycling and arylation of thiols using its reactive 3-position. ROS generation explains various toxic effects of excessive menadione, including DNA damage and cell death, or on a whole-animal level, cardiac and renal toxicity in rats. == References == == External links == Menadione in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)",Menaphthone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.8053763508796692), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -1.318681188422488e-05), (' FOOD', -0.8391662240028381), (',', -0.0009131324477493763), (' INDUSTR', -0.0013326213229447603), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.7075427174568176), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.008804193697869778), ('ĠINDU', -0.17042052745819092), ('ST', -1.0132738680113107e-05), ('RI', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), (',', -0.47417834401130676), ('ĠMED', -0.03827492147684097), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.006759989075362682)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.005234594456851482), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The oldest traces of a settlement in the area include scattered neolithic and Bronze Age items and La Tene tombs. The remains of a Roman era fountain and an early medieval cemetery have also been found. During the Middle Ages, the village was part of the Herrschaft of Münsingen. The rulers of Münsingen built a fort near the village around 1278. Very little is known of the history of the fort, but it fell into ruins was demolished in 1798. During the 15th century, the village broke away from the Herrschaft and in the following century it became subject to the city of Bern. Due to its proximity to the city Bernese patricians built their summer homes in the area. The hamlet of Beitenwil was first mentioned in 1328 as Beitenwile. It was originally owned by Fraubrunnen Abbey. However, in 1473, it was acquired by the Herrschaft of Worb and was combined with Trimstein. In 1834 the three school districts of Rubigen, Allmendingen and Trimstein merged to form the political municipality of Rubigen. These three would remain politically united until 1993. The roads and fields around the village were often damaged when the Aare river flooded. The Jura water correction projects of 1824-31 finally controlled the river and allowed the villages to expand their infrastructure. The Hunzigen bridge was built in 1836 to replace several ferries. Despite the improved roads and the bridge, the villages remained generally small and rural. Even the completion of a train station on the Bern-Thun railroad in 1859 did not lead to growth. The municipality's population only began to grow in the 1960s. The completion of the A6 motorway in 1973 encouraged further growth. Today many of the residents of the municipality commute to jobs in nearby cities. == Geography == Rubigen has an area of 6.92 km2 (2.67 sq mi).

2390,"('Acyclovir', 'Aciclovir', 'Acycloguanosine')",Medical,"Aciclovir, also known as acyclovir, is an antiviral medication. It is primarily used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections, chickenpox, and shingles. Other uses include the prevention of cytomegalovirus infections following transplant, and severe complications of Epstein–Barr virus infection. It can be taken by mouth, applied as a cream, or injected. Common side effects include nausea and diarrhea. Potentially serious side effects include kidney problems and low platelets. Greater care is recommended in those with poor liver or kidney function. It is generally considered safe for use in pregnancy with no harm having been observed. It appears to be safe during breastfeeding. Aciclovir is a nucleoside analogue that mimics guanosine. It works by decreasing the production of the virus's DNA. Aciclovir was patented in 1974, by Burroughs Wellcome, and approved for medical use in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication and is marketed under many brand names worldwide. In 2022, it was the 134th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical use == Aciclovir acts by inhibiting viral DNA replication and is used for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus infections, including: Genital herpes simplex (treatment and prevention) Neonatal herpes simplex Herpes simplex labialis (cold sores) Shingles Acute chickenpox in immunocompromised patients Herpes simplex encephalitis Acute mucocutaneous HSV infections in immunocompromised patients Herpes of the eye and herpes simplex blepharitis (a chronic (long-term) form of herpes eye infection) Prevention of herpes viruses in immunocompromised people (such as people undergoing cancer chemotherapy) It has not been found to be effective against Epstein–Barr virus and its associated infectious mononucleosis. Aciclovir risks causing resistance to antiviral agents, and in 1% to 10% of cases can cause unpleasant side effects. Aciclovir taken by mouth does not appear to decrease the risk of pain after shingles. In those with herpes of the eye, aciclovir may be more effective and safer than idoxuridine. It is unclear if aciclovir eye drops are more effective than brivudine eye drops. Intravenous aciclovir is effective in treating severe medical conditions caused by different species of the herpes virus family, including severe localized infections of the herpes virus, severe genital herpes, chickenpox and herpesviral encephalitis. It is also effective in systemic or traumatic herpes infections, eczema herpeticum, and herpesviral meningitis. Reviews of research dating from the 1980s show there is some effect in reducing the number and duration of lesions if aciclovir is applied at an early stage of an outbreak. Research shows effectiveness of topical aciclovir in both the early and late stages of the outbreak as well as improving methodologically and in terms of statistical certainty from previous studies. Aciclovir trials show that this agent has no role in preventing HIV transmission, but it can help slow HIV disease progression in people not taking anti-retroviral therapy (ART). This finding emphasizes the importance of testing simple, inexpensive non-ART strategies, such as aciclovir and cotrimoxazole, in people with HIV. === Pregnancy === The CDC and others have declared that during severe recurrent or first episodes of genital herpes, aciclovir may be used. For severe HSV infections (especially disseminated HSV), IV aciclovir may also be used. Studies in mice, rabbits, and rats (with doses more than 10 times the equivalent of that used in humans) given during organogenesis have failed to demonstrate birth defects. Studies in rats in which they were given the equivalent to 63 times the standard steady-state human concentrations of the drug on day 10 of gestation showed head and tail anomalies. Aciclovir is recommended by the CDC for treatment of varicella during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters. Aciclovir is excreted in breast milk, therefore it is recommended that caution should be used in breast-feeding women. It has been shown in limited test studies that the nursing infant is exposed to approximately 0.3 mg/kg/day following oral administration of aciclovir to the mother. If nursing mothers have herpetic lesions near or on the breast, breast-feeding should be avoided. == Adverse effects == === Systemic therapy === Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with systemic aciclovir therapy (oral or IV) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy (with IV use only), injection site reactions (with IV use only) and headache. In high doses, hallucinations have been reported. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, oedema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, anaphylaxis, and Cotard's syndrome. Intravenous aciclovir may cause reversible nephrotoxicity in up to 5% to 10% of patients because of precipitation of aciclovir crystals in the kidney. Aciclovir crystalline nephropathy is more common when aciclovir is given as a rapid infusion and in patients with dehydration and preexisting renal impairment. Adequate hydration, a slower rate of infusion, and dosing based on renal function may reduce this risk. The aciclovir metabolite 9-Carboxymethoxymethylguanine (9-CMMG) has been shown to play a role in neurological adverse events, particularly in older people and those with reduced renal function. === Topical therapy === Aciclovir topical cream is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with dry or flaking skin or transient stinging/burning sensations. Infrequent adverse effects include erythema or itch. When applied to the eye, aciclovir is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with transient mild stinging. Infrequently (0.1–1% of patients), ophthalmic aciclovir is associated with superficial punctate keratitis or allergic reactions. == Drug interactions == Ketoconazole: In-vitro replication studies have found a synergistic, dose-dependent antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 when given with aciclovir. However, this effect has not been clinically established and more studies need to be done to evaluate the true potential of this synergy. Probenecid: Reports of increased half-life of aciclovir, as well as decreased urinary excretion and renal clearance have been shown in studies where probenecid is given simultaneously with aciclovir. Interferon: Synergistic effects when administered with aciclovir and caution should be taken when administering aciclovir to patients receiving IV interferon. Zidovudine: Although administered often with aciclovir in HIV patients, neurotoxicity has been reported in at least one patient who presented with extreme drowsiness and lethargy 30–60 days after receiving IV aciclovir; symptoms resolved when aciclovir was discontinued. == Detection in biological fluids == Aciclovir may be quantitated in plasma or serum to monitor for drug accumulation in patients with renal dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims. == Mechanism of action == Aciclovir is converted by viral thymidine kinase to aciclovir monophosphate, which is then converted by host cell kinases to aciclovir triphosphate (ACV-TP, also known as aciclo-GTP). ACV-TP is a very potent inhibitor of viral DNA replication. ACV-TP competitively inhibits and inactivates the viral DNA polymerase. Its monophosphate form also incorporates into the viral DNA, resulting in chain termination. === Resistance === Resistance to aciclovir is rare in people with healthy immune systems but is more common (up to 10%) in people with immunodeficiencies on chronic antiviral prophylaxis (transplant recipients, people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome due to HIV infection). Mechanisms of resistance in HSV include deficient viral thymidine kinase; and mutations to viral thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase, altering substrate sensitivity. === Microbiology === Aciclovir is active against most species in the herpesvirus family. In descending order of activity: Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) Herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2) Varicella zoster virus Epstein–Barr virus Human cytomegalovirus – least activity == Pharmacokinetics == Aciclovir is poorly water-soluble and has poor oral bioavailability (15–30%), hence intravenous administration is necessary if high concentrations are required. When orally administered, peak plasma concentration occurs after 1–2 hours. According to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System, aciclovir is a Class III drug, i.e., soluble with low intestinal permeability. Aciclovir has a high distribution rate; protein binding is reported to range from 9 to 33%. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of aciclovir depends according to age group; neonates have a t1/2 of 4 hours, children 1–12 years have a t1/2 of 2–3 hours whereas adults have a t1/2 of 3 hours. == Chemistry == Details of the synthesis of aciclovir were first published by scientists from the University at Buffalo. In the first step shown, 2,6-dichloropurine was alkylated with 1-benzoyloxy-2-chloromethoxyethane. The chlorine group at the 6-position of the heterocyclic ring is more reactive than the chlorine at the 2-position, hence it can be selectively replaced by an amino group, which was then converted to an amide using nitrous acid. Finally, the remaining chlorine was replaced by the amino group of aciclovir using ammonia in methanol. This synthesis and other methods for preparing the compound have been reviewed. == History == Aciclovir was seen as the start of a new era in antiviral therapy, as it is extremely selective and low in cytotoxicity. Since the discovery in the mid-1970s, it has been used as an effective drug for the treatment of infections caused by most known species of the herpesvirus family, including herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses. Nucleosides isolated from a Caribbean sponge, Cryptotethya crypta, were the basis for the synthesis of aciclovir. It was codiscovered by Howard Schaeffer following his work with Robert Vince, S. Bittner and S. Gurwara on the adenosine analog acycloadenosine which showed promising antiviral activity. Later, Schaeffer joined Burroughs Wellcome and continued the development of aciclovir with pharmacologist Gertrude B. Elion. A U.S. patent on aciclovir listing Schaeffer as inventor was issued in 1979. Vince later invented abacavir, an nRTI drug for HIV patients. Elion was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine, partly for the development of aciclovir. A related prodrug form, valaciclovir came into medical use in 1995. It is converted to aciclovir in the body after absorption. In 2009, acyclovir in combination with hydrocortisone cream, marketed as Xerese, was approved in the United States for the early treatment of recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores) to reduce the likelihood of ulcerative cold sores and to shorten the lesion healing time in adults and children (six years of age and older). == Society and culture == === Names === It was originally marketed as Zovirax; patents expired in the 1990s and since then it has been generic and is marketed under many brand names worldwide. == Notes == == References == == Further reading ==",Acycloguanosine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.992108420585282e-05), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007445423980243504)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68000212?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=91, start_index=9, title='Acyclovir - MeSH - NCBI', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68000212?utm_source=openai')])"
2391,"('Fosamprenavir', 'Amprenavir phosphate', 'Gw 433908', 'Telzir', 'Fosamprenavir [inn]')",Medical,"Fosamprenavir (FPV), sold under the brand names Lexiva and Telzir, is a medication used to treat HIV/AIDS. It is a prodrug of the protease inhibitor and antiretroviral drug amprenavir. It is marketed by ViiV Healthcare as the calcium salt. Fosamprenavir was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2003, and in the European Union in July 2004. The human body metabolizes fosamprenavir in order to form amprenavir, which is the active ingredient. A head-to-head study with lopinavir showed the two drugs to have comparable potency, but patients on fosamprenavir tended to have a higher serum cholesterol. == Medical uses == Fosamprenavir is used for the treatment of HIV-1 infections, typically but not necessarily in combination with low-dose ritonavir or other antiviral drugs. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effect is diarrhea. Other common side effects include headache, dizziness and exanthema, which is usually transient. Severe allergic reactions (Stevens–Johnson syndrome) are rare. == Interactions == Amprenavir (the active metabolite of fosamrenavir, which is found in blood plasma, liver and other organs) is metabolized via the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and also weakly inhibits this enzyme. This means that combination with drugs that are also metabolized by CYP3A4 can increase their plasma concentrations and thus side effects; and combination with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase amprenavir concentrations. When combining fosamprenavir with low doses of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir, this interaction is intended as it allows for application of lower fosamprenavir doses. == Pharmacology == Fosamprenavir is quickly activated to amprenavir, even before it reaches the circulation.

2393,"('Cefazolin', 'Cephazolin', 'Cephamezine', 'Cefazoline', 'Cefamezin')",Medical,"Cefazolin, also known as cefazoline and cephazolin, is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. Specifically it is used to treat cellulitis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, joint infection, and biliary tract infections. It is also used to prevent group B streptococcal disease around the time of delivery and before surgery. It is typically given by injection into a muscle or vein. Common side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, yeast infections, and allergic reactions. Historically, it was thought to be contraindicated in patients with allergies to penicillin, although several recent studies have refuted this and it is proven to be safe in almost all patients, including those with known penicillin allergies. It is relatively safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Cefazolin is in the first-generation cephalosporin class of medication and works by interfering with the bacteria's cell wall. Cefazolin was patented in 1967 and came into commercial use in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Cefazolin is used in a variety of infections provided that susceptible organisms are involved. It is indicated for use in the following infections: Respiratory tract infections Urinary tract infections Skin infections Biliary tract infections Bone and joint infections Genital infections Blood infections (sepsis) Endocarditis It can also be used peri-operatively to prevent infections post-surgery, and is often the preferred drug for surgical prophylaxis. There is no penetration into the central nervous system and therefore cefazolin is not effective in treating meningitis. Cefazolin has been shown to be effective in treating methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) but does not work in cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In many instances of staphylococcal infections, such as bacteremia, cefazolin is an alternative to penicillin in patients who are allergic to penicillin. However, there is still potential for a reaction to occur with cefazolin and other cephalosporins in patients allergic to penicillin. Resistance to cefazolin is seen in several species of bacteria, such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia, in which case different generations of cephalosporins may be more effective. Cefazolin does not fight against Enterococcus, anaerobic bacteria, or atypical bacteria, among others. === Bacterial susceptibility === As a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, cefazolin and other first-generation antibiotics are very active against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria. Their broad spectrum of activity can be attributed to their improved stability to many bacterial beta-lactamases compared to penicillins. === Spectrum of activity === Gram-positive aerobes: Staphylococcus aureus (including beta-lactamase producing strains) Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other strains of streptococci Gram-Negative Aerobes: Escherichia coli Proteus mirabilis Klebsiella pneumoniae === Non susceptible === The following are not susceptible: Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus Enterococcus most strains of indole positive Proteus (Proteus vulgaris) Enterobacter spp. Morganella morganii Providencia rettgeri Serratia spp. Pseudomonas spp. Listeria == Special populations == === Pregnancy === Cefazolin is pregnancy category B, indicating general safety for use in pregnancy. Caution should be used in breastfeeding as a small amount of cefazolin enters the breast milk. Cefazolin can be used prophylactically against perinatal Group B streptococcal infection (GBS). Although penicillin and ampicillin are the standard of care for GBS prophylaxis, penicillin-allergic women with no history of anaphylaxis can be given cefazolin instead. These patients should be closely monitored as there is a small chance of an allergic reaction due to the similar structure of the antibiotics. === Newborns === There has been no established safety and effectiveness for use in premature infants and neonates. === Elderly === No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed in clinical trials comparing elderly and younger subjects, however the trials could not eliminate the possibility that some older individuals may have a higher level of sensitivity. === Additional considerations === People with kidney disease and those on hemodialysis may need the dose adjusted. Cefazolin levels are not significantly affected by liver disease. As with other antibiotics, cefazolin may interact with other medications being taken. Some important drugs that may interact with cefazolin such as probenecid. == Side effects == Side effects associated with use of cefazolin therapy include: Common (1–10%): diarrhea, stomach pain or upset stomach, vomiting, and rash. Uncommon (<1%): dizziness, headache, fatigue, itching, transient hepatitis. Patients with penicillin allergies could experience a potential reaction to cefazolin and other cephalosporins. As with other antibiotics, patients experiencing watery and/or bloody stools occurring up to three months following therapy should contact their prescriber. Like those of several other cephalosporins, the chemical structure of cefazolin contains an N-methylthiodiazole (NMTD or 1-MTD) side-chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTD, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (Antabuse), due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Those with an allergy to penicillin may develop a cross sensitivity to cefazolin. == Mechanism of action == Cefazolin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding penicillin-binding proteins which stops peptidoglycan synthesis. Penicillin-binding proteins are bacterial proteins that help to catalyze the last stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, which is needed to maintain the cell wall. They remove the D-alanine from the precursor of the peptidoglycan. The lack of synthesis causes the bacteria to lyse because they also continually break down their cell walls. Cefazolin is bactericidal, meaning it kills the bacteria rather than inhibiting their growth. == Cost == Cefazolin is relatively inexpensive. == Trade names == It was initially marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the trade name Nostof. Other trade names include: Cefacidal, Cefamezin, Cefrina, Elzogram, Faxilen, Gramaxin, Kefol, Kefzol, Kefzolan, Kezolin, Novaporin, Reflin, Zinol, and Zolicef. == References == == External links == MedlinePlus Drug Information: Cefazolin Sodium Injection.",Cefamezin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.000758955895435065), ('ICAL', -1.6689286894688848e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004114259034395218)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([rxreasoner.com](https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/cefamezin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=89, start_index=9, title='CEFAMEZIN - Drug - RxReasoner', type='url_citation', url='https://www.rxreasoner.com/drugs/cefamezin?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a slightly yellow oil intended to be applied to the skin or to clothing and provides protection against mosquitoes, flies, ticks, fleas, chiggers, leeches, and many other biting insects. == Effectiveness == DEET is effective against a variety of invertebrates, including ticks, flies, mosquitos, and some parasitic worms. A 2018 systematic review found no consistent performance difference between DEET and icaridin in field studies and concluded that they are equally preferred mosquito repellents, noting that 50% DEET offers longer protection but is not available in some countries. === Concentrations === The concentration of DEET in products may range from less than 10% to nearly 100%, but concentrations greater than 50% do not increase the duration of protection. Higher concentrations can be safely applied to clothing, although it may damage some types of synthetic fibers. In the United Kingdom, the publicly-funded healthcare system, the National Health Service (NHS), recommends that UK citizens should use a concentration of 50% when visiting areas of the world with malaria. A lower concentration of 10% is recommended for infants and children. Health Canada decided to limit DEET concentration to 30% in the country since 2002 due to an increased long-term risk observed with repeated applications. DEET is often sold and used in spray or lotion in concentrations up to 100%. Consumer Reports found a correlation between DEET concentration and hours of protection against insect bites. 100% DEET was found to offer up to 12 hours of protection while several lower concentration DEET formulations (20–34%) offered 3–6 hours of protection. Other research has corroborated the effectiveness of DEET. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 30–50% DEET to prevent the spread of pathogens carried by insects. A 2008 study found that higher concentrations of DEET have an improved ability to repel insects through fabric. == Contraindications == DEET should not be used on children younger than 2 months of age. == Adverse effects == When used as directed, products containing between 10% and 30% DEET have been found by the American Academy of Pediatrics to be safe to use on children as well as adults. As a precaution, manufacturers advise that DEET products should not be used under clothing or on damaged skin, and that preparations be washed off after they are no longer needed or between applications. DEET can irritate the eyes and, unlike icaridin, it can cause breathing difficulty, headaches, or, in rare cases, it may cause severe epidermal reactions. The authors of a 2002 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine wrote: ... this repellent has been subjected to more scientific and toxicologic scrutiny than any other repellent substance. ... DEET has a remarkable safety profile after 40 years of use and nearly 8 billion human applications. Fewer than 50 cases of serious toxic effects have been documented in ... medical literature since 1960 ... Many of these cases of toxic effects involved long-term, heavy, frequent, or whole-body application of DEET. No correlation has been found between the concentration of DEET used and the risk of toxic effects. ... When applied with common sense, DEET-based repellents can be expected to provide a safe as well as a long-lasting repellent effect ... under circumstances in which it is crucial to be protected against arthropod bites that might transmit disease. In the DEET Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) in 1998, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported 14 to 46 cases of potential DEET-associated seizures, including four deaths. The EPA states: ""... it does appear that some cases are likely related to DEET toxicity,"" which may underreport the risk as physicians may fail to check for history of DEET use or fail to report cases of seizure subsequent to DEET use. In 1997, the Pesticide Information Project of Cooperative Extension Offices of Cornell University stated that ""Everglades National Park employees having extensive DEET exposure were more likely to have insomnia, mood disturbances and impaired cognitive function than lesser exposed co-workers"". Citing human health reasons, Health Canada barred the sale of insect repellents for human use that contained more than 30% DEET in a 2002 re-evaluation ""based on a human health risk assessment that considered daily application of DEET over a prolonged period of time"". The agency recommended that DEET-based products be used on children between the ages of 2 and 12 only if the concentration of DEET is 10% or less and that repellents be applied no more than 3 times a day, children under 2 should not receive more than 1 application of repellent in a day and DEET-based products of any concentration should not be used on infants under 6 months. A 2020 study performed by students within the University of Florida's College of Public Health and Health Professions analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and identified 1,205 participants who had ""DEET metabolic levels recorded at or above detection limits"". They analyzed biomarkers related to systemic inflammation, immune, liver, and kidney functions, and found no ""evidence that DEET exposure has any impact on the biomarkers identified."" === Detection in body fluids === DEET may be measured in blood, plasma, or urine by gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma DEET concentrations are expected to be in a range of 0.3–3.0 mg/L during the first 8 hours after dermal application in persons using the chemical appropriately, >6 mg/L in intoxicated patients and >100 mg/L in victims of acute intentional oral overdose. == Overdose == Applying DEET to the skin is safe if done as directed. Adverse reactions are very rare, about 1 in 100 million people. However, repeated use of DEET in very high concentrations can lead to toxic encephalopathy with severe neurological symptoms including seizures, tremors and slurred speech. The risk is higher for children since they have a greater surface area to body weight ratio. == Interactions == Limited data indicates that combining insect repellents with DEET and sunscreen decreases the sun protection factor of the sunscreen by about a third. Unlike icaridin, the combination also increases the absorption of both significantly. When the two need to be used together, the repellent should be applied after the sunscreen has been absorbed, about 30 or more minutes later. When DEET is used in combination with insecticides for cockroaches it can strengthen the toxicity of carbamate, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. These 1996 findings indicate that DEET has neurological effects on insects in addition to known olfactory effects, and that its toxicity is strengthened in combination with other insecticides. == Damage to materials == Unlike icaridin, DEET is an effective solvent and may dissolve some watch crystals, plastics, rayon, spandex, other synthetic fabrics, and painted or varnished surfaces including nail polish. It also may act as a plasticizer by remaining inside some formerly hard plastics, leaving them softened and more flexible. DEET is incompatible with rayon, acetate, or dynel clothing. == Environmental impact == Though DEET is not expected to bioaccumulate, it has been found to have a slight toxicity for fresh-water fish such as rainbow trout and tilapia, and it also has been shown to be toxic for some species of freshwater zooplankton. DEET has been detected at low concentrations in water bodies as a result of production and use, such as in the Mississippi River and its tributaries, where a 1991 study detected levels varying from 5 to 201 ng/L. A 1975 study analyzed the effects of DEET on communities of freshwater organisms native to Chinese waterways and found that DEET was moderately toxic to aquatic organisms compared to other commercial insect repellants. The most-at-risk organisms were algae colonies which often experienced ""significant biomass decline and community composition shift[s]"" when exposed to DEET at 500 ng/L. DEET is biodegraded by fungi into products less toxic to zooplankton. It degrades well under aerobic conditions, but poorly and slowly under anaerobic conditions. == Mechanism of action == DEET is thought to provide protection from mosquitos via two pathways, both by negatively impacting mosquito odorant receptors at a distance, and by negatively impacting mosquito chemoreceptors upon contact. The exact mechanisms are still being researched, but the two most likely hypotheses are the ""smell and avoid hypothesis"" (that DEET has an unpleasant odor to insects), and the ""bewilderment hypothesis"" (that smelling DEET confuses insects). An alternative hypothesis is that DEET ""masks"" humans by reducing the volatility of skin odorants that are attractive to insects. == Synthesis == A slightly yellow liquid at room temperature, it can be prepared by converting m-toluic acid (3-methylbenzoic acid) to the corresponding acyl chloride using thionyl chloride (SOCl2), and then allowing that product to react with diethylamine: == History == DEET was developed in 1944 by Samuel Gertler of the United States Department of Agriculture for use by the United States Army, following its experience of jungle warfare during World War II. It was originally tested as a pesticide on farm fields, and entered military use in 1946 and civilian use in 1957. It was used in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. In its original form, known as ""bug juice"", the application solution was composed of 75% DEET and 25% ethanol. Later, a new version of the repellent was developed by the U.S. Army and the USDA. This formulation consisted of DEET and a mixture of polymers that extended its release and reduced its evaporation rate. This extended-release application was registered by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1991. == See also == Beautyberry Citronella oil DDT, another insecticide used for disease vector control Ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535) Icaridin Lemon eucalyptus Mosquito coil p-Menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) Permethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide that can be applied to clothing to help prevent bites SS220 Anthranilate-based insect repellents == References == == Further reading == == External links == DEET General Fact Sheet - National Pesticide Information Center DEET Technical Fact Sheet – National Pesticide Information Center West Nile Virus Resource Guide – National Pesticide Information Center Health Advisory: Tick and Insect Repellents, New York State US Centers for Disease Control information on DEET US Environmental Protection Agency information on DEET Review of scientific literature on DEET Archived 2016-12-10 at the Wayback Machine (from a RAND Corporation report on Gulf War illnesses) Health Canada - Re-evaluation Decision Document: Personal insect repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide and related compounds), 2002",Diethyl toluamide,WIKIPEDIA,"('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.023358216509222984), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.3135015070438385), (' INDUSTR', -1.6286106983898208e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('P', -0.1298452913761139), ('ERSON', 0.0), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('ĠCARE', -5.125986263010418e-06), (',', -0.20152471959590912), ('ĠMED', -0.3881591558456421), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.018202288076281548)])","('PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.575939416885376), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.03804149478673935), (' INDUSTR', -1.306760805164231e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('PERSONAL CARE; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEET,https://www.altmeyers.org/en/cosmetology/diethyl-toluamide-inci-146164,https://www.invivochem.com/diethyltoluamide.html ', [])"
2396,"('Pyrroloquinoline quinone', 'Methoxatin', 'Coenzyme pqq', 'Pyrrolo-quinoline quinone', 'Pyrroloquinoline-quinone')","Endogenous, Food, Medical","Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), also called methoxatin, is a redox cofactor and antioxidant. Quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase is used as a glucose sensor in bacteria. PQQ stimulates growth in bacteria. == History == It was discovered by J. G. Hauge in 1964 as the third redox cofactor after nicotinamide and flavin in bacteria (although he hypothesised that it was naphthoquinone). Anthony and Zatman also found the unknown redox cofactor in alcohol dehydrogenase. In 1979, Salisbury and colleagues as well as Duine and colleagues extracted this prosthetic group from methanol dehydrogenase of methylotrophs and identified its molecular structure. Adachi and colleagues discovered that PQQ was also found in Acetobacter. == Biosynthesis == A novel aspect of PQQ is its biosynthesis in bacteria from a ribosomally translated precursor peptide, PqqA (UniProt P27532). A glutamic acid and a tyrosine in PqqA are cross-linked by the radical SAM enzyme PqqE (P07782) with the help of PqqD (P07781) in the first step of PqqA modification. A protease then liberates the Glu-Tyr molecule from the peptide backbone. PqqB (P07779) oxidizes the 2 and 3 positions on the tyrosine ring, forming a quinone which quickly becomes AHQQ, finishing the pyridine ring. PqqC (P07780) then forms the final pyrrole ring. Efforts to understand PQQ biosynthesis have contributed to broad interest in radical SAM enzymes and their ability to modify proteins, and an analogous radical SAM enzyme-dependent pathway has since been found that produces the putative electron carrier mycofactocin, using a valine and a tyrosine from the precursor peptide, MftA (P9WJ81). == Role in proteins == Quinoproteins generally embed the cofactor in a unique, six-bladed beta-barrel structure. Some examples also have a heme C prosthetic group and are termed quinohemoproteins. Although quinoproteins are mostly found in bacteria, a Coprinopsis cinerea (fungus) pyranose dehydrogenase has been shown to use PQQ in its crystal structure. PQQ also appears to be essential in some other eukaryotic proteins, albeit not as the direct electron carrier. The mammalian lactate dehydrogenase requires PQQ to run but uses NADH as the direct redox cofactor. It seems to speed up the reaction by catalyzing the oxidation of NADH via redox cycling. == Controversy regarding role as vitamin == The scientific journal Nature published the 2003 paper by Kasahara and Kato that essentially stated that PQQ was a new vitamin and in 2005, an article by Anthony and Felton that stated that the 2003 Kasahara and Kato paper drew incorrect and unsubstantiated conclusions. An article by Bruce Ames in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2018 identified pyrroloquinoline quinone as a ""longevity vitamin"" not essential for immediate survival, but necessary for long-term health. == See also == L-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, EC 1.2.1.31 == References ==",Methoxatin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.014491010457277298)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.024277888238430023), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001176856574602425)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -8.77627644513268e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.06196802109479904), (' FOOD', -0.3870573341846466)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The development of therapeutic strategy centered on the glutamatergic system known to bear a critical role in cognitive functions, is therefore of major importance in the treatment of mild forms of AD or age-related memory dysfunctions. In Experiment 1, we investigated the effects of ageing on spatial working memory measured by sequential alternation (SA). Thus, the decay of alternation rates over a series of trials separated by varying intertrial temporal intervals (ITI, from 5 sec to 180 sec) was studied in mice of different age groups. In Experiment 2, we investigated the memory-enhancing potential of S 18986--a modulator of AMPA receptors--on age-related SA impairments, in comparison with memantine--an antagonist of NMDA receptors--. In Experiment 1, aged mice responded at chance with shorter ITI's and exhibited greater levels of interference in the SA task as compared to young adult mice. In Experiment 2, (1) S 18986 at 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg reversed the memory deficit in aged mice but did not modify performance in young adult mice; (2) memantine at 10 mg/kg also increased SA rates in aged mice but did not improve performance in young adult mice. The SA task is a useful tool to reveal age-induced time-dependent working memory impairments. As compared to memantine, S 18986--a compound targeting AMPA receptors--contributes a valuable therapy in the treatment of age-related cognitive dysfunctions or mild forms of AD. The effect of S 18986, positive AMPA receptor modulator, on acetylcholine (ACh), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) release from the hippocampus of freely moving young and aged rats was investigated by microdialysis coupled to HPLC. The cognition-enhancing properties were evaluated by a passive avoidance test. In 3 month-old rats, S 18986 (10 mg/kg i.p.) increased by 70% ACh release, which returned to basal level within 2 h, while 3 mg/kg had no effect. In 22 month-old rats, both 3 and 10 mg/kg i.p. induced a long lasting increase in ACh release, as large as that induced by 10 mg/kg in young rats. S 18986 did not modify GABA and glutamate release. No effect on general behavior was observed, but S 18986 at both doses prevented the disrupting effect of scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.) on passive avoidance acquisition. (S)-2,3-dihydro-[3,4]cyclopentano-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxi de (S 18986-1) is a new compound that facilitates post-synaptic responses by modulating alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated synaptic responses and thus promotes long-term potentiation and potentiates (S)-AMPA-induced release of noradrenaline in rat brain slices. In the present study, the effects of S 18986-1 were evaluated on cognitive functions by using a one-trial object-recognition test in the Wistar rat, a test which measures a form of episodic memory in rodents. Recognition was measured by the ability of treated rats to discriminate between a familiar and a new object after a 24-h retention delay. Oral administrations with S 18986-1 (0.3 to 100 mg/kg) 1 h before each session of the test improved object recognition at concentrations as low as 0.3 mg/kg. Under the same conditions, the nootropic drug aniracetam was active at a dose of 10 mg/kg by i.p. route. S 18986-1 was still effective on the object-recognition test when it was administered 4 h before each of the three sessions. Furthermore, subchronic oral pretreatment (7 days) with S 18986-1 (0.3 to 30 mg/kg) also increased the recognition of the familiar object indicating that the animals failed to develop tolerance to repeated administrations with S 18986-1. Finally, the recognition of the familiar object was improved when S 18986-1 was administered before the recognition trial whereas the rats failed to recognise the familiar object when S 18986-1 was administered before the sample presentation trial only. Taken together, the results indicated that S 18986-1 facilitated a form of episodic memory in the rat, by improving the recognition of a familiar information (retention). Furthermore, S 18986-1 was long-acting and demonstrated a good oral bioavailability.

2400,"('Prednisone acetate', 'Prednisone 21-acetate', 'Cortancyl', 'Delcortin', 'Deltalone')",Medical,"Prednisone is a glucocorticoid medication mostly used to suppress the immune system and decrease inflammation in conditions such as asthma, COPD, and rheumatologic diseases. It is also used to treat high blood calcium due to cancer and adrenal insufficiency along with other steroids. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects may include cataracts, bone loss, easy bruising, muscle weakness, and thrush. Other side effects include weight gain, swelling, high blood sugar, increased risk of infection, and psychosis. It is generally considered safe in pregnancy and low doses appear to be safe while the user is breastfeeding. After prolonged use, prednisone must be stopped gradually. Prednisone is a prodrug and must be converted to prednisolone by the liver before it becomes active. Prednisolone then binds to glucocorticoid receptors, activating them and triggering changes in gene expression. Prednisone was patented in 1954 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 30th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 18 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Prednisone is used for many different autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions, including asthma, gout, COPD, CIDP, rheumatic disorders, allergic disorders, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, adrenocortical insufficiency, hypercalcemia due to cancer, thyroiditis, laryngitis, severe tuberculosis, hives, eczema, lipid pneumonitis, pericarditis, multiple sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, sarcoidosis, to relieve the effects of shingles, lupus, myasthenia gravis, poison oak exposure, Ménière's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, giant cell arteritis, the Herxheimer reaction that is common during the treatment of syphilis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, uveitis, and as part of a drug regimen to prevent rejection after organ transplant. Prednisone has also been used in the treatment of migraine headaches and cluster headaches and for severe aphthous ulcer. Prednisone is used as an antitumor drug. Prednisone is often also prescribed as a form of treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). Prednisone can be used in the treatment of decompensated heart failure to increase renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large doses of loop diuretics. In terms of the mechanism of action for this purpose: prednisone, a glucocorticoid, can improve renal responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide by increasing the density of natriuretic peptide receptor type A in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, thereby inducing a potent diuresis. At high doses, it may be used to prevent rejection following an organ transplant. == Side effects == Short-term side effects, as with all glucocorticoids, include high blood glucose levels (especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or on other medications that increase blood glucose, such as tacrolimus) and mineralocorticoid effects such as fluid retention. The mineralocorticoid effects of prednisone are minor, which is why it is not used in the management of adrenal insufficiency unless a more potent mineralocorticoid is administered concomitantly. It can also cause depression or depressive symptoms and anxiety in some individuals. Long-term side effects include Cushing's syndrome, steroid dementia syndrome, truncal weight gain, glaucoma and cataracts, diabetes mellitus type 2, and depression upon dose reduction or cessation. Long-term steroids can also increase the risk of osteoporosis, but research has found that few of these people were taking medications to protect bones. Prednisone also results in leukocytosis. === Major === Source: === Minor === Source: === Dependency === Adrenal suppression will begin to occur if prednisone is taken for longer than seven days. Eventually, this may cause the body to temporarily lose the ability to manufacture natural corticosteroids (especially cortisol), which results in dependence on prednisone. For this reason, prednisone should not be abruptly stopped if taken for more than seven days; instead, the dosage should be gradually reduced. This weaning process may be over a few days if the course of prednisone is short but may take weeks or months if the patient had been on long-term treatment. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to an Addisonian crisis. For those on chronic therapy, alternate-day dosing may preserve adrenal function and thereby reduce side effects. Glucocorticoids act to inhibit feedback of both the hypothalamus, decreasing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland, decreasing the amount of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). For this reason, glucocorticoid analogue drugs such as prednisone down-regulate the natural synthesis of glucocorticoids. This mechanism leads to dependence in a short time and can be dangerous if medications are withdrawn too quickly. The body must have time to begin synthesis of CRH and ACTH and for the adrenal glands to begin functioning normally again. Prednisone may start to result in the suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis if used at doses 7–10 mg or higher for several weeks. This is approximately equal to the amount of endogenous cortisol produced by the body every day. As such, the HPA axis starts to become suppressed and atrophy. If this occurs the patient should be tapered off prednisone slowly to give the adrenal gland enough time to regain its function and endogenous production of steroids. === Withdrawal === The magnitude and speed of dose reduction in corticosteroid withdrawal should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the underlying condition being treated, and individual patient factors such as the likelihood of relapse and the duration of corticosteroid treatment. Gradual withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids should be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and have: received more than 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily for more than one week been given repeat doses in the evening received more than three weeks of treatment recently received repeated courses (particularly if taken for longer than three weeks) taken a short course within one year of stopping long-term therapy other possible causes of adrenal suppression Systemic corticosteroids may be stopped abruptly in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse who have received treatment for three weeks or less and who are not included in the patient groups described above. During corticosteroid withdrawal, the dose may be reduced rapidly down to physiological doses (equivalent to prednisolone 7.5 mg daily) and then reduced more slowly. Assessment of the disease may be needed during withdrawal to ensure that relapse does not occur. == Pharmacology == Prednisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Prednisone is a prodrug; it is metabolised in the liver by 11-β-HSD to prednisolone, the active drug. Prednisone has no substantial biological effects until converted via hepatic metabolism to prednisolone. === Pharmacokinetics === Prednisone is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and has a half-life of 2–3 hours. it has a volume of distribution of 0.4–1 L/kg. The drug is cleared by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome P450 enzymes. Metabolites are excreted in the bile and urine. === Lodotra === ""Lodotra"" is the brand name of an oral formulation, which releases prednisone four hours after ingestion. It is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis with morning stiffness. Taken at 10 p.m., it releases the drug at around 2 a.m. The plasmic peak level is reached at 4 a.m., which is considered to be the optimal time for relieving morning stiffness. The drug was approved in the European Union, in January 2009. == Industry == The pharmaceutical industry uses prednisone tablets for the calibration of dissolution testing equipment according to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). == Chemistry == Prednisone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisone and is also known as δ1-cortisone or 1,2-dehydrocortisone or as 17α,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione. == History == The first isolation and structure identifications of prednisone and prednisolone were done in 1950 by Arthur Nobile. The first commercially feasible synthesis of prednisone was carried out in 1955 in the laboratories of Schering Corporation, which later became Schering-Plough Corporation, by Arthur Nobile and coworkers. They discovered that cortisone could be microbiologically oxidized to prednisone by the bacterium Corynebacterium simplex. The same process was used to prepare prednisolone from hydrocortisone. The enhanced adrenocorticoid activity of these compounds over cortisone and hydrocortisone was demonstrated in mice.

2401,"('Isosorbide dinitrate', 'Sorbide nitrate', 'Sorbidnitrate', 'Isordil', 'Nitrosorbide')",Medical,"Isosorbide dinitrate is a medication used for heart failure, esophageal spasms, and to treat and prevent chest pain from not enough blood flow to the heart. It has been found to be particularly useful in heart failure due to systolic dysfunction together with hydralazine. It is taken by mouth or under the tongue. Common side effects include headache, lightheadedness with standing, and blurred vision. Severe side effects include low blood pressure. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. It should not be used together with PDE5 Inhibitors. Isosorbide dinitrate is in the nitrate family of medications and works by dilating blood vessels. Isosorbide dinitrate was first written about in 1939. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Isosorbide dinitrate is available as a generic medication. A long-acting form exists. In 2022, isosorbide was the 119th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == It is used for angina, in addition to other medications for congestive heart failure, and for esophageal spasms. It is available as an oral tablet both in extended release and slow release. The onset of action for Isosorbide Dinitrate is thirty minutes and the onset of action for oral extended release is 12–24 hours. Long-acting nitrates can be more useful as they are generally more effective and stable in the short term. == Side effects == === Tolerance === After long-term use for treating chronic conditions, tolerance may develop in patients, reducing its effectiveness. The mechanisms of nitrate tolerance have been thoroughly investigated in the last 30 years and several hypotheses have been proposed. These include: Impaired biotransformation of isosorbide dinitrate to its active principle NO (or a NO-related species) Neurohormonal activation, causing sympathetic activation and release of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin and angiotensin II which counteract the vasodilation induced by isosorbide dinitrate Plasma volume expansion The oxidative stress hypothesis The last hypothesis might represent a unifying hypothesis, and an isosorbide dinitrate-induced inappropriate production of oxygen free radicals might induce a number of abnormalities which include the ones described above. Furthermore, nitrate tolerance is shown to be associated with vascular abnormalities which have the potential to worsen patients prognosis: these include endothelial and autonomic dysfunction. == Mechanism of action == Similar to other nitrites and organic nitrates, isosorbide dinitrate is converted to nitric oxide (NO), an active intermediate compound which activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (atrial natriuretic peptide receptor A). This stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) which then activates a series of protein kinase-dependent phosphorylations in the smooth muscle cells, eventually resulting in the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain of the smooth muscle fiber. The subsequent sequestration of calcium ions results in the relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and vasodilation. == Society and culture == Isosorbide dinitrate is sold in the US under the brand names Dilatrate-SR by Schwarz and Isordil by Valeant, according to FDA Orange Book. It is sold under the trade name Isoket in the United Kingdom, Argentina, and Hong Kong.

2402,"('Ibandronate (sodium monohydrate)', 'Ibandronic acid', 'Ibandronate', 'Boniva', 'Bonviva')",Medical,"Ibandronic acid is a bisphosphonate medication used in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and metastasis-associated skeletal fractures in people with cancer. It may also be used to treat hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels). It is typically formulated as its sodium salt ibandronate sodium. It was patented in 1986 by Boehringer Mannheim and approved for medical use in 1996. == Medical uses == Ibandronate is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. In May 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ibandronate as a daily treatment for post-menopausal osteoporosis. The basis for this approval was a three-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial women with post-menopausal osteoporosis. Each participant also received daily oral doses of calcium and 400IUs [international units] of vitamin D. At the study's conclusion, both doses significantly reduced the occurrence risk of new vertebral fractures by 50–52 percent when compared to the effects of the placebo drug. Ibandronate is efficacious for the prevention of metastasis-related bone fractures in multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and certain other cancers. == Adverse effects == In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a communication warning of the possibility of severe and sometimes incapacitating bone, joint or muscle pain. A study conducted by the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research concluded that long-term use of bisphosphonates, including Boniva, may increase the risk of a rare but serious fracture of the femur. The drug also has been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw, a relatively rare but serious condition. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, which include ibandronate, pamidronate and alendronate exert their effects on osteoclasts mainly by inhibiting the synthesis of isoprenoid lipids such as isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) via the mevalonate pathway. These isoprenoids are used in posttranslational modifcation(prenylation) of small GTPases such as Ras, Rho, and Rac. These prenylated GTPases are necessary for various cellular processes including osteoclast morphology, endosome trafficking, and apoptosis. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Ibandronic acid is sold under the brand names Boniva, Bondronat, Bonviva, Bandrone, Ibandrix, Adronil, Bondrova, Bonprove, and Fosfonat. == References ==",Bonviva,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8000440832111053e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.000576449150685221)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ema.europa.eu](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/bonviva?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=103, start_index=9, title='Bonviva | European Medicines Agency (EMA)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/bonviva?utm_source=openai')])"
2403,"('Enoxolone', 'Glycyrrhetic acid', 'Uralenic acid', 'Glycyrrhetin', 'Rhetinic acid')",Medical,"Enoxolone (INN, BAN; also known as glycyrrhetinic acid or glycyrrhetic acid) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid derivative of the beta-amyrin type obtained from the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizic acid, which was obtained from the herb liquorice. The substance has a sweet taste, so it is used in flavoring to mask the bitter taste of drugs like aloe and quinine. It may have some anti-inflammatory activities. One of its metabolites is responsible for the blood pressure-increasing effect of liquorice. == Medical uses == === Oral topical === In Turkey, enoxolone is used in a ""Anzibel"" lozenge in combination with benzocaine (a local anesthetic) and chlorhexidine hydrochloride (an antibacterial). It is found in an over-the-counter ""Arthrodont"" toothpaste. Evidence for the ingredient's usefulness for plaque and gingivitis is lacking. === Skin topical === In Japan, enoxolone is found in the ""Salonpas"" pain-relief menthol patch. It is also used in the Singaporean ""Vetic"" cream. In the United States, it is found in PruClair, a ""precription medical device"" indicated for generic dermatoses. === Possible other uses === Enoxolone is effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer and also has expectorant (antitussive) properties. It has some additional pharmacological properties with possible antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antibacterial activities. == Mechanism of action == === Anti-inflammatory === Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits the enzymes (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and delta-13-prostaglandin reductase) that metabolize the prostaglandins PGE-2 and PGF-2α to their respective, inactive 15-keto-13,14-dihydro metabolites. This increases prostaglandins in the digestive system. Prostaglandins inhibit gastric secretion, stimulate pancreatic secretion and mucous secretion in the intestines, and markedly increase intestinal motility. They also cause cell proliferation in the stomach. The effect on gastric acid secretion, and promotion of mucous secretion and cell proliferation shows why licorice has potential in treating peptic ulcers. Licorice should not be taken during pregnancy, because PGF-2α stimulates activity of the uterus during pregnancy and can cause abortion. ds The structure of glycyrrhetinic acid is similar to that of cortisone. Both molecules are flat and similar at positions 3 and 11. This might be the basis for licorice's anti-inflammatory action. === Hypertensive === 3-β-D-(Monoglucuronyl)-18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid, a metabolite of glycyrrhetinic acid, inhibits the conversion of 'active' cortisol to 'inactive' cortisone in the kidneys. This occurs via inhibition of the enzyme 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. As a result, cortisol levels become high within the collecting duct of the kidney. Cortisol has intrinsic mineralocorticoid properties (that is, it acts like aldosterone and increases sodium reabsorption) that work on ENaC channels in the collecting duct. Hypertension develops due to this mechanism of sodium retention. People often have high blood pressure with a low renin and low aldosterone blood level. The increased amounts of cortisol binds to the unprotected, nonspecific mineralocorticoid receptors and induce sodium and fluid retention, hypokalaemia, high blood pressure, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, licorice should not be given to patients with a known history of hypertension in doses sufficient to inhibit 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. == Derivatives == In glycyrrhetinic acid, the functional group (R) is a hydroxyl group. Research in 2005 demonstrated that with a proper functional group a very effective glycyrrhetinic artificial sweetener can be obtained. When R is an anionic NHCO(CH2)CO2K side chain, the sweetening effect is found to be 1200 times that of sugar (human sensory panel data). A shorter or longer spacer reduces the sweetening effect. One explanation is that the taste bud cell receptor has 1.3 nanometers (13 angstroms) available for docking with the sweetener molecule. In addition, the sweetener molecule requires three proton donor positions, of which two reside at the extremities, to be able to interact efficiently with the receptor cavity. A synthetic analog, carbenoxolone, was developed in Britain. Both glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone have a modulatory effect on neural signaling through gap junction channels. Acetoxolone, the acetyl derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid, is a drug used in the treatment of peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease. == See also == 11α-Hydroxyprogesterone == References == == Further reading == Saponin Glycosides Archived 2021-01-26 at the Wayback Machine, by Georges-Louis Friedli, URL accessed Sept 2010. == External links == Media related to Enoxolone at Wikimedia Commons",Glycyrrhetin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.008806372061371803), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.1394825428724289), (',', -0.0019298245897516608), (' PERSONAL', -0.0005894906935282052), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.013346732594072819), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), (',', -0.0025128712877631187), ('ĠFOOD', -0.013014258816838264), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.576084554195404)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('Glycyrrhetin, also known as glycyrrhetinic acid or enoxolone, is a compound derived from glycyrrhizin, the main sweet-tasting constituent of licorice root.

Studies in animals suggest that carcainium chloride, a quaternary derivative of the local anesthetic lidocaine, is able to inhibit experimentally induced cough by a mechanism of action distinct from that of lidocaine. To determine the effectiveness of aerosolised carcainium chloride (VRP700) in controlling cough in patients with IIP. Eight female patients (mean age 71 years) with IIP were investigated in a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled crossover, adaptive contingency study design (EudraCT Number 2010-021350-19). The study consisted of a screening visit to assess the eligibility of patients, and two separated (48-72 h) study days. On the two study days, patients were randomised to receive either nebulized VRP700 (1.0 mg/kg) on the first study visit followed by nebulised placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%) on the second visit, or placebo on the first visit followed by VRP700 on the second visit. The primary endpoint was cough frequency over a 4-h assessment period; secondary endpoints were subjective cough-related level of discomfort as assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the subjective response to treatment as assessed by a quality of life question. Safety (ECG, spirometry, urine and blood tests) and adverse events occurring during the trial were also investigated. In all patients both VRP700 and placebo decreased cough frequency; however, mean decreases in cough frequency after treatment with VRP700 were significantly (P < 0.001) higher than with placebo. Similarly, mean reductions in VAS score were significantly (P < 0.001) higher after treatment with VRP 700 compared with placebo. All but one patient indicated that they felt better after receiving VRP700. No adverse events were reported during the study, nor were any changes in ECG variables, spirometry, urine and blood tests noted.

It is being investigated as a cancer treatment, e.g. for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). == Target of pevonedistat == NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) is a heterodimeric molecule consisting of amyloid beta precursor protein-binding protein 1 (APPBP1) and ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 3 (UBA3). As reviewed by Xu et al., in a first step NAE binds ATP and NEDD8 and catalyzes the formation of a NEDD8-AMP intermediate. This intermediate binds the adenylation domain of NAE. NEDD8-AMP reacts with the catalytic cysteine in UBA3 during which NEDD8 is transferred to the catalytic cysteine, resulting in a high energy thioester linkage. NAE then binds ATP and NEDD8 to generate a second NEDD8-AMP, forming a fully loaded NAE carrying two activated NEDD8 molecules (i.e., one as a thioester and the other as an adenylate). Pevonedistat is an AMP mimetic. Pevonedistat forms a stable covalent adduct with NEDD8 in the NAE catalytic pocket of UBA3 by reacting with thioester-linked NEDD8 bound to the enzyme's catalytic cysteine. Unlike the labile NEDD8-AMP intermediate, the NEDD8-pevonedistat adduct cannot be utilized in subsequent reactions necessary for NAE activity. == Mechanism of action == ""Inhibition of NAE prevents activation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which are critical for proteasome-mediated protein degradation."" MLN4924 has been shown to disrupt CRL-mediated protein turnover leading to apoptosis in cancer cells by deregulating S-phase DNA synthesis. Essentially, it encourages apoptosis in dividing cells. In addition to proteasome-mediated protein degradation, activated NEDD8 is needed for at least two pathways of DNA repair: nucleotide excision repair (NER) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (see NEDD8). One or more DNA repair genes in seven DNA repair pathways are frequently epigenetically silenced in cancers (see e.g. DNA repair pathways).) This is a likely source of genome instability in cancers. If activation of NEDD8 is inhibited by pevonedistat, cells will then have an additional induced deficiency of NER or NHEJ. Such cells may then die because of deficient DNA repair leading to accumulation of DNA damages. The effect of NEDD8 inhibition may be greater for cancer cells than for normal cells if the cancer cells are already deficient in DNA repair due to prior epigenetic silencing of DNA repair genes active in alternative pathways (see synthetic lethality). == Clinical trials == In a phase 1 trial to determine dosing in patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndromes ""modest clinical activity was observed"". Later, in 2016, pevonedistat demonstrated a significant therapeutic effect in three further Phase I clinical cancer trials. These include pevonedistat trials against relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma or lymphoma, metastatic melanoma, and advanced solid tumors. These were followed by several phase I and II clinical trials in a variety of advanced cancer types.

However, there is no direct comparison of JAK inhibitors in plaque psoriasis. In order to compare the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in psoriasis, we conducted a network meta-analysis using eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The efficacy of JAK inhibitors was evaluated using a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) from baseline, and the proportion of patients achieving the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) response. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) was also assessed. A total of eight RCTs with tofacitinib, peficitinib, solcitinib, baricitinib, abrocitinib and deucravacitinib were included. A total of 3612 participants who were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were analysed. Overall, JAK inhibitors showed superior PASI75 response over placebo at both 8 and 12 weeks. Among all included JAK inhibitors, tofacitinib 15 mg twice a day (BID) had the highest probability of achieving PASI75 at both 8 and 12 weeks (SUCRA = 0.938 and 0.937, separately), followed by tofacitinib 10 mg BID (SUCRA = 0.905 and 0.908, separately) and deucravacitinib 12 mg once daily (QD) (SUCRA = 0.874 and 0.837, separately). A similar finding was observed for PGA response. Safety assessment showed that all JAK inhibitors had non-inferior safety compared with placebo, except for deucravacitinib 6 mg BID and 12 mg QD. Tofacitinib 2 mg BID was the first-ranked drug for safety profile followed by deucravacitinib 3 mg QD, and tofacitinib 5 mg BID.

Systolic heart failure is characterized by impaired ventricular emptying, caused by reduced contractility. Diastolic dysfunction is defined by defective ventricular filling, caused by the heart's inability to properly relax between beats. Intracellular calcium fluxes regulate both contraction and relaxation. Cardiac muscle cells from patients with heart failure show smaller amounts of peak calcium in their cytoplasm during contraction, and slower removal., The mishandling of intracellular calcium is often due to problems in the cells’ ability to mediate calcium influx, and sequestration of calcium back in the sarcoplasmic reticulum., == Mechanism of action == Istaroxime is a positive inotropic agent that mediates its action through inhibition of sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ ATPase). Na+/K+ ATPase inhibition increases intracellular sodium levels, which reverses the driving force of the sodium/calcium exchanger, inhibiting calcium extrusion and possibly facilitating calcium entry., Additionally, istaroxime increases intracellular calcium by improving the efficacy by which intracellular calcium triggers sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, and by accelerating the inactivation state of L-type calcium channels, which allow for calcium influx. Together the changes in calcium handling increase cell contraction. Istaroxime also enhances the heart's relaxation phase by increasing the rate of intracellular calcium sequestration by Sarco/endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase, isotype 2a (SERCA2a). SERCa2a is inhibited by phospholamban and higher phospholamban-to-SERCA2a ratios cause SERCA inhibition and impaired relaxation. Istaroxime reduces SERCA2a-phospholamban interaction, and increases SERCA2a affinity for cytosolic calcium. Studies on failing human heart tissue show that istaroxime increases SERCA2a activity up to 67%. == Clinical use == Clinical trials show that istaroxime improves ejection fraction, stroke volume and systolic blood pressure, while also enhancing ventricular filling. The drug also reduces heart rate and ventricular diastolic stiffness. Contrary to available inotropic therapies, istaroxime may permit cytosolic calcium accumulation while avoiding a proarrhythmic state. Proposed mechanisms for istaroxime's antiarrhythmic effect include a suppression of the transient inward calcium current directly involved in the production of delayed after-depolarizations and improved calcium sequestration due to SERCA2a stimulation. SERCA down-regulation in the failing myocardium might sensitize patients to the detrimental effect of other currently used positive inotropes. Istaroxime's lusitropic effect facilitates its wider margin of safety, as patients can receive higher doses without signs of arrhythmias. == References ==",Istaroxime,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.2664456789934775e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00014828535495325923), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004097993951290846)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([ir.windtreetx.com](https://ir.windtreetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windtree-announces-fda-fast-track-designation-istaroxime?utm_source=openai), [ir.windtreetx.com](https://ir.windtreetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windtree-therapeutics-announces-positive-istaroxime-phase-2?utm_source=openai), [ir.windtreetx.com](https://ir.windtreetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windtree-therapeutics-provides-update-istaroxime-clinical?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=487, start_index=9, title='Windtree Announces FDA Fast Track Designation for Istaroxime | Windtree Therapeutics, Inc', type='url_citation', url='https://ir.windtreetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windtree-announces-fda-fast-track-designation-istaroxime?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=487, start_index=9, title='Windtree Therapeutics Announces Positive Istaroxime Phase 2 Study in Early Cardiogenic Shock (SEISMiC) Published in the European Journal of Heart Failure | Windtree Therapeutics, Inc', type='url_citation', url='https://ir.windtreetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windtree-therapeutics-announces-positive-istaroxime-phase-2?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=487, start_index=9, title='Windtree Therapeutics Provides Update on Istaroxime\xa0Clinical Development and Upcoming Clinical Trial Data | Windtree Therapeutics, Inc', type='url_citation', url='https://ir.windtreetx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/windtree-therapeutics-provides-update-istaroxime-clinical?utm_source=openai')])"

It is used to treat onychomycosis (fungal infection of the toe- and fingernails). Amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in once-weekly or twice-weekly applications was shown in two decades-old studies to be between 60% and 71% effective in treating toenail onychomycosis; complete cure rates three months after stopping treatment (after six months of treatment) were 38% and 46%.

2410,"('Dapsone', 'Diaphenylsulfone', 'Dapson', 'Diaphenylsulfon', 'Sulfona')",Medical,"Dapsone, also known as 4,4'-sulfonyldianiline (SDA) or diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS), is an antibiotic commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. It is a second-line medication for the treatment and prevention of pneumocystis pneumonia and for the prevention of toxoplasmosis in those who have poor immune function. Additionally, it has been used for acne, dermatitis herpetiformis, and various other skin conditions. Dapsone is available both topically and by mouth. Severe side effects may include a decrease in blood cells, red blood cell breakdown especially in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD), or hypersensitivity. Common side effects include nausea and loss of appetite. Other side effects include liver inflammation, methemoglobinemia, and a number of types of skin rashes. While the safety of use during pregnancy is not entirely clear some physicians recommend that it be continued in those with leprosy. It is of the sulfone class. Dapsone was first studied as an antibiotic in 1937. Its use for leprosy began in 1945. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The form, which is taken by mouth, is available as a generic drug and not very expensive. == Medical uses == === Infections === Dapsone is commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. It is also used to both treat and prevent pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). It is also used for toxoplasmosis in people unable to tolerate trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole. Dapsone by mouth was one of the first medications used to treat moderate to severe acne vulgaris, and is still occasionally prescribed for the treatment of severe cases. A topical form of dapsone is also effective with potentially less side effects. It is unclear if the combination with pyrimethamine is useful in the prevention of malaria. === Autoimmune disease === Cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Dapsone is effective and safe in persons with moderate, severe, or refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Dapsone is effective and safe for adjunctive glucocorticoid-sparing treatment of persons with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and is preferred over danazol or interferon alpha in those people with antinuclear antibodies. Chronic spontaneous urticaria. Dapsone is effective and safe for treatment of second-line therapy for people with chronic spontaneous urticaria in those for whom antihistamines and other first-line agents have failed. Relapsing polychondritis. There are no clinical trials but there are many case reports that dapsone is effective at doses of 25 mg/day to 200 mg/day for treatment of relapsing polychondritis. === Other === Dermatitis herpetiformis in combination with a gluten-free diet. Dapsone may be used to treat brown recluse spider bites that become necrotic. Dapsone is the recommended treatment for erythema elevatum diutinum, as a review found that using oral dapsone alone was effective in 80% of early cases of the disease. However, dapsone can potentially cause severe side effects, meaning that sometimes steroids or other antibiotics should be used instead, although these alternative treatments are much less effective. An August 2015 review notes that dapsone is reported to be effective against generalized granuloma annulare. Dapsone has been used as a monomer in the design of dye adsorbent polymers. == Contraindications and precautions == People with porphyria, anemia, cardiac disease, lung disease, HIV infection, G6PD deficiency, and liver impairment are at higher risks of adverse effects when using dapsone. == Adverse effects == Hypersensitivity reactions occur in 1.4% of persons treated with dapsone, and can be fatal in medical settings with low resources. It is a form of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in which a SCARs disorder, primarily the DRESS syndrome or a DRESS syndrome-like reaction occurs. === Blood === Hemolysis is the most prominent side-effect, occurring in about 20 % of patients treated with dapsone, although it is dose-related. It may lead to hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia. The side-effect is more common and severe in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, leading to the dapsone-containing antimalarial combination Lapdap being withdrawn from clinical use. A case of hemolysis in a neonate from dapsone in breast milk has been reported. Agranulocytosis occurs rarely when dapsone is used alone but more frequently in combination regimens for malaria prophylaxis. Abnormalities in white blood cell formation, including aplastic anemia, are rare, yet are the cause of the majority of deaths attributable to dapsone therapy. Methemoglobinemia occurs in about 15 % of patients treated with long-term dapsone at standard doses (100 mg/day). Only special multi-wavelength oximeters (CO-oximeters) can detect methemoglobinemia directly. When there is a ""saturation gap"" between a low ordinary pulse oximeter reading and a high arterial blood gas analysis result, methemoglobinemia may be suspected. === Liver === Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported by the manufacturer. These toxic reactions may also occur as part of the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome (a form of SCARs-see above) or dapsone syndrome (see below). Dapsone is metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system, specifically isozymes CYP2D6, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19. Dapsone metabolites produced by the cytochrome P450 2C19 isozyme are associated with the methemoglobinemia side effect of the drug. === Skin === When used topically, dapsone can cause mild skin irritation, redness, dry skin, burning, and itching. When used together with benzoyl peroxide products, temporary yellow or orange skin discolorations can occur. === Dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome === Hypersensitivity reactions occur in some patients. This reaction may be more frequent in patients receiving multiple-drug therapy. The reaction always involves a rash, may also include fever, jaundice, and eosinophilia, and is likely to be one manifestation of the SCARs reaction viz., the DRESS syndrome (see above). In general, these symptoms will occur within the first six weeks of therapy or not at all, and may be ameliorated by corticosteroid therapy. === Other adverse effects === Other adverse effects include nausea, headache, and rash (which are common), and insomnia, psychosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Effects on the lung occur rarely and may be serious, though are generally reversible. == Mechanism of action == As an antibacterial, dapsone inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, via competition with para-aminobenzoate for the active site of dihydropteroate synthase, thereby inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. Though structurally distinct from dapsone, the sulfonamide group of antibacterial drugs also work in this way. As an anti-inflammatory, dapsone inhibits the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-halide-mediated cytotoxic system in polymorphonucleocytes. As part of the respiratory burst that neutrophils use to kill bacteria, myeloperoxidase converts hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is the most potent oxidant generated by neutrophils, and can cause significant tissue damage during inflammation. Dapsone arrests myeloperoxidase in an inactive intermediate form, reversibly inhibiting the enzyme. This prevents accumulation of hypochlorous acid, and reduces tissue damage during inflammation. Myeloperoxidase inhibition has also been suggested as a neuron-sparing mechanism for reducing inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and stroke. Dapsone's anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects are thought to be its mechanism of action in treating dermatitis herpetiformis. Dapsone is an odorless white to creamy-white crystalline powder with a slightly bitter taste. == History == === Discovery === In the early 20th century, the German chemist Paul Ehrlich was developing theories of selective toxicity based largely on the ability of certain dyes to kill microbes. Gerhard Domagk, who would later win a Nobel Prize for his efforts, made a major breakthrough in 1932 with the discovery of the antibacterial prontosil red (sulfonamidochrysoidine). Further investigation into the involved chemicals opened the way to sulfa drug and sulfone therapy, first with the discovery of sulfanilamide, the active agent of prontosil, by Daniel Bovet and his team at Pasteur Institute (1935), then with that of dapsone independently by Ernest Fourneau in France and Gladwin Buttle in the United Kingdom. === Proposed use in antimalarial drugs === The spread of drug-resistant malaria in Africa has encouraged the development of new, low-cost antimalarial drugs. Plasmodium falciparum, one of the Plasmodium species that causes malaria, has developed resistance both to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, two of the most common treatments for malaria. Artemisinin, another antimalarial drug, had been developed in the 1980s but was too expensive for large-scale use. This led GlaxoSmithKline to develop Lapdap, a combination drug consisting of chlorproguanil and dapsone. Lapdap was licensed in the United Kingdom starting in October 2003. One advantage of Lapdap was that chlorproguanil and dapsone are both low-cost drugs. Another was that by virtue of being a combination drug, it was less likely to cause drug resistance. However, because dapsone causes hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, and because G6PD deficiency affects 10-25% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, it was discovered that Lapdap is not safe for use in Africa. It was available in many African countries for four years before GlaxoSmithKline took it off the market in February 2008. === Dapsone gel === Dapsone had been reported in a few cases to effectively treat acne, but the risk of hemolytic anemia kept it from being widely used for this purpose. For many years scientists attempted to develop a topical formulation of dapsone that would be as effective against acne as oral dapsone, but without the hemolysis side effect. This was difficult to accomplish because dapsone is highly insoluble in aqueous solvents. In the early 2000s QLT USA developed Aczone, a 5% dapsone gel that was shown to be effective against acne without causing clinically significant declines in hemoglobin levels, even in subjects with G6PD deficiency. In February 2016, the FDA approved a 7.5% dapsone gel. This higher strength has the advantage of a once-daily application, versus twice-daily application of the 5% formulation. == Other uses == 4,4-Diaminodiphenyl sulfone also finds uses as a curing agent for materials like epoxy resins and imine-based vitrimers, applications include in printed circuit boards, adhesives and coatings. Its use in epoxy systems typically give a resin with a high glass-transition temperature. == See also == Promin, a more-soluble derivative == References == == External links == ""Dapsone"".

2412,"('Azithromycin', 'Cp 62993', 'Zithromax', 'Sumamed', 'Hemomycin')",Medical,"Azithromycin, sold under the brand names Zithromax (in oral form) and Azasite (as an eye drop), is an antibiotic medication used for the treatment of several bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia, traveler's diarrhea, and certain other intestinal infections. Along with other medications, it may also be used for malaria. It is administered by mouth, into a vein, or into the eye. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and upset stomach. An allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, or a type of diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile is possible. Azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No harm has been found with its use during pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is not confirmed, but it is likely safe. Azithromycin is an azalide, a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein, thereby stopping bacterial growth. Azithromycin was discovered in Yugoslavia (present day Croatia) in 1980 by the pharmaceutical company Pliva and approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization lists it as an example under ""Macrolides and ketolides"" in its Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine (designed to help manage antimicrobial resistance). It is available as a generic medication and is sold under many brand names worldwide. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Azithromycin is used to treat diverse infections, including: Acute bacterial sinusitis due to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae. A 1999 study found Azithromycin to be faster in resolving symptoms as compared to amoxicillin / clavulanic. Acute otitis media caused by H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae. A 2021 study concluded that Azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in its treatment and that it was safer and more tolerable in children. Community-acquired pneumonia due to C. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. pneumoniae, or S. pneumoniae. Genital ulcer disease (chancroid) in men due to H. ducreyi Pharyngitis or tonsillitis caused by S. pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy Prevention and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae. The benefits of long-term prophylaxis must be weighed on a patient-by-patient basis against the risk of cardiovascular and other adverse effects. Trachoma due to C. trachomatis Uncomplicated skin infections due to S. aureus, S. pyogenes, or S. agalactiae Whooping cough caused by B. pertussis. Scrub typhus caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. === Bacterial susceptibility === Azithromycin has relatively broad but shallow antibacterial activity. It inhibits some Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria, and many atypical bacteria. Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus (Methicillin-sensitive only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative microorganisms Bordetella pertussis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Legionella pneumophila Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Anaerobic microorganisms Peptostreptococcus species Prevotella bivia Other microorganisms Chlamydia trachomatis Chlamydophila pneumoniae Mycoplasma genitalium Mycoplasma pneumoniae Ureaplasma urealyticum === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === While some studies claim that no harm has been found with use during pregnancy, more recent studies with mice during late pregnancy has shown adverse effects on embryonic testicular and neural development of prenatal azithromycin exposure (PAzE) . One recent study claims obvious fetus changes were observed under high-dose, mid-pregnancy and multi-course exposure. However, there need to be more well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The safety of the medication during breastfeeding is unclear. It was reported that because only low levels are found in breast milk and the medication has also been used in young children, it is unlikely that breastfed infants would have adverse effects. === Airway diseases === Azithromycin has beneficial effects in the treatment of asthma. It possesses antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties which contribute to its effectiveness. Asthma exacerbations can be caused by chronic neutrophilic inflammation, and azithromycin is known to reduce this type of inflammation due to its immunomodulatory properties. The recommended dosage for controlling asthma exacerbations with azithromycin is either 500 mg or 250 mg taken orally as tablets three times a week. In adults with severe asthma, low-dose azithromycin may be prescribed as an add-on treatment when standard therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids or long-acting beta2-agonists are not sufficient. Long-term use of azithromycin in patients with persistent symptomatic asthma aims to decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations and improve their quality of life. While both its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects play crucial roles in treating asthma, studies suggest that responsiveness to azithromycin therapy depends on individual variations in lung bacterial burden and microbial composition, collectively referred to as the lung microbiome. The richness (diversity) of the lung microbiome has been identified as a key factor in determining the effectiveness of azithromycin treatment. Azithromycin has significant interactions with the patient's microbiome. Long-term use of azithromycin reduces the presence of H. influenzae bacteria in the airways but also increases resistance against macrolide antibiotics. The specific pharmacological mechanisms through which azithromycin interacts with the patient's microbiome remain unknown as of 2024; research continues to explore how changes in microbial composition influence drug efficacy and patient outcomes. Azithromycin appears to be effective in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through its suppression of inflammatory processes. Azithromycin is potentially useful in sinusitis via this mechanism. Azithromycin is believed to produce its effects through suppressing certain immune responses that may contribute to inflammation of the airways. == Adverse effects == Most common adverse effects are diarrhea (5%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting. Fewer than 1% of people stop taking the drug due to side effects. Nervousness, skin reactions, and anaphylaxis have been reported. Clostridioides difficile infection has been reported with use of azithromycin. Azithromycin does not affect the efficacy of birth control unlike some other antibiotics such as rifampin. Hearing loss has been reported. Occasionally, people have developed cholestatic hepatitis or delirium. Accidental intravenous overdose in an infant caused severe heart block, resulting in residual encephalopathy. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that azithromycin ""can cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart that may lead to a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm."" The FDA noted in the warning a 2012 study that found the drug may increase the risk of death, especially in those with heart problems, compared with those on other antibiotics such as amoxicillin or no antibiotic. The warning indicated people with preexisting conditions are at particular risk, such as those with abnormalities in the QT interval, low blood levels of potassium or magnesium, a slower than normal heart rate, or those who use certain drugs to treat abnormal heart rhythms. The warning mentioned that azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. == Interactions == === Colchicine === Azithromycin, should not be taken with colchicine as it may lead to colchicine toxicity. Symptoms of colchicine toxicity include gastrointestinal upset, fever, myalgia, pancytopenia, and organ failure. === Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 === CYP3A4 is an enzyme that metabolizes many drugs in the liver. Some drugs can inhibit CYP3A4, which means they reduce its activity and increase the blood levels of the drugs that depend on it for elimination. This can lead to adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Azithromycin is a member of macrolides that are a class of antibiotics with a cyclic structure with a lactone ring and sugar moieties. Macrolides can inhibit CYP3A4 by a mechanism called mechanism-based inhibition (MBI), which involves the formation of reactive metabolites that bind covalently and irreversibly to the enzyme, rendering it inactive. Mechanism-based inhibition is more serious and long-lasting than reversible inhibition, as it requires the synthesis of new enzyme molecules to restore the activity. The degree of mechanism-based inhibition by macrolides depends on the size and structure of their lactone ring. Clarithromycin and erythromycin have a 14-membered lactone ring, which is more prone to demethylation by CYP3A4 and subsequent formation of nitrosoalkenes, the reactive metabolites that cause mechanism-based inhibition. Azithromycin, on the other hand, has a 15-membered lactone ring, which is less susceptible to demethylation and nitrosoalkene formation. Therefore, azithromycin is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, while clarithromycin and erythromycin are strong inhibitors which increase the area under the curve (AUC) value of co-administered drugs more than five-fold. AUC it is a measure of the drug exposure in the body over time. By inhibiting CYP3A4, macrolide antibitiotics, such as erythromycin and clarithromycin, but not azithromycin, can significantly increase the AUC of the drugs that depend on it for clearance, which can lead to higher risk of adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Azithromycin stands apart from other macrolide antibiotics because it is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and does not significantly increase AUC value of co-administered drugs. The difference in CYP3A4 inhibition by macrolides has clinical implications, for example for people who take statins, which are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of clarithromycin or erythromycin with statins can increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy, a condition that causes muscle pain and damage. Azithromycin, however, does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of statins and is considered a safer alternative than other macrolide antibiotics. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Azithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting translation of mRNA. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. === Pharmacokinetics === Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, so it can be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single dose of 500 mg, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of azithromycin is 68 hours. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, about 6% of the administered dose appears as an unchanged drug in urine. == History == A team of researchers at the pharmaceutical company Pliva in Zagreb, Croatia discovered azithromycin in 1980. The company Pliva patented it in 1981. In 1986, Pliva and Pfizer signed a licensing agreement, which gave Pfizer exclusive rights for the sale of azithromycin in Western Europe and the United States. Pliva put its azithromycin on the market in Central and Eastern Europe. Pfizer launched azithromycin under Pliva's license in other markets under the brand name Zithromax in 1991. Patent protection ended in 2005. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Azithromycin is available as a generic medication. Azithromycin is administered in film-coated tablet, capsule, oral suspension, intravenous injection, granules for suspension in sachet, and ophthalmic solution. === Usage === In 2010, azithromycin was the most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the US, whereas in Sweden, where outpatient antibiotic use is a third as prevalent, macrolides are only on 3% of prescriptions. In 2017, and 2022, azithromycin was the second most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the United States. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. === Brand names === == Research == Azithromycin is researched for its supposed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, which are believed to be exhibited through its suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which is important in dampening inflammation. Cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by immune cells and play a key role in the immune response. Studies suggest that azithromycin can decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 while increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. By decreasing the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, azithromycin probably controls potential tissue damage during inflammation. These effects are believed to be due to azithromycin's ability to suppress a transcription factor called nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) resulting in blockade of inflammatory response pathways downstream from NF-κB activation leading to decreased chemokine receptor CXCR4 signaling causing reduced inflammation. Despite the efficiency of treating rosacea with azithromycin, the exact mechanism of why azithromycin is effective in treating rosacea are not completely understood. It is unclear whether its antibacterial or immunomodulatory properties or a combination of both mechanisms contribute to its efficacy. Azithromycin may prevent mast cell degranulation and thus can suppress inflammation of dorsal root ganglia through various signaling pathways such as decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells which are particularly relevant since they mediate the response of hair follicle antigens. Inflammation in rosacea is thought to be associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inflammatory cells. The ability of azithromycin to decrease ROS production can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, but this remains speculation. The therapeutic role of azithromycin has been explored in various diseases such as cystic fibrosis exacerbation, burn injury-induced lung injury, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 infection. Despite early evidence showing azithromycin slowed down coronavirus multiplication in laboratory settings, further research indicates it to be ineffective as a treatment for COVID-19 in humans. Azithromycin in conjunction with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been associated with deleterious outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including drug-induced QT prolongation. After a large-scale trial showed no benefit of using azithromycin in treating COVID-19, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its guidance and no longer recommends the medication for COVID-19. Azithromycin has been studied in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and has been reported to improve or even resolve symptoms in some cases. However, these studies have been described as being of very low quality. In any case, the beneficial effects might be by eradication of chronic bacterial infections that are possibly contributing to or causing CFS or by the immunomodulatory effects of azithromycin. Azithromycin therapy in cystic fibrosis patients yields a modest respiratory function improvement, reduces exacerbation risk, and extends time to exacerbation up to six months; still, long-term efficacy data is a subject of ongoing research. Potential benefits of azithromycin therapy is azithromycin's good safety profile, minimal treatment burden, and cost-effectiveness, but the drawbacks are gastrointestinal side effects with weekly dosing, which are ameliorated by a split dose regimen. The potential role of azithromycin in inhibiting the autophagic destruction of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) within macrophages has garnered significant attention. This mechanism may contribute to the observed correlation between long-term macrolide monotherapy and an increased risk of NTM infection and the emergence of macrolide-resistant strains. Azithromycin's interference with autophagy could potentially predispose patients with cystic fibrosis to mycobacterial infections. Despite repeated refutations of a direct association between azithromycin use and NTM infection, there remains a high level of concern regarding the potential for the development of NTM strains resistant to macrolides. Azithromycin has been shown to be an effective preventive measure against many postpartum infections in mothers following planned vaginal births; still, its impact on neonatal outcomes remains inconclusive and is the subject of ongoing research. == References == == See also == Zrinka Tamburašev, Croatian biochemist on the team that discovered azithromycin",Hemomycin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.060365608893335e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0020024979021400213), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004097400698810816)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.5759396553039551)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It has several potential medicinal properties, like anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity. == Natural occurrences == Lupeol is found in a variety of plants, including mango, Acacia visco and Abronia villosa. It is also found in dandelion coffee. Lupeol is present as a major component in Camellia japonica leaf. == Total synthesis == The first total synthesis of lupeol was reported by Gilbert Stork et al. In 2009, Surendra and Corey reported a more efficient and enantioselective total synthesis of lupeol, starting from (1E,5E)-8-[(2S)-3,3-dimethyloxiran-2-yl]-2,6-dimethylocta-1,5-dienyl acetate by use of a polycyclization. == Biosynthesis == Lupeol is produced by several organisms from squalene epoxide. Dammarane and baccharane skeletons are formed as intermediates. The reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme lupeol synthase. A recent study on the metabolomics of Camellia japonica leaf revealed that lupeol is produced from squalene epoxide where squalene play the role as a precursor. == Pharmacology == Lupeol has a complex pharmacology, displaying antiprotozoal, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antitumor and chemopreventive properties. Animal models suggest lupeol may act as an anti-inflammatory agent. A 1998 study found lupeol to decrease paw swelling in rats by 39%, compared to 35% for the standardized control compound indomethacin. One study has also found some activity as a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor at high concentrations (in the millimolar range). It is an effective inhibitor in laboratory models of prostate and skin cancers. As an anti-inflammatory agent, lupeol functions primarily on the interleukin system. Lupeol to decreases interleukin 4 (IL-4) production by T-helper type 2 cells. Lupeol has been found to have a contraceptive effect due to its inhibiting effect on the calcium channel of sperm (CatSper). Lupeol has also been shown to exert anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer effects via the downregulation of TNF-alpha and VEGFR-2.

Non-selective α-blockers can cause a much more pronounced reflex tachycardia than the selective α1 blockers. Like the selective α1 blockers, phentolamine causes a relaxation of systemic vasculature, leading to hypotension. This hypotension is sensed by the baroreceptor reflex, which results in increased sympathetic nerve firing on the heart, releasing norepinephrine. In response, the β1 adrenergic receptors on the heart increase their rate, contractility, and dromotropy, which help to offset the decrease in systemic blood pressure. Unlike the α1 selective blockers, phentolamine also inhibits the α2 receptors, which function predominantly as presynaptic negative feedback for norepinephrine release. By abolishing this negative feedback phentolamine leads to even less regulated norepinephrine release, which results in a more drastic increase in heart rate. == Uses == The primary application for phentolamine is for the control of hypertensive emergencies, most notably due to pheochromocytoma. It also has usefulness in the treatment of cocaine-induced cardiovascular complications, where one would generally avoid β-blockers (e.g. metoprolol), as they can cause unopposed α-adrenergic mediated coronary vasoconstriction, worsening myocardial ischemia and hypertension. Phentolamine is not a first-line agent for this indication. Phentolamine should only be given to patients who do not fully respond to benzodiazepines, nitroglycerin, and calcium channel blockers. When given by injection, it causes blood vessels to dilate, thereby increasing blood flow. When injected into the penis (intracavernosal), it increases blood flow to the penis, which results in an erection. It may be stored in crash carts to counteract severe peripheral vasoconstriction secondary to extravasation of peripherally placed vasopressor infusions, typically of norepinephrine. Epinephrine infusions are less vasoconstrictive than norepinephrine as they primarily stimulate β receptor more than α receptors, but the effect remains dose-dependent. Phentolamine also has diagnostic and therapeutic roles in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Phentolamine is marketed in the dental field as a local anesthetic reversal agent. Branded as OraVerse, it is a phentolamine mesylate injection designed to reverse the local vasoconstrictor properties used in many local anesthetics to prolong anesthesia. Phentolamine is also used ophthalmically under the brand name Ryzumvi to reverse the effects of pharmacologically-induced mydriasis. == Chemistry == Phentolamine can be synthesized by alkylation of 3-(4-methylanilino)phenol using 2-chloromethylimidazoline: == Adverse effects == Orthostatic hypotension. == References ==",Regitin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -5.8887653722194955e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0024909917265176773)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.061967797577381134)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/cons/regitine.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=82, start_index=9, title='Regitine Advanced Patient Information - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/cons/regitine.html?utm_source=openai')])"

Its antioxidant properties have caused it to be widely used as a preservative in food, food packaging, animal feed, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, rubber, and petroleum products. BHA has been used in food since around 1947. == Chemistry == BHA consists of a mixture of two isomeric organic compounds, 2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole and 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole. It is prepared from 4-methoxyphenol and isobutylene. The conjugated aromatic ring of BHA is able to stabilize free radicals, sequestering them. By acting as free radical scavengers, further free radical reactions are prevented. == Applications == Since 1947, BHA has been added to edible fats and fat-containing foods for its antioxidant properties as it prevents rancidification of food which creates objectionable odors. It has been assigned the E number E320. It is often combined with a similar chemical, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). BHA also is commonly used in medicines, such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), isotretinoin, lovastatin, and simvastatin, among others. == Health effects == The U.S. National Institutes of Health report that BHA is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In particular, when administered in high doses as part of their diet, BHA causes papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach in rats and Syrian golden hamsters. In mice, there is no carcinogenic effect; in fact, there is evidence of a protective effect against the carcinogenicity of other chemicals. When examining human population statistics, the usual low intake levels of BHA show no significant association with an increased risk of cancer. The European Commission has conducted an evaluation of literature. They noted the lack of potential for the compound to induce carcinogenic effects in humans; studies showing carcinogenic effects in hamsters are not relevant to humans (which lack a forestomach). Also noted is that endocrine disruption, if any, is only likely to be present at levels vastly exceeding the intake as a food. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) – Summaries & Evaluations stated butylated hydroxyanisole was tested for carcinogenicity in two experiments in rats and in two experiments in hamsters by administration in the diet, inducing benign and malignant tumours of the forestomach.

Saroglitazar is indicated for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia with type 2 diabetes mellitus not controlled by statin therapy. In clinical studies, saroglitazar has demonstrated reduction of triglycerides (TG), LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and an increase in HDL cholesterol a characteristic hallmark of atherogenic diabetic dyslipidemia (ADD). It has also shown anti-diabetic medication properties by reducing the fasting plasma glucose and HBA1c in diabetes patients. == Mechanism of action == Saroglitazar is an insulin sensitizer. It is a first in class drug which acts as a dual PPAR agonist at the subtypes α (alpha) and γ (gamma) of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). Agonist action on PPARα lowers high blood triglycerides, and agonist action on PPARγ improves insulin resistance and consequently lowers blood sugar. == Efficacy == Being a dual PPAR agonist, saroglitazar helps in controlling blood glucose and lipid parameters, especially high triglycerides and high non-HDL cholesterol. A study done in rats concluded that saroglitazar has the potential to prevent the progression of retinopathy in diabetes patients. Using preclinical models, it has also been shown to be useful in diabetic nephropathy. == Safety == No major serious adverse events have been reported; however, long-term cardiovascular safety has not been established. Concerns have been raised regarding increase in serum creatinine with the use of saroglitazar, initially noted in a meta-analysis published by Dutta et. al. In another randomized controlled trial published by Gawrieh et. al., a mild but significant increase in serum creatinine was noted with 16 weeks use of saroglitazar at 4mg/day dose. == Controversies == In December 2016, Zydus Discovery DMCC, a research subsidiary Zydus Lifesciences, was cited by the US FDA for deliberately misbranding saroglitazar.

2418,"('Glucosamine', 'Chitosamine', 'Glcn', 'Glucosamine free base', '(3r,4r,5s,6r)-3-amino-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-2,4,5-triol')","Endogenous, Medical","Glucosamine (C6H13NO5) is an amino sugar and a prominent precursor in the biochemical synthesis of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Glucosamine is part of the structure of two polysaccharides, chitosan and chitin. Glucosamine is one of the most abundant monosaccharides. Produced commercially by the hydrolysis of shellfish exoskeletons or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as corn or wheat, glucosamine has many names depending on country. Although a common dietary supplement, there is little evidence that it is effective for relief of arthritis or pain, and is not an approved prescription drug in the United States. == Dietary supplement == Oral glucosamine is a dietary supplement and is not a prescription drug in the United States. Glucosamine is marketed as a supplement to support the structure and function of joints, and the marketing is targeted to people with osteoarthritis. Commonly sold forms of glucosamine are glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine chondroitin, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetylglucosamine. Of the three commonly available forms of glucosamine, only glucosamine sulfate is given a ""likely effective"" rating for treating osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is often sold in combination with other supplements such as chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane. Glucosamine, along with commonly used chondroitin, is not routinely prescribed to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, as there is insufficient evidence that this treatment is helpful. As is common with heavily promoted dietary supplements, the claimed benefits of glucosamine are based principally on clinical and laboratory studies. Clinical studies on glucosamine efficacy are divided, with some reporting relief from arthritic pain and stiffness, while others report no benefit above placebo. As of 2015, there is no evidence that consumption of glucosamine by sport participants prevents or limits joint damage after injury. == Adverse effects and drug interactions == Glucosamine with or without chondroitin elevates the international normalized ratio (INR) in individuals who are taking the blood thinner, warfarin. It may also interfere with the efficacy of chemotherapy for treating cancer symptoms. Adverse effects are mild and infrequent and may include stomach upset, constipation, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Since glucosamine is usually derived from the shells of shellfish, it may be unsafe for those with shellfish allergy. Many manufacturers of glucosamine derived from shellfish include a warning that those with a seafood allergy should consult a healthcare professional before taking the product. Alternatively, non-shellfish-derived forms of glucosamine are available. Another concern has been that the extra glucosamine could contribute to diabetes by interfering with the normal regulation of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, but several investigations found no evidence that this occurs. Other studies conducted in lean or obese subjects concluded that oral glucosamine at standard doses does not affect insulin resistance. == Biochemistry == Glucosamine is naturally present in the shells of shellfish, animal bones, bone marrow, and fungi. D-Glucosamine is made naturally in the form of glucosamine-6-phosphate, and is the biochemical precursor of all nitrogen-containing sugars. Specifically in humans, glucosamine-6-phosphate is synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine by glutamine—fructose-6-phosphate transaminase as the first step of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. The end-product of this pathway is uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is then used for making glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. As the formation of glucosamine-6-phosphate is the first step for the synthesis of these products, glucosamine may be important in regulating their production; however, the way that the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is actually regulated, and whether this could be involved in contributing to human disease remains unclear. == Manufacturing == Most glucosamine is manufactured by processing chitin from the shells of shellfish including shrimp, lobsters, and crabs. To meet the demands of vegetarians and others with objections to shellfish, manufacturers have brought glucosamine products to market made using fungus Aspergillus niger and from fermenting corn. == History == Glucosamine was first prepared in 1876 by Georg Ledderhose by the hydrolysis of chitin with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The stereochemistry was not fully determined until the 1939 work of Walter Haworth. == Legal status == === United States === In the United States, glucosamine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use in humans. Since glucosamine is classified as a dietary supplement in the United States, evidence of safety is required by FDA regulations, but evidence of efficacy is not required so long as it is not advertised as a treatment for a medical condition. In 2004, the FDA declared there was insufficient evidence for supplement manufacturers to state that glucosamine was effective for treating arthritis, joint degeneration, or cartilage deterioration, a position remaining in effect as of 2018. === Europe === In most of Europe, glucosamine is approved as a medical drug and is sold in the form of glucosamine sulfate. In this case, evidence of safety and efficacy is required for the medical use of glucosamine and several guidelines have recommended its use as an effective and safe therapy for osteoarthritis. The Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee has granted glucosamine sulfate a level of toxicity of 5 in a 0-100 scale, and recent OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) guidelines for hip and knee osteoarthritis indicate an acceptable safety profile. By 2014, the OARSI did not recommend glucosamine for disease modification, and considered it ""uncertain"" for symptom relief, in knee osteoarthritis. === Class-action lawsuits === In 2013, without admitting fault, manufacturer Rexall Sundown and NBTY agreed to pay up to US$2 million to settle consumer claims related to the wording of certain claims on the packaging of glucosamine bottles sold at Costco under the Kirkland label. In August 2012, a class-action lawsuit was filed in New York claiming that 21st Century Healthcare, Inc. had falsely advertised that its ""Glucosamine 750 Chondroitin 600 Triple Strength"" dietary supplements would restore lost cartilage. In April 2013, a San Diego man launched a proposed class-action lawsuit in California Federal Court accusing Nutramax Laboratories, Walmart and Rite Aid of falsely advertising the effectiveness of glucosamine. == Research == === Humans === Because glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of cartilage, research has focused on the potential for supplemental glucosamine to improve cartilage structure and alleviate arthritis, but there is little evidence from clinical trials that it is effective for alleviating arthritis pain. ==== Bioavailability ==== Two studies measured the concentrations of glucosamine in the synovial fluid and plasma after oral administration of glucosamine sulfate to both healthy volunteers and people with osteoarthritis. In the first study, glucosamine sulfate was given to healthy volunteers in doses of 750, 1,500, or 3,000 mg once daily. In the second study, oral glucosamine sulfate capsules (1,500 mg) were given daily for two weeks to 12 people with osteoarthritis. Glucosamine concentrations in plasma and synovial fluid increased significantly from baseline levels, and the levels in the two fluids were highly correlated. The authors interpreted that these levels could be biologically advantageous to articular cartilage, but the levels are still ten to one hundred times lower than required to positively influence the cartilage (chondrocytes) to build new tissue. Glucosamine sulfate uptake in synovial fluid may be as much as 20%, or it could be negligible, indicating no biological significance. == Veterinary medicine == === Dogs === Some studies have shown efficacy of glucosamine supplementation for dogs with osteoarthritis pain, particularly in combination with other nutraceuticals like chondroitin, while others have not. A trial of oral combination capsules (glucosamine, chondroitin, and manganese ascorbate) in dogs with osteoarthritis found no benefit on either gait analysis or subjective assessments by the veterinarian or owner. === Horses === The use of glucosamine in equine medicine exists, but one meta-analysis judged extant research too flawed to be of value in guiding treatment of horses. A number of studies have measured the bioavailability of glucosamine after oral administration to horses. When given as a single oral dose (9 g) with or without chondroitin sulfate (3 g) to ten horses, glucosamine (hydrochloride) was detected in the blood with a maximum level of 10.6±6.9 μg/mL at two hours after dosing. Another study examined both the serum and the joint synovial fluid after nasogastric (oral) or intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg glucosamine hydrochloride to eight adult horses. Although joint fluid concentrations of glucosamine reached 9–15 μmol/L following intravenous dosing, it was only 0.3–0.7 μmol/L with nasogastric dosing. The authors calculated that these glucosamine synovial fluid levels achieved by the oral route were 500 times lower than that required to have a positive effect on the metabolism of cartilage cells. A follow-up study by the same research group compared glucosamine sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride at the same dose (20 mg/kg) in eight horses and found a higher fluid concentration with the sulfate preparation (158 ng/mL compared to 89 ng/mL one hour post oral dose). They concluded that these higher synovial fluid levels obtained with the sulfate derivative were still too low to have a relevant biological effect on articular cartilage. A three-month trial of an oral dosage regime of a commercial preparation of glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and methylsulfonylmethane was performed in veteran horses with no effect on gait stiffness, with exercise alone in the control group being effective. The intravenous use of a combination of N-acetylglucosamine, pentosan polysulfate and sodium hyaluronate in horses with surgically-induced osteoarthritis saw improvements in X-ray changes to the cartilage but not histologically or in biochemical outcomes, suggesting more evidence is needed for this combination and route of administration. == See also == Chitobiose == References == == External links == Glucosamine and Chondroitin for Osteoarthritis Pain, Arthritis Foundation Glucosamine, DailyMed, U.S. National Library of Medicine MedFacts Natural Products",Chitosamine,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.5062811970710754), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.008623439818620682), (' END', -0.35241398215293884), ('OG', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ENO', -0.0003362966235727072), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.16038751602172852), (' PERSONAL', -0.007700792048126459), (' CARE', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('FOOD, MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.37695398926734924), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.0025927757378667593), ('ĠMED', -0.8753753900527954), ('ICAL', -3.6954811548639555e-06), (',', -0.31358882784843445), ('ĠEND', -0.5761182904243469), ('OG', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.03816132992506027)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -1.9361264946837764e-07)])","('INFO ; ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/9/5/99?utm_source=openai)),([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7014278/?utm_source=openai)),([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4557018/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=7, title='Chitosan: A Promising Multifunctional Cosmetic Ingredient for Skin and Hair Care', type='url_citation', url='https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/9/5/99?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=170, start_index=77, title='Chitosan Derivatives and Their Application in Biomedicine - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7014278/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=264, start_index=171, title='Chitosan: An Update on Potential Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Applications - PMC', type='url_citation', url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4557018/?utm_source=openai')])"
2419,"('(r)-serine', 'Serine', '(r)-2-amino-3-hydroxypropanoic acid', '(2r)-2-amino-3-hydroxypropanoic acid', 'Serine d-form')","Food, Medical","Serine /ˈsɪəriːn/ (symbol Ser or S) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form under biological conditions), a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a side chain consisting of a hydroxymethyl group, classifying it as a polar amino acid. It can be synthesized in the human body under normal physiological circumstances, making it a nonessential amino acid. It is encoded by the codons UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU and AGC. == Occurrence == This compound is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. Only the L-stereoisomer appears naturally in proteins. It is not essential to the human diet, since it is synthesized in the body from other metabolites, including glycine. Serine was first obtained from silk protein, a particularly rich source, in 1865 by Emil Cramer. Its name is derived from the Latin for silk, sericum. Serine's structure was established in 1902. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of serine starts with the oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate (an intermediate from glycolysis) to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate and NADH by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.95). Reductive amination (transamination) of this ketone by phosphoserine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.52) yields 3-phosphoserine (O-phosphoserine) which is hydrolyzed to serine by phosphoserine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.3). In bacteria such as E. coli these enzymes are encoded by the genes serA (EC 1.1.1.95), serC (EC 2.6.1.52), and serB (EC 3.1.3.3). Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SMHT) also catalyzes the biosynthesis of glycine (retro-aldol cleavage) from serine, transferring the resulting formalddehyde synthon to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate. However, that reaction is reversible, and will convert excess glycine to serine. SHMT is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme. == Synthesis and reactions == Industrially, L-serine is produced from glycine and methanol catalyzed by hydroxymethyltransferase. Racemic serine can be prepared in the laboratory from methyl acrylate in several steps: Hydrogenation of serine gives the diol serinol: HOCH2CH(NH2)CO2H + 2 H2 → HOCH2CH(NH2)CH2OH + 2 H2O == Biological function == === Metabolic === Serine is important in metabolism in that it participates in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. It is the precursor to several amino acids including glycine and cysteine, as well as tryptophan in bacteria. It is also the precursor to numerous other metabolites, including sphingolipids and folate, which is the principal donor of one-carbon fragments in biosynthesis. === Signaling === D-Serine, synthesized in neurons by serine racemase from L-serine (its enantiomer), serves as a neuromodulator by coactivating NMDA receptors, making them able to open if they then also bind glutamate. D-serine is a potent agonist at the glycine site (NR1) of canonical diheteromeric NMDA receptors. For the receptor to open, glutamate and either glycine or D-serine must bind to it; in addition a pore blocker must not be bound (e.g. Mg2+ or Zn2+). Some research has shown that D-serine is a more potent agonist at the NMDAR glycine site than glycine itself. However, D-serine has been shown to work as an antagonist/inverse co-agonist of t-NMDA receptors through the glycine binding site on the GluN3 subunit. == Ligands == D-serine was thought to exist only in bacteria until relatively recently; it was the second D amino acid discovered to naturally exist in humans, present as a signaling molecule in the brain, soon after the discovery of D-aspartate. Had D amino acids been discovered in humans sooner, the glycine site on the NMDA receptor might instead be named the D-serine site. Apart from central nervous system, D-serine plays a signaling role in peripheral tissues and organs such as cartilage, kidney, and corpus cavernosum. === Gustatory sensation === Pure D-serine is an off-white crystalline powder with a very faint musty aroma. D-Serine is sweet with an additional minor sour taste at medium and high concentrations. == Clinical significance == Serine deficiency disorders are rare defects in the biosynthesis of the amino acid L-serine. At present three disorders have been reported: 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency 3-phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency Phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency These enzyme defects lead to severe neurological symptoms such as congenital microcephaly and severe psychomotor retardation and in addition, in patients with 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency to intractable seizures. These symptoms respond to a variable degree to treatment with L-serine, sometimes combined with glycine. Response to treatment is variable and the long-term and functional outcome is unknown. To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype/phenotype correlation and outcome of these diseases their impact on the quality of life of patients, as well as for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies a patient registry was established by the noncommercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders (iNTD). Besides disruption of serine biosynthesis, its transport may also become disrupted. One example is spastic tetraplegia, thin corpus callosum, and progressive microcephaly, a disease caused by mutations that affect the function of the neutral amino acid transporter A. === Research for therapeutic use === The classification of L-serine as a non-essential amino acid has come to be considered as conditional, since vertebrates such as humans cannot always synthesize optimal quantities over entire lifespans. Safety of L-serine has been demonstrated in an FDA-approved human phase I clinical trial with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS, patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01835782), but treatment of ALS symptoms has yet to be shown. A 2011 meta-analysis found adjunctive sarcosine to have a medium effect size for negative and total symptoms of schizophrenia. There also is evidence that L‐serine could acquire a therapeutic role in diabetes. D-Serine is being studied in rodents as a potential treatment for schizophrenia. D-Serine also has been described as a potential biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, due to a relatively high concentration of it in the cerebrospinal fluid of probable AD patients. D-serine, which is made in the brain, has been shown to work as an antagonist/inverse co-agonist of t-NMDA receptors mitigating neuron loss in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. D-Serine has been theorized as a potential treatment for sensorineural hearing disorders such as hearing loss and tinnitus. == See also == Isoserine Homoserine (isothreonine) Serine octamer cluster == References == == External links == Serine MS Spectrum",Serine,WIKIPEDIA,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -6.32523515378125e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -5.860340752406046e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.3868890106678009), (' FOOD', -0.22567054629325867), (',', -0.12695477902889252), (' MED', -0.01614217273890972), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('EN', -0.045015763491392136), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -1.0371154530730564e-05), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.0015099564334377646), ('ĠFOOD', -0.009347720071673393), (',', -0.5760238766670227), ('ĠMED', -0.06612027436494827), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014193889684975147)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', 0.0), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -5.512236498361744e-07), (' FOOD', -3.547789674485102e-05)])","('ENDOGENOUS,FOOD,PERSONAL CARE,MEDICAL;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9105362/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10783795/,https://foodcom.pl/en/amino-acids-in-which-industries-are-they-used/,https://pmarketresearch.com/serine-market-analysis/ ', [])"

As cancer-related inflammation is a cause of pain, we investigated whether Bindarit suppresses cancer-related inflammation and pain. We established a bone-cancer mouse model by inoculating cancer cells. After applying Bindarit, we preformed pain sensitivity tests and checked cancer development by X-ray. Using flow cytometry and qRT-PCR assays, we assessed the effect of Bindarit on peripheral blood monocyte mobilization and M2 macrophage polarization. We also investigated the targets of Bindarit using western blotting and luciferase assay. Bindarit-treated mice performed better in pain sensitivity tests compare to control mice. X-ray imaging showed that Bindarit-treated mice had fewer cancer cell colonies and smaller overall tumor burden. Bindarit reduced the number of monocytes in peripheral blood and down-regulated the expression of M2 macrophage polarization makers. Bindarit also inhibited IKKβ phosphorylation. Bindarit efficiently relieves cancer-related pain and suppresses cancer development. Bindarit inhibits monocyte mobilization in peripheral blood as well as M2 macrophage polarization. IKKβ is identified as a target of Bindarit. Diabetes-associated periodontitis (DP) aggravates diabetic complications and increases mortality from diabetes. DP is caused by diabetes-enhanced host immune-inflammatory responses to bacterial insult. In this study, we found that persistently elevated CCL2 levels in combination with proinflammatory monocyte infiltration of periodontal tissues were closely related to DP. Moreover, inhibition of CCL2 by oral administration of bindarit reduced alveolar bone loss and increased periodontal epithelial thickness by suppressing periodontal inflammation. Furthermore, bindarit suppressed the infiltration of proinflammatory monocytes and altered the inflammatory properties of macrophages in the diabetic periodontium. This finding provides a basis for the development of an effective therapeutic approach for treating DP.

However, the direct cytotoxic mechanisms of CYT997 have not yet been fully characterized. We evaluated apoptosis and autophagy in human osteosarcomas after treatment with CYT997 and investigated the underlying mechanisms. To explore relationships, we used the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, ERO1 inhibitor EN460 and mitochondrial targeted protection peptide elamipretide. BALB/c-nu mice were inoculated with 143B tumor cells to investigate the in vivo effect of CYT997. We explored the efficacy and mechanism of CYT997 in osteosarcoma (OS) in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that CYT997 potently suppresses cell viability and induces apoptosis and autophagy. CYT997 triggered production of ROS and exerted lethal effects via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in OS cells. NAC attenuated these effects. The PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, which can block the ER stress pathway, reduced ROS production and enhanced cell viability. Moreover, activation of ERO1 in the ER stress pathway was responsible for inducing ROS production. ROS produced by the mitochondrial pathway also aggravate ER stress. Protection of mitochondria can reduce apoptosis and autophagy. Finally, CYT997 prominently reduced tumor growth in vivo.

We tested the effectiveness of several of these compounds in substituting for authentic SOD enzymes in two simple systems--the prokaryote Escherichia coli and the single-celled eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae--where strains are available that completely lack cytoplasmic SOD activity and are thus significantly impaired in their ability to grow aerobically. Most of the compounds tested, including Euk-8 and Euk-134, manganese salen derivatives developed by Eukarion; M40403, a manganese complex of a bis(cyclohexylpyridine)-substituted macrocyclic ligand developed by Metaphore; and several manganese porphyrin derivatives, were ineffective in both systems. Only the manganese tetrapyridyl porphyrin complex MnTM-2-PyP and two close relatives were effective in rescuing aerobic growth of E. coli lacking SOD, and, in the case of sod1Delta yeast, only MnTM-2-PyP itself was fully effective. Surprisingly, several compounds reported to be beneficial in other in vivo model systems (Euk-8, Euk-134, M40403) were actually toxic to these organisms lacking SOD, although they had no effect on the wild-type parent strains. Our results suggest the possibility that the beneficial effects of some of the so-called ""SOD mimic drugs"" may be due to some property other than in vivo superoxide dismutase activity. Mitochondria play an important role in sperm cell maturation and function. Here, we examined whether (and how) changes in sperm redox milieu affect the functional status of sperm mitochondria, that is, sperm functionality. Compared with the control, incubation in Tyrode's medium for 3 h, under noncapacitating conditions, decreased sperm motility, the amount of nitric oxide ((•)NO), the number of MitoTracker(®) Green FM (MT-G) positive mitochondria, and the expression of complexes I and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In turn, superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic (M40403) treatment restored/increased these parameters, as well as the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, manganese SOD, and catalase.

2424,"('Oxalic acid', 'Ethanedioic acid', 'Aktisal', 'Aquisal', 'Oxiric acid')","Endogenous, Medical","Oxalic acid is an organic acid with the systematic name ethanedioic acid and chemical formula HO−C(=O)−C(=O)−OH, also written as (COOH)2 or (CO2H)2 or H2C2O4. It is the simplest dicarboxylic acid. It is a white crystalline solid that forms a colorless solution in water. Its name is derived from early investigators who isolated oxalic acid from flowering plants of the genus Oxalis, commonly known as wood-sorrels. It occurs naturally in many foods. Excessive ingestion of oxalic acid or prolonged skin contact can be dangerous. Oxalic acid has much greater acid strength than acetic acid. It is a reducing agent and its conjugate bases hydrogen oxalate (HC2O−4) and oxalate (C2O2−4) are chelating agents for metal cations. It is used as a cleaning agent, especially for the removal of rust, because it forms a water-soluble ferric iron complex, the ferrioxalate ion. Oxalic acid typically occurs as the dihydrate with the formula H2C2O4·2H2O. == History == The preparation of salts of oxalic acid from plants had been known, at least since 1745, when the Dutch botanist and physician Herman Boerhaave isolated a salt from wood sorrel, akin to kraft process. By 1773, François Pierre Savary of Fribourg, Switzerland had isolated oxalic acid from its salt in sorrel. In 1776, Swedish chemists Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Torbern Olof Bergman produced oxalic acid by reacting sugar with concentrated nitric acid; Scheele called the acid that resulted socker-syra or såcker-syra (sugar acid). By 1784, Scheele had shown that ""sugar acid"" and oxalic acid from natural sources were identical. The modern name was introduced along with many other acid names by de Morveau, Lavoisier and coauthors in 1787. In 1824, the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler obtained oxalic acid by reacting cyanogen with ammonia in aqueous solution. This experiment may represent the first synthesis of a natural product. == Production == === Industrial === Oxalic acid is mainly manufactured by the oxidation of carbohydrates or glucose using nitric acid or air in the presence of vanadium pentoxide. Another process uses oxygen to regenerate the nitric acid, using a variety of precursors including glycolic acid and ethylene glycol. As of 2011, this process was only used by Mitsubishi in Japan. A newer method entails oxidative carbonylation of alcohols to give the diesters of oxalic acid: 4 ROH + 4 CO + O2 → 2 (CO2R)2 + 2 H2O These diesters are subsequently hydrolyzed to oxalic acid. Approximately 120,000 tonnes are produced annually. Historically oxalic acid was obtained exclusively by using caustics, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, on sawdust, followed by acidification of the oxalate by mineral acids, such as sulfuric acid. Oxalic acid can also be formed by the heating of sodium formate in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. === Laboratory === Although it can be readily purchased, oxalic acid can be prepared in the laboratory by oxidizing sucrose using nitric acid in the presence of a small amount of vanadium pentoxide as a catalyst. The hydrated solid can be dehydrated with heat or by azeotropic distillation. == Structure == === Anhydrous === Anhydrous oxalic acid exists as two polymorphs; in one the hydrogen-bonding results in a chain-like structure, whereas the hydrogen bonding pattern in the other form defines a sheet-like structure. Because the anhydrous material is both acidic and hydrophilic (water seeking), it is used in esterifications. === Dihydrate === The dihydrate H2C2O4·2H2O has space group C52h–P21/n, with lattice parameters a = 611.9 pm, b = 360.7 pm, c = 1205.7 pm, β = 106°19′, Z = 2. The main inter-atomic distances are: C−C 153 pm, C−O1 129 pm, C−O2 119 pm. == Reactions == === Acid–base properties === Oxalic acid's pKa values vary in the literature from 1.25 to 1.46 and from 3.81 to 4.40. The 100th ed of the CRC, released in 2019, has values of 1.25 and 3.81. Oxalic acid is relatively strong compared to other carboxylic acids: Oxalic acid undergoes many of the reactions characteristic for other carboxylic acids. It forms esters such as dimethyl oxalate (m.p. 52.5 to 53.5 °C, 126.5 to 128.3 °F). It forms an acid chloride called oxalyl chloride. === Metal-binding properties === Transition metal oxalate complexes are numerous, e.g. the drug oxaliplatin. Oxalic acid has been shown to reduce manganese dioxide MnO2 in manganese ores to allow the leaching of the metal by sulfuric acid. Oxalic acid is an important reagent in lanthanide chemistry. Hydrated lanthanide oxalates form readily in very strongly acidic solutions as a densely crystalline, easily filtered form, largely free of contamination by nonlanthanide elements: 2 Ln3+ + 3 H2C2O4 → Ln2(C2O4)3 + 6 H+ Thermal decomposition of these oxalates gives the oxides, which is the most commonly marketed form of these elements. === Other === Oxalic acid and oxalates can be oxidized by permanganate in an autocatalytic reaction. Oxalic acid vapor decomposes at 125–175 °C into carbon dioxide CO2 and formic acid HCOOH. Photolysis with 237–313 nm UV light also produces carbon monoxide CO and water. Evaporation of a solution of urea and oxalic acid in 2:1 molar ratio yields a solid crystalline compound H2C2O4·2CO(NH2)2, consisting of stacked two-dimensional networks of the neutral molecules held together by hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms. == Occurrence == === Biosynthesis === At least two pathways exist for the enzyme-mediated formation of oxalate. In one pathway, oxaloacetate, a component of the Krebs citric acid cycle, is hydrolyzed to oxalate and acetic acid by the enzyme oxaloacetase: [O2CC(O)CH2CO2]2− + H2O → C2O2−4 + CH3CO−2 + H+ It also arises from the dehydrogenation of glycolic acid, which is produced by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. === Occurrence in foods and plants === Early investigators isolated oxalic acid from wood-sorrel (Oxalis). Members of the spinach family and the brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts) are high in oxalates, as are sorrel and umbellifers like parsley. The leaves and stems of all species of the genus Chenopodium and related genera of the family Amaranthaceae, which includes quinoa, contain high levels of oxalic acid. Rhubarb leaves contain about 0.5% oxalic acid, and jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) contains calcium oxalate crystals. Similarly, the Virginia creeper, a common decorative vine, produces oxalic acid in its berries as well as oxalate crystals in the sap, in the form of raphides. Bacteria produce oxalates from oxidation of carbohydrates. Plants of the genus Fenestraria produce optical fibers made from crystalline oxalic acid to transmit light to subterranean photosynthetic sites. Carambola, also known as starfruit, also contains oxalic acid along with caramboxin. Citrus juice contains small amounts of oxalic acid. The formation of naturally occurring calcium oxalate patinas on certain limestone and marble statues and monuments has been proposed to be caused by the chemical reaction of the carbonate stone with oxalic acid secreted by lichen or other microorganisms. === Production by fungi === Many soil fungus species secrete oxalic acid, which results in greater solubility of metal cations and increased availability of certain soil nutrients, and can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals. Some fungi such as Aspergillus niger have been extensively studied for the industrial production of oxalic acid; however, those processes are not yet economically competitive with production from oil and gas. Cryphonectria parasitica may excrete oxalic acid containing solutions at the advancing edge of its chestnut cambium infection. The lower pH (<2.5) of more concentrated oxalic acid excretions may degrade cambium cell walls and have a toxic effect on chestnut cambium cells. Cambium cells that burst provide nutrients for a blight infection advance. == Biochemistry == The conjugate base of oxalic acid is the hydrogenoxalate anion, and its conjugate base (oxalate) is a competitive inhibitor of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme. LDH catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid (end product of the fermentation (anaerobic) process) oxidising the coenzyme NADH to NAD+ and H+ concurrently. Restoring NAD+ levels is essential to the continuation of anaerobic energy metabolism through glycolysis. As cancer cells preferentially use anaerobic metabolism (see Warburg effect) inhibition of LDH has been shown to inhibit tumor formation and growth, thus is an interesting potential course of cancer treatment. Oxalic acid plays a key role in the interaction between pathogenic fungi and plants. Small amounts of oxalic acid enhances plant resistance to fungi, but higher amounts cause widespread programmed cell death of the plant and help with fungi infection. Plants normally produce it in small amounts, but some pathogenic fungi such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum cause a toxic accumulation. Oxalate, besides being biosynthesised, may also be biodegraded. Oxalobacter formigenes is an important gut bacterium that helps animals (including humans) degrade oxalate. == Applications == Oxalic acid's main applications include cleaning or bleaching, especially for the removal of rust (iron complexing agent). Its utility in rust removal agents is due to its forming a stable, water-soluble salt with ferric iron, ferrioxalate ion. Oxalic acid is an ingredient in some tooth whitening products. About 25% of produced oxalic acid is used as a mordant in dyeing processes. It is also used in bleaches, especially for pulpwood, cork, straw, cane, feathers, and for rust removal and other cleaning, in baking powder, and as a third reagent in silica analysis instruments. === Niche uses === Oxalic acid is used by some beekeepers as a miticide against the parasitic varroa mite. Dilute solutions (0.05–0.15 M) of oxalic acid can be used to remove iron from clays such as kaolinite to produce light-colored ceramics. Oxalic acid can be used to clean minerals like many other acids. Two such examples are quartz crystals and pyrite. Oxalic acid is sometimes used in the aluminum anodizing process, with or without sulfuric acid. Compared to sulfuric-acid anodizing, the coatings obtained are thinner and exhibit lower surface roughness. Oxalic acid is also widely used as a wood bleach, most often in its crystalline form to be mixed with water to its proper dilution for use. === Semiconductor industry === Oxalic acid is also used in electronic and semiconductor industries. In 2006 it was reported being used in electrochemical–mechanical planarization of copper layers in the semiconductor devices fabrication process. === Proposed uses === Reduction of carbon dioxide to oxalic acid by various methods, such as electrocatalysis using a copper complex, is under study as a proposed chemical intermediate for carbon capture and utilization. == Content in food items == == Toxicity == Oxalic acid has an oral LDLo (lowest published lethal dose) of 600 mg/kg. It has been reported that the lethal oral dose is 15 to 30 grams. The toxicity of oxalic acid is due to kidney failure caused by precipitation of solid calcium oxalate. Oxalate is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Ingestion of ethylene glycol results in oxalic acid as a metabolite which can also cause acute kidney failure. == Kidney stones == Most kidney stones, 76%, are composed of calcium oxalate. == Notes == ^a Unless otherwise cited, all measurements are based on raw vegetable weights with original moisture content. == References == == External links == Oxalic acid MS Spectrum International Chemical Safety Card 0529 NIOSH Guide to Chemical Hazards (CDC) Table: Oxalic acid content of selected vegetables (USDA) Alternative link: Table: Oxalic Acid Content of Selected Vegetables (USDA) About rhubarb poisoning (The Rhubarb Compendium) Oxalosis & Hyperoxaluria Foundation (OHF) The Oxalate Content of Food 2008 (PDF) Oxalosis & Hyperoxaluria Foundation (OHF) Diet Information Calculator: Water and solute activities in aqueous oxalic acid",Ethanedioic acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.0009898189455270767), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -6.2729995988775045e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.062062691897153854), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.6937089562416077), (' PERSONAL', -0.0007042104844003916), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.17279084026813507), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -1.537788011773955e-05), ('ĠINDU', -0.0004748170613311231), ('ST', -1.2993727978027891e-05), ('RI', -1.585470999998506e-05), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.31336116790771484)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.00015872348740231246), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.00020354038861114532), (' INDUSTR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL; ([britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/science/oxalic-acid?utm_source=openai), [periodical.knowde.com](https://periodical.knowde.com/industrial-applications-of-oxalic-acid/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=216, start_index=18, title='Oxalic acid | Formula, Uses, & Facts | Britannica', type='url_citation', url='https://www.britannica.com/science/oxalic-acid?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=216, start_index=18, title='Industrial Applications of Oxalic Acid - Ethanedioic Acid', type='url_citation', url='https://periodical.knowde.com/industrial-applications-of-oxalic-acid/?utm_source=openai')])"
2425,"('Mito-tempo',)",Medical," In tomcats, epididymal spermatozoa provide an additional source of male gametes available for cryopreservation. While this procedure is feasible, the survival rate and motility of epididymal cat spermatozoa are both low after thawing. Cryopreservation is known to induce oxidative stress in spermatozoa, with mitochondria and the plasma membrane being the two major generation sites, and an imbalanced presence of free radicals is a possible cause for this low survival rate. Different antioxidants have been tested before for their effect on cryopreserved cat spermatozoa quality, with varying results. Here, we used Mito-Tempo, which is a synthetic mitochondria-targeted antioxidant and a specific scavenger of the mitochondrial superoxide system. By supplementing Mito-Tempo with the freezing extender, we aimed to improve the sperm quality of frozen-thawed cat epididymal spermatozoa. Epididymal spermatozoa obtained from twelve tomcats were assessed for motility and concentration. Prior to freezing, samples were diluted in TRIS buffered extender with egg yolk and glycerol and divided into five aliquots supplemented with 0 (control), 0.5, 5, 50, and 1005M of Mito-Tempo. After thawing, sperm motility, concentration, morphology, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and mitochondrial membrane potential were evaluated. A Friedman rank sum test with a Bonferroni post-hoc test was used to determine statistical in-between group differences in post-thaw semen parameters. The results indicated a slight improvement in acrosome integrity across all groups that were supplemented with Mito-Tempo, with the group that received 55M of Mito-Tempo showing the greatest improvement [(median of 67.99%, IQR of 5.55) compared to the control group (median of 65.33%, IQR of 7.75;  Our previous studies have demonstrated that Mito-Tempol (also known as 4-hydroxy-Tempo), a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species scavenger, alleviates oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-triggered foam cell formation. Given the effect of oxidative stress on activating the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which promotes foam cell formation, we aimed to explore whether Mito-Tempo inhibits ox-LDL-triggered foam cell formation by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome. The results revealed that Mito-Tempo re-activated Nrf2 and alleviated macrophage foam cell formation induced by ox-LDL, whereas the effects were reversed by ML385 (a specific Nrf2 inhibitor). Mito-Tempo restored the expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 by decreasing ox-LDL-induced ubiquitination. Furthermore, Mito-Tempo suppressed ox-LDL-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis, whereas the changes were blocked by ML385. Mito-Tempo decreased lipoprotein uptake by inhibiting CD36 expression and suppressed foam cell formation by regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, Mito-Tempo exhibits potent anti-atherosclerotic effects by regulating Nrf2/NLRP3 signaling. Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a common environmental toxin which alters testicular function in both animals and humans. BPA exerts its cytotoxic potential by altering mitochondrial oxidative stress and functioning. Therefore, protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress may prevent BPA-induced testicular damage. In the present study, modulation of BPA toxicity by mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, mito-TEMPO was studied in male Wistar rats. Rats were administered mito-TEMPO (0.1 mg/kg b.w, i.p.) twice a week, followed by BPA (10 mg/kg b.w., orally) once a week for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, sperm parameters were evaluated in the testis along with histopathological analysis. The mitochondrial oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and enzymatic activity of mitochondrial complex II and IV were estimated in the testicular tissue. Pretreatment of mito-TEMPO protected animals from toxic effects of BPA as indicated by the normalization of sperm parameters and preserved histoarchitecture of testis. BPA treatment to animals significantly increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). A significant decrease in the activity of mitochondrial complex II was also observed after BPA exposure whereas, mitochondrial complex II activity was increased. In addition, an increase in MMP was also observed in BPA group. Mito-TEMPO successfully normalized mitochondrial ROS and LPO formation. Similar normalization effect was also noted in the activity of mitochondrial complex II, complex IV, and MMP. Results suggested that mito-TEMPO pretreatment significantly protected BPA-induced oxidative stress and thereby mito-TEMPO effectively prevented testicular damage.",Mito-tempo,PUBMED,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.1967465579509735), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL, MEDICAL', [('IN', -0.49857038259506226), ('DU', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('ST', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('RI', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('AL', 0.0), (',', -0.0791124776005745), ('ĠMED', -0.023482318967580795), ('ICAL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.029798436909914017)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.160397469997406), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.575941801071167), (' INDUSTR', -7.493430894101039e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://www.abbexa.com/mito-tempo,https://www.glpbio.cn/mito-tempo.html,https://www.enzo.com/product/mito-tempo/,https://focusbiomolecules.com/product-tag/mito-tempo-mitochondria-targeted-antioxidant/,https://zellbio.eu/product/mito-tempo/ ', [])"

It also has biological activity in its own right, including acting as a melatonin receptor agonist, an agonist of the TrkB, and having antioxidant effects. == Biological function == Like melatonin, NAS is an agonist at the melatonin receptors MT1, MT2, and MT3, and may be considered to be a neurotransmitter. In addition, NAS is distributed in some areas of the brain where serotonin and melatonin are not, suggesting that it may have unique central duties of its own instead of merely functioning as a precursor in the synthesis of melatonin. NAS is known to have anti-depressant, neurotrophic and cognition-enhancing effects and has been proposed to be a target for the treatment of aging-associated cognitive decline and depression === TrkB receptor === NAS has been shown to act as a potent TrkB receptor agonist, while serotonin and melatonin do not. Subchronic and chronic administration of NAS to adult mice induces proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPC)s, blockage of TrkB abolished this effect suggesting that it is TrkB-dependent. NAS was also found to significantly enhance NPC proliferation in sleep-deprived mice. It is thought that the anti-depressant and neurotrophic effects of NAS are in part due to its role as a TrkB agonist. === Antioxidant properties === NAS acts as a potent antioxidant, NAS effectiveness as an anti-oxidant has been found to be different depending on the experimental model used, it has been described as being between 5 and 20 times more effect than melatonin at protecting against oxidant damage. NAS has been shown to protect against lipid peroxidation in microsomes and mitochondria. NAS has also been reported to lower resting levels of ROS in peripheral blood lymphocytes and to exhibit anti-oxidant effects against t-butylated hydroperoxide- and diamide-induced ROS. NAS has also been observed to inhibit nitric oxide synthase. === Anti-inflammatory effects === NAS has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. NAS has been shown to inhibit LPS-stimulated production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in differentiated THP-1-derived human monocytes. === Miscellaneous === NAS may play a role in the antidepressant effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The SSRI fluoxetine and the MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline upregulate AANAT indirectly through serotonergic mechanisms and thereby increase NAS levels after chronic administration, and this correlates with the onset of their antidepressant effects. Furthermore, light exposure inhibits the synthesis of NAS and reduces the antidepressant effects of MAOIs. In addition, AANAT knockout mice display significantly greater immobility times versus control mice in animal models of depression. These data support a potential role for NAS in mood regulation and in antidepressant-induced therapeutic benefits. Through a currently unidentified mechanism, NAS may be the cause of the orthostatic hypotension seen with clinical treatment of MAOIs. It reduces blood pressure in rodents, and pinealectomy (the pineal gland being a major site of NAS and melatonin synthesis) abolishes the hypotensive effects of clorgyline. == Biochemistry == NAS is produced from serotonin by the enzyme aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) and is converted to melatonin by acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT).

In this study, we investigated the effect of p38 inhibitor doramapimod on the osteoclast differentiation. Doramapimod significantly inhibited the osteoclastogenesis of bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) via attenuating the activation of p38 induced by M-CSF and RANKL. Importantly, doramapimod blocked the migration and fusion in pre-osteoclasts via the down-regulating NFATc1. The inhibitory effect of doramapimod on the migration/fusion of pre-osteoclasts via inhibiting NFATc1 activity were confirmed by measuring NFATc1 luciferase activity and evaluating the mRNA expression of NFATc1-responsive genes related to the osteoclastic migration/fusion. These results suggested anti-osteoclastogenic activity of doramapimod via inhibiting migration/fusion of pre-osteoclasts and NFATc1 activity. Doramapimod, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, is a potent anti-inflammatory drug that decreases inflammatory cytokine production in equine whole blood in vitro. It may have benefits for treating systemic inflammation in horses. To determine whether doramapimod is well tolerated when administered IV to horses, and whether it has anti-inflammatory effects in horses in a low-dose endotoxemia model. Six Standardbred horses. Tolerability study, followed by a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Horses were given doramapimod, and clinical and clinicopathological variables were monitored for 24 hours. Horses then were treated with doramapimod or placebo, followed by a low dose infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Clinical variables (heart rate, rectal temperature, noninvasive blood pressure), leukocyte count and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) concentrations were measured at multiple time points until 6 hours post-LPS infusion. No adverse effects or clinicopathological changes were seen in the safety study. When treated with doramapimod as compared to placebo, horses had significantly lower heart rates (P = .03), rectal temperatures (P = .03), and cytokine concentrations (P = .03 for TNF-α and IL-1β), and a significantly higher white blood cell count (P = .03) after LPS infusion. Doramapimod has clinically relevant anti-inflammatory effects in horses, likely mediated by a decrease in leukocyte activation and decrease in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. To evaluate its potential as a novel treatment for systemic inflammatory response syndrome in horses, clinical trials will be necessary to determine its efficacy in naturally occurring disease. Doramapimod (BIRB-796-BS), is an anti-inflammatory compound, acting through p38 MAPK inhibition, but its anti-inflammatory effects have not previously been studied in the horse.

2434,"('Zileuton', 'A 64077', 'Abbott 64077', 'Zyflo', 'Leutrol')",Medical,"Zileuton (trade name Zyflo) is an orally active inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, and thus inhibits leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) formation, used for the maintenance treatment of asthma. Zileuton was introduced in 1996 by Abbott Laboratories and is now marketed in two formulations by Cornerstone Therapeutics Inc. under the brand names Zyflo and Zyflo CR. The original immediate-release formulation, Zyflo, is taken four times per day. The extended-release formulation, Zyflo CR, is taken twice daily. Although the 600 mg immediate release tablet (Zyflo) and extended release formulation of zileuton are still available (Zyflo CR), the 300 mg immediate release tablet was withdrawn from the U.S. market on February 12, 2008. == Pharmacotherapy == === Indications and dosing === Zileuton is indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Zileuton is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks. Therapy with zileuton can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. The recommended dose of Zyflo is one 600 mg tablet, four times per day. The tablets may be split in half to make them easier to swallow. The recommended dose of Zyflo CR is two 600 mg extended-release tablets twice daily, within one hour after morning and evening meals, for a daily dose of 2400 mg. Do not split Zyflo CR tablets in half. Related compounds include montelukast (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate). These two compounds are leukotriene receptor antagonists which block the action of specific leukotrienes, while zileuton inhibits leukotriene formation. Research Research on mice suggests that Zileuton used alone or in combination with imatinib may inhibit chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It has also been researched in a mouse model of dementia. === Contraindications and warnings === The most serious side effect of Zyflo and Zyflo CR is a potential elevation of liver enzymes (in 2% of patients). Therefore, zileuton is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or persistent hepatic function enzymes elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal. Hepatic function should be assessed prior to initiating Zyflo CR, monthly for the first 3 months, every 2–3 months for the remainder of the first year, and periodically thereafter. Neuropsychiatric events, including sleep disorders and behavioral changes, may occur with Zyflo and Zyflo CR. Patients should be instructed to notify their healthcare provider if neuropsychiatric events occur while using Zyflo or Zyflo CR. Zileuton is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2 and thus has three clinically important drug interactions, which include increasing theophylline, and propranolol levels. It has been shown to lower theophylline clearance significantly, doubling the AUC and prolonging half-life by nearly 25%. Because of theophylline's relation to caffeine (both being a methylxanthine, and theophylline being a metabolite of caffeine), caffeine's metabolism and clearance may also be reduced, but there are no drug interaction studies between zileuton and caffeine. The R-isomer of warfarin metabolism and clearance is mainly affected by zileuton, while the S-isomer is not (because of metabolism via different enzymes). This can lead to an increase in prothrombin time. == Chemistry == Zileuton is an active oral inhibitor of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, which forms leukotrienes, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid from arachidonic acid. The chemical name of zileuton is (±)-1-(1-Benzo[b]thien-2-ylethyl)-l-hydroxyurea. The molecular formula of zileuton is C11H12N2O2S with a molecular weight of 236.29. The formulation from the manufacturer is a racemic mixture of R(+) and S(-) enantiomers. == Pharmacokinetics == Following oral administration zileuton is rapidly absorbed with a mean time to peak blood serum concentration of 1.7 hours and an average half-life elimination of 2.5 hours. Blood plasma concentrations are proportional to dose, whereas the absolute bioavailability is unknown. The apparent volume of distribution of zileuton is approximately 1.2 L/kg. Zileuton is 93% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin, with minor binding to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Elimination of zileuton is primarily through metabolites in the urine (~95%) with the feces accounting for the next largest amount (~2%). The drug is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, 2C9, and 3A4. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse reactions reported by patients treated with Zyflo CR were sinusitis (6.5%), nausea (5%), and pharyngolaryngeal pain (5%) vs. placebo, 4%, 1.5%, and 4% respectively. == Interactions == === Drug interactions === Zileuton is a minor substrate of CYP1A2, 2C8/9, 3A4, and a weak inhibitor of CYP 1A2. The drug has been shown to increase the serum concentration or effects of theophylline, propranolol, and warfarin, although significant increase in prothrombin time is not obvious. It is advised that the doses of each medication be monitored and/or reduced accordingly. === Other interactions === The avoidance of alcohol is recommended due to increased risk of CNS depression as well as an increased risk of liver toxicity. In addition, the herbal supplement St. John's wort may decrease the serum levels of zileuton. == Overdose/toxicology == === Symptoms === Human experience of acute overdose with zileuton is limited. A patient in a clinical study took between 6.6 and 9.0 grams of zileuton immediate-release tablets in a single dose. Vomiting was inducted and the patient recovered without sequelae. Zileuton is not removed by dialysis. The oral minimum lethal doses in mice and rats were 500-4000 and 300–1000 mg/kg, respectively (providing greater than 3 and 9 times the systemic exposure (AUC) achieved at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose, respectively). In dogs, at an oral dose of 1000 mg/kg (providing in excess of 12 times the systemic exposure (AUC) achieved at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose) no deaths occurred but nephritis was reported. === Treatment === Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway.

2435,"('Vanillin', 'P-vanillin', 'M-methoxy-p-hydroxybenzaldehyde', 'P-hydroxy-m-methoxybenzaldehyde', 'Vanillaldehyde')","Food, Medical","Vanillin is an organic compound with the molecular formula C8H8O3. It is a phenolic aldehyde. Its functional groups include aldehyde, hydroxyl, and ether. It is the primary component of the extract of the vanilla bean. Synthetic vanillin is now used more often than natural vanilla extract as a flavoring in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals. Vanillin and ethylvanillin are used by the food industry; ethylvanillin is more expensive, but has a stronger note. It differs from vanillin by having an ethoxy group (−O−CH2CH3) instead of a methoxy group (−O−CH3). Natural vanilla extract is a mixture of several hundred different compounds in addition to vanillin. Artificial vanilla flavoring is often a solution of pure vanillin, usually of synthetic origin. Because of the scarcity and expense of natural vanilla extract, synthetic preparation of its predominant component has long been of interest. The first commercial synthesis of vanillin began with the more readily available natural compound eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol). Today, artificial vanillin is made either from guaiacol or lignin. Lignin-based artificial vanilla flavoring is alleged to have a richer flavor profile than that from guaiacol-based artificial vanilla; the difference is due to the presence of acetovanillone, a minor component in the lignin-derived product that is not found in vanillin synthesized from guaiacol. == Natural history == Although it is generally accepted that vanilla was domesticated in Mesoamerica and subsequently spread to the Old World in the 16th century, in 2019, researchers published a paper stating that vanillin residue had been discovered inside jars within a tomb in Israel dating to the 2nd millennium BCE, suggesting the possible cultivation of an unidentified, Old World-endemic Vanilla species in Canaan since the Middle Bronze Age. Traces of vanillin were also found in wine jars in Jerusalem, which were used by the Judahite elite before the city was destroyed in 586 BCE. Vanilla beans, called tlilxochitl, were discovered and cultivated as a flavoring for beverages by native Mesoamerican peoples, most famously the Totonacs of modern-day Veracruz, Mexico. Since at least the early 15th century, the Aztecs used vanilla as a flavoring for chocolate in drinks called xocohotl. == Synthetic history == Vanillin was first isolated as a relatively pure substance in 1858 by Théodore Nicolas Gobley, who obtained it by evaporating a vanilla extract to dryness and recrystallizing the resulting solids from hot water. In 1874, the German scientists Ferdinand Tiemann and Wilhelm Haarmann deduced its chemical structure, at the same time finding a synthesis for vanillin from coniferin, a glucoside of isoeugenol found in pine bark. Tiemann and Haarmann founded a company Haarmann and Reimer (now part of Symrise) and started the first industrial production of vanillin using their process (now known as the Reimer–Tiemann reaction) in Holzminden, Germany. In 1876, Karl Reimer synthesized vanillin (2) from guaiacol (1). By the late 19th century, semisynthetic vanillin derived from the eugenol found in clove oil was commercially available. Synthetic vanillin became significantly more available in the 1930s, when production from clove oil was supplanted by production from the lignin-containing waste produced by the sulfite pulping process for preparing wood pulp for the paper industry. By 1981, a single pulp and paper mill in Thorold, Ontario, supplied 60% of the world market for synthetic vanillin. However, subsequent developments in the wood pulp industry have made its lignin wastes less attractive as a raw material for vanillin synthesis. Today, approximately 15% of the world's production of vanillin is still made from lignin wastes, while approximately 85% is synthesized in a two-step process from the petrochemical precursors guaiacol and glyoxylic acid. Beginning in 2000, Rhodia began marketing biosynthetic vanillin prepared by the action of microorganisms on ferulic acid extracted from rice bran. This product, sold at USD$700/kg under the trademarked name Rhovanil Natural, is not cost-competitive with petrochemical vanillin, which sells for around US$15/kg. However, unlike vanillin synthesized from lignin or guaiacol, it can be labeled as a natural flavoring. == Occurrence == Vanillin is most prominent as the principal flavor and aroma compound in vanilla. Cured vanilla pods contain about 2% by dry weight vanillin. Relatively pure vanillin may be visible as a white dust or ""frost"" on the exteriors of cured pods of high quality. It is also found in Leptotes bicolor, a species of orchid native to Paraguay and southern Brazil, and the Southern Chinese red pine. At lower concentrations, vanillin contributes to the flavor and aroma profiles of foodstuffs as diverse as olive oil, butter, raspberry, and lychee fruits. Aging in oak barrels imparts vanillin to some wines, vinegar, and spirits. In other foods, heat treatment generates vanillin from other compounds. In this way, vanillin contributes to the flavor and aroma of coffee, maple syrup, and whole-grain products, including corn tortillas and oatmeal. == Chemistry == === Natural production === Natural vanillin is extracted from the seed pods of Vanilla planifolia, a vining orchid native to Mexico, but now grown in tropical areas around the globe. Madagascar is presently the largest producer of natural vanillin. As harvested, the green seed pods contain vanillin in the form of glucovanillin, its β-D-glucoside; the green pods do not have the flavor or odor of vanilla. Vanillin is released from glucovanillin by the action of the enzyme β-glucosidase during ripening and during the curing process. After being harvested, their flavor is developed by a months-long curing process, the details of which vary among vanilla-producing regions, but in broad terms it proceeds as follows: First, the seed pods are blanched in hot water, to arrest the processes of the living plant tissues. Then, for 1–2 weeks, the pods are alternately sunned and sweated: during the day they are laid out in the sun, and each night wrapped in cloth and packed in airtight boxes to sweat. During this process, the pods become dark brown, and enzymes in the pod release vanillin as the free molecule. Finally, the pods are dried and further aged for several months, during which time their flavors further develop. Several methods have been described for curing vanilla in days rather than months, although they have not been widely developed in the natural vanilla industry, with its focus on producing a premium product by established methods, rather than on innovations that might alter the product's flavor profile. === Biosynthesis === Although the exact route of vanillin biosynthesis in V. planifolia is currently unknown, several pathways are proposed for its biosynthesis. Vanillin biosynthesis is generally agreed to be part of the phenylpropanoid pathway starting with L-phenylalanine, which is deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to form t-cinnamic acid. The para position of the ring is then hydroxylated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H/P450) to create p-coumaric acid. Then, in the proposed ferulate pathway, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase (4CL) attaches p-coumaric acid to coenzyme A (CoA) to create p-coumaroyl CoA. Hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) then converts p-coumaroyl CoA to 4-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate. This subsequently undergoes oxidation by the P450 enzyme coumaroyl ester 3’-hydroxylase (C3’H/P450) to give caffeoyl shikimate/quinate. HCT then exchanges the shikimate/quinate for CoA to create caffeoyl CoA, and 4CL removes CoA to afford caffeic acid. Caffeic acid then undergoes methylation by caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) to give ferulic acid. Finally, vanillin synthase hydratase/lyase (vp/VAN) catalyzes hydration of the double bond in ferulic acid followed by a retro-aldol elimination to afford vanillin. Vanillin can also be produced from vanilla glycoside with the additional final step of deglycosylation. In the past p-hydroxybenzaldehyde was speculated to be a precursor for vanillin biosynthesis. However, a 2014 study using radiolabelled precursor indicated that p-hydroxybenzaldehyde is not used to synthesise vanillin or vanillin glucoside in the vanilla orchids. === Chemical synthesis === The demand for vanilla flavoring has long exceeded the supply of vanilla beans. As of 2001, the annual demand for vanillin was 12,000 tons, but only 1,800 tons of natural vanillin were produced. The remainder was produced by chemical synthesis. Vanillin was first synthesized from eugenol (found in oil of clove) in 1874–75, less than 20 years after it was first identified and isolated. Vanillin was commercially produced from eugenol until the 1920s. Later it was synthesized from lignin-containing ""brown liquor"", a byproduct of the sulfite process for making wood pulp. Counterintuitively, though it uses waste materials, the lignin process is no longer popular because of environmental concerns, and today most vanillin is produced from guaiacol. Several routes exist for synthesizing vanillin from guaiacol. At present, the most significant of these is the two-step process practiced by Rhodia since the 1970s, in which guaiacol (1) reacts with glyoxylic acid by electrophilic aromatic substitution. The resulting vanillylmandelic acid (2) is then converted by 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglyoxylic acid (3) to vanillin (4) by oxidative decarboxylation. === Wood-based vanillin === 15% of the world's production of vanillin is produced from lignosulfonates, a byproduct from the manufacture of cellulose via the sulfite process. The sole producer of wood-based vanillin is the company Borregaard located in Sarpsborg, Norway. Wood-based vanillin is produced by copper-catalyzed oxidation of the lignin structures in lignosulfonates under alkaline conditions and is claimed by the manufacturing company to be preferred by their customers due to, among other reasons, its much lower carbon footprint than petrochemically synthesized vanillin. === Fermentation === The company Evolva has developed a genetically modified microorganism which can produce vanillin. Because the microbe is a processing aid, the resulting vanillin would not fall under U.S. GMO labeling requirements, and because the production is nonpetrochemical, food using the ingredient can claim to contain ""no artificial ingredients"". Using ferulic acid as an input and a specific non GMO species of Amycolatopsis bacteria, natural vanillin can be produced. === Biochemistry === Several studies have suggested that vanillin can affect the performance of antibiotics in laboratory conditions. == Uses == The largest use of vanillin is as a flavoring, usually in sweet foods. The ice cream and chocolate industries together comprise 75% of the market for vanillin as a flavoring, with smaller amounts being used in confections and baked goods. Vanillin is also used in the fragrance industry, in perfumes, and to mask unpleasant odors or tastes in medicines, livestock fodder, and cleaning products. It is also used in the flavor industry, as a very important key note for many different flavors, especially creamy profiles such as cream soda. Additionally, vanillin can be used as a general-purpose stain for visualizing spots on thin-layer chromatography plates. This stain yields a range of colors for these different components. Vanillin–HCl staining can be used to visualize the localisation of tannins in cells. Vanillin is becoming a popular choice for the development of bio-based plastics. === Manufacturing === Vanillin has been used as a chemical intermediate in the production of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other fine chemicals. In 1970, more than half the world's vanillin production was used in the synthesis of other chemicals. As of 2016, vanillin uses have expanded to include perfumes, flavoring and aromatic masking in medicines, various consumer and cleaning products, and livestock foods. == Adverse effects == Vanillin can trigger migraine headaches in a small fraction of the people who experience migraines. Some people have allergic reactions to vanilla. They may be allergic to synthetically produced vanilla but not to natural vanilla, or the other way around, or to both. Vanilla orchid plants can trigger contact dermatitis, especially among people working in the vanilla trade if they come into contact with the plant's sap. An allergic contact dermatitis called vanillism produces swelling and redness, and sometimes other symptoms. The sap of most species of vanilla orchid which exudes from cut stems or where beans are harvested can cause moderate to severe dermatitis if it comes in contact with bare skin. The sap of vanilla orchids contains calcium oxalate crystals, which are thought to be the main causative agent of contact dermatitis in vanilla plantation workers. A pseudophytodermatitis called vanilla lichen can be caused by flour mites (Tyroglyphus farinae). == Ecology == Scolytus multistriatus, one of the vectors of the Dutch elm disease, uses vanillin as a signal to find a host tree during oviposition. == See also == Phenolic compounds in wine Other positional isomers: Isovanillin ortho-Vanillin 2-Hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde 2-Hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde Benzaldehyde Protocatechuic aldehyde Syringaldehyde == References == == Notes ==",Vanillaldehyde,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.004151176195591688), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.008618593215942383), (' PERSONAL', -0.2531399130821228), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.003183182328939438), (' INDUSTR', -0.02632143348455429), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.001989767886698246), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.02976430207490921), ('ĠINDU', -0.014171558432281017), ('ST', -6.198863957251888e-06), ('RI', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('AL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12695671617984772)])","('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.01814994215965271), (' INDUSTR', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.findascent.com/ingredients/v/1684/vanillin.php,https://www.chembk.com/en/chem/Vanillaldehyde ', [])"

It is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist. It is given as an drops in the eye. It was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2010. It is available as a generic medication and as an over-the-counter medication. == Medical uses == Alcaftadine is indicated for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. == Pharmacology == Alcaftadine is an antagonist of histamine receptor 1. By blocking the receptor, alcaftadine has been shown to reduce itching and redness of the eyes, and to reduce recruitment of eosinophils after exposure to an allergen. Alcaftadine reduces the number of eosinophils compared to olopatadine 0.1%, and in animal models, alcaftadine 0.25% decreased the expression of the epithelial protein E-cadhedrin-1 compared to placebo. Reducing E-cadherin decreases junctions that lead to the progression of allergic conjunctivitis. == Adverse effects == In studies comparing the effectiveness of olopatadine to alcaftadine, there was not a dose-response increase of adverse effects as alcaftadine doses increases for 0.05% to 0.1% to 0.25%. The most common seen side effect of alcaftadine administration was irritation or a stinging sensation at the administration site. == Pharmacokinetics == Because alcaftadine is administered at low concentrations and at a local site (the eye), it appears to have minimal systemic effects, and the low absorption of alcaftadine results in minimal systemic accumulation. == History == When alcaftadine was tested against placebo and olopatadine, only alcaftadine 0.25% showed a clinically significant reduction in conjunctival redness scores 7 and 15 minutes after administration. Alcaftadine 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.25% all reduced lid swelling, conjunctival redness, and ocular itching/tearing compared to placebo. == Society and culture == === Economics === Allergan, Inc. began selling alcaftadine under the trade name Lastacaft after it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2010.

We replicated 26 signals and identified 10 new lead associations from previously reported loci. Rare-variant associations tended to be specific to populations, but even common-variant associations influencing smoking behavior, such as those with CHRNA5 and CYP2A6, showed population specificity. Fine-mapping and expression quantitative trait locus colocalization nominated several candidate variants and susceptibility genes such as IRF4 and FUBP1. DNA damage assays of prioritized genes in lung fibroblasts indicated that a subset of these genes, including the pleiotropic gene IRF4, potentially exert effects by promoting endogenous DNA damage. D-aspartate oxidase (DDO) and D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) are flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing flavoproteins that catalyze the oxidative deamination of D-amino acids. Unlike DAO, which acts on several neutral and basic D-amino acids, DDO is highly specific for acidic D-amino acids. Based on molecular modeling and simulated annealing docking analyses, a recombinant mouse DDO carrying two substitutions (Arg-216 to Leu and Arg-237 to Tyr) was generated (R216L-R237Y variant). This variant and two previously constructed single-point mutants of mouse DDO (R216L and R237Y variants) were characterized to investigate the role of Arg-216 and Arg-237 in the substrate specificity of mouse DDO. The R216L-R237Y and R216L variants acquired a broad specificity for several neutral and basic D-amino acids, and showed a considerable decrease in activity against acidic D-amino acids. The R237Y variant, however, did not show any additional specificity for neutral or basic D-amino acids and its activity against acidic D-amino acids was greatly reduced. The kinetic properties of these variants indicated that the Arg-216 residue is important for the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of mouse DDO. However, Arg-237 is, apparently, only marginally involved in substrate recognition, but is important for catalytic activity. Notably, the substrate specificity of the R216L-R237Y variant differed significantly from that of the R216L variant, suggesting that Arg-237 has subsidiary effects on substrate specificity. Additional experiments using several DDO and DAO inhibitors also suggested the involvement of Arg-216 in the substrate specificity and catalytic activity of mouse DDO and that Arg-237 is possibly involved in substrate recognition by this enzyme. Collectively, these results indicate that Arg-216 and Arg-237 play crucial and subsidiary role(s), respectively, in the substrate specificity of mouse DDO.",D 237,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.002054605633020401), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.02335282601416111)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/117237,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Fluoro-dasatinib,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Desoxymetasone,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Deschloro-Dasatinib-d7,https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Desoxymetasone-d3-21-Acetate ', [])"

It has been used in some forms of traditional medicine. == Preparation == Due to its poor solubility in water, piperine is typically extracted from black pepper by using organic solvents like dichloromethane. The amount of piperine varies from 1–2% in long pepper, to 5–10% in commercial white and black peppers. Piperine can also be prepared by treating the solvent-free residue from a concentrated alcoholic extract of black pepper with a solution of potassium hydroxide to remove resin (said to contain chavicine, an isomer of piperine). The solution is decanted from the insoluble residue and left to stand overnight in alcohol. During this period, the alkaloid slowly crystallizes from the solution. Piperine has been synthesized by the action of piperonoyl chloride on piperidine. == Reactions == Piperine forms salts only with strong acids. The platinichloride B4·H2PtCl6 forms orange-red needles (""B"" denotes one mole of the alkaloid base in this and the following formula). Iodine in potassium iodide added to an alcoholic solution of the base in the presence of a little hydrochloric acid gives a characteristic periodide, B2·HI·I2, crystallizing in steel-blue needles with melting point 145 °C. Piperine can be hydrolyzed by an alkali into piperidine and piperic acid. In light, especially ultraviolet light, piperine is changed into its isomers chavicine, isochavicine and isopiperine, which are tasteless. == History == Piperine was discovered in 1819 by Hans Christian Ørsted, who isolated it from the fruits of Piper nigrum, the source plant of both black and white pepper. Piperine was also found in Piper longum and Piper officinarum (Miq.) C. DC.

Removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. Furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide HNP-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against P. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. These data suggest that host-derived lipids contribute to mucosal defense. The emerging concept of host-derived antimicrobial lipids unveils novel roads to a better understanding of the immunology of infectious diseases. Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a critical step for atherogenesis, and the role of the 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) as well as LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) expressed in macrophages in this process has been suggested. The oxygenation of cholesteryl linoleate in LDL by mouse macrophage-like J774A.1 cells overexpressing 12/15-LOX was inhibited by an anti-LRP antibody but not by an anti-LDL receptor antibody. When the cells were incubated with LDL double-labeled by [3H]cholesteryl linoleate and [125I]apoB, association with the cells of [3H]cholesteryl linoleate expressed as LDL protein equivalent exceeded that of [125I]apoB, indicating selective uptake of [3H]cholesteryl linoleate from LDL to these cells. An anti-LRP antibody inhibited the selective uptake of [3H]cholesteryl ester by 62% and 81% with the 12/15-LOX-expressing cells and macrophages, respectively. Furthermore, addition of LDL to the culture medium of the [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled 12/15-LOX-expressing cells increased the release of [3H]cholesteryl linoleate to the medium in LDL concentration- and time-dependent manners. The transport of [3H]cholesteryl linoleate from the cells to LDL was also inhibited by an anti-LRP antibody by 75%. These results strongly suggest that LRP contributes to the LDL oxidation by 12/15-LOX in macrophages by selective uptake and efflux of cholesteryl ester in the LDL particle. This study examines the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated exchange of cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide (Ch18:2-OOH) and cholesteryl linoleate hydroxide (Ch18:2-OH) between low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL). When [3H]Ch18:2-OOH- and [3H]18:2-OH-labeled LDL were incubated at 37 degrees C for 0-24 h with unoxidized HDL and purified CETP, Ch18:2-OOH and Ch18:2-OH accumulated in the HDL. Similarly, when incubations were carried out with [3H]Ch18:2-OOH- and [3H]Ch18:2-OH-labeled HDL, unoxidized LDL, and CETP, Ch18:2-OOH and Ch18:2-OH accumulated in the LDL. Comparable results were obtained for the CETP-mediated transfer of [3H]Ch18:2-OH alone from LDL to HDL. Transfer to HDL of oxidized cholesteryl linoleate from [3H]Ch18:2-OOH- and [3H]Ch18:2-OH-labeled LDL was comparable to that of unoxidized cholesteryl linoleate (Ch18:2). However, the rate of transfer of [3H]Ch18:2-OOH and [3H]Ch18:2-OH from LDL to HDL increased linearly as the molar ratio of acceptor (HDL) to donor (oxidized LDL) particles in the incubation increased from 0.5:1 to 10:1. This increased rate of exchange was accompanied by an increased proportion of the oxidized Ch18:2 being present as the hydroxide rather than hydroperoxide. Further increases in the molar ratio of HDL to oxidized LDL particles neither affected the transfer rate nor the extent of reduction of Ch18:2-OOH to Ch18:2-OH. We therefore conclude that i) CETP mediates bidirectional transfers of Ch18:2-OOH and Ch18:2-OH between HDL and LDL; ii) CETP does not distinguish between Ch18:2-OOH, Ch18:2-OH, and Ch18:2 as it mediates their exchange between HDL and LDL; and iii) association with HDL hastens the reduction of Ch18:2-OOH to Ch18:2-OH.",Cholesteryl linoleate,PUBMED,"('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -0.0144045390188694), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('US', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS', [('EN', -0.020136572420597076), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -2.1934269170742482e-05), ('OUS', -2.145764938177308e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12694810330867767)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -7.73183855926618e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -2.7610454708337784e-05), (' FOOD', -3.547789674485102e-05)])","('INFO; ', [])"

These cellular mechanisms include excitotoxicity, calcium dysregulation, oxidative damage, ER stress and neuroinflammation. Recent data have identified a dual role in these events for glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, which are able both to induce and to protect against damage induced by diverse stresses. Cyclo(His-Pro), a cyclic dipeptide derived from the hydrolytic removal of the amino-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue of the hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone, may be important in regulating the nature of the glial cell contribution. Cyclo(His-Pro) is ubiquitous in the central nervous system and is a key substrate of organic cation transporters, which are strongly linked to neuroprotection. The cyclic dipeptide can also cross the brain-blood-barrier and, once in the brain, can affect diverse inflammatory and stress responses by modifying the Nrf2-NF-κB signaling axis. For these reasons, cyclo(His-Pro) has striking potential for therapeutic application by both parenteral and oral administration routes and may represent an important new tool in counteracting neuroinflammation-based degenerative pathologies. In this review, we discuss the chemistry and biology of cyclo(His-Pro), how it may interact with the biological mechanisms driving neurodegenerative disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and thereby act to preserve or restore neuronal function. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) have become the world's most common liver diseases, placing a growing strain on healthcare systems worldwide. Nonetheless, no effective pharmacological treatment has been approved. The naturally occurring compound cyclo histidine-proline (His-Pro) (CHP) is an interesting candidate for NAFLD management, given its safety profile and anti-inflammatory effects. Two different mouse models of liver disease were used to evaluate protective effects of CHP on disease progression towards fibrosis: a model of dietary NAFLD/NASH, achieved by thermoneutral housing (TN) in combination with feeding a western diet (WD), and liver fibrosis caused by repeated injections with carbon tetrachloride (CCl Treatment with CHP limited overall lipid accumulation, lowered systemic inflammation, and prevented hyperglycaemia. Histopathology and liver transcriptomics highlighted reduced steatosis and demonstrated remarkable protection from the development of inflammation and fibrosis, features which herald the progression of NAFLD. We identified the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway as an early mediator of the cellular response to CHP. CHP was active in both the preventive and therapeutic setting, reducing liver steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammation and improving several markers of liver disease. Considering the incidence and the lack of approved treatments, it is urgent to identify new strategies that prevent and manage NAFLD. CHP was effective in attenuating NAFLD progression in two animal models of the disease. Overall, our work points to CHP as a novel and effective strategy for the management of NAFLD, fuelling optimism for potential clinical studies. Cyclo(His-Pro) (CHP) is a cyclic dipeptide which is endowed with favorable pharmacokinetic properties combined with a variety of biological activities. CHP is found in a number of protein-rich foods and dietary supplements. While being stable at physiological pH, CHP can open yielding two symmetric dipeptides (His-Pro, Pro-His), the formation of which might be particularly relevant from dietary CHP due to the gastric acidic environment. The antioxidant and protective CHP properties were repeatedly reported although the non-enzymatic mechanisms were scantly investigated. The CHP detoxifying activity towards α,β unsaturated carbonyls was never investigated in detail, although its open dipeptides might be effective as already observed for histidine containing dipeptides. Hence, this study investigated the scavenging properties of TRH, CHP and its open derivatives towards 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. The obtained results revealed that Pro-His possesses a marked activity and is more reactive than l-carnosine. As investigated by DFT calculations, the enhanced reactivity can be ascribed to the greater electrophilicity of the involved iminium intermediate. These findings emphasize that the primary amine (as seen in l-carnosine) can be replaced by secondary amines with beneficial effects on the quenching mechanisms. Serum stability of the tested peptides was also evaluated, showing that Pro-His is characterized by a greater stability than l-carnosine. Docking simulations suggested that its hydrolysis can be catalyzed by serum carnosinase. Altogether, the reported results evidence that the antioxidant CHP properties can be also due to the detoxifying activity of its open dipeptides, which might be thus responsible for the beneficial effects induced by CHP containing food.",Cyclo(-his-pro),PUBMED,"('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.25493836402893066), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.22543783485889435), (',', -0.01105300523340702), (' MED', -1.0445127372804563e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.15810319781303406), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), (',', -0.0002109781780745834), ('ĠFOOD', -0.5764054656028748), (',', -0.2520151138305664), ('ĠEND', -0.008923768997192383), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005930095794610679)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0031806828919798136), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0788901224732399), (' FOOD', -3.8889261304575484e-06)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It is a third-generation retinoid. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 1999, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2001. It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Bexarotene is indicated for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in people who are refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (oral) and for the topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with CTCL who have refractory or persistent disease after other therapies or who have not tolerated other therapies (topical). It has been used off-label for non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. == Contraindications == Known contraindications include: == Adverse effects == Overall the most common adverse effects are skin reactions (mostly itchiness and rashes), leucopenia, headache, weakness, thyroid anomalies (which seem to be mediated by RXR-mediated downregulation of thyroid stimulating hormone) and blood lipid anomalies such as hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol) and hyperlipidaemia, hypothyroidism. == Interactions == Its plasma concentration may be increased by concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole. It may also induce CYP3A4, and hence CYP3A4 substrates like cyclophosphamide may have their plasma concentrations reduced. Likewise consumption of grapefruit juice might increase bexarotene's plasma concentrations, hence potentially altering its therapeutic effects. == Mechanism == Bexarotene is a retinoid that selectively activates retinoid X receptors (RXRs), as opposed to the retinoic acid receptors, the other major target of retinoic acid (the acid form of vitamin A). By so doing it induces cell differentiation and apoptosis and prevents the development of drug resistance. It also has anti-angiogenic effects and inhibits cancer metastasis. The retinoic acid receptors (RARs) regulate cell differentiation and proliferation whereas RXRs regulate apoptosis. == Physical properties == Bexarotene is a solid, white powder. It is poorly soluble in water; the solubility is estimated to be about 10-50 μM. It is soluble in DMSO at 65 mg/mL and in ethanol at 10 mg/mL with warming. == History == SRI International and the La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation (now the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute) collaborated on work that resulted in patent filings for the drug. The developer of bexarotene (brand name Targretin) was Ligand Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego biotech company which received FDA approval for the drug in 1999. The FDA approved bexarotene on 29 December 1999. Japanese pharmaceutical Eisai bought the rights to Targretin and three other anti-cancer products from Ligand in 2006. In the United States, patents on the drug expired in 2016. It received EMA approval on 29 March 2001. Early-stage preclinical studies suggested that bexarotene reduced amyloid plaques and improved mental functioning in a small sample of mice engineered to exhibit Alzheimer's-like symptoms although subsequent studies have yielded mixed results. The results of CCMR-One, a clinical trial of the effects of bexarotene on patients with multiple sclerosis operated by the University of Cambridge, have shown that the drug can cause remyelination, but will not lead to the drug being used as a therapy, due to its risk profile. == References == == External links == ""Bexarotene"".

It is often used together with the combination medication ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir specifically for hepatitis C virus (HCV) type 1. Ribavirin may also additionally be used. These combinations result in a cure in more than 90% of people. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include trouble sleeping, nausea, itchiness, and feeling tired. It is not recommended in those with liver failure but appears okay in people with kidney disease. While there is no evidence of harm if used during pregnancy, it has not been well studied. It should not be used with birth control pills that contain ethinylestradiol. Dasabuvir is in the HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor class of medication. Dasabuvir was approved for medical use in 2014. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only for use in combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. As of 2015, the ability to get these medications in many areas of the world is poor. == Medical uses == Dasabuvir is used in the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C infection. It is used in the following HCV subtypes: genotype 1a, genotype 1b, genotype 1 of unknown subtype, and genotype 1 mixed infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. In the European Union, dasabuvir (Exviera) is always used in combination with another medicine, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Viekirax) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus genotypes 1a and 1b. Some people taking dasabuvir are also treated with another antiviral medicine, ribavirin, in addition to ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. In the United States, dasabuvir is co-packaged with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Viekira Pak) and the combination is indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. The co-packaged dasabuvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is used in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. == Contraindications == People should not be taking dasabuvir if they meet any of the following criteria: They have a hypersensitivity to it or any of the substances in the tablet. They are taking any hormonal contraception that contain ethinylestradiol (often found in combined oral contraceptives or vaginal rings). They are also taking medications that are strong or moderate enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, mitotane, rifampicin, enzalutamide, and St. John's Wort (Hypercium perforatum). They are also taking medications that are strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (gemfibrozil). They meet contraindication criteria for ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir since dasabuvir is used in combination with those three medications. In October 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the manufacturer to add a warning to the drug label that hepatitis C treatments Viekira Pak and Technivie can cause serious liver injury mostly in people with underlying advanced liver disease. == Adverse effects == The FDA approved combination of dasabuvir used with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir in the product Viekira Pak can cause a number of adverse effects. When Viekira Pak was used without ribavirin, nausea, severe itching, and insomnia occurred in more than 5% of the subjects. Less commonly, patients experienced increases in liver enzymes, such as AST and ALT, to greater than five times the upper limit of normal (occurred in 1% of patients). Usually this was asymptomatic. However, this is notable because females who are taking ethinylestradiol are at an increased risk for this side effect (25%). Dasabuvir could cause hepatitis B re-activation in people co-infected with hepatitis B and C viruses. The European Medicines Agency recommended screening all people for hepatitis B before starting dasabuvir for hepatitis C in order to minimize the risk of hepatitis B reactivation. == Mechanism of action == Dasabuvir works by inhibiting the action of NS5B palm polymerase, effectively terminating RNA polymerization and stopping the replication of the HCV's genome. By blocking NS5B polymerase, the virus can no longer multiply and infect new cells. == History == The U.S. FDA approved regimen of ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir and dasabuvir on December 19, 2014, to be used in the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection in adults, which includes those with compensated cirrhosis. == Administration and storage == The two tablets of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir will be taken in the morning and the one dasabuvir tablet taken twice a day in the morning and in the evening with a meal.

This combination treatment is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor, though it now mainly serves to boost the potency of other protease inhibitors. It may also be used in combination with other medications to treat hepatitis C and COVID-19. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects of ritonavir include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and numbness of the hands and feet. Serious side effects include liver complications, pancreatitis, allergic reactions, and arrhythmias. Serious interactions may occur with a number of other medications including amiodarone and simvastatin. At low doses, it is considered to be acceptable for use during pregnancy. Ritonavir is of the protease inhibitor class. However, it is also commonly used to inhibit the enzyme that metabolizes other protease inhibitors. This inhibition allows lower doses of these latter medications to be used. Ritonavir was patented in 1989 and came into medical use in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ritonavir capsules were approved as a generic medication in the United States in 2020. == Medical uses == === HIV === Ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1-infected patients. Though initially developed as an independent antiviral treatment, it is most commonly used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, in order to increase the plasma concentrations of other antiretrovirals. Ritonavir is effective in preventing the replication of HIV-1. Protease inhibitors, including ritonavir, effectively block HIV-1 protease, a crucial enzyme in the reproductive cycle of HIV-1. === COVID-19 === Two SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors are prepackaged with ritonavir to enhance their blood concentration.

The co-packaged medications are sold under the brand name Paxlovid. Paxlovid is not authorized for the pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 or for initiation of treatment in those requiring hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19. On December 31, 2021, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved the same combination ""for people with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19"". In January 2023, simnotrelvir/ritonavir was conditionally approved by China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for COVID-19. === Other uses === The use of ritonavir as a CYP3A inhibitor is also seen in the Hepatitis C medication ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. == Side effects == When administered at the initially tested higher doses effective for anti-HIV therapy, the side effects of ritonavir are those shown below. === Adverse drug reactions === Ritonavir exhibits hepatic activity. It induces CYP1A2 and inhibits CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Concomitant therapy of ritonavir with a variety of medications may result in serious and sometimes fatal drug interactions. Due to it being a strong inhibitor (that causes at least a five-fold increase in the plasma AUC values, or more than 80% decrease in clearance) of both cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, ritonavir can severely potentiate and prolong the half-life and/or increase the blood concentration of phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, phenytoin, PDE5 inhibitors like sildenafil, opioids such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, pethidine and fentanyl, antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone, propafenone and disopyramide, immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus, voclosporin and sirolimus, neuroleptics like lurasidone and pimozide, as well as some chemotherapeutic agents, benzodiazepines and some ergot derivatives. The FDA has issued a boxed warning for this type of drug interactions. CYP3A4 inducers can counteract the inhibiting effects of ritonavir and lead to drastically reduced levels of ""boosted"" drugs, increasing the risk of developing drug resistance. Other CYP3A4 inhibitors may have an additive effect with ritonavir, causing increased drug levels. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Ritonavir was originally developed as an inhibitor of HIV protease, one of a family of pseudo-C2-symmetric small molecule inhibitors. Ritonavir is rarely used for its own antiviral activity but remains widely used as a booster of other protease inhibitors. More specifically, ritonavir is used to inhibit a particular enzyme, in intestines, liver, and elsewhere, that normally metabolizes protease inhibitors, cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4). The drug binds to and inhibits CYP3A4, so a low dose can be used to enhance other protease inhibitors. This discovery drastically reduced the adverse effects and improved the efficacy of protease inhibitors and HAART.. However, because of the general role of CYP3A4 in xenobiotic metabolism, dosing with ritonavir also affects the efficacy of numerous other medications, adding to the challenge of prescribing drugs concurrently. See § Adverse drug reactions above. === Pharmacokinetics === Ritonavir at a 200 mg dose reaches maximum plasma concentration in about 3 hours and has a half life of 3–4 hours. Importantly, the pharmacokinetics of Ritonavir are not linear—the half life increases at higher doses or under repeated dosing. For instance, the half life of a 500 mg tablet is 4–6 hours rather than 3–4 hours for a 200 mg tablet. The drug has high bioavailability but about 20% is lost due to first-pass metabolism. Rivonavir capsules are not absorbed as quickly as Ritonavir tablets and may exhibit different bioavailability. Ritonavir was demonstrated to have an in vitro potency of EC50=0.02 μM on HIV-1 protease and highly sustained concentration in plasma after oral administration in several species. == Chemistry == Ritonavir was initially derived from a moderately potent and orally bioavailable small molecule, A-80987. The P3 and P2′ heterocyclic groups of A-80987 were redesigned to create an analogue, now known as ritonavir, with improved pharmacokinetic properties to the original. Full details of the synthesis of ritonavir were first published by scientists from Abbott Laboratories. In the first step shown, an aldehyde derived from phenylalanine is treated with zinc dust in the presence of vanadium(III) chloride. This results in a pinacol coupling reaction which dimerizes the material to provide an intermediate which is converted to its epoxide and then reduced to (2S,3S,5S)-2,5-diamino-1,6-diphenylhexan-3-ol. Importantly, this retains the absolute stereochemistry of the amino acid precursor. The diamine is then treated sequentially with two thiazole derivatives, each linked by an amide bond, to provide ritonavir. == History == Ritonavir is sold as Norvir by AbbVie, Inc. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ritonavir on March 1, 1996, As a result of the introduction of ""highly active antiretroviral thearap[ies]"" the annual U.S. HIV-associated death rate fell from over 50,000 to about 18,000 over a period of two years. In 2014, the FDA approved a combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4. After the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020, many antivirals, including protease inhibitors in general and ritonavir in particular, were repurposed in an effort to treat the new infection. Lopinavir/ritonavir was found not to work in severe COVID-19. Virtual screening followed by molecular dynamics analysis predicted ritonavir blocks the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor, which is critical for the virus entry into human cells. Finally in 2021, a combination of ritonavir with nirmatrelvir, a newly developed orally active 3C-like protease inhibitor, was developed for the treatment of COVID-19. Ritonavir serves to slow down metabolism of nirmatrelvir by cytochrome enzymes to maintain higher circulating concentrations of the main drug. In November that year, Pfizer announced positive phase 2/3 results, including 89% reduction in hospitalizations when given within three days after symptom onset. == Polymorphism and temporary market withdrawal == Ritonavir was originally dispensed as a capsule that did not require refrigeration. This contained a crystal form of ritonavir that is now called form I. However, like many drugs, crystalline ritonavir can exhibit polymorphism, i.e., the same molecule can crystallize into more than one crystal type, or polymorph, each of which contains the same repeating molecule but in different crystal packings/arrangements. The solubility and hence the bioavailability can vary in the different arrangements, and this was observed for forms I and II of ritonavir. During development—ritonavir was introduced in 1996—only the crystal form now called form I was found; however, in 1998, a lower free energy, more stable polymorph, form II, was discovered. This more stable crystal form was less soluble, which resulted in significantly lower bioavailability. The compromised oral bioavailability of the drug led to temporary removal of the oral capsule formulation from the market. As a consequence of the fact that even a trace amount of form II can result in the conversion of the more bioavailable form I into form II, the presence of form II threatened the ruin of existing supplies of the oral capsule formulation of ritonavir; and indeed, form II was found in production lines, effectively halting ritonavir production. Abbott (now AbbVie) withdrew the capsules from the market, and prescribing physicians were encouraged to switch to a Norvir suspension. It has been estimated that Abbott lost more than US$250 million as a result, and the incident is often cited as a high-profile example of disappearing polymorphs. The company's research and development teams ultimately solved the problem by replacing the capsule formulation with a refrigerated gelcap. In 2000, Abbott (now AbbVie) received FDA-approval for a tablet formulation of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) which contained a preparation of ritonavir that did not require refrigeration. Ritonavir tablets produced in a solid dispersion by melt-extrusion was found to remain in form I, and was re-introduced commercially in 2010. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2003, Abbott (AbbVie, Inc.) raised the price of a Norvir course from US$1.71 per day to US$8.57 per day, leading to claims of price gouging by patients' groups and some members of Congress. Consumer group Essential Inventions petitioned the NIH to override the Norvir patent, but the NIH announced on August 4, 2004, that it lacked the legal right to allow generic production of Norvir. == References == == Further reading ==",Norvir,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.823885577323381e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0007165487040765584)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir,https://www.drugs.com/norvir.html,https://www.iapac.org/fact-sheet/ritonavir-norvir/ ', [])"
2454,"('Sulfasalazine', 'Salicylazosulfapyridine', 'Azulfidine', 'Salazosulfapyridine', 'Sulphasalazine')",Medical,"Sulfasalazine, sold under the brand name Azulfidine among others, is a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. It is considered by some to be a first-line treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. It is taken by mouth or can be administered rectally. Significant side effects occur in about 25% of people. Commonly these include loss of appetite, nausea, headache, and rash. Severe side effects include bone marrow suppression, liver problems, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and kidney problems. It should not be used in people allergic to aspirin or sulfonamide. Use during pregnancy appears to be safe for the baby. Sulfasalazine is in the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) family of medications. It is unclear exactly how it works. One proposed mechanism is the inhibition of prostaglandins, resulting in local anti-inflammatory effects in the colon. The medication is broken down by intestinal bacteria into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. Sulfasalazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1950. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Sulfasalazine is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 284th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Sulfasalazine is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is also indicated for use in rheumatoid arthritis and used in other types of inflammatory arthritis (e.g. psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis). It is usually not given to children under two years of age. == Side effects == Use of sulfasalazine is contraindicated in people with sulfa allergies and in those with urinary tract obstructions, intestinal obstructions, and severe liver or kidney problems. Sulfasalazine metabolizes to sulfapyridine. Serum levels should be monitored every three months, and more frequently at the outset. Serum levels above 50 μg/L are associated with side effects. In rare cases, sulfasalazine can cause severe depression in young males. It can also cause oligospermia and temporary infertility. Immune thrombocytopenia has been reported. Sulfasalazine inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, and can cause folate deficiency and megaloblastic anemia. and various other undesirable effects. Sulfasalazine can cause hemolytic anemia in people with G6PD deficiency. Sulfasalazine can cause kidney stones. Sulfasalazine may cause stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness, or unusual tiredness. Skin and urine can become orange, with occasional allergic reactions. Sulfasalazine may cause sulfhemoglobinemia. == Pharmacology == Around 90% of a dose of sulfasalazine reaches the colon, where most of it is metabolized by bacteria into sulfapyridine and mesalazine (also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA). Both metabolites are active; most of the sulfapyridine is absorbed and then further metabolized, but most mesalazine is not, and remains in the colon. A mix of unchanged, hydroxylated, and glucuronidated sulfapyridine is eliminated in urine, as is acetylated mesalazine and unmetabolized sulfasalazine. The mechanism of action is not clear, but it appears that sulfasalazine and its metabolites have immunosuppressive, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. It also appears to inhibit the cystine-glutamate antiporter, as well as sepiapterin reductase. == Chemistry == It is a codrug which is a combination of sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid coupled with an azo linkage. == Cost == In people with rheumatoid arthritis, the cost-effectiveness of sulfasalazine is improved by combining it with other drugs. It is commonly used in treating inflammatory bowel disease in part due to its cost effectiveness. == Research == Sulfasalazine has been studied in cirrhosis, psoriasis, idiopathic urticaria, and amyloidosis. == References ==",Sulphasalazine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.437280717364047e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002728328399825841)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;  ', [])"

2456,"('Natamycin', 'Pimaricin', 'Mycophyt', 'Synogil', 'Tennecetin')",Medical,"Natamycin, also known as pimaricin, is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections around the eye. This includes infections of the eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea. It is used as eyedrops. Natamycin is also used in the food industry as a preservative. Allergic reactions may occur. It is unclear if medical use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It is in the macrolide and polyene families of medications. It results in fungal death by altering the cell membrane. Natamycin was discovered in 1955 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is produced by fermentation of certain types of the bacterium Streptomyces. == Uses == === Medical === Natamycin is used to treat fungal infections, including Candida, Aspergillus, Cephalosporium, Fusarium, and Penicillium. It is applied topically as a cream, in eye drops, or (for oral infections) in a lozenge. Natamycin shows negligible absorption into the body when administered in these ways. When taken orally, little or none is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, making it inappropriate for systemic infections. Natamycin lozenges are used by veterinarians for oral thrush. === Food === Natamycin has been used for decades in the food industry as a hurdle to fungal outgrowth in dairy products and other foods. Potential advantages for the usage of natamycin might include the replacement of traditional chemical preservatives, a neutral flavor impact, and less dependence on pH for efficacy, as is common with chemical preservatives. It can be applied in a variety of ways: as an aqueous suspension (such as mixed into a brine) sprayed on the product or into which the product is dipped, or in powdered form (along with an anticaking agent such as cellulose) sprinkled on or mixed into the product. Natamycin is approved for various dairy applications in the United States. More specifically, natamycin is commonly used in products such as cream cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, shredded cheeses, cheese slices, and packaged salad mixes. One of the reasons for food producers to use natamycin is to replace the artificial preservative sorbic acid. Natamycin is also known to diffuse slower and lesser into cheese when compared to sorbate, which could otherwise cause undesirable changes to the flavor. As a food additive, it has E number E235. Throughout the European Union, it is approved only as a surface preservative for certain cheese and dried sausage products. It must not be detectable 5 mm below the rind. While natamycin is approved in different applications at different levels in the world, it is approved in over 150 countries worldwide. While not currently approved for use on meats in the United States, some countries allow natamycin to be applied to the surface of dry and fermented sausages to prevent mold growth on the casing. Sausages that contain cheese, even in countries that don't allow its use on meats, may contain and list natamycin as an ingredient. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) panel took over the responsibilities of providing scientific food safety advice to the EU from the Scientific Committee on Food in 2002. In 2009, the EFSA considered the proposed use levels of natamycin are safe if it is used for the surface treatment for these cheese and sausage types. == Safety == Natamycin does not have acute toxicity. In animal studies, the lowest LD50 found was 2.5–4.5 g/kg. In rats, the LD50 is ≥2300 mg/kg, and doses of 500 mg/kg/day over two years caused no detectable differences in survival rate, growth, or incidence of tumors. The metabolites of natamycin also lack toxicity. The breakdown products of natamycin under various storage conditions may have a lower LD50 than natamycin, but in all cases, the numbers are quite high. In humans, a dose of 500 mg/kg/day repeated over multiple days caused nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. No evidence shows natamycin, at either pharmacological levels or levels encountered as a food additive, can harm normal intestinal flora, but definitive research may not be available. However, some people are allergic to natamycin. The EFSA has concluded that the use of natamycin as a food additive has no relevant risk for the development of resistant fungi. == Mechanism of action == Natamycin inhibits the growth of fungi by specifically binding to ergosterol present in fungal cell membranes. Natamycin inhibits amino acid and glucose transport proteins leading to a loss of nutrient transport across the plasma membrane. While this binding is reversible, ergosterol binding acts as a universal mechanism of fungal inhibition, allowing natamycin to act on diverse fungal pathogens from Saccharomyces yeast to Aspergillus moulds. Natamycin is unique amongst related antifungals specifically because it does not directly cause membrane permeabilization. Structurally-related antibiotics with similar binding properties are thought to produce hydrophilic channels that allow leakage of potassium and sodium ions from the cell. Natamycin has very low solubility in water; however, natamycin is effective at very low levels. Its minimum inhibitory concentration is less than 10 ppm for most molds. == Biochemistry == Natamycin is produced as a secondary metabolite by some Streptomyces species: S. natalensis, S. lydicus, S. chattanoogensis and S. gilvosporeus. Structurally, its core is a macrolide containing a polyene segment, with carboxylic acid and mycosamine groups attached. As with other polyene antimycotics, the biosynthesis begins with a series of polyketide synthase modules, followed by additional enzymatic processes for oxidation and attachment of the substituents. Natamycin is produced on an industrial scale by fermentation of various Streptomyces strains, including S. chattanoogensis L10. == History == Natamycin was first isolated in 1955 from fermentation broth of a Streptomyces natalensis cell culture. It was originally named pimaricin to honor Pietermaritzburg, where Streptomyces natalensis was acquired. Pimaricin was later renamed after the World Health Organization (WHO) mandated that antibiotics produced by Streptomyces end in –mycin. The name natamycin was chosen in reference to the natalensis species name. == Society and culture == Natamycin appears on Whole Foods' ""Unacceptable Ingredients for Food"" list. == References ==",Pimaricin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -9.615255839889869e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.0032841814681887627), ('ICAL', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -6.079655122448457e-06), ('ĠFOOD', -2.062299427052494e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005267550237476826)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.005233763717114925), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -5.836499985889532e-05)])","('MEDICAL, FOOD; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natamycin,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4700089/,https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/3255 ', [])"
2457,"('Nikethamide', 'N,n-diethylnicotinamide', 'Nicethamide', 'Anacardone', 'Coramine')",Medical,"Nikethamide is a stimulant which mainly affects the respiratory cycle. Widely known by its former trade name of Coramine, it was used in the mid-twentieth century as a medical countermeasure against tranquilizer overdoses, before the advent of endotracheal intubation and positive-pressure lung expansion. It is no longer commonly considered to be of value for such purposes. In alternate terminology, it is known as nicotinic acid diethylamide, which meaningfully emphasizes its laboratory origins, and of which its common name is derived as a blend. == Uses == It is useful for mountain climbers to increase endurance at high altitudes. === Available forms === It is available as a short-acting over-the-counter drug in several South American and European countries, combined with glucose in form of lozenges. == Contraindications == Contraindications include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and epilepsy. == Society and culture == Coramine was used by suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams when treating patient Gertrude Hullett, whom he was suspected of murdering. However, the toxicity of nikethamide is quite low (LD50 rabbits 650 mg/kg oral, LD50 rats 240 mg/kg subcutaneous). Theodor Morell, Adolf Hitler's personal physician, would inject the German ruler with Coramine when Hitler was unduly sedated with barbiturates. In addition, Morell would use Coramine as part of an all-purpose ""tonic"" for Hitler. === Use in sports === In some sports, nikethamide is listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as a banned substance. Jaime Huélamo was stripped of his bronze medal at the 1972 Olympic individual cycling road race after testing positive for Coramine. Croatian tennis player Marin Čilić was suspended from competition for nine months after he tested positive for nikethamide in April 2013. This ban was later reduced to four months after Cilic appealed and claimed he had unintentionally ingested it in a glucose tablet bought at a pharmacy. Polish kart driver Igor Walilko was given a two-year ban, later reduced to eighteen months, from competition in 2010 due to testing positive for nikethamide after a win in Germany in July, 2010.

2458,"('Salbutamol (hemisulfate)', 'Albuterol (hemisulfate)', 'Salbutamol', 'Albuterol', 'Proventil')",Medical,"Salbutamol, also known as albuterol and sold under the brand name Ventolin among others, is a medication that opens up the medium and large airways in the lungs. It is a short-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist that causes relaxation of airway smooth muscle. It is used to treat asthma, including asthma attacks and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It may also be used to treat high blood potassium levels. Salbutamol is usually used with an inhaler or nebulizer, but it is also available in a pill, liquid, and intravenous solution. Onset of action of the inhaled version is typically within 15 minutes and lasts for two to six hours. Common side effects include shakiness, headache, fast heart rate, dizziness, and feeling anxious. Serious side effects may include worsening bronchospasm, irregular heartbeat, and low blood potassium levels. It can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but safety is not entirely clear. Salbutamol was patented in 1966 in Britain and became commercially available in the UK in 1969. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Salbutamol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the seventh most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 59 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Salbutamol is typically used to treat bronchospasm (due to any cause—allergic asthma or exercise-induced), as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is also one of the most common medicines used in rescue inhalers (short-term bronchodilators to alleviate asthma attacks). As a β2 agonist, salbutamol also has use in obstetrics. Intravenous salbutamol can be used as a tocolytic to relax the uterine smooth muscle to delay premature labor. While preferred over agents such as atosiban and ritodrine, its role has largely been replaced by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, which is more effective and better tolerated. Salbutamol has been used to treat acute hyperkalemia, as it stimulates potassium flow into cells, thus lowering the potassium in the blood. Two recent studies have suggested that salbutamol reduces the symptoms of newborns and adolescents with myasthenia gravis and transient neonatal myasthenia gravis. == Adverse effects == The most common side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other symptoms may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances of sleep and behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with kidney failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives. Salbutamol metered dose inhalers have been described as the ""single biggest source of carbon emissions from NHS medicines prescribing"" due to the propellants used in the inhalers. Dry powder inhalers are recommended as a low-carbon alternative. == Pharmacology == The tertiary butyl group in salbutamol makes it more selective for β2 receptors, which are the predominant receptors on the bronchial smooth muscles. Activation of these receptors causes adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP, beginning the signalling cascade that ends with the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation and lowering the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (myosin phosphorylation and calcium ions are necessary for muscle contractions). The increase in cAMP also inhibits inflammatory cells in the airway, such as basophils, eosinophils, and most especially mast cells, from releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Salbutamol and other β2 receptor agonists also increase the conductance of channels sensitive to calcium and potassium ions, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles. Salbutamol is either filtered out by the kidneys directly or is first metabolized into the 4′-O-sulfate, which is excreted in the urine. == Chemistry == Salbutamol is sold as a racemic mixture. The (R)-(−)-enantiomer (CIP nomenclature) is shown in the image at right (top), and is responsible for the pharmacologic activity; the (S)-(+)-enantiomer (bottom) blocks metabolic pathways associated with elimination of itself and of the pharmacologically active enantiomer (R). The slower metabolism of the (S)-(+)-enantiomer also causes it to accumulate in the lungs, which can cause airway hyperreactivity and inflammation. Potential formulation of the R form as an enantiopure drug is complicated by the fact that the stereochemistry is not stable, but rather the compound undergoes racemization within a few days to weeks, depending on pH. The direct separation of Salbutamol enantiomers and the control of enantiomeric purity has been described by thin-layer chromatography. == History == Salbutamol was discovered in 1966, by a research team led by David Jack at the Allen and Hanburys laboratory (now a subsidiary of Glaxo) in Ware, Hertfordshire, England, and was launched as Ventolin in 1969. The 1972 Munich Olympics were the first Olympics where anti-doping measures were deployed, and at that time β2 agonists were considered to be stimulants with high risk of abuse for doping. Inhaled salbutamol was banned from those games, but by 1986 was permitted (although oral β2 agonists were not). After a steep rise in the number of athletes taking β2 agonists for asthma in the 1990s, Olympic athletes were required to provide proof that they had asthma in order to be allowed to use inhaled β2 agonists. In February 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first generic of an albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in people four years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in people four years of age and older. The FDA granted approval of the generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to Perrigo Pharmaceutical. In April 2020, the FDA approved the first generic of Proventil HFA (albuterol sulfate) metered dose inhaler, 90 μg per inhalation, for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients four years of age and older who have reversible obstructive airway disease, as well as the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in this age group. The FDA granted approval of this generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to Cipla Limited. == Society and culture == In 2020, generic versions were approved in the United States. === Names === Salbutamol is the international nonproprietary name (INN) while albuterol is the United States Adopted Name (USAN). The drug is usually manufactured and distributed as the sulfate salt (salbutamol sulfate). It was first sold by Allen & Hanburys (UK) under the brand name Ventolin, and has been used for the treatment of asthma ever since. The drug is marketed under many names worldwide. === Misuse === Albuterol and other beta-2 adrenergic agonists are used by some recreational bodybuilders. === Doping === As of 2011 there was no evidence that an increase in physical performance occurs after inhaling salbutamol, but there are various reports for benefit when delivered orally or intravenously. In spite of this, salbutamol required ""a declaration of Use in accordance with the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions"" under the 2010 WADA prohibited list. This requirement was relaxed when the 2011 list was published to permit the use of ""salbutamol (maximum 1600 micrograms over 24 hours) and salmeterol when taken by inhalation in accordance with the manufacturers' recommended therapeutic regimen."" Abuse of the drug may be confirmed by detection of its presence in plasma or urine, typically exceeding 1,000 ng/mL. The window of detection for urine testing is on the order of just 24 hours, given the relatively short elimination half-life of the drug, estimated at between 5 and 6 hours following oral administration of 4 mg. == Research == Salbutamol has been studied in subtypes of congenital myasthenic syndrome associated with mutations in Dok-7. It has also been tested in a trial aimed at treatment of spinal muscular atrophy; it is speculated to modulate the alternative splicing of the SMN2 gene, increasing the amount of the SMN protein, the deficiency of which is regarded as a cause of the disease. Albuterol increases energy expenditure by 10-15 percent at a therapeutic dose for asthma and around 25 percent at a higher, oral dose. In several human studies, albuterol increased lean body mass, reduced fat mass, and caused lipolysis; it has been studied for use as an anti-obesity and anti-muscle wasting medication when taken orally. == Veterinary use == Salbutamol's low toxicity makes it safe for other animals and thus is the medication of choice for treating acute airway obstruction in most species. It is usually used to treat bronchospasm or coughs in cats and dogs and used as a bronchodilator in horses with recurrent airway obstruction; it can also be used in emergencies to treat asthmatic cats. Toxic effects require an extremely high dose, and most overdoses are due to dogs chewing on and puncturing an inhaler or nebulizer vial. == References ==",Proventil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.366862701019272e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015460216673091054)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com/proventil.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=78, start_index=9, title='Proventil HFA (Inhaler) Uses, Dosage & Side Effects - Drugs.com', type='url_citation', url='https://www.drugs.com/proventil.html?utm_source=openai')])"

A new drug application for avibactam in combination with ceftazidime was approved by the FDA in 2015 for treating complicated urinary tract (cUTI) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including those caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Increasing resistance to cephalosporins among Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, especially among hospital-acquired infections, results in part from the production of β-lactamase enzymes that deactivate these antibiotics. While the co-administration of a β-lactamase inhibitor can restore antibacterial activity to the cephalosporin, previously approved β-lactamase inhibitors such as tazobactam and clavulanic acid do not inhibit important classes of β-lactamases, including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs), New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), and AmpC-type β-lactamases. Whilst avibactam inhibits class A (KPCs, CTX-M, TEM, SHV), class C (AmpC), and some class D serine β-lactamases (such as OXA-23, OXA-48), it has been reported to be a poor substrate/weak inhibitor of class B metallo-β-lactamases, such as VIM-2, VIM-4, SPM-1, BcII, NDM-1, Fez-1. For infections sustained by metallo-β-lactamases producing bacteria, a therapeutic strategy consists in administering avibactam as companion drug administered alongside aztreonam. In fact, although in theory aztreonam is not hydrolyzed by metallo-β-lactamases, many metallo-β-Lactamases-producing strains co-produce enzymes that could hydrolyze aztreonam (e.g. AmpC, ESBL), therefore avibactam is given to protect aztreonam exploiting its robust β-lactamases inhibition.

The pro-drug Tamiflu is converted in the human body to the pharmacologically active metabolite, oseltamivir acid, with a yield of 75%. Oseltamivir acid is indirectly photodegradable and slowly biodegradable in sewage works and sediment/water systems. A previous environmental risk assessment has concluded that there is no bioaccumulation potential of either of the compounds. However, little was known about the ecotoxicity of the metabolite. Ester hydrolysis typically reduces the hydrophobicity and thus the toxicity of a compound. In this case, a zwitterionic, but overall neutral species is formed from the charged parent compound. If the speciation and predicted partitioning into biological membranes is considered, the metabolite may have a relevant contribution to the overall toxicity. These theoretical considerations triggered a study to investigate the toxicity of oseltamivir acid (OA), alone and in binary mixtures with its parent compound oseltamivir ethylester (OE). OE and OA were found to be baseline toxicants in the bioluminescence inhibition test with Vibrio fischeri. Their mixture effect lay between predictions for concentration addition and independent action for the mixture ratio excreted in urine and nine additional mixture ratios of OE and OA. In contrast, OE was an order of magnitude more toxic than OA towards algae, with a more pronounced effect when the direct inhibition of photosystem II was used as toxicity endpoint opposed to the 24h growth rate endpoint. The binary mixtures in this assay yielded experimental mixture effects that agreed with predictions for independent action. This is consistent with the finding that OE exhibits slightly enhanced toxicity, while OA acts as baseline toxicant. Therefore, with respect to mixture classification, the two compounds can be considered as acting according to different modes of toxic action, although there are indications that the difference is a toxicokinetic effect, not a true difference of mechanism of toxicity. The general mixture results illustrate the need to consider the role of metabolites in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals. However, in the concentration ratio of parent to metabolite excreted by humans, the experimental results confirm that the active metabolite does not significantly contribute to the risk quotient of the mixture.",Oseltamivir acid,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.06360658258199692), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.006449835374951363), ('ICAL', -2.0265558760002023e-06), (',', -0.47415584325790405), ('ĠEND', -0.3369666337966919), ('OG', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0015944637125357985)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oseltamivir,https://www.drugs.com/monograph/oseltamivir.html ', [])"
2463,"('Apabetalone',)",Medical,"Apabetalone (development codes RVX 208, RVX-208, and RVX000222) is an orally available small molecule created by Resverlogix Corp. that is being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the phase II clinical trial ASSURE in patients with angiographic coronary disease and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, apabetalone showed no greater increase in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) levels or incremental regression of atherosclerosis than administration of placebo, while causing a statistically significant greater incidence of elevated liver enzymes. However, pooled analysis of the effect of apabetalone in three phase II clinical trials ASSERT, ASSURE, and SUSTAIN demonstrated increases in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) levels, as well as decreases in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Reduction of MACE was more profound in patients with diabetes mellitus. In a short-term study in prediabetics, favorable changes in glucose metabolism were observed in patients receiving apabetalone. An international, multicenter phase III trial, “Effect of RVX000222 on Time to Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in High-Risk Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects with Coronary Artery Disease” (BETonMACE) commenced in October 2015. The trial is designed to determine whether apabetalone in combination with statins can decrease cardiac events compared to treatment with statins alone. == Mechanism of action == The molecular targets of apabetalone are bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) proteins, and in particular the BET family member BRD4. BET proteins, which contain two bromodomains, interact with acetylated lysines on histones bound to DNA to regulate gene transcription via an epigenetic mechanism. Apabetalone selectively binds to the second bromodomain (BD2). When apabetalone binds to BRD4, it impacts key biological processes that contribute to CVD such as cholesterol levels and inflammation. Apabetalone stimulates ApoA-I gene expression and production of the protein. ApoA-I is the main protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which can transfer cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaque in arteries to liver for excretion via the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway. This process is thought to stabilize the plaque to avoid coronary events. Clinical trials have shown apabetalone increases ApoA-I and HDL. Further, serum from individuals taking apabetalone had increased cholesterol efflux capacity, indicating the HDL generated in response to apabetalone functions in RCT. Inflammation is also a major contributor to atherosclerosis and CVD. Both ApoA-I induction and anti-inflammatory effects are common properties of BET inhibitors. In clinical trials, more favorable effects of apabetalone on coronary disease progression have been observed in patients with elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Apabetalone was also reported to reduce inflammation in pre-clinical models. Subsequent research showed apabetalone targets multiple processes that underlie CVD. The impact on any of these pathways, independently or cumulatively, may contribute to the lower incidence of MACE observed in clinical trials. == References ==",Apabetalone,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.427741704508662e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001958001870661974)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apabetalone?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Apabetalone', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apabetalone?utm_source=openai')])"

The values of Hill equation parameters have been estimated and used for calculation of intrinsic Gibbs free energy of binding. The results have been interpreted in terms of structural viewpoint of GOD and nature of interactions in the solution. The interpretations are in good agreement with denaturation experiment. Activity measurements represent the significant activation of enzyme due to binding of first CPC molecules. However, the binding of subsequent CPC diminished the activity of enzyme which may be due to the binding of second CPC to enzyme active site.

2469,"('Methoprene', 'Diacon', 'Dianex', 'Juvemon', 'Pharoid')",Medical,"Methoprene is a juvenile hormone (JH) analog and insect growth regulator (IGR) used widely in pest control. Classified under Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) group 7A, methoprene is an amber-colored liquid with a faint fruity odor. Unlike conventional pesticides that kill insects through toxicity, Methoprene disrupts the development of insects, preventing them from reaching reproductive maturity. Methoprene does not kill insects. Instead, it interferes with an insect’s life cycle and prevents it from reaching maturity or reproducing. Methoprene functions by mimicking natural juvenile hormones necessary for insect development. Insects treated with methoprene fail to transition from pupa stages to adulthood, effectively halting reproduction and the biological life cycle. Methoprene is considered a biological pesticide because rather than controlling target pests through direct toxicity, methoprene interferes with an insect’s lifecycle and prevents it from reaching maturity or reproducing. == Applications == Public Health: Methoprene is frequently employed in mosquito control programs to curb the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever, malaria. and the West Nile virus. Its larvicidal activity targets immature mosquito stages, breaking the insect's lifecycle. Recent studies on the granular formulation OmniPrene™ G demonstrated over 90% inhibition of adult mosquito emergence for up to 63 days depending on water depth and mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti, Anopheles hermsi, and Culex quinquefasciatus. Agriculture: Methoprene is applied to protect a range of food commodities such as meat, milk, mushrooms, peanuts, rice, and cereals. In cattle farming, it serves as a feed additive to prevent the breeding of flies in manure. Veterinary Use: Methoprene is a common ingredient in flea control products for domestic animals, aiding in the suppression of flea populations on pets. Water Treatment: Methoprene is added to water storage systems to combat mosquito larvae, making it a crucial tool for public health initiatives in areas prone to mosquito-borne illnesses. == Formulations and Efficacy == Methoprene is available in various formulations, including microencapsulated suspensions, granules, pellets, and briquets. The granular formulation OmniPrene™ G utilizes diatomaceous earth as a carrier, enhancing the delivery and stability of the active ingredient. This formulation allows for better vegetation penetration, reduced UV degradation, and improved persistence in aquatic environments. Laboratory and field evaluations have highlighted the efficacy of methoprene products. Against Aedes aegypti and Anopheles hermsi, OmniPrene™ G maintained over 90% control for at least 49 days in 30.5 cm of water. Efficacy was further extended to 63 days in shallower water depths of 15.25 cm. For Culex quinquefasciatus, control lasted up to 56 days. == Health and safety == According to its materials safety data sheet (MSDS), methoprene is a material that may be irritating to the mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract; may be harmful by inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption; may cause eye, skin, or respiratory system irritation; and is very toxic to aquatic life. The GHS signal word is ""Warning"", with notes such as ""P273: Avoid release into the environment"" and ""P391: Collect spillage"". Methoprene is suspected to be highly toxic to lobsters. Like insects and mites, lobsters are arthropods. == Conclusion == Methoprene continues to be a vital tool in pest management strategies across public health, agriculture, and veterinary sectors. Its innovative formulations, such as OmniPrene™ G, provide enhanced efficacy and extended residual control, making it a reliable option for controlling disease vectors and agricultural pests while maintaining a favorable environmental safety profile. Ongoing research and careful adherence to application protocols remain essential to maximize its benefits and mitigate potential environmental risks. == References == == External links == Methoprene Pesticide Fact Sheet - Environmental Protection Agency Methoprene Pesticide Information Profile - Extension Toxicology Network Methoprene in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)",Dianex,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.09203432500362396), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.10285632312297821), ('DU', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('AL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1290968656539917)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([1mg.com](https://www.1mg.com/drugs/dianex-50mg-tablet-410306?utm_source=openai), [drugs-about.com](https://drugs-about.com/drugs-d/dianex.html?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16114162/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=258, start_index=6, title='Dianex 50mg Tablet: View Uses, Side Effects, Price and Substitutes | 1mg', type='url_citation', url='https://www.1mg.com/drugs/dianex-50mg-tablet-410306?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=258, start_index=6, title='Dianex (Methoprene)', type='url_citation', url='https://drugs-about.com/drugs-d/dianex.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=258, start_index=6, title='Efficacy and tolerability of Dianex in Type 2 diabetes mellitus: a non randomized, open label non-comparative study - PubMed', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16114162/?utm_source=openai')])"
2470,"('Menthone', 'P-menthan-3-one', 'Cyclohexanone, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-', 'P-menthanone', '.alpha.-isomenthone')","Food, Medical","Menthone is a chemical compound of the monoterpene class of naturally occurring organic compounds found in a number of essential oils, one that presents with minty flavor. It is a specific pair of stereoisomers of the four possible such isomers for the chemical structure, 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanone. Of those, the stereoisoomer l-menthone—formally, the (2S,5R)-trans isomer of that structure, as shown at right—is the most abundant in nature. Menthone is structurally related to menthol, which has a secondary alcohol (>C-OH) in place of the carbon-oxygen double bond (carbonyl group) projecting from the cyclohexane ring. Menthone is obtained for commercial use after purifying essential oils pressed from Mentha species (peppermint and corn mint). It is used as a flavorant and in perfumes and cosmetics for its characteristic aromatic and minty aroma. == Occurrence == Menthone is a constituent of the essential oils of pennyroyal, peppermint, corn mint, pelargonium geraniums, and other plant species. In most essential oils, it is a minor component. Menthone was first synthesized by oxidation of menthol in 1881, before being found as a component in essential oils in 1891. Of the isomers possible for this chemical structure (see below), the one termed l-menthone—formally, the (2S,5R)-trans-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanone (see infobox and below)—is the most abundant in nature. == Physical and sensory properties == Menthone is a liquid under standard conditions, and has a density of 0.895 g/cm3. Under the same conditions, the melting point is −6 °C, and its boiling point is 207 °C. Menthone interacts cognitively with other components in food, drink, and other consumables, to present with what is termed a minty flavor. Pure l-menthone has been described as having an intensely minty clean aroma; in contrast, d-isomenthone has a ""green"" note, increasing levels of which are perceived to detract from the aroma quality of l-menthone. == Structure and stereochemistry == The structure of 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanone (menthones and isomenthones, see following) were established historically by establishing identity of natural and synthetic products after chemical synthesis of this structure from other chemical compounds of established structure; these inferential understandings have, in modern organic chemistry, been augmented by supporting mass spectrometric and spectroscopic evidence (e.g., from NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism) to make the conclusions secure. The structure 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanone has two asymmetric carbon centers, one at each attachment point of the two alkyl group substituents, the isopropyl in the 2-position and the methyl in the 5-position of the cyclohexane framework. The spatial arrangement of atoms—the absolute configuration—at these two points are designated by the descriptors R (Latin, rectus, right) or S (L., sinister, left) based on the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules. Hence, four unique stereoisomers are possible for this structure: (2S,5S), (2R,5S), (2S,5R) and (2R,5R). The (2S,5S) and (2R,5R) stereoisomers project the isopropyl and methyl groups from the same ""side"" of the cyclohexane ring, are the so-called cis isomers, and are termed isomenthone; the (2R,5S) and (2S,5R) stereoisomers project the two groups on the opposite side of the ring, are the so-called trans isomers, and are referred to as menthone. Because the (2S,5R) isomer has an observed negative optical rotation, it is called l-menthone or (−)-menthone. It is the enantiomeric partner of the (2R,5S) isomer: (+)- or d-menthone. === Interconversion === Menthone and isomenthone interconvert easily, the equilibrium favoring menthone; if menthone and isomenthone are equilibrated at room temperature, the isomenthone content will reach 29%. Menthone can easily be converted to isomenthone and vice versa via a reversible epimerization reaction via an enol intermediate, which changes the direction of optical rotation, so that l-menthone becomes d-isomenthone, and d-menthone becomes l-isomenthone. == Preparation and reactivity == Menthone is obtained commercially by fractional crystallization of the oils pressed from peppermint and cornmint, sp. Mentha. In the experimental laboratory, l-menthone may be prepared by oxidation of menthol with acidified dichromate. If the chromic acid oxidation is performed with stoichiometric oxidant in the presence of diethyl ether as co-solvent, a method introduced by H.C. Brown and colleagues in 1971, the epimerization of l-menthone to d-isomenthone is largely avoided. == History == Menthone was first described by Moriya in 1881. It was later synthesized by heating menthol with chromic acid, and its structure was later confirmed by synthesizing it from 2-isopropyl-5-methylpimelic acid. Menthone was one of the original substrates reported in the discovery of the still widely used synthetic organic chemistry transformation, the Baeyer-Villiger (B-V) oxidation, as reported by Adolf Von Baeyer and Victor Villiger in 1899; Baeyer and Villiger noted that menthone reacted with monopersulfuric acid to produce the corresponding oxacycloheptane (oxepane-type) lactone, with an oxygen atom inserted between the carbonyl carbon and the ring carbon attached to the isopropyl substituent. In 1889, Ernst Beckmann discovered that dissolving menthone in concentrated sulfuric acid gave a new ketonic material which gave an equal but opposite optical rotation to the starting material. Beckmann's inferences from his results situated menthone as a crucial player in a great mechanistic discovery in organic chemistry. Beckmann concluded that the change in structure underlying the observed opposite optical rotation was the result of an inversion of configuration at the asymmetric carbon atom next to the carbonyl group (which, at that time was believed to be the carbon atom attached to the methyl rather than the isopropyl group). He postulated that this occurred through an intermediate enol—a tautomer of the ketone—such that the original absolute configuration of that carbon atom changed as its geometry went from terahedral to trigonal planar. This report is an early example of an inference that an otherwise undetectable intermediate was involved in a reaction mechanism, one that could account for the observed structural outcome of the reaction. == See also == Piperitone Pulegone == Further reading == == References ==",Menthone,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -5.800739018013701e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' PERSONAL', -3.5716304410016164e-05), (' CARE', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.030376123264431953), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -6.12716976320371e-05), ('ĠPERSON', -0.00013195598148740828), ('AL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('ĠCARE', -1.3112935448589269e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.014166975393891335)])","('FOOD', [('FO', 0.0), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD,PERSONAL CARE;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menthone ', [])"

It is a less preferred treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include headache, increased urination, diarrhea, cough, and dizziness. Other side effects may include hearing loss and low blood potassium. Torasemide is a sulfonamide and loop diuretic. Use is not recommended in pregnancy or breastfeeding. It works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys. Torasemide was patented in 1974 and came into medical use in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 184th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == It is used to treat fluid overload due to heart failure. It is sometimes used to treat high blood pressure. Compared with furosemide, torasemide is associated with a lower risk of rehospitalization for heart failure and an improvement in New York Heart Association class of heart failure. In heart failure it may be safer and more effective than furosemide. Long-term outcomes with torasemide may be better than with furosemide in patients with heart failure. == Adverse effects == No evidence of torasemide-induced ototoxicity has been demonstrated in humans. Loop diuretics, including torsemide, may decrease total body thiamine, particularly in people with poor thiamine intake, and this depletion may worsen heart failure. It is therefore reasonable to either also give thiamine supplements or to check blood thiamine levels in those being treated with chronic loop diuretics. == Chemistry == Compared with other loop diuretics, torasemide has a more prolonged diuretic effect than equipotent doses of furosemide and relatively decreased potassium loss. == Names == Torasemide is the recommended name of the drug (rINN) according to the (INN), which is the drug naming system coordinated by the World Health Organization. Torsemide is the official name of the drug according to the (USAN), which is the drug naming system coordinated by the USAN Council, which is co-sponsored by the American Medical Association (AMA), the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA). == Veterinary uses == In May 2024, the US FDA conditionally approved the first torsemide animal medication for dogs.

Preliminary research suggests that it may possess certain antidementia properties in rats. == Effects == Nefiracetam's cytoprotective actions are mediated by enhancement of GABAergic, cholinergic, and monoaminergic neuronal systems. Preliminary studies suggest that it improves apathy and motivation in post-stroke patients. It may also exhibit antiamnesia effects for the Alzheimer's type and cerebrovascular type of dementia. In addition, research in animal models suggests antiamnesic effects against a number of memory impairing substances, including: ethanol, chlorodiazepoxide, scopolamine, bicuculline, picrotoxin, and cycloheximide. == Pharmacology == Unlike other racetams, nefiracetam shows high affinity for the GABAA receptor (IC50) = 8.5 nM), where it is presumed to be an agonist. It was able to potently inhibit 80% of muscimol binding to the GABAA receptor, although it failed to displace the remaining 20% of specific muscimol binding. Nefiracetam is able to reverse the amnesia caused by the GABAA receptor antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline in mice, although it failed to prevent seizures induced by these drugs. == Concerns == Studies of long-term consumption of nefiracetam in humans and primates have shown it to have no toxicity.

2474,"('Fasudil (hydrochloride)', 'Fasudil', 'Ha-1077', 'Ha 1077', 'At 877')",Medical,"Fasudil (INN) is a potent Rho-kinase inhibitor and vasodilator. Since it was discovered, it has been used for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm, which is often due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as to improve the cognitive decline seen in stroke patients. It has been found to be effective for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. It has been demonstrated that fasudil could improve memory in normal mice, identifying the drug as a possible treatment for age-related or neurodegenerative memory loss. It has been approved for use in Japan and China since 1995, but has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration or by the European Medicines Agency. Woolsey Pharmaceuticals is developing BRAVYL (oral fasudil) for various neurodegenerative diseases. == Molecular mechanism == Fasudil (HA-1077) is a selective RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. ROCK is an enzyme that plays an important role in mediating vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. ROCK induces vasoconstriction by phosphorylating the myosin-binding subunit of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase, thus decreasing MLC phosphatase activity and enhancing vascular smooth muscle contraction. === ACE expression === Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin-I (Ang-I) to angiotensin-II (Ang-II). Ang-II is a peptide hormone which increases blood pressure by initiating vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion. ROCK increases ACE expression and activity in pulmonary hypertension. By inhibiting ROCK with fasudil, circulating ACE and Ang-II are reduced, leading to a decrease in pulmonary vascular pressure. === eNOS expression === Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mediates the production of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Pulmonary arterial cell cultures treated with fasudil showed a significant increase in eNOS mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner, and the half-life of eNOS mRNA increased 2-folds. These findings suggested that ROCK inhibition with fasudil increases eNOS expression by stabilizing eNOS mRNA, which contributed to an increase of NO level to enhance vasodilation. === ERK activation === The proliferative effects of ROCK on vascular endothelial cells is due to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK mediates cell proliferation via the phosphorylation of p27Kip1, thus accelerating the degradation rate of p27Kip1. p27Kip1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor which down-regulates cell cycle by binding cyclin-CDK complex. Human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells treated with fasudil showed a decrease in cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Fasudil also decreases ERK activities, as well as increases level of p27Kip1. This suggested that the anti-proliferative effects of fasudil is due to the decrease of ERK activities via the inhibition of ROCK. === Direct inhibition of α-synuclein aggregation === In addition to ROCK inhibition, fasudil has also been demonstrated to directly modulate the aggregation of α-synuclein, both in vitro and in cellular models of neurodegenerative disease. Aggregation of α-synuclein is a major hallmark of Parkinson's disease, and has also been observed in other neurodegenerative diseases. Physical interactions between α-synuclein and fasudil have been shown to take place with α-synuclein in the intrinsically disordered state, which places fasudil among a small number of drug-like molecules that directly interact with intrinsically disordered proteins. == See also == Ripasudil, a fasudil derivative used to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension == References ==",Fasudil,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.271740287251305e-06), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.003183774882927537)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasudil?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=9, title='Fasudil', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasudil?utm_source=openai')])"

Phloretic acid, found in the rumen of sheep fed with dried grass, is produced by hydrogenation of the 2-propenoic side chain of p-coumaric acid. The enzyme, resveratrol synthase, also known as stilbene synthase, catalyzes the synthesis of resveratrol ultimately from a tetraketide derived from 4-coumaroyl CoA. p-Coumaric acid is a cofactor of photoactive yellow proteins (PYP), a homologous group of proteins found in many eubacteria. p-Coumaric acid is found as the base moiety of Caleicine, one of many sesquiterpenes in Calea ternifolia. == See also == o-coumaric acid m-coumaric acid Coumarin Coumaroyl-Coenzyme A Ferulic acid Cinnamic acid Phenolic content in wine p-Coumaroylated anthocyanins == References ==",P-cumaric acid,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -3.47626737493556e-05), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, ENDOGENOUS', [('FO', -0.0020958855748176575), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.31337571144104004), ('ĠEND', -0.2441907674074173), ('OG', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('EN', 0.0), ('OUS', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0040955008007586)])","('FOOD', [('FO', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('OD', 0.0)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.benthamscience.com/article/126952,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6720745/,https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Medicine_and_healthcare/Pharmaceutical_medicine/P-Coumaric_acid/ ', [])"
2476,"('Pyridoxal phosphate', 'Pyridoxal 5‚ä≤-phosphate', 'Pyridoxyl phosphate', 'Codecarboxylase', ""Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate"")","Endogenous, Medical","Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, P5P), the active form of vitamin B6, is a coenzyme in a variety of enzymatic reactions. The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has catalogued more than 140 PLP-dependent activities, corresponding to ~4% of all classified activities. The versatility of PLP arises from its ability to covalently bind the substrate, and then to act as an electrophilic catalyst, thereby stabilizing different types of carbanionic reaction intermediates. == Role as a coenzyme == PLP acts as a coenzyme in all transamination reactions, and in certain decarboxylation, deamination, and racemization reactions of amino acids. The aldehyde group of PLP forms a Schiff-base linkage (internal aldimine) with the ε-amino group of a specific lysine group of the aminotransferase enzyme. The α-amino group of the amino acid substrate displaces the ε-amino group of the active-site lysine residue in a process known as transaldimination. The resulting external aldimine can lose a proton, carbon dioxide, or an amino acid sidechain to become a quinonoid intermediate, which in turn can act as a nucleophile in several reaction pathways. In transamination, after deprotonation the quinonoid intermediate accepts a proton at a different position to become a ketimine. The resulting ketimine is hydrolysed so that the amino group remains on the complex. In addition, PLP is used by aminotransferases (or transaminases) that act upon unusual sugars such as perosamine and desosamine. In these reactions, the PLP reacts with glutamate, which transfers its alpha-amino group to PLP to make pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP). PMP then transfers its nitrogen to the sugar, making an amino sugar. PLP is also involved in various beta-elimination reactions such as the reactions carried out by serine dehydratase and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3-dehydratase (ColD). It is also active in the condensation reaction in heme synthesis. PLP plays a role in the conversion of levodopa into dopamine, facilitates the conversion of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and allows SAM to be decarboxylated to form propylamine, which is a precursor to polyamines. == Role in human body == Pyridoxal phosphate has numerous roles in human body. A few examples below: Metabolism and biosynthesis of serotonin. Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of aromatic L-amino acids decarboxylase. This allows for conversion of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) into serotonin (5-HT). This reaction takes place in serotonergic neurons. Metabolism and biosynthesis of histamine. Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of L-histidine decarboxylase. This allows for conversion of histidine into histamine. This reaction takes place in Golgi apparatus in mast cells and in basophils. Next, histamine is stored in granularity in mast cells as a complex with acid residues of heparin proteoglycan while in basophils as a complex with chondroitine sulfate. Metabolism and biosynthesis of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid). Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). This allows for conversion of glutamate into GABA. Reaction takes place in cytoplasm of termination of GABA-ergic neurons, therefore vitamin B6 deficiency may cause epileptic seizures in children. Pyridoxal phosphate also participates in the oxidative deamination of GABA, where it is a cofactor of GABA aminotransferase. Metabolism of ornithine. Pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor of ornithine carboxylase. Transamination. Pyridoxal phosphate takes part in decomposition and synthesis of amino acids, fats, and carbohydrates, and in the biosynthesis of hormones, neurotransmitters, and heme. == Non-classical examples of PLP == PLP is also found on glycogen phosphorylase in the liver, where it is used to break down glycogen in glycogenolysis when glucagon or epinephrine signals it to do so. However, this enzyme does not exploit the reactive aldehyde group, but instead utilizes the phosphate group on PLP to perform its reaction. Although the vast majority of PLP-dependent enzymes form an internal aldimine with PLP via an active site lysine residue, some PLP-dependent enzymes do not have this lysine residue, but instead have a histidine in the active site. In such a case, the histidine cannot form the internal aldimine, and, therefore, the co-factor does not become covalently tethered to the enzyme. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3-dehydratase (ColD) is an example of such an enzyme. Human Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 regulates one-carbon transfer reactions required for amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and exists in dimeric and tetrameric forms. The dimeric SHMT2 variant is a potent inhibitor of the BRISC deubiquitylase enzyme complex, which regulates immune-based cell signaling. Recent studies show that SJMT2 tetramerization is induced by PLP. This prevents interaction with the BRISC deubiqutylase complex, potentially linking vitamin B6 levels and metabolism to inflammation. == Catalytic mechanism == The pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes (PLP enzymes) catalyze myriad reactions. Although the scope of PLP-catalyzed reactions appears to be immense, the unifying principle is the formation of an internal lysine-derived aldimine. Once the amino substrate interacts with the active site, a new Schiff base is generated, commonly referred to as the external aldimine. After this step, the pathway for each PLP-catalyzed reactions diverge. == Specificity == Specificity is conferred by the fact that, of the four bonds of the alpha-carbon of the amino acid aldimine state, the bond perpendicular to the pyridine ring will be broken (Dunathan Stereoelectronic Hypothesis). Consequently, specificity is dictated by how the enzymes bind their substrates. An additional role in specificity is played by the ease of protonation of the pyridine ring nitrogen. == PLP-enzymes == PLP is retained in the active site not only thanks to the lysine, but also thanks to the interaction of the phosphate group and a phosphate binding pocket and to a lesser extent thanks to base stacking of the pyridine ring with an overhanging aromatic residue, generally tyrosine (which may also partake in the acid–base catalysis). Despite the limited requirements for a PLP binding pocket, PLP enzymes belong to only five different families. These families do not correlate well with a particular type of reaction. The five families are classified as fold types followed by a Roman numeral. Fold Type I — aspartate aminotransferase family Fold Type II — tryptophan synthase family Fold Type III — alanine racemase family (TIM-barrel) Fold Type IV — D-amino acid aminotransferase family Fold Type V — glycogen phosphorylase family == Biosynthesis == === From vitamers === Animals are auxotroph for this enzyme co-factor and require it or an intermediate to be supplemented, hence its classification as a vitamin B6, unlike MoCo or CoQ10 for example. PLP is synthesized from pyridoxal by the enzyme pyridoxal kinase, requiring one ATP molecule. PLP is metabolized in the liver. === Prototrophy === Two natural pathways for PLP are currently known: one requires deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), while the other does not, hence they are known as DXP-dependent and DXP-independent. These pathways have been studied extensively in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. Despite the disparity in the starting compounds and the different number of steps required, the two pathways possess many commonalities. ==== DXP-dependent biosynthesis ==== The DXP-dependent biosynthetic route requires several steps and a convergence of two branches, one producing 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate from erythrose 4-phosphate, while the other (single enzyme) producing deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate. The condensation product of 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate and deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate is pyridoxine 5'-phosphate. The condensation is catalyzed by PNP synthase, encoded by pdxJ, which creates PNP (pyridoxine 5' phosphate). The final enzyme is PNP oxidase (pdxH), which catalyzes the oxidation of the 4' hydroxyl group to an aldehyde using dioxigen, resulting in hydrogen peroxide. The first branch is catalyzed in E. coli by enzymes encoded by epd, pdxB, serC and pdxA. These share mechanistical similarities and homology with the three enzymes in serine biosynthesis (serA (homologue of pdxB), serC, serB — however, epd is a homologue of gap), which points towards a shared evolutionary origin of the two pathways. In several species there are two homologues of the E. coli serC gene, generally one in a ser operon (serC), and the other in a pdx operon, in which case it is called pdxF. A ""serendipitous pathway"" was found in an overexpression library that could suppress the auxotrophy caused by the deletion of pdxB (encoding erythronate 4 phosphate dehydrogenase) in E. coli. The serendipitous pathway was very inefficient, but was possible due to the promiscuous activity of various enzymes. It started with 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (the product of the serA-encoded enzyme in serine biosynthesis) and did not require erythronate-4-phosphate. 3PHP was dephosphorylated, resulting in an unstable intermediate that decarboxylates spontaneously (hence the presence of the phosphate in the serine biosynthetic pathway) to glycaldehyde. Glycaldehyde was condensed with glycine and the phosphorylated product was 4-phosphohydroxythreonine (4PHT), the canonical substrate for 4-PHT dehydrogenase (pdxA). ==== DXP-independent biosynthesis ==== The DXP-independent PLP-biosynthetic route consists of a step catalyzed by PLP-synthase, an enzyme composed of two subunits. PdxS catalyzes the condensation of ribulose 5-phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and ammonia, this latter molecules is produced by PdxT which catalyzes the production of ammonia from glutamine. PdxS is a (β/α)8 barrel (also known as a TIM-barrel) that forms a dodecamer. === Abiotic synthesis === The widespread utilization of PLP in central metabolism, especially in amino acid biosynthesis, and its activity in the absence of enzymes, suggests PLP may be a ""prebiotic"" compound—that is, one that predates the origin of organic life (not to be confused with prebiotic compounds, substances which serve as a food source for beneficial bacteria). In fact, heating NH3 and Glycolaldehyde spontaneously forms a variety of pyridines, including pyridoxal. Under certain conditions, PLP is formed from cyanoacetylene, diacetylene, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, water, and a phosphoric acid. == Inhibitors == Several inhibitors of PLP enzymes are known. One type of inhibitor forms an electrophile with PLP, causing it to irreversibly react with the active site lysine. Acetylenic compounds (e.g. propargylglycine) and vinylic compounds (e.g. vinylglycine) are such inhibitors. A different type of inhibitor inactivates PLP, and such are α-methyl and amino-oxy substrate analogs (e.g. α-methylglutamate). Still other inhibitors have good leaving groups that nucleophilically attack the PLP. Such is chloroalanine, which inhibits a large number of enzymes. Examples of inhibitors: Levothyroxine In rats given only 10 μg of D, L-thyroxine daily for 15 days, liver cysteine desulfhydrase activity disappears and serine and threonine dehydrase and alanine glutamate transaminase activities decrease about 40%. Either in vivo feeding of pyridoxal-5-phosphate or in vitro addition of the coenzyme to the liver preparations restores full activity to all these enzymes, and the slight in vitro inhibition in the presence of 10−5 M thyroxine is also reversed by pyridoxal-5-phosphate. The inactive form pyridoxine competitively inhibits the active pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. Consequently, symptoms of vitamin B6 supplementation in the pyridoxine form can mimic those of vitamin B6 deficiency; an effect which perhaps might be avoided by supplementing with P5P instead. AlaP (alanine phosphonate) inhibits alanine racemases, but its lack of specificity has prompted further designs of ALR inhibitors. Gabaculine and Vigabatrin inhibit GABA aminotransferase Canaline and 5-fluoromethylornithine inhibit ornithine aminotransferase Amino-oxy SAM inhibits ACC synthase == Evolution == Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (vitamin B6)-dependent enzymes have multiple evolutionary origins. The overall B6 enzymes diverged into four independent evolutionary lines: α family (i.e. aspartate aminotransferase), β family (serine dehydratase),D-alanine aminotransferase family and the alanine racemase family. An example of the evolutionary similarity in the Beta family is seen in the mechanism. The β enzymes are all lyases and catalyze reactions where Cα and Cβ participate. Overall, in the PLP-dependent enzymes, the PLP in every case is covalently attached via an imine bond to the amino group in the active site. == See also == Aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase Ornithine decarboxylase == References == == External links == A11HA06 (WHO)",Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate,WIKIPEDIA,"('FOOD', [('FO', -0.4489457905292511), ('OD', 0.0)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('EN', -0.793847918510437), ('DO', 0.0), ('GEN', -8.4638240878121e-06), ('OUS', -5.960462772236497e-07), (',', -0.006723282393068075), ('ĠFOOD', -0.014199530705809593), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.693270206451416)])","('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -2.9040898880339228e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', 0.0), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0007099286303855479), (' FOOD', -0.07903652638196945)])","('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE; https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/pyridoxal-5-phosphate/,https://foodb.ca/compounds/FDB021820 ', [])"
2477,"('(z)-orantinib', '(z)-su6668', '(z)-tsu-68', 'Orantinib', 'Su 6668')",Medical," Observations that Glioma-associated transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2 (Gli1/2), executers of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway and targets of the Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) signaling axis, are involved in numerous developmental and pathological processes unveil them as attractive pharmaceutical targets. Unc-51-like serine/threonine kinase Ulk3 has been suggested to play kinase activity dependent and independent roles in the control of Gli proteins in the context of the Shh signaling pathway. This study aimed at investigating whether the mechanism of generation of Gli1/2 transcriptional activators has similarities regardless of the signaling cascade evoking their activation. We also elucidate further the role of Ulk3 kinase in regulation of Gli1/2 proteins and examine SU6668 as an inhibitor of Ulk3 catalytic activity and a compound targeting Gli1/2 proteins in different cell-based experimental models. Here we demonstrate that Ulk3 is required not only for maintenance of basal levels of Gli1/2 proteins but also for TGF-β or Shh dependent activation of endogenous Gli1/2 proteins in human adipose tissue derived multipotent stromal cells (ASCs) and mouse immortalized progenitor cells, respectively. We show that cultured ASCs possess the functional Shh signaling axis and differentiate towards osteoblasts in response to Shh. Also, we demonstrate that similarly to Ulk3 RNAi, SU6668 prevents de novo expression of Gli1/2 proteins and antagonizes the Gli-dependent activation of the gene expression programs induced by either Shh or TGF-β. Our data suggest SU6668 as an efficient inhibitor of Ulk3 kinase allowing manipulation of the Gli-dependent transcriptional outcome.",(z)-su6668,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0067154900170862675), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.39925462007522583), ('ICAL', -1.7165990357170813e-05), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.2519744336605072)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.20143575966358185)])","('INFO; https://www.scbt.com/p/pdgfr-vegfr2-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor-5-br-su6668,https://www.scbt.com/p/su-6668-252916-29-3,https://www.cellgs.com/products/su6668.html,https://drugs.ncats.io/drug/9RL37ZZ665,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5403372/,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3844503/ ', [])"
