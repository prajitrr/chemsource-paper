A phase II randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 22-week study of immediate-release (IR) ralinepag safety and efficacy met its primary endpoint, significantly reducing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) compared with placebo. This phase II open-label extension (OLE) study assessed long-term safety and tolerability of ralinepag. Participants were eligible for the OLE if they completed the parent study or experienced a clinical worsening event while receiving placebo. Those previously receiving IR ralinepag remained on their current dose, and participants formerly administered placebo were titrated to the highest tolerated dose. Participants were transitioned to an extended-release ralinepag formulation toward the end of the OLE. The primary objective evaluated long-term safety and tolerability; secondary endpoints included changes in 6-min walk distance (6MWD), World Health Organization/New York Heart Association functional class, clinical worsening, and hemodynamic measures. In total, 45/61 participants enrolled in the OLE study, 30 from the IR ralinepag group and 15 from the placebo group. The most common adverse events (AEs) were known prostacyclin-related effects (e.g., headache, 64.4%; diarrhea, 37.8%; jaw pain, 33.3%). There was a notable decline in AEs after reaching and maintaining a stable dose. At month 24 after entering the OLE, 6MWD significantly increased by a mean of 36.3 m (P = 0.004) from OLE baseline, and most participants remained stable in their functional class (84.8%). Post-baseline PVR in 1 or 2 years decreased by a median of 52.2 dyn.s/cm Ralinepag produced sustained, durable improvements in 6MWD along with durable reductions in PVR and a manageable AE profile. Most participants continuing treatment with ralinepag maintained functional measures throughout the OLE and those switching from placebo to ralinepag often experienced functional improvements. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare disease caused by elevated pressure in the blood vessels connecting the heart to the lungs. A previous phase 2 study found that ralinepag significanlty reduced pulmonary vascular resistance (the force or resistance that blood encounters as it flows through the blood vessels in the lungs) compared with placebo. This clinical study of 45 patients investigated whether ralinepag was safe and effective for long-term use to treat people with pulmonary arterial hypertension. All participants received ralinepag twice daily until a new once daily pill was available later in the study. The primary endpoints were long-term safety and tolerability, and secondary endpoints included exercise capacity, impact on daily life (functional class), clinical worsening, and hemodynamic measures (metrics to measure how well the heart is working). The study found that ralinepag had a manageable side effect profile, with a decrease in side effects for patients who continued taking ralinepag over time. Moreover, the study showed that ralinepag improved the ability to exercise, maintained functional measures, and helped to reduce pressure in the blood vessels connecting the heart to the lungs over a 24-month period for participants with pulmonary arterial hypertension. This phase 2 study was designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of immediate-release orally administered ralinepag, a selective, non-prostanoid prostacyclin receptor agonist with a 24-h terminal half-life, compared to placebo in adult patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 61 PAH patients who were receiving standard care, including mono or dual PAH-targeted background therapy were randomised 2:1 to ralinepag (n=40) or placebo (n=21). The starting dose of ralinepag was 10 μg twice daily. Dosage was then up-titrated as tolerated over the course of the 9-week dose-titration period, to a maximum total daily dose of 600 μg (300 μg twice daily). The primary efficacy end-point was the absolute change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) from baseline to week 22. Additional end-points included percentage change in PVR from baseline, other haemodynamic parameters, 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and safety and tolerability. Ralinepag significantly decreased PVR by 163.9 dyn·s·cm Ralinepag reduced PVR compared with placebo in PAH patients on mono (41%) or dual combination (59%) background therapy.

Recently, there have been reports that SC-236 protects against cartilage damage in addition to reducing inflammation and pain in osteoarthritis. However, the mechanism involved in the inflammatory allergic reaction has not been examined. Mast cells accumulation can be related to inflammatory conditions, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of SC-236 on stem cell factor (SCF)-induced migration, morphological alteration, and cytokine production of rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs). We observed that SCF significantly induced the migration and morphological alteration. The ability of SCF to enhance migration and morphological alteration was abolished by treatment with SC-236. In addition, production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production induced by SCF was significantly inhibited by treatment with SC-236. Previous work has demonstrated that SCF-induced migration and cytokine production of mast cells require p38 MAPK activation. We also showed that SC-236 suppresses the SCF-induced p38 MAPK activation in RPMCs. These data suggest that SC-236 inhibits migration and cytokine production through suppression of p38 MAPK activation. These results provided new insight into the pharmacological actions of SC-236 and its potential therapeutic role in the treatment of inflammatory allergic diseases. SC-236, (4-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1-pyrazol-1-]benzenesulfonamide; C(16)H(11)ClF(3)N(3)O(2)S) is a highly selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor. Recently, there have been reports that SC-236 protects against cartilage damage in addition to reducing inflammation and pain for those with osteoarthritis. However, the mechanism involved in an inflammatory allergic reaction in a murine model has not been examined. The aim of the present study is to elucidate whether and how SC-236 modulates the inflammatory allergic reaction in a murine model. In this study, the anti-allergic effect was investigated using rat peritoneal mast cells, IgE-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), and the ear-swelling model in mice. Also, we examined the inhibitory effect of SC-236 on the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. SC-236 was found to inhibit the ear-swelling response and histamine release in the murine model. Additionally, SC-236 was revealed to inhibit the PCA response and COX-2 expression. As a final step, the inhibitory mechanism of SC-236 was shown to occur through phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). These in vitro and in vivo results provide new insight into the pharmacological actions of SC-236 as a potential molecule for therapy for inflammatory allergic diseases. Aspirin exerts antitumor effect partly through blocking tumor promoter-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation. The aim of this study is to determine how specific COX-2 inhibitor SC-236 mediates antitumor effect by modulation of AP-1-signaling pathway. AP-1 transcriptional activity and DNA-binding activity were detected by luciferase reporter assay and gel shift assay, separately. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was determined by Western blot and in vitro kinase assay. Antisense oligonucleotide against c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) was used to suppress JNK expression. We showed that SC-236 inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA)-induced cell transformation in a dose-dependent manner in JB6 cells. At a dose range (12.5-50 micromol/L) that inhibited cell transformation, SC-236 also inhibited anchorage-independent cell growth and AP-1-activation in 3 gastric cancer cells, independent of COX-prostaglandin synthesis. SC-236 down-regulated c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase phosphorylation and activity. Suppression of JNK activity reversed the inhibitory effect on AP-1 activity by SC-236 and suppressed gastric cancer cell growth, indicating that the inhibitory effect of SC-236 on AP-1 activation and cell growth was through interaction with JNK. The inhibitory effect on JNK-c-Jun/AP-1 activation contributes to the antitumor effect of COX-2-specific inhibitor, and inhibition of JNK activation may have a therapeutic benefit against gastric cancer.",Sc 236,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0011705794604495168), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.011759249493479729), ('ICAL', -1.7881377516459906e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07891254872083664)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([invivochem.com](https://www.invivochem.com/sc-236.html?utm_source=openai), [biocrick.com](https://www.biocrick.com/SC-236-BCC7809.html?utm_source=openai), [enzo.com](https://www.enzo.com/product/sc-236/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=230, start_index=6, title='SC-236 | inhibitor of COX-2 | PPARγ agonist | CAS# 170569-86-5 | InvivoChem', type='url_citation', url='https://www.invivochem.com/sc-236.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=230, start_index=6, title='SC 236 | CAS:170569-86-5 | Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor | High Purity | Manufacturer BioCrick', type='url_citation', url='https://www.biocrick.com/SC-236-BCC7809.html?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=230, start_index=6, title='SC-236 - Enzo', type='url_citation', url='https://www.enzo.com/product/sc-236/?utm_source=openai')])"

Next-generation agents that improve the tolerability while maintaining efficacy are desirable. A phase Ib clinical study was conducted with the oral PI3K-delta isoform-selective small-molecule inhibitor, linperlisib, in patients with r/r PTCL, and the clinical benefit was explored by the evaluation of safety and efficacy. In this clinical study, 43 patients with r/r PTCL in China were treated with continuous dosing of 80-mg linperlisib once a day. Treatment-related adverse events (AE) were manageable. The most frequently reported grade 3 AE were neutropenia (21%), pneumonia (11.6%), and hypertriglyceridemia (7%). All other AE were either absent or reported in <5% of the patients. Linperlisib treatment for these patients with r/r PTCL, consisting of the major PTCL subtypes, was observed to have a 60.5% overall response rate with 35% complete responses and led to a median duration of response of 11.1 months, median progression-free survival of 11.8 months, and a median overall survival of >38 months (not reached). With the very promising clinical activity against r/r PTCL, the results of this study support the further investigation of linperlisib for the treatment of r/r PTCL. Patients with advanced solid tumors have a suboptimal prognosis. This study investigated the safety and feasibility of linperlisib, a selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta isoform (PI3Kδ) inhibitor, for treating patients with advanced solid tumors. In this phase Ib, single-arm, open-label, multi-center clinical trial, patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors from eight centers in China were enrolled to receive oral linperlisib (80 mg/day). The primary endpoint was safety. Between August 2019 and June 2022, 94 patients were enrolled in the trial and received the study treatment. The most common (≥ 20%) treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of all grades irrespective of causality were increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (26.6%), proteinuria (26.6%), decreased appetite (25.5%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (22.3%), weight loss (21.3%), and anemia (21.3%). The most common grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were diarrhea (4.3%), increased AST (3.2%), increased ALT (3.2%), neutropenia (3.2%), anemia (3.2%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (3.2%). The objective response rate (ORR) was 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0-5.8), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 37.2% (95% CI 27.5-47.8). As of the data cutoff, the median follow-up time was 4.2 months (95% CI 2.8-6.9). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.85 months (95% CI 1.79-1.88). The median overall survival (OS) was not reached. Linperlisib showed an acceptable safety profile and preliminary clinical benefit in patients with a range of advanced solid tumors. Further studies of linperlisib safety and efficacy are warranted.",Linperlisib,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.672895011026412e-05), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00044860312482342124)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([laotiantimes.com](https://laotiantimes.com/2022/11/09/yingli-pharma-announces-nmpa-approval-of-new-anti-cancer-drug-linperlisib/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=159, start_index=9, title='Yingli Pharma Announces NMPA Approval of New Anti-cancer Drug Linperlisib - Laotian Times', type='url_citation', url='https://laotiantimes.com/2022/11/09/yingli-pharma-announces-nmpa-approval-of-new-anti-cancer-drug-linperlisib/?utm_source=openai')])"

Laropiprant itself has no cholesterol lowering effect, but it reduces facial flushes induced by nicotinic acid. Merck & Co. planned to market this combination under the trade names Cordaptive in the US and Tredaptive in Europe. Both brands contained 1000 mg of nicotinic acid (niacin) and 20 mg of laropiprant in each tablet. == Mechanism of action == Nicotinic acid in cholesterol lowering doses (500–2000 mg per day) causes facial flushes by stimulating biosynthesis of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), especially in the skin. PGD2 dilates the blood vessels via activation of the prostaglandin D2 receptor subtype DP1, increasing blood flow and thus leading to flushes. Laropiprant acts as a selective DP1 receptor antagonist to inhibit the vasodilation of prostaglandin D2-induced activation of DP1. Taking 325 mg of aspirin 20–30 minutes prior to taking nicotinic acid has also been proven to prevent flushing in 90% of patients, presumably by suppressing prostaglandin synthesis, but this medication also increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, though the increased risk is less than 1 percent. == History == In the mid-2000s, in a trial with 1613 patients, 10.2% patients stopped taking the medication in the combination drug group versus 22.2% under nicotinic acid monotherapy. On April 28, 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ""not approved"" letter for Cordaptive. Tredaptive was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on July 3, 2008. On January 11, 2013, Merck & Co Inc. announced they were withdrawing the drug worldwide as a result of European regulators recommendations. The Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events (HPS2-THRIVE) involved more than 25,000 adults. The treatment group received 2 g of extended-release nicotinic acid and 40 mg of laropiprant daily. Study results, reported in July 2014, showed that the combination of nicotinic acid and laropiprant did not have any beneficial effects when compared with a placebo treatment and had an increase in adverse effects. == References ==",Cordaptive,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007158888038247824), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006805725861340761), ('ICAL', -3.814689989667386e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.04863104596734047)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([antigo.anvisa.gov.br](https://antigo.anvisa.gov.br/informacoes-tecnicas13?_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_assetEntryId=400711&_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_groupId=33868&_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_type=content&_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_urlTitle=alerta-snvs-anvisa-nuvig-gfarm-n-02-de-15-de-janeiro-de-2013&p_p_col_count=2&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS&utm_source=openai), [fiercepharma.com](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/also-noted-merck-s-cordaptive-fails-to-get-u-s-approval-medtronic-sub-faces-fda-imposed?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=647, start_index=6, title='Cordaptive® (ácido nicotínico/laropipranto): retirada do medicamento do mercado. - Informações técnicas - Anvisa', type='url_citation', url='https://antigo.anvisa.gov.br/informacoes-tecnicas13?_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_assetEntryId=400711&_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_groupId=33868&_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_type=content&_101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS_urlTitle=alerta-snvs-anvisa-nuvig-gfarm-n-02-de-15-de-janeiro-de-2013&p_p_col_count=2&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_pos=1&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_R6VaZWsQDDzS&utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=647, start_index=6, title=""ALSO NOTED: Merck's Cordaptive fails to get U.S. approval; Medtronic sub faces FDA-imposed outage; | Fierce Pharma"", type='url_citation', url='https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/also-noted-merck-s-cordaptive-fails-to-get-u-s-approval-medtronic-sub-faces-fda-imposed?utm_source=openai')])"

It targets a specific mutation, G12C, in the protein K-Ras encoded by gene KRAS which is responsible for various forms of cancer. Sotorasib is an inhibitor of the RAS GTPase family. The most common side effects include diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, liver damage and cough. The most common adverse reactions for sotorasib used in combination with panitumumab include rash, dry skin, diarrhea, stomatitis, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. Sotorasib is the first approved targeted therapy for people with tumors with any KRAS mutation, which accounts for approximately 25% of mutations in non-small cell lung cancers. KRAS G12C mutations occur in about 13% of people with non-small cell lung cancers. Sotorasib was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2021, and in the European Union in January 2022. The US Food and Drug Administration considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == In the US, sotorasib is indicated for the treatment of adults with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, as determined by a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. It is also indicated, in combination with panitumumab, for the treatment of adults with KRAS G12C-mutated KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. In the EU, sotorasib, as monotherapy, is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation and who have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. == Chemistry and pharmacology == Sotorasib can exist in either of two atropisomeric forms, and one is more active than the other. It selectively forms an irreversible covalent bond to the sulfur atom in the cysteine residue that is present in the mutated form of KRAS, but not in the normal form. == History == Sotorasib is being developed by Amgen. Phase I clinical trials were completed in 2020. In December 2019, it was approved to begin phase II clinical trials. Researchers evaluated the efficacy of sotorasib in a study of 124 participants with locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer with disease progression after receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. The major outcomes measured were objective response rate (proportion of participants whose tumor is destroyed or reduced) and duration of response. The objective response rate was 36% and 58% of those participants had a duration of response of six months or longer. Sotorasib was evaluated in one non-randomized, dose escalation and dose expansion clinical trial (CodeBreaK 100) in participants with non-small cell lung cancer. There were 124 participants with non-small cell lung cancer included in the primary efficacy population, while 204 participants with non-small cell lung cancer were included in the primary safety population. The primary endpoint of the trial was objective response rate. Approximately 36% of participants (37 of 124 participants) treated with sotorasib in the clinical study CodeBreaK 100 had partial shrinkage of their cancer, including two participants with complete shrinkage. Shrinkage lasted more than six months for 58% of participants who had a response to sotorasib. The trial was conducted at 46 sites in 10 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, and the United States). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for sotorasib orphan drug, fast track, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designations. The FDA granted approval of Lumakras to Amgen Inc. Sotorasib was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval program. The efficacy of using sotorasib, in combination with panitumumab, was evaluated in CodeBreaK 300 (NCT05198934), a randomized, open-label, controlled trial in participants with KRAS G12C-mutated mutated metastatic colorectal cancer who previously received fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Mutations were prospectively identified in tumor tissue samples using the QIAGEN therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR kit. A total of 160 participants were randomized (1:1:1) to receive either sotorasib 960 mg orally once daily and panitumumab 6 mg/kg IV every two weeks, sotorasib 240 mg orally once daily and panitumumab 6 mg/kg IV every two weeks, or investigator's choice of standard of care trifluridine/tipiracil or regorafenib. == Society and culture == === Economics === At introduction, in the United States, sotorasib costs US$17,900 per month. === Legal status === In May 2021, sotorasib was approved under the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accelerated approval program. In November 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorization for the medicinal product Lumykras, intended for the treatment of people with KRAS G12C mutation non-small cell lung cancer. The applicant for this medicinal product is Amgen Europe B.V. Sotorasib was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2022. In January 2025, the FDA approved sotorasib, in combination with panitumumab, for the treatment of adults with KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. === Names === Sotorasib is the international nonproprietary name. == Research == In a randomized phase III trial, sotorasib was compared with docetaxel in 345 patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with previous platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. The study showed an improvement in the progression-free survival for sotorasib (960 mg daily), compared with docetaxel (median progression-free survival 5.6 months vs 4.5 months; hazard ratio 0·66; p=0·0017). The radiographic response rate for sotorasib was 28.1% compared with 13.2% response rate for docetaxel. Overall survival was not different between sotorasib and docetaxel. At a meeting of FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, FDA staff made comments about design and conduct of the trial that raised concerns about the validity of the conclusions of this trial. Sotorasib was prepared as an amorphous solid dispersion with at least one polymer, combined with powders using resonant acoustic mixing, for use in tablets. This method was shown to result in an appropriate amount of medication in a dissolution test. == References == == Further reading == Hong DS, Fakih MG, Strickler JH, Desai J, Durm GA, Shapiro GI, et al.

In the present study, we explored the antiproliferative activity of indeno[1,2-d]thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine analogues against LC using in-vitro, in-silico, and in-vivo models. In-vitro screening against A549 cells revealed compounds 9B (8-methoxy-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-5,6-dihydroindeno[1,2-d]thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine) and 12B (5-(4-chlorophenyl)-5,6-dihydroindeno[1,2-d]thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine) as potential pyrimidine analogues against LC. Compounds 9B and 12B were docked with different molecular targets IL-6, Cyt-C, Caspase9, and Caspase3 using AutoDock Vina 4.1 to evaluate the binding affinity. Subsequently, in-vivo studies were conducted in albino Wistar rats through ethyl-carbamate (EC)- induced LC. 9B and 12B imparted significant effects on physiological (weight variation), and biochemical (anti-oxidant [TBAR's, SOD, ProC, and GSH), lipid (TC, TG, LDL, VLDL, and HDL)], and cytokine (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1β) markers in EC-induced LC in albino Wistar rats. Morphological examination (SEM and H&E) and western blotting (IL-6, STAT3, Cyt-C, BAX, Bcl-2, Caspase3, and caspase9) showed that compounds 9B and 12B had antiproliferative effects. Accordingly, from the in-vitro, in-silico, and in-vivo experimental findings, we concluded that 9B and 12B have significant antiproliferative potential and are potential candidates for further evaluation to meet the requirements of investigation of new drug application.",Methoxy}ethyl)carbamate,PUBMED,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0005530327325686812)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.08268427103757858), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.002621073741465807)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

People started on empagliflozin may first see a decrease in kidney function before their glomerular filtration rate stabilises. Greatest benefit was demonstrated in those who had severe loss of kidney function, higher risk of kidney function worsening and background of diabetes. Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of the sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2), and works by increasing sugar loss in urine. Empagliflozin was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 2014. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 56th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12 million prescriptions. It has received approval as a generic medication from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). == Medical uses == In the United States, empagliflozin is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure; to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression; to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease; and as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in people aged ten years of age and older with type 2 diabetes. In the European Union, empagliflozin is indicated in people aged ten years of age and older for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise; as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance; in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. It is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure; and it is indicated in adults for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. Empagliflozin lowers risk of hospitalization and death in people with reduced heart function, when added to standard heart failure treatment with or without type 2 diabetes. It is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death; and as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. In June 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded the indication, as an addition to diet and exercise, to improve blood sugar control in children 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. == Contraindications == History of a severe allergic reaction to empagliflozin End-stage kidney disease Diabetic ketoacidosis == Side effects == === Common === Empagliflozin increases the risk of genital fungal infections. The risk is highest in people with a prior history of genital fungal infections. Empagliflozin has been thought to be associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections. Reviews of clinical trials have shown there is no significant risk of developing urinary tract infections while taking empagliflozin when compared to placebo or other diabetic medications. Empagliflozin reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure and can increase the risk of low blood pressure, which can cause fainting and/or falls. The risk is higher in older people, people taking diuretics, and people with reduced kidney function. Slight increases in Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can be seen with empagliflozin, in the range of 2–4% from baseline. === Serious === Diabetic ketoacidosis, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, may occur more commonly with empagliflozin and other SGLT-2 inhibitors. While diabetic ketoacidosis is usually associated with elevated blood glucose levels, in people taking SGLT-2 inhibitors diabetic ketoacidosis may be seen with uncharacteristically normal blood glucose levels, a phenomenon called euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. The absence of elevated blood glucose levels in people on an SGLT-2 inhibitor may make it more difficult to diagnose diabetic ketoacidosis. The risk of empagliflozin-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis may be higher in the setting of illness, dehydration, surgery, and/or alcohol consumption. It is also seen in type 1 diabetes who take empagliflozin, which notably is an unapproved or ""off-label"" use of the medication. To lessen the risk of developing ketoacidosis (a serious condition in which the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones) after surgery, the FDA has approved changes to the prescribing information for SGLT2 inhibitor diabetes medicines to recommend they be stopped temporarily before scheduled surgery. Empagliflozin should each be stopped at least three days before scheduled surgery. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and trouble breathing. Fournier's gangrene, a rare but serious infection of the groin, occurs more commonly in people taking empagliflozin and other SGLT-2 inhibitors. Symptoms include feverishness, a general sense of malaise, and pain or swelling around the genitals or in the skin behind them. The infection progresses quickly and urgent medical attention is recommended. Empagliflozin can increase the risk of low blood sugar when it is used together with a sulfonylurea or insulin. When used by itself or in addition to metformin it does not appear to increase the risk of hypoglycemia. == Mechanism of action == Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of the sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2), which is found almost exclusively in the proximal tubules of nephronic components in the kidneys. SGLT-2 accounts for about 90 percent of glucose reabsorption into the blood. Blocking SGLT-2 reduces blood glucose by blocking glucose reabsorption in the kidney and thereby excreting glucose (i.e., blood sugar) via the urine. Of all the SGLT-2 Inhibitors currently available, empagliflozin has the highest degree of selectivity for SGLT-2 over SGLT-1, SGLT-4, SGLT-5 and SGLT-6. == History == It was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and is co-marketed by Eli Lilly and Company. It is also available as the fixed-dose combinations empagliflozin/linagliptin, empagliflozin/metformin, and empagliflozin/linagliptin/metformin. For cardiovascular death, the FDA based its decision on a postmarketing study it required when it approved empagliflozin in 2014, as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Empagliflozin was studied in a postmarket clinical trial of more than 7,000 participants with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the trial, empagliflozin was shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death compared to a placebo when added to standard of care therapies for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. For heart failure, the safety and effectiveness of empagliflozin were evaluated by the FDA as an adjunct to standard of care therapy in a randomized, double-blind, international trial comparing 2,997 participants who received empagliflozin, 10 mg, once daily to 2,991 participants who received the placebo. The main efficacy measurement was the time to death from cardiovascular causes or need to be hospitalized for heart failure. Of the individuals who received empagliflozin for an average of about two years, 14% died from cardiovascular causes or were hospitalized for heart failure, compared to 17% of the participants who received the placebo. This benefit was mostly attributable to fewer participants being hospitalized for heart failure. The FDA granted the application for empagliflozin priority review and granted the approval of Jardiance to Boehringer Ingelheim. == Legal status == As of May 2013, Boehringer and Lilly had submitted applications for marketing approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Empagliflozin was approved in the European Union in May 2014, and was approved in the United States in August 2014. The FDA required four postmarketing studies: a cardiovascular outcomes trial, two studies in children, and a toxicity study in animals related to the pediatric trials. == Research == A meta-analysis of short-term randomized controlled trials has shown similar efficacy on glycemic control between empagliflozin 10mg and 25mg in people with type 2 diabetes. While there may be a higher reduction in HbA1c with higher doses, this difference is more clinically significant when the patients' baseline HbA1c is ≥ 8.5%. === Weight and blood pressure === Empagliflozin causes moderate reductions in blood pressure and body weight. These effects are likely due to the excretion of glucose in the urine and a slight increase in urinary sodium excretion. In clinical trials, participants with type 2 diabetes taking empagliflozin with other diabetic medications lost an average of 2% of their baseline body weight. A higher percentage of people taking empagliflozin achieved weight loss greater than 5% from their baseline, which has been associated with improved glucose control. The same extent of weight loss was also observed in a study with heart failure patients taking empagliflozin. Empagliflozin has been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure by 3 to 5 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) without changes in pulse rate. A greater percentage of people with uncontrolled blood pressure at baseline, achieved controlled blood pressure (i.e. systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg) after taking empagliflozin at 24 weeks. The effects on blood pressure and body weight are generally viewed as favorable, as many people with type 2 diabetes have high blood pressure or are overweight or obese. == References ==",Empagliflozin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.597391747054644e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00016640232934150845)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ', [])"

615,"('Floxuridine', 'Fluorodeoxyuridine', 'Deoxyfluorouridine', 'Fluoruridine deoxyribose', 'Floxuridin')",Medical,"Floxuridine (also 5-fluorodeoxyuridine) is an oncology drug that belongs to the class known as antimetabolites. Specifically, floxuridine is a pyrimidine analog, classified as a deoxyuridine. The drug is usually administered via an artery, and most often used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The quality of life and survival rates of individuals that receive continuous hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine for colorectal cancer metastases is significantly higher than control groups. Floxuridine can also be prescribed for the treatment of kidney and stomach cancers. In vitro uses of floxuridine include 5-minute treatments of fluorouracil, floxuridine, and mitomycin to increase cell proliferation in Tenon's capsule fibroblasts. == Biosynthesis == Immobilized Aeromonas salmonicida ATCC 27013, when exposed to thymidine and 5-fluorouracil in phosphate buffer at room temperature for one hour, can synthesize floxuridine and thymine. == Pharmacology == Floxuridine primarily works by stopping the growth of newly born cells. The drug essentially stops DNA from forming in new and rapidly developing cells, which is a sign of a cancerous cell. Therefore, the floxuridine kills the cancerous cells. For colorectal cancer and hepatic metastases, an average adult should be given an intra-arterial dosage of 0.1–0.6 mg/kg/day as a continuous infusion, continued until intolerable toxicity is reached (white blood cell count < 3,500/mm3 or platelet count < 100,000/mm3). Lethal dosages for other species are below. LD50 is the lethal dose at which half of organisms exposed to the drug die. === Pharmacodynamics === Floxuridine is a pyrimidine analog that acts as an inhibitor of the S-phase of cell division. This selectively kills rapidly dividing cells. Antimetabolites masquerade as pyrimidine-like molecules which prevents normal pyrimidines from being incorporated into DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle. Fluorouracil (the end-product of catabolism of floxuridine) blocks an enzyme which converts cytosine nucleosides into the deoxy derivative. In addition, DNA synthesis is further inhibited because fluorouracil blocks the incorporation of the thymidine nucleotide into the DNA strand. === Mechanism of action === Floxuridine is rapidly catabolized to 5-fluorouracil, which is the active form of the drug. The primary effect is interference with DNA synthesis and to a lesser extent, inhibition of RNA formation through the drug's incorporation into RNA, thus leading to the production of fraudulent RNA. Fluorouracil also inhibits uracil riboside phosphorylase, which prevents the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. As well, the monophosphate of floxuridine, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthetase. This leads to the inhibition of methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thus interfering with DNA synthesis. === Route of elimination === The drug is excreted intact and as urea, fluorouracil, α-fluoro-β-ureidopropionic acid, dihydrofluorouracil, α-fluoro-β-guanidopropionic acid, and α-fluoro-β-alanine in the urine; it is also expired as respiratory carbon dioxide. == Side effects == Side effects include: === Common (30% of patients) === Low blood counts. The patient's white and red blood cells and platelets may temporarily decrease. This can put them at increased risk for infection, anemia and/or bleeding. Mouth sores Diarrhea (may be severe) === Less common (10–29% of patients) === Poor appetite Nausea and vomiting Hair loss Elevated liver enzymes (temporary increase in alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, transaminase, and bilirubin). This is seen more with the intra-arterial infusion directly into the liver. Hand-foot syndrome (Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or PPE) -skin rash, swelling, redness, pain and/or peeling of the skin on the palms of hands and soles of feet Stomach ulcers (This is seen more with the intra-arterial infusion). === Contact your health provider immediately === Fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher, chills (possible signs of infection). === Contact your health provider === Diarrhea (2 episodes in a 24-hour period) Nausea (interferes with ability to eat and unrelieved with prescribed medication) Vomiting (vomiting more than 4–5 times in a 24-hour period) Mouth sores (painful redness, swelling or ulcers) Unusual bleeding or bruising Black or tarry stools, or blood in your stools Blood in the urine Yellowing of the skin or eyes Tingling or burning, redness, swelling of the palms of the hands or soles of feet === Other === Fertility for both men and women may be affected by floxuridine. == Use in research == Apart from its use in chemotherapy, floxuridine is also used in aging research employing a C. elegans model, namely to stop growth and to prevent reproduction. The latter is brought about by treatment of larvae close to maturity with low doses of floxuridine that, even though allowing normal maturation, causes reproducing individuals to lay eggs that are unable to hatch. This limits the population to a single generation allowing quantification of aging processes and measurement of longevity. It has, however, been indicated that floxuridin exposure by itself increases life expectancy potentially leading to flawed data in respective studies. == History == Floxuridine first gained FDA approval in December 1970 under the brand name FUDR. The drug was initially marketed by Roche, which also did a lot of the initial work on 5-fluorouracil. The National Cancer Institute was an early developer of the drug. Roche sold its FUDR product line in 2001 to F H Faulding, which became Mayne Pharma. == Alternative names == Synonyms for floxuridine include: == References ==",Fluorodeoxyuridine,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.5033637939486653e-05), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0019346822518855333)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

It acts as a platelet aggregation inhibitor by antagonising the P2Y12 receptor. The drug is produced by AstraZeneca. The most common side effects include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), bleeding and raised uric acid level in the blood. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in December 2010, and in the United States in July 2011. In 2022, it was the 203rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == In the US, ticagrelor is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in people with acute ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack. In the EU, ticagrelor, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adults with acute coronary syndromes or a history of myocardial infarction and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event; and for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adults with a history of myocardial infarction and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic event. == Contraindications == Contraindications to ticagrelor are active bleeding, increased risk of bradycardia, concomitant therapy of ticagrelor and strong cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A4) inhibitors and moderate or severe hepatic impairment due to the risk of increased exposure to ticagrelor. == Adverse effects == The common adverse effects are increased risk of bleeding (which may be severe) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea). Dyspnoea is usually transient and mild-to-moderate in severity, with a higher risk at < 1 month, 1–6 months and >6 months of follow up compared to clopidogrel. Discontinuation of therapy is rare, although some people do not persist or switch therapies. People who develop tolerable dyspnoea as a side effect of ticagrelor should be reassured to continue therapy, as it does not impact on the drug's cardiovascular benefit and bleeding risk in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Furthermore, two small subgroup analyses found no associations between ticagrelor and adverse changes in heart and lung function that may induce dyspnoea in stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and people with ACS without heart failure or significant lung disease. Ventricular pauses ≥3 seconds may occur in people with ACS the first week of treatment, but are likely to be mostly asymptomatic and transient, without causing increased clinical bradycardic adverse events. Caution is recommended when using ticagrelor in people with advanced sinoatrial node disease. Allergic skin reactions such as rash and itching have been observed in less than 1% of people taking ticagrelor. == Interactions == Inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole and possibly grapefruit juice, increase blood plasma levels of ticagrelor and consequently can lead to bleeding and other adverse effects. Ticagrelor is a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor and can increase the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 substrates Current evidence suggests that use of ticagrelor with statins can increase the risk of adverse effects like myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. However, this evidence is weak, and more research is needed. While it appears that the risk is low for most people, caution should be used when the medications are combined. This is especially important in elderly patients, and some evidence suggests that extra caution should be used with renally impaired patients as well. CYP3A4 inducers, for example rifampicin and possibly St. John's wort, can reduce the effectiveness of ticagrelor. There is no evidence for interactions via CYP2C9. The drug also inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp), leading to increased plasma levels of digoxin, ciclosporin and other P-gp substrates. Levels of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX (the active metabolite of ticagrelor formed by O-deethylation) are not significantly influenced by P-gp inhibitors. It is generally recommended to use low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg per day) with ticagrelor when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is indicated. It has been observed that the use of 325 mg daily aspirin in DAPT increases the risk of bleeding events, without lowering the rate of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) such as cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke or unplanned revascularisation (restoration of blood flow). == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Like the thienopyridines prasugrel, clopidogrel and ticlopidine, ticagrelor blocks adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptors of subtype P2Y12. In contrast to the other antiplatelet drugs, ticagrelor has a binding site different from ADP, making it an allosteric antagonist, and the blockage is reversible. Moreover, the drug does not need hepatic activation, which might work better for people with genetic variants regarding the enzyme CYP2C19 (although it is not certain whether clopidogrel is significantly influenced by such variants). Ticagrelor was found to result in a lower risk of stroke at 90 days than clopidogrel, which requires metabolic conversion, among Han Chinese CYP2C19 loss-of-function carriers with minor ischemic stroke or TIA. === Pharmacokinetics === Ticagrelor is absorbed quickly from the gut, the bioavailability being 36%, and reaches its peak concentration after about 1.5 hours. The main metabolite, AR-C124910XX, is formed quickly via CYP3A4 by de-hydroxyethylation at position 5 of the cyclopentane ring. Plasma concentrations of ticagrelor are slightly increased (12–23%) in elderly people, women, people of Asian ethnicity, and people with mild hepatic impairment. They are decreased in people that self-identified as 'black' and those with severe renal impairment. These differences are not considered clinically relevant. In Japanese people, concentrations are 40% higher than in Caucasians, or 20% after body weight correction. The drug has not been tested in people with severe hepatic impairment. Consistently with its reversible mode of action, ticagrelor is known to act faster and shorter than clopidogrel. This means it has to be taken twice instead of once a day which is a disadvantage in respect of compliance, but its effects are more quickly reversible which can be useful before surgery or if side effects occur. == Chemistry == Ticagrelor is a nucleoside analogue: the cyclopentane ring is similar to the sugar ribose, and the nitrogen rich aromatic ring system resembles the nucleobase purine, giving the molecule an overall similarity to adenosine. The substance has low solubility and low permeability under the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. == Research == === Comparison with related drugs === ==== With clopidogrel ==== The PLATO trial concluded superiority of ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel in reducing the rate of death from vascular causes, MI, and stroke in people presenting with acute coronary syndromes. A post-hoc subgroup analysis of the PLATO trial suggested a reduction in total mortality with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel in people with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. However, this finding should only be considered exploratory as it was not a primary endpoint of the PLATO trial. Ticagrelor, as monotherapy, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), and in comparison to clopidogrel, is associated with decreased all-cause mortality. When in comparison to clopidogrel, there is evidence for increased risk of bleeding. The PLATO trial found that ticagrelor use, in conjunction with low-dose aspirin (where tolerated), had better all-cause mortality rates than the same treatment plan with clopidogrel (4.5% vs. 5.9%) in treating people with acute coronary syndrome. People given ticagrelor were less likely to die from vascular causes, heart attack, or stroke, regardless of whether the treatment plan was invasive. There is some conjecture in the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor within the Asian population, despite significant thrombotic benefits. A meta-analysis of observational studies in several Asian countries proposed that ticagrelor did not increase the risk of considerable bleeding events in Asian individuals. There is evidence to suggest that East Asian individuals are at a higher risk of bleeding events when using ticagrelor. The guidelines recommend that people of East Asian origin exercise caution and that treatment continuation after six months be based on net-clinical benefit. ==== With prasugrel ==== In 2019, the ISAR-REACT 5 trial comparing ticagrelor and prasugrel in participants with acute coronary syndrome showed that people with acute coronary disease receiving prasugrel had lower incidence of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to those who received ticagrelor. A 2019 study showed antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. This study used concentrations of ticagrelor for bactericidal activity that far exceeded those achieved by standard post acute coronary syndrome doses. Research indicates that ticagrelor may help reduce the risk of infections, such as pneumonia and sepsis. == References ==",Brilique,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.312633478140924e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0002097863471135497)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
618,"('Flumazenil', 'Ro 15-1788', 'Anexate', 'Flumazepil', 'Lanexat')",Medical,"Flumazenil (also known as flumazepil, code name Ro 15-1788) is a selective GABAA receptor antagonist administered via injection, otic insertion, or intranasally. Therapeutically, it acts as both an antagonist and antidote to benzodiazepines (particularly in cases of overdose), through competitive inhibition. It was first characterized in 1981, and was first marketed in 1987 by Hoffmann-La Roche under the trade name Anexate. However, it did not receive FDA approval until December 20, 1991. The developer lost its exclusive patent rights in 2008; so at present, generic formulations of this drug are available. Intravenous flumazenil is primarily used to treat benzodiazepine overdoses and to help reverse anesthesia. Administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has also been tested. == Medical uses == Flumazenil benefits patients who become excessively drowsy after use of benzodiazepines for either diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The drug has been used as an antidote in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdoses. It reverses the effects of benzodiazepines by competitive inhibition at the benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. There are many complications that must be taken into consideration when used in the acute care setting. These include lowered seizure threshold, agitation, and anxiousness. Flumazenil's short half-life requires multiple doses. Because of the potential risks of withdrawal symptoms and the drug's short half-life, patients must be carefully monitored to prevent recurrence of overdose symptoms or adverse side effects. Flumazenil is also sometimes used after surgery to reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. This is similar to naloxone's application to reverse the effect of opiates and opioids following surgery. Administration of the drug requires careful monitoring by an anesthesiologist due to potential side effects and serious risks associated with over-administeration. Likewise, post-surgical monitoring is also necessary because flumazenil can mask the apparent metabolization (""wearing off"") of the drug after removal of patient life-support and monitoring equipment. Flumazenil has been effectively used to treat overdoses of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon and zopiclone (also known as the ""Z-drugs""). It may also be effective in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness while improving vigilance in primary hypersomnias, such as idiopathic hypersomnia. The drug has also been used in hepatic encephalopathy. It may have beneficial short‐term effects in people with cirrhosis, but there is no evidence for long-term benefits. The onset of action is rapid, and effects are usually seen within one to two minutes. The peak effect is seen at six to ten minutes. The recommended dose for adults is 200 μg every 1–2 minutes until the effect is seen, up to a maximum of 3 mg per hour. It is available as a clear, colourless solution for intravenous injection, containing 500 μg in 5 mL. Additional doses may be needed within 20 to 30 minutes if evidence of oversedation reappears. Many benzodiazepines (including midazolam) have longer half-lives than flumazenil. Therefore, in cases of overdose, repeated doses of flumazenil may be required to prevent recurrent symptoms once the initial dose of flumazenil wears off. It is hepatically metabolised to inactive compounds which are excreted in the urine. Individuals who are physically dependent on benzodiazepines may experience benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, upon rapid administration of flumazenil. It is not recommended for routine use in those with a decreased level of consciousness. In terms of drug enforcement initiatives, diversion control programs and required post-marketing surveillance of adverse events, orders for flumazenil may trigger a prescription audit to the search for benzodiazepine misuse and for clinically significant adverse reactions related to their use. === PET radioligand === Radiolabeled with the radioactive isotope carbon-11, flumazenil may be used as a radioligand in neuroimaging with positron emission tomography to visualize the distribution of GABAA receptors in the human brain. === Treatment for benzodiazepine dependence & tolerance === Epileptic patients who have become tolerant to the anti-seizure effects of the benzodiazepine clonazepam became seizure-free for several days after treatment with 1.5 mg of flumazenil. Similarly, patients who were dependent on high doses of benzodiazepines (median dosage 333 mg diazepam-equivalent) were able to be stabilised on a low dose of clonazepam after 7–8 days of treatment with flumazenil. Flumazenil has been tested against placebo in benzodiazepine-dependent subjects. Results showed that typical benzodiazepine withdrawal effects were reversed with few to no symptoms. Flumazenil was also shown to produce significantly fewer withdrawal symptoms than saline in a randomized, placebo-controlled study with benzodiazepine-dependent subjects. Additionally, relapse rates were much lower during subsequent follow-up. In vitro studies of tissue cultured cell lines have shown that chronic treatment with flumazenil enhanced the benzodiazepine binding site where such receptors have become more numerous and uncoupling/down-regulation of GABAA has been reversed. After long-term exposure to benzodiazepines, GABAA receptors become down-regulated and uncoupled. Growth of new receptors and recoupling after prolonged flumazenil exposure has also been observed. It is thought this may be due to increased synthesis of receptor proteins. Flumazenil was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing feelings of hostility and aggression in patients who had been free of benzodiazepines for 4–266 weeks. This may suggest a role for flumazenil in treating protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Low-dose, slow subcutaneous flumazenil administration is a safe procedure for patients withdrawing from long-term, high-dose benzodiazepine dependency. It has a low risk of seizures even amongst those who have experienced convulsions when previously attempting benzodiazepine withdrawal. In Italy, the gold standard for treatment of high-dose benzodiazepine dependency is 8–10 days of low-dose, slowly infused flumazenil. One addiction treatment centre in Italy has used flumazenil to treat over 300 patients who were dependent on high doses of benzodiazepines (up to 70 times higher than conventionally prescribed) with physicians being among the clinic's most common patients. == Pharmacology == Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, antagonizes the actions of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system. Flumazenil competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. It also exhibits weak partial agonism of GABAA receptor complexes that contain α6-type monomers; the clinical relevance of this is unknown. Flumazenil does not antagonize all of the central nervous system effects of drugs affecting GABA-ergic neurons by means other than the benzodiazepine receptor (including ethanol, barbiturates, and most anesthetics) and does not reverse the effects of opioids. It will however antagonize the action of non-benzodiazepine z-drugs, such as zolpidem and zopiclone, because they act via the benzodiazepine site of the GABA receptor - it has been used to successfully treat z-drug overdose. === Pharmacodynamics === Intravenous flumazenil has been shown to antagonize sedation, impairment of recall, psychomotor impairment and ventilatory depression produced by benzodiazepines in healthy human volunteers. The duration and degree of reversal of sedative benzodiazepine effects are related to the dose and plasma concentrations of flumazenil. == Availability == Flumazenil is sold under a wide variety of brand names worldwide like Anexate, Lanexat, Mazicon, Romazicon. In India it is manufactured by Roche Bangladesh Pharmaceuticals and USAN Pharmaceuticals. == See also == Bretazenil Imidazenil Ro15-4513 GABAA receptor negative allosteric modulators == References == == External links == Media related to Flumazenil at Wikimedia Commons Flumazenil drug label/data at DailyMed from U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health.

620,"('Norfloxacin', 'Norfloxacine', 'Noroxin', 'Chibroxin', 'Baccidal')",Medical,"Ofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. When taken by mouth or injection into a vein, these include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, plague, and certain types of infectious diarrhea. Other uses, along with other medications, include treating multidrug resistant tuberculosis. An eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for otitis media when a hole in the ear drum is present. When taken by mouth, common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Other serious side effect include tendon rupture, numbness due to nerve damage, seizures, and psychosis. Use in pregnancy is typically not recommended. Ofloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. It works by interfering with the bacterium's DNA. Ofloxacin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1985. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ofloxacin is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 206th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Ofloxacin is used in the treatment of bacterial infections such as: Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Community-acquired pneumonia Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections Nongonococcal urethritis and cervicitis Epididymitis Mixed Infections of the urethra and cervix Acute pelvic inflammatory disease Uncomplicated cystitis Complicated urinary tract infections Prostatitis Acute, uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea Ofloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis. Fluoroquinolones, the class of drug ofloxacin belongs to, were the drug of choice for treating gonorrhea in the 1980s; However, due to the development of fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, fluoroquinolones were no longer used to treat gonorrhea by the late 1990s. As of 2004, the failure of single dose ofloxacin to treat gonorrhea has been reported in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. === Susceptible bacteria === According to the product package insert, ofloxacin is effective against these microorganisms: Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms Citrobacter koseri (Citrobacter diversus) Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae Neisseria gonorrhoeae Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Other microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis == Adverse effects == In general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side effects being mild to moderate. On occasion, serious adverse effects occur. Common side effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headache and insomnia. The overall rate of adverse events in patients treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin. Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of ""black box"" warnings in the United States. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon. Younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients. The overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments. Risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Tendon damage may manifest during and up to a year after fluoroquinolone therapy has been completed. Fluoroquinolones prolong the QT interval by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Prolongation of the QT interval can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice, this appears relatively uncommon in part because the most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the QT interval. Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea may occur in connection with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk similar to or less than that associated with broad spectrum cephalosporins. Fluoroquinolone administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent Clostridium strain. The US prescribing information contains a warning regarding uncommon cases of peripheral neuropathy, which can be permanent. Other nervous system effects include insomnia, restlessness, and rarely, seizure, convulsions, and psychosis Other rare and serious adverse events have been observed with varying degrees of evidence for causation. Events that may occur in acute overdose are rare, and include kidney failure and seizure. Susceptible groups of patients, such as children and the elderly, are at greater risk of adverse reactions during therapeutic use. Ofloxacin, like some other fluoroquinolones, may inhibit drug-metabolizing enzymes, and thereby increase blood levels of other drugs such as cyclosporine, theophylline, and warfarin, among others. These increased blood levels may result in a greater risk of side effects. Careful monitoring of serum glucose is advised when ofloxacin or other fluorquinolones are used by people who are taking sulfonylurea antidiabetes drugs. The concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a quinolone, including ofloxacin, may increase the risk of central nervous system stimulation and convulsive seizures. The fluoroquinolones have been shown to increase the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol, anisindione, and dicumarol. Additionally, the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias is increased when co-administered with drugs such as dihydroquinidine barbiturate, quinidine, and quinidine barbiturate. Current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones. == Contraindications == As noted above, under licensed use, ofloxacin is now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance. Caution should be used in people with liver disease. The excretion of ofloxacin may be reduced in patients with severe liver function disorders (e.g., cirrhosis with or without ascites). Ofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with psychiatric illnesses and in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. === Pregnancy === Ofloxacin has not been shown to have any teratogenic effects at oral doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day (11 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 50 times based on mg/kg) and 160 mg/kg/day (four times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 10 times based on mg/kg) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. Additional studies in rats with oral doses up to 360 mg/kg/day (five times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 23 times based on mg/kg) demonstrated no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. Doses equivalent to 50 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose of ofloxacin (based on mg/kg) were fetotoxic (i.e., decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality) in rats and rabbits, respectively. Minor skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg/kg/day, which is more than 10 times higher than the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. === Children === Oral and intravenous ofloxacin are not licensed for use in children, except as noted above, due to the risk of musculoskeletal injury. In one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months after treatment. At 12 months' follow-up, the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics. In the levafloxacin-treated group, about two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae. In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these adverse events were thought to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the levofloxacin. Two deaths were observed in the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System at the time of the 20 September 2011 FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee include musculoskeletal events (39, including five cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including five cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for levofloxacin were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period. == Overdose == Limited information is available on overdose with ofloxacin. Advice for the management of an acute overdose of ofloxacin is emptying of the stomach, along with close observation, and making sure that the patient is appropriately hydrated. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is of only limited effectiveness. Overdose may result in central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon/articular toxicity, and hepatic toxicity as well as kidney failure and seizure. Both seizures and severe psychiatric reactions have, however, been reported to occur at therapeutic dosage. == Pharmacokinetics == The bioavailability of ofloxacin in the tablet form is roughly 98% following oral administration, reaching maximum serum concentrations within one to two hours. Between 65% and 80% of an administered oral dose of ofloxacin is excreted unchanged via the kidneys within 48 hours of dosing. Therefore, elimination is mainly by renal excretion. However, 4-8% of an ofloxacin dose is excreted in the feces. This would indicate a small degree of biliary excretion, as well. Plasma elimination half-life is around 4 to 5 hours in patients and 6.4 to 7.4 hours in elderly patients. Ofloxacin is a racemic mixture, which consists of 50% levofloxacin (the biologically active component) and 50% of its “mirror image” or enantiomer dextrofloxacin. ""After multiple-dose administration of 200 mg and 300 mg doses, peak serum levels of 2.2 and 3.6 μg/ml, respectively, are predicted at steady-state. In vitro, approximately 32% of the drug in plasma is protein bound. Floxin is widely distributed to body tissues. Ofloxacin has been detected in blister fluid, cervix, lung tissue, ovary, prostatic fluid, prostatic tissue, skin, and sputum. Pyridobenzoxazine ring appears to decrease the extent of parent compound metabolism. Less than 5% is eliminated by the kidneys as desmethyl or N-oxide metabolites; 4% to 8% by feces."" A number of the endogenous compounds have been reported to be affected by ofloxacin as inhibitors, alteraters, and depletors. See the latest package insert for ofloxacin for additional details. == Mode of action == Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting two bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme necessary to separate (mostly in prokaryotes, in bacteria in particular) replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting bacterial cell division. == History == Ofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone, being a broader-spectrum analog of norfloxacin, and was synthesized and developed by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku. It was first approved for marketing in Japan in 1985, for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under the brand name Tarvid. Daiichi, working with Johnson & Johnson, obtained FDA approval in December 1990, under the brand name Floxin, labelled for use in adults with lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and sexually transmitted diseases. By 1991, it was also marketed as Tarvid by Hoechst in the UK, Germany, Belgium, and Portugal; as Oflocet in France, Portugal, Tunisia, and several African countries by Roussel-Uclaf, as Oflocin by Glaxo in Italy, and as Flobacin by Sigma-Tau in Italy. The market for ofloxacin was seen as difficult from its launch; it was approved as a ""1C"" drug, a new molecular entity with little or no therapeutic gain over existing therapies, and ciprofloxacin, which had a broader spectrum, was already on the market. By 1992, an intravenous solution was approved for marketing, In 1997, an indication for pelvic inflammatory disease was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the oral formulation, and in the same year, a solution for ear infections was approved under the brand Daiichi and J&J also cannibalized its own market by introducing levofloxacin, the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin, in 1996; Johnson and Johnson's annual sales of Floxin in 2003 was about $30 million, whereas their combined sales of Levaquin/Floxin exceeded $1.15 billion in the same year. Johnson & Johnson withdrew the marketing application in 2009. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Ofloxacin for systemic use is available in multiple strengths as a tablet, an oral suspension, and an injectable solution. It is also used as eye drops and ear drops and is available in combination with ornidazole. === Antibiotic use and bacterial resistance === Resistance to ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. Numerous pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes now exhibit resistance worldwide. Floxacin and other fluoroquinolones had become the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults in 2002. Nearly half (42%) of these prescriptions were for conditions not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as acute bronchitis, otitis media, and acute upper respiratory tract infection. == References ==",Baccidal,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00010962257510982454), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.023563476279377937), ('ICAL', -1.311301275563892e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004122331738471985)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medicinesfaq.com](https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/baccidal?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=9, title='Baccidal: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, FAQ - MedicinesFAQ', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/baccidal?utm_source=openai')])"

Eosinophils are important effector cells in the pathogenesis of asthma, and, in vitro, glucocorticoids modulate eosinophil viability. Using this glucocorticoid inhibition of eosinophil viability, we compared the in vitro potencies of several inhaled glucocorticoids with particular attention to fluticasone 17-propionate. Eosinophils from normal or mildly atopic donors were purified, cultured with cytokines and glucocorticoids, and on day 4, after staining with propidium iodide, analysed by flow cytometry. Eosinophil viability was prolonged by interleukin (IL)-5 in a concentration-dependent manner; in contrast, dexamethasone inhibited the IL-5 effect. Fluticasone 17-propionate, 1.0-1000 nM, also inhibited the IL-5 effect in a concentration-dependent manner; interestingly, at 0.1 nM fluticasone 17-propionate modestly, but significantly, enhanced eosinophil survival. High concentrations of IL-5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor essentially completely overcame the inhibitory effect of 1000 nM fluticasone 17-propionate on eosinophil survival. In contrast, although interferon-gamma-mediated eosinophil viability was inhibited by 1.0-1000 nM fluticasone 17-propionate, this inhibition was not overcome by increased concentrations of interferon-gamma. Comparison of the glucocorticoid inhibition of eosinophil viability in the presence of 10 pg/mL IL-5 resulted in these drug IC50 values (in nM): fluticasone 17-propionate, 1.3; budesonide, 8.5; triamcinolone acetonide, 25; flunisolide, 32; dexamethasone, 94; beclomethasone 17-monopropionate, 210; beclomethasone 17,21-dipropionate, 290; and hydrocortisone, >1000. Fluticasone 17-propionate's effect on cytokine-mediated eosinophil viability is similar qualitatively to other glucocorticoid preparations.

623,"('Carbinoxamine maleate salt', 'Carbinoxamine', 'Paracarbinoxamine', 'Allergefon', 'Carbinoxamina')",Medical,"Carbinoxamine is an antihistamine and anticholinergic agent. It is used for hay fever, vasomotor rhinitis, mild urticaria, angioedema, dermatographism and allergic conjunctivitis. Carbinoxamine is a histamine antagonist, specifically an H1-antagonist. The maleic acid salt of the levorotatory isomer is sold as the prescription drug rotoxamine. It was patented in 1947 and came into medical use in 1953. It was first launched in the United States by the McNeil Corporation under the brand name Clistin. Carbinoxamine is available in various countries around the world by itself, combined with decongestants such as pseudoephedrine, and also with other ingredients including paracetamol, aspirin, and codeine. == Society and culture == In June 2006 the FDA announced that more than 120 branded pharmacy products containing carbinoxamine were being illegally marketed and demanded they be removed from the marketplace. This action was precipitated by twenty-one reported deaths in children under the age of two who had been administered carbinoxamine-containing products. Despite the fact that the drug had not been studied in this age group, a multitude of OTC preparations containing carbinoxamine were being marketed for infants and toddlers.

625,"('Ezetimibe', 'Zetia', 'Ezetrol', 'Ezedoc', '(3r,4s)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[(3s)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl]-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)azetidin-2-one')",Medical,"Ezetimibe, sold under the brand name Zetia among others, is a medication used to treat high blood cholesterol and certain other lipid abnormalities. Generally it is used together with dietary changes and a statin. Alone, it is less preferred than a statin. It is taken by mouth. It is also available in the fixed-dose combinations ezetimibe/simvastatin, ezetimibe/atorvastatin, ezetimibe/rosuvastatin, and ezetimibe/bempedoic acid. The most commonly reported adverse events include upper respiratory tract infections, joint pain, diarrhea, and tiredness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, depression, and muscle breakdown. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. Ezetimibe works by decreasing cholesterol absorption in the intestines. Ezetimibe was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 79th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Several treatment guidelines recommend adding ezetimibe in select high risk persons in whom LDL goals cannot be achieved by maximally tolerated statin alone. Adding ezetimibe to statin treatment of high blood cholesterol has no effect on overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality, although it significantly reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. Combining ezetimibe with simvastatin had no effect on overall mortality but did lower the risk of heart attack or stroke in people with prior heart attack. Initiation of ezetimibe along with high-intensity statin therapy at the time of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event was associated with significantly better cholesterol reduction at day 7, 1-month, 3-months, and 1-year post-ACS event; which translated into significantly lower recurrent cardiovascular events (death from any cause, major ACS, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke) post the index event of ACS. Ezetimibe is indicated in the United States as an add-on to dietary measures to reduce levels of certain lipids in people with: Primary hyperlipidemia, alone or with a statin Mixed hyperlipidemia, in combination with fenofibrate Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in combination with specific statins Homozygous sitosterolemia A 2018 review found that ezetimibe used as sole treatment slightly lowered plasma levels of lipoprotein(a), but the effect was not large enough to be important. Ezetimibe improves the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score but the available evidence indicates it does not improve outcomes of hepatic steatosis. == Contraindications == The two contraindications to taking ezetimibe are a previous allergic reaction to it, including symptoms of rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis, and severe liver disease, especially when taken with a statin. Ezetimibe may have significant medication interactions with ciclosporin and with fibrates other than fenofibrate. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with ezetimibe therapy include headache and/or diarrhea (steatorrhea). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include myalgia and/or raised liver function test (ALT/AST) results. Rarely (<0.1% of patients), hypersensitivity reactions (rash, angioedema) or myopathy may occur. Cases of muscle problems (myalgia and rhabdomyolysis) have been reported and are included as warnings on the label for ezetimibe. Since NPC1L1 also regulates vitamin K uptake, the use of ezetimibe can lead to side effects in warfarin therapy. == Overdose == The incidence of overdose with ezetimibe is rare; subsequently, few data exist on the effects of overdose. However, an acute overdose of ezetimibe is expected to produce an exaggeration of its usual effects, leading to loose stools, abdominal pain, and fatigue. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Ezetimibe inhibits the absorption of cholesterol from the small intestine and decreases the amount of cholesterol normally available to liver cells. The lower levels of cholesterol in the liver cells lead them to absorb more cholesterol from circulation thus lowering the levels of circulating cholesterol. It blocks the critical mediator of cholesterol absorption, the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) protein on the gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells, as well as in hepatocytes; it blocks aminopeptidase N and interrupts a caveolin 1–annexin A2 complex involved in trafficking cholesterol. === Pharmacokinetics === Within 4–12 hours of the oral administration of a 10-mg dose to fasting adults, the attained mean ezetimibe peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 3.4–5.5 ng/ml. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is absorbed and extensively conjugated to a phenolic glucuronide (active metabolite). Mean Cmax (45–71 ng/ml) of ezetimibe-glucuronide is attained within 1–2 hours. The concomitant administration of food (high-fat vs. nonfat meals) does not affect the extent of absorption of ezetimibe. However, coadministration with a high-fat meal increases its Cmax by 38%. The absolute bioavailability cannot be determined, since ezetimibe is insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection. Ezetimibe and its active metabolites are highly bound to human plasma proteins (90%). Ezetimibe is primarily metabolized in the liver and the small intestine via glucuronide conjugation with subsequent renal and biliary excretion. Both the parent compound and its active metabolite are eliminated from plasma with a half-life of around 22 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing. Ezetimibe lacks significant inhibitor or inducer effects on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which explains its limited number of drug interactions. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with chronic kidney disease or mild hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh score 5–6). Due to insufficient data, the manufacturer does not recommend ezetimibe for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7–15). In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the mean AUC values for total ezetimibe are increased about 1.7-fold, 3-to-4-fold, and 5-to-6-fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. == References ==",Ezedoc,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.6331539882230572e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00026913834153674543)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([medicinesfaq.com](https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/ezedoc?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=90, start_index=9, title='Ezedoc: Uses, Dosage, Side Effects, FAQ - MedicinesFAQ', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medicinesfaq.com/brand/ezedoc?utm_source=openai')])"
626,"('Bifenthrin', 'Biphenthrin', 'Kappa-bifenthrin', 'Capture', 'Kappa-bifenthrine')",Medical,"Bifenthrin is a pyrethroid insecticide. It is widely used against ant infestations. == Chemical properties == Bifenthrin is poorly soluble in water and often remains in soil. Its residual half-life in soil is between 7 days and 8 months, depending on the soil type, with a low mobility in most soil types. Bifenthrin has the longest known residual time in soil of insecticides currently on the market. It is a white, waxy solid with a faint sweet smell. It is chemically synthesized in various forms, including powder, granules and pellets. However, it is not naturally occurring. Like other pyrethroids, bifenthrin is chiral; it has different enantiomers which can have different effects. Bifenthrin is found in two enantiomers: 1S-cis-bifenthrin and 1R-cis-bifenthrin. 1S-cis-Bifenthrin is 3-4 times more toxic to humans than 1R-cis-bifenthrin, while the latter is more than 300 times more effective as a pesticide. == Toxicity == === Toxicodynamics === There are two types of pyrethroids: those with and without α-cyanogroup. The neurotoxicity of bifenthrin is based on the affinity to the voltage-gated sodium channels (in insects as well as mammals). The pyrethroids with an α-cyanogroup block the sodium-channel permanently, causing the membrane to be permanently hyperpolarized. The resting potential will not be restored, and no further action potential can be generated. The pyrethroids without an α-cyanogroup, to which bifenthrin belongs, are only able to bind to the sodium channel transiently. This will result in after potentials and eventual continuous firing of axons. The resting potential is not affected by these pyrethroids. Bifenthrin will open the sodium channel for a shorter period than other pyrethroids. The mechanism in mammals and invertebrates is not different, but the effect on mammals is much less due to higher body temperature, higher body volume, and lower affinity of bifenthrin to sodium channels. === Toxicokinetics === Numerous studies have been conducted on the half life of bifenthrin in soil, water, and air under different conditions, such as aerobic or anaerobic, and at different temperatures and pH. It is more likely to remain in the soil and not so much in water (it is hydrophobic), nor in the air (it is unlikely to volatilize because of its physical properties). Because of the water-insolubility of bifenthrin, it will not rapidly cause contamination of ground water. However, some contamination might occur by soil bound bifenthrin to surface water through runoff. For an overview of the environmental degradation of bifenthrin, see figure below. The main path of degradation results in 4’-hydroxy bifenthrin. ==== Biotransformation ==== Pyrethroids are much less toxic in mammals than they are in insects and fish, because mammals have the ability to rapidly break the ester bond in bifenthrin and break the substance into its inactive acid and alcohol components. In humans and rats, bifenthrin is degraded by the cytochrome p450-family. === Toxicology === ==== Toxicity in animals ==== Mosquitoes Bifenthrin is an effective pesticide to use against malaria and filaria vector mosquitoes. It is still effective when resistance to other pyrethroids is found. Mosquito nets and indoor walls can be treated with bifenthrin to keep more mosquitoes away. Bifenthrin is an effectively used insecticide, but the risk is high of it working only for a short time. Mosquitoes can develop a resistance to it, as well. Aquatic life Bifenthrin is hardly soluble in water, so nearly all bifenthrin will stay in the sediment, but it is very harmful to aquatic life. Even in small concentrations, fish and other aquatic animals are affected by bifenthrin. One of the reasons for the high sensitivity of fish is fish have a slow metabolism. Bifenthrin will stay longer in the system of the fish. Another reason for the high sensitivity of fish is the effect of bifenthrin as ATPase-inhibitor. The gills need ATP to control the osmotic balance of oxygen. If the fish is no longer capable of taking up oxygen because ATP can no longer be used, the fish will die. In cold water, bifenthrin is even more dangerous. pH and calcium concentration are also factors that influence the toxicity. Vertebrates are less sensitive to the effects of bifenthrin as ATPase-inhibitor. Bees In bees, the lethal concentration (LC50) of bifenthrin is about 17 mg/L. At sublethal concentrations, bifenthrin reduces the fecundity of bees, decreases the rate at which bee larvae develop into adults, and increases their immature periods. Table of LD50 values ==== Toxicity in humans ==== Bifenthrin and other synthetic pyrethroids are being used in agriculture in increasing amounts because of the high efficiency of these substances in killing insects, the low toxicity for mammals, and good biodegradability. However, because of its success, they are being used more often (also indoors) and high exposure of bifenthrin to humans can occur. ===== Carcinogenicity ===== The U.S. EPA classified bifenthrin as a Category C, possible human carcinogen. This rating is based on an increased rate of urinary bladder tumors in mice, adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the liver in male mice, and bronchoalveolar adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung in some female mice. ===== Potential for neurotoxicity ===== Bifenthrin can be absorbed by humans either by skin contact or ingestion. Skin contact is not toxic, causing only a slight tingling sensation at the point of contact. Ingestion in concentrations below 10−4 M is not toxic. However, commercially available bifenthrin products formulated for household use (such as Ortho Home Defense Max, sold as a liquid pump spray), can induce toxic effects due to other chemicals added to improve the sustainability of bifenthrin or are toxic on their own. Symptoms of excessive exposure are nausea, headaches, hypersensitivity for touch and sound, and irritation of the skin and the eyes. == Regulation == The EPA monitors and regulates the use of pesticides in the United States. Because of its high toxicity to aquatic organisms, bifenthrin is classified as a restricted-use pesticide, meaning it may only be sold to certified pesticide applicators. However, the EPA allows lower concentrations of bifenthrin to be sold to the general public. Bifenthrin has been approved for use against the Rasberry crazy ant in the Houston, Texas, area, under a special ""crisis exemption"" from the Texas Department of Agriculture and the EPA. The chemical is only approved for use in Texas counties experiencing ""confirmed infestations"" of the newly imported, invasive ant species. The EPA has classified bifenthrin as a class C carcinogen, a possible human carcinogen based on a test with mice, which showed increased development of certain tumors. An acute and chronic reference dose (RfD) for bifenthrin has been established, based on animal studies. The reference dose resembles the estimated quantity of a chemical which a person could be exposed to every day (or a one-time exposure for the acute RfD) without any appreciable risk of adverse health effects. The acute reference dose (RfD) for bifenthrin is 0.328 mg/kg bodyweight/day. The chronic reference dose (RfD) for bifenthrin is 0.013 mg/kg bodyweight/day. Bifenthrin was included in a biocide ban proposed by the Swedish Chemicals Agency, because of its carcinogenic effect. This was approved by the European Parliament in 2009. Pesticides containing bifenthrin were withdrawn from use in the European Union. They have since been reinstated. Bifenthrin is banned for agricultural use in European union countries since July 2019 but is still approved for the preservation of chopped wood. == Use == On a large scale, bifenthrin is often used against invasive red fire ants. It is also effective against aphids, worms, other ants, gnats, moths, beetles, earwigs, grasshoppers, mites, midges, spiders, ticks, yellow jackets, maggots, thrips, caterpillars, flies, fleas, spotted lanternflies and termites. It is mostly used in orchards, nurseries, and homes. In the agricultural sector, it is used in great amounts on certain crops, such as corn. About 70% of all hops and raspberries cultured in the United States are treated with bifenthrin. Bifenthrin is used by the textile industry to protect woollen products from insect attack. It was introduced as an alternative to permethrin-based agents, due to greater efficacy against keratinophagous insects, better wash-fastness, and lower aquatic toxicity. === Products === Products containing bifenthrin include Sevin, Transport, Talstar, Maxxthor, Biforce, Capture, Brigade, Bifenthrine, DuoCide insect control, Ortho Home Defense Max, Bifen XTS, Bifen IT, Bifen L/P, Torant, Zipak, Scotts Turf Builder SummerGuard, Wisdom TC Flowable, FMC 54800, Allectus, Ortho Max Pro and OMS3024 and mega wash from green planet and in Australia, Fortune Ultra, Hovex Ultra Low Odor and Surefire Fivestar. == References == == External links == Bifrenthrin general fact sheet - National Pesticide Information Center Pyrethrins and Pyrethroids Fact Sheet - National Pesticide Information Center Bifenthrin in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)",Bifenthrin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.00043752157944254577), ('DU', 0.0), ('ST', -2.861018856492592e-06), ('RI', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.004122687969356775)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', 0.0), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifenthrin?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=92, start_index=12, title='Bifenthrin', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifenthrin?utm_source=openai')])"

Tasquinimod has been mostly studied in prostate cancer, but its mechanism of action suggests that it could be used to treat other cancers. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), formerly called hormone-resistant or hormone-refractory prostate cancer, is prostate cancer that grows despite medical or surgical androgen deprivation therapy. Tasquinimod targets the tumor microenvironment and counteracts cancer development by inhibiting angiogenesis and metastasis and by modulating the immune system. It is now in phase III development, following successful phase II trial outcomes. == History == Collaborative studies by laboratories at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Active Biotech Research AB identified tasquinimod as the lead agent for developing a treatment for prostate cancer. Tasquinimod was one of several second-generation quinoline-3-carboxamide variants synthesized using the drug roquinimex as a starting point, and it performed well in pre-clinical studies of cancer models. In April 2011, Ipsen and Active Biotech entered into a broad partnership for the co-development of tasquinimod for the treatment of cancer. Active Biotech granted Ipsen exclusive rights to commercialize tasquinimod worldwide, except in North and South America and Japan where Active Biotech retained all commercial and marketing rights. == Mechanism of action == Tasquinimod is a novel small-molecule inhibitor that targets the tumor microenvironment by controlling the accumulation and immunosuppressive, pro-angiogenic and pro-metastatic functions of regulatory myeloid cells (also called myeloid-derived suppressor cells). It binds to and inhibits the interactions of S100A9, an immunomodulatory protein that promotes tumor development, influences suppressive and pro-angiogenic cells in the tumor microenvironment, and participates in the establishment of pre-metastatic niches. Tasquinimod may also target the tumor microenvironment by suppressing the tumor hypoxic response, in which genes involved in the adaptation and survival of cells during hypoxia are induced. Tasquinimod reduces tumor angiogenesis; but its anti-angiogenic effects do not appear to be linked to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) neutralization or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition. == Clinical studies == A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study comparing tasquinimod with placebo in 206 men with metastatic CRPC was completed in 2009. The primary endpoint in the trial was to show a difference in the number of patients with disease progression at 6 months. The proportion of patients who were disease progression-free after 6 months was 69% for patients treated with tasquinimod versus 37% for placebo-treated patients (p<0.001). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly improved in patients treated with tasquinimod compared with patients receiving placebo (7.6 vs 3.3 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39, 0.85, p=0.0042). Tasquinimod thus delayed disease progression by about 4.3 months. Overall survival (OS) observed for tasquinimod-treated patients was longer than previously reported in this patient population. Median overall survival was 33.4 months for the tasquinimod group versus 30.4 months for the placebo group (p=0.49). Using a multivariate analysis, treatment with tasquinimod was associated with an OS advantage with a HR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.42, 0.97, p=0.034). It was hypothesized that the prolongation in PFS observed with tasquinimod treatment may lead to a survival advantage in men with metastatic CRPC. Also, a stronger trend for survival benefit was seen in patients with bone metastases; 34.2 for the tasquinimod group vs 27.1 months for the placebo group (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46, 1.17, p=0.19). Analysis of up to 3 years of safety data from phase II studies showed that treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate, manageable and less frequent after 2 months of therapy. Adverse events observed included gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain as well as elevations of some laboratory parameters. A phase III randomized controlled trial called 10TASQ10 to confirm tasquinimod’s effect on disease progression is ongoing. More than 1,200 patients with asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC were successfully enrolled in the study, as planned in the clinical protocol. The study is expected to complete in 2016.

It is a small-molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) of c-Met (HGFR) and VEGFR2, and also inhibits AXL, RET, and FLT3. It was discovered and developed by Exelixis Inc. In November 2012, cabozantinib in its capsule formulation was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the name Cometriq for treating people with medullary thyroid cancer. The capsule form was approved in the European Union for the same purpose in 2014. In April 2016, the FDA granted approval for marketing the tablet formulation (Cabometyx) as a second line treatment for kidney cancer and the same was approved in the European Union in September of that year. The brands Cometriq and Cabometyx have different formulations and are not interchangeable. == Medical uses == Cabozantinib is used in two forms. A capsule form (Cometriq) is used to treat medullary thyroid cancer and a tablet form (Cabometyx) is used to treat renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. In the US, cabozantinib (Cabometyx) is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma; advanced renal cell carcinoma, as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab; hepatocellular carcinoma for people who have been previously treated with sorafenib; and locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible. In March 2025, the US Food and Drug Administration expanded the indication for cabozantinib (Cabometyx) to include the treatment of people aged twelve years of age and older with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; and for people aged twelve years of age and older with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, well-differentiated extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. == Contraindications == Cabozantinib has not been tested in pregnant women; it causes harm to fetuses in rodents. Pregnant women should not take this drug, and women should not become pregnant while taking it. It is not known if cabozantinib is excreted in breast milk. == Adverse effects == In the US, the capsule formulation (Cometriq) carries a black box warning of the risk of holes forming in the stomach or intestines as well as formation of fistulas (tunnels between the GI tract and the skin). The black box also warns against the risk of uncontrolled bleeding. The tablet formulation (Cabometyx) warns of these effects as well. The labels also warn of the risk of clots forming and causing heart attacks or strokes, high blood pressure including hypertensive crisis, osteonecrosis of the jaw, severe diarrhea, skin sloughing off the palms and soles, a syndrome with headaches, confusion, loss of vision, and seizures, and protein appearing in urine. Very common adverse effects (greater than 10% of people) include decreased appetite; low calcium, potassium, phosphate, and magnesium levels; high bilirubin levels; distorted sense of taste, headache, and dizziness; high blood pressure; distorted sense of hearing, earaches and sore throat; diarrhea, nausea, constipation, vomiting, stomach pain and upset stomach, and inflammation of the mouth and lips and a burning sensation in the mouth; skin sloughing off the palms and soles, hair color changes and hair loss, rash, dry skin, and red skin; joint pain and muscle spasms; fatigue and weakness; weight loss, elevated transaminases, higher cholesterol levels, and loss of red and white blood cells. Common adverse effects (between 1% and 10% of people) include abscesses (inside the body, on the skin, and in teeth skin), pneumonia, inflamed hair follicles, fungal infections, low thyroid levels, dehydration, loss of albumin, anxiety, depression, and confusion, peripheral neuropathy, tingling, and tremor, tinnitus, atrial fibrillation, low blood pressure, blocked veins, paleness, chills, fistulas forming in the trachea and esophagus, blood clots in the lungs, and bleeding in the respiratory tract, GI perforation, bleeding in the stomach and intestines, pancreatitis, hemorrhoids, anal fissure, anal inflammation, gallstones, hard skin growths, acne, blisters, abnormal hair growth, loss of skin color and skin flaking, chest pain, blood or protein in urine, wounds that don't heal well, and facial swelling. == Interactions == Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2; drugs that inhibit these enzymes will increase the half-life of cabozantinib and potentially increase its adverse effects; drugs that activate them may cause cabozantinib to be less effective. == Pharmacology == Cabozantinib inhibits the following receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs): c-Met (HGFR), VEGFR2, AXL, RET, and FLT3. == Economics == In 2023, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) identified Cabometyx (cabozantinib), developed by Exelixis, as one of five high-expenditure drugs that experienced significant net price increases without new clinical evidence to justify the hikes. Specifically, Cabometyx's wholesale acquisition cost rose by 7.5%, leading to an additional $86 million in costs to U.S. payers. == History == Cabozantinib was granted orphan drug status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2010, and in February 2017. Exelixis filed a new drug application with the FDA in 2012, and in November 2012, cabozantinib in its capsule formulation was granted marketing approval by the FDA under the name Cometriq for treating people with medullary thyroid cancer. The capsule form was approved in the European Union for the same purpose in 2014. In March 2016, Exelixis licensed to Ipsen worldwide rights (outside the US, Canada, and Japan) to market cabozantinib. In April 2016, the FDA granted approval for marketing the tablet formulation as a second line treatment for kidney cancer and the same was approved in the European Union in September of that year. In December 2017, the FDA granted approval to cabozantinib (Cabometyx) for the treatment of people with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The approval was based on data from CABOSUN (NCT01835158), a randomized, open-label phase II multicenter study in 157 participants with intermediate and poor-risk previously untreated RCC. In January 2019, the FDA approved cabozantinib (Cabometyx) for the treatment of people with hepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib. The approval was based on CELESTIAL (NCT01908426), a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma who had previously received sorafenib and had Child Pugh Class A liver impairment. In March 2025, the FDA approved cabozantinib (Cabometyx) for the treatment of people aged twelve years of age and older with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) and well-differentiated extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (epNET). == Research == Cabozantinib is being researched for efficacy as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cervical cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), urothelial cancer, prostate cancer, gastric and gastroesophageal cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, merkel cell carcinoma, brain cancers (including glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adrenocortical carcinoma, various sarcomas, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), breast cancer, endometrial cancer, neuroendocrine cancers, and neurofibromatosis type 1. == References == == Further reading == Choueiri TK, Escudier B, Powles T, Mainwaring PN, Rini BI, Donskov F, et al.

Herein, we report the first examples of the open 16-vertex  Polyamides (PAM) constructed from N-methylpyrrole (Py), N-methylimidazole (Im), 3-chlorothiophene (Ct), and N-methylhydroxypyrrole (Hp) amino acids comprise a class of synthetic oligomeric ligands that bind to the minor groove of DNA (1, 2). The aromatic heterocycles in the PAM orientate antiparallel with respect to the Watson-Crick base pair (bp), which leads to a specific recognition of DNA sequences (3). The recognition process follows a series of pairing rules; i.e., an ImPy specifies for G·C, a PyPy binds both A·T and T·A, an HpPy discriminates T·A over A·T, and a CtPy prefers T·A over A·T at the N-terminus. These aromatic amino acids can be programmed to a strand with more than two residues to recognize longer DNA sequences; for example, an ImPyPy motif specifies for the five-bp sequence 5’-WGWCW-3’ (W=A, T) instead of 5’-WGWWW-3’ (4). More complicated PAM motifs can be designed by adding small molecules such as β-alanine or γ-aminobutyric acid to covalently link between two antiparallel PAM strands, yielding substantial increases in affinities and specificities. For instance, an eight-ring hairpin motif, which has a γ-aminobutyric acid (γ-turn) linker to connect the carboxylic terminus of one polyamide to the amino terminus of another, exhibits ~100-fold higher affinity for binding a six-bp DNA sequence compared to the unlinked homodimers (4). PAM are molecules that can permeate cell membranes and have been used in targeting a variety of DNA sequences in cell culture (5). The binding of PAM replaces the DNA-binding proteins and thus regulates the transcription of selected genes.

The compound was synthesized by Jerome Horwitz and collaborators in 1964. The formal chemical name is often shortened to less accurate but also less cumbersome phrases such as bromochloroindoxyl galactoside. The X from indoxyl may be the source of the X in the X-gal contraction. X-gal is often used in molecular biology to test for the presence of an enzyme, β-galactosidase, in the place of its usual target, a β-galactoside. It is also used to detect activity of this enzyme in histochemistry and bacteriology. X-gal is one of many indoxyl glycosides and esters that yield insoluble blue compounds similar to indigo dye as a result of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis. A less often used but very similar (chiral) compound is X- α {\displaystyle \alpha } -gal (Xαgal, X-alpha-gal), or 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside, which is hydrolyzed by α-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) instead of β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23). == Uses == X-gal is an analog of lactose, and therefore may be hydrolyzed by the β-galactosidase enzyme which cleaves the β-glycosidic bond in D-lactose. X-gal, when cleaved by β-galactosidase, yields galactose and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole - 1. The latter then spontaneously dimerizes and is oxidized into 5,5'-dibromo-4,4'-dichloro-indigo - 2, an intensely blue product which is insoluble. X-gal itself is colorless, so the presence of blue-colored product may therefore be used as a test for the presence of active β-galactosidase. This also allows for bacterial β-galactosidase (so called lacZ ) to be used as a reporter in various applications. Similarly, Xαgal is used as a reporter compound for α-galactosidase (e.g. Mel1 in yeast). === Reaction === === Cloning === In gene cloning, X-gal is used as a visual indication of whether a cell expresses a functional β-galactosidase enzyme in a technique called blue/white screening. This method of screening is a convenient way of distinguishing a successful cloning product from other unsuccessful ones. The blue/white screening method relies on the principle of α-complementation of the β-galactosidase gene, where a fragment of the lacZ gene (lacZα) in the plasmid can complement another mutant lacZ gene (lacZΔM15) in the cell. Both genes by themselves produce non-functional peptides, however, when expressed together, as when a plasmid containing lacZα is transformed into a lacZΔM15 cells, they form a functional β-galactosidase. The presence of an active β-galactosidase may be detected when cells are grown in plates containing X-gal, the blue-colored product precipitated within cells resulted in the characteristic blue colonies. However, the multiple cloning site, where a gene of interest may be ligated into the plasmid vector, is located within the lacZα gene. Successful ligation therefore disrupts the lacZα gene, α-complementation is therefore also disrupted and no functional β-galactosidase can form, resulting in white colonies. Cells containing successfully ligated insert can then be easily identified by its white coloration from the unsuccessful blue ones. Example of cloning vectors used for this test are pUC19, pBluescript, pGem-T Vectors, and it also requires the use of specific E. coli host strains such as DH5α which carries the mutant lacZΔM15 gene. Often, the plate containing X-Gal also contains IPTG (isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside). IPTG is a chemical structure analogue of lactose. However, IPTG cannot be hydrolyzed by β-galactosidase. IPTG is used as an inducer that binds to lac repressor releasing the DNA and allowing transcription. The presence of IPTG in the agar plate therefore increases the synthesis of β-galactosidase. ==== Variants ==== X-gal has a number of variants, which are similar molecules with slight differences serving mainly to produce colors other than blue as a signal. === Protein-protein interactions === In two-hybrid analysis, β-galactosidase may be used as a reporter to identify proteins that interact with each other. In this method, genome libraries may be screened for protein interaction using yeast or bacterial system. Where there is a successful interaction between proteins being screened, it will result to the binding of an activation domain to a promoter. If the promoter is linked to a lacZ gene, the production of β-galactosidase, which results in the formation of blue-pigmented colonies in the presence of X-gal, will therefore indicate a successful interaction between proteins. This technique may be limited to screening libraries of size of less than around 106. The successful cleavage of X-gal also creates a noticeably foul odor due to the volatilization of indole. == See also == X-Gluc == References ==",X-gal,WIKIPEDIA,"('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.20141352713108063), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IN', -0.04875662550330162), ('DU', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('ST', -1.4305104514278355e-06), ('RI', -7.152555099310121e-07), ('AL', 0.0), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.1002768948674202)])","('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('INDUSTRIAL; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-gal?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=87, start_index=12, title='X-gal', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-gal?utm_source=openai')])"

637,"('Anagrelide (hydrochloride)',)",Medical," New treatment options for polycythemia vera (PV) have recently become available. This article reviews current treatment strategies for PV with a focus on anagrelide and ruxolitinib. The current treatment of PV is directed towards reducing the risk of additional thrombotic events. In addition to phlebotomy and aspirin, patients who are believed to have high-risk disease also receive cytoreductive therapy. Hydroxyurea (HU) and PEG-IFN are most commonly used first-line treatments. The use of anagrelide in PV is limited to situations where patient develops thrombohemorrhagic episodes in the setting of extreme thrombocytosis. The role of ruxolitinib in treatment of PV has not been fully established but based on a recently completed Phase III trial it will likely serve as a second-line option for patients with systemic symptoms. HU and PEG-IFN are frontline therapies for patients with high-risk PV. Anagrelide use should be restricted to patients with clinical consequences of extreme thrombocytosis. Ruxolitinib is a treatment option for patients who fail frontline therapies. However, long-term effects and toxicities are not yet fully known. Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm. This multicentre, Phase 3b, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority study investigated the cardiac safety, efficacy and tolerability of first-line treatment with anagrelide or hydroxyurea in high-risk ET patients for up to 3 years. Eligible patients aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of high-risk ET confirmed by bone marrow biopsy within 6 months of randomisation received anagrelide (n = 75) or hydroxyurea (n = 74), administered twice daily. Treatment dose for either compound was titrated to the lowest dose needed to achieve a response. Planned primary outcome measures were change in left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline over time and platelet count at Month 6. Planned secondary outcome measures were platelet count change from baseline at Months 3 and 36; percentage of patients with complete or partial response; time to complete or partial response; number of patients with thrombohaemorrhagic events; and changes in white blood cell count or red blood cell count over time. Neither treatment altered cardiac function. There were no significant differences in adverse events between treatment groups, and no reports of malignant transformation. The incidence of disease-related thrombotic or haemorrhagic events was numerically higher in anagrelide-treated patients. Both treatments controlled platelet counts at 6 months, with the majority of patients experiencing complete or partial responses. In conclusion, these results suggest that long-term treatment with anagrelide is not associated with adverse effects on cardiac function. This is one of the few studies using left ventricular ejection fraction assessment and central biopsy reading to confirm the diagnosis of ET.Trial registration number: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00202644. To ascertain the role of patient age as an influencing factor in the pharmacokinetics of anagrelide and to clarify whether different dosing is required in young (18 - 50 years) vs. elderly (≥ 65 years) patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). This Phase II, multicenter, open-label study compared the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of anagrelide and its active metabolite, 3-hydroxy-anagrelide, in young and elderly patients with ET. Three days prior to pharmacokinetic assessment, patients divided their normal daily anagrelide into a structured twice-daily dosing (BID) schedule. Serial blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis over a 12-h dosing interval. Anagrelide and 3-hydroxy-anagrelide plasma concentrations were normalized to a common dose (1 mg BID) to control for dosing differences between patients. Patients were monitored routinely for adverse events (AEs) and vital signs. A total of 24 patients (12 young; 12 elderly) completed the study. The dose-normalized anagrelide maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve over one dosing interval (AUCτ), were higher in elderly patients compared with young patients (Cmax: 3.63 vs. 2.66 ng/ml; p = 0.09, AUCτ: 10.3 vs. 6.4 ng×h/ml; p = 0.01). In contrast, the dose-normalized 3-hydroxy-anagrelide Cmax and AUCτ were lower in the elderly patients when compared with young patients (Cmax: 4.19 vs. 7.26 ng/ml; p = 0.02, AUCτ: 17.4 vs. 27.6 ng×h/ml; p = 0.03).

It is available as a generic medication. == Medical uses == Nitisinone is used to treat hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) in patients from all ages, in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine. Since its first use for this indication in 1991, it has replaced liver transplantation as the first-line treatment for this ultra rare condition. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse reactions (>1%) for nitisinone are elevated tyrosine levels, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, keratitis, photophobia, eye pain, blepharitis, cataracts, granulocytopenia, epistaxis, pruritus, exfoliative dermatitis, dry skin, maculopapular rash and alopecia.has several negative side effects; these include but are not limited to: bloated abdomen, dark urine, abdominal pain, feeling of tiredness or weakness, headache, light-colored stools, loss of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, and yellow-colored eyes or skin. == Mechanism of action == The mechanism of action of nitisinone involves inhibition of 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). This is a treatment for patients with Tyrosinemia type 1 as it prevents the formation of 4-Maleylacetoacetic acid and fumarylacetoacetic acid, which have the potential to be converted to succinyl acetone, a toxin that damages the liver and kidneys. This causes the symptoms of Tyrosinemia type 1 experienced by untreated patients. Alkaptonuria is caused when an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase (HGD) is faulty, leading to a buildup of homogenisate. Alkaptonuria patients treated with nitisinone produce far less HGA than those not treated (95% less in the urine), because nitisinone inhibits HPPD, resulting in less homogenisate accumulation. Clinical trials are ongoing to test whether nitisinone can prevent ochronosis experienced by older alkaptonuria patients. == History == Nitisinone was discovered as part of a program to develop a class of herbicides called HPPD inhibitors. It is a member of the benzoylcyclohexane-1,3-dione family of herbicides, which are chemically derived from a natural phytotoxin, leptospermone, obtained from the Australian bottlebrush plant (Callistemon citrinus). HPPD is essential in plants and animals for catabolism, or breaking apart, of tyrosine. In plants, preventing this process leads to destruction of chlorophyll and the death of the plant. In toxicology studies of the herbicide, it was discovered that it had activity against HPPD in rats and humans. In Type I tyrosinemia, a different enzyme involved in the breakdown of tyrosine, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase is mutated and doesn't work, leading to very harmful products building up in the body. Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase acts on tyrosine after HPPD does, so scientists working on making herbicides in the class of HPPD inhibitors hypothesized that inhibiting HPPD and controlling tyrosine in the diet could treat this disease. A series of small clinical trials attempted with one of their compounds, nitisinone, were conducted and were successful, leading to nitisinone being brought to market as an orphan drug Swedish Orphan International, which was later acquired by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (Sobi). == References ==",Orfadin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.537788011773955e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0004353767435532063)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([orfadin.com](https://www.orfadin.com/?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=68, start_index=9, title='Orfadin® (nitisinone) for hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1)', type='url_citation', url='https://www.orfadin.com/?utm_source=openai')])"

It is recommended to be given with artesunate to reduce the risk of resistance. Due to the risk of rare but serious side effects, it is not generally recommended to prevent malaria. Though, the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2013 recommended use for seasonal preventive in children at high risk in combination with sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine. Amodiaquine is a 4-aminoquinoline compound related to chloroquine. The side effects of amodiaquine are generally minor to moderate and are similar to those of chloroquine. Rarely liver problems or low blood cell levels may occur. When taken in excess headaches, trouble seeing, seizures, and cardiac arrest may occur. The WHO recommends its use for pregnant women during the second and third trimester as well as during lactation, but reports that evidence for use in the first trimester is still insufficient. Amodiaquine was first made in 1948. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. While not available in the United States, it is widely available in Africa. == Medical uses == Amodiaquine has become an important drug in the combination therapy for malaria treatment in Africa. It is often used in combination with artesunate as a by mouth artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Amodiaquine has also been found to work against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains of malaria, though there is geographic variation in its activity against chloroquine-resistant strains. It is also used in combination with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. == Interactions == There have been reports of increased liver toxicity in people with HIV/AIDS on zidovudine or efavirenz when treated with amodiaquine-containing ACT regimens, therefore it is recommended that these people avoid amodiaquine. == Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics == It is bioactivated hepatically to its primary metabolite, N-desethylamodiaquine, by the cytochrome p450 enzyme CYP2C8. Among amodiaquine users, several rare but serious side effects have been reported and linked to variants in the CYP2C8 alleles. CYP2C8*1 is characterized as the wild-type allele, which shows an acceptable safety profile, while CYP2C8*2, *3 and *4 all show a range of ""poor metabolizer"" phenotypes. People who are poor metabolizers of amodiaquine display lower treatment efficacy against malaria, as well as increased toxicity. Several studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence of CYP2C8 alleles amongst malaria patients in East Africa, and have tentatively shown the variant alleles have significant prevalence in that population. About 3.6% of the population studied showed high risk for a poor reaction to or reduced treatment outcomes when treated with amodiaquine.

644,"('Climbazole', 'Climbazol', 'Baypival', 'Baysan', 'Crinipan ad')",Medical,"Beit She'an (Hebrew: בֵּית שְׁאָן ), also known as Beisan (Arabic: بيسان ), or Beth-shean, is a town in the Northern District of Israel. The town lies at the Beit She'an Valley about 120 m (394 feet) below sea level. Beit She'an is believed to be one of the oldest cities in the region. It has played an important role in history due to its geographical location at the junction of the Jordan River Valley and the Jezreel Valley. Beth She'an's ancient tell contains remains beginning in the Chalcolithic period. When Canaan came under Imperial Egyptian rule in the Late Bronze Age, Beth She'an served as a major Egyptian administrative center. The city came under Israelite rule in the monarchic period. It probably fell under Philistine control during the time of Saul, when, according to the Bible, his body was displayed there along with his sons. During the Hellenistic period, the settlement was known as Scythopolis (Ancient Greek: Σκυθόπολις). After the region came under Roman rule, Scythopolis gained imperial free status and was the leading city of the Decapolis. A multi-cultural metropolis under Byzantine rule, it served as the capital of the province of Palaestina Secunda, and had a mixed population of Christians, pagans, Jews and Samaritans. After the Arab conquest of the Levant, and following a series of devastating earthquakes (most notably in 749), the city lost its prominence, and became a medium-sized country town. The population of the town was completely changed from 1948 to 1950. It had been entirely Muslim and Christian, designated to be part of the Jewish state in the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, and was captured by the Haganah in May 1948. The battle over the town during Operation Gideon caused most of its inhabitants to flee, and the remainder were expelled. The town was then resettled by Jewish immigrants. Today, Beit She'an serves as a regional centre for the towns in the Beit She'an Valley. The ancient city ruins are now protected within the Beit She'an National Park. The town is located near the Jordan River Crossing, one of three crossing points between Israel and Jordan. == Geography == Beit She'an's location has always been strategically significant, due to its position at the junction of the Jordan River Valley and the Jezreel Valley, essentially controlling access from Jordan and the inland to the coast, as well as from Jerusalem and Jericho to the Galilee. Beit She'an is situated on Highway 90, the north–south road which runs the length of the eastern edge of Israel and the West Bank. The city stretches over an area of 7 square kilometers with a substantial national park in the north of the city. Beit She'an has a population of 20,000. Today the town is under the administration of the Emek HaMa'ayanot Regional Council. == Climate == Beit She'an has a hot semi-arid climate, with mild, rainy winters and very hot, dry summers. Beit She'an is one of the hottest cities in Israel, due to its location in Beit She'an valley, which is part of the Jordan Valley. The annual precipitation is 305 mm, which make it the driest city in Northern Israel. The cause of the relative aridity is the location in the rain shadow of the Samaria mountains and Mount Gilboa, which blocks some of the rain from reaching the area. == History of archaeological exploration == The University of Pennsylvania carried out excavations of ancient Beit She'an in 1921–1933. Relics from the Egyptian period were discovered, most of them now exhibited in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. Some are in the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia. Excavations at the site were resumed by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1983 and then again from 1989 to 1996 under the direction of Amihai Mazar. The excavations have revealed no less than 18 successive ancient towns. == History == === Prehistory (Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods) === In 1933, archaeologist G.M. FitzGerald, under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, carried out a ""deep cut"" on Tell el-Hisn (""castle hill""), the large tell, or mound, of Beth She'an, in order to determine the earliest occupation of the site. His results suggest that settlement began in the Late Neolithic or Early Chalcolithic periods (sixth to fifth millennia BC.) Occupation continued intermittently throughout the Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, with a likely gap during the Late Chalcolithic period (ca. 4000–3300 BC). === Early Bronze Age === Settlement seems to have resumed at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age I (3200–3000) and continues throughout this period, is then missing during the Early Bronze Age II, and then resumes in the Early Bronze Age III. === Middle Bronze Age === A large cemetery on the northern mound was in use from the Bronze Age to Byzantine times. Canaanite graves dating from 2000 to 1600 BC were discovered there in 1926. === Late Bronze Age === ==== Egyptian period ==== After the conquest of Beit She'an by Pharaoh Thutmose III in the 15th century BCE, as recorded in an inscription at Karnak, the small town on the summit of the mound became the center of the Egyptian administration of the region. The Egyptian newcomers changed the organization of the town and left a great deal of material culture behind. A large Canaanite temple (39 m (128 ft) in length) excavated by the University of Pennsylvania Museum (Penn Museum) may date from about the same period as Thutmose III's conquest, though the Hebrew University excavations suggest that it dates to a later period. Artifacts of potential cultic significance were found around the temple. Based on an Egyptian stele found at the place, the temple was dedicated to the god Mekal. The Hebrew University excavations determined that this temple was built on the site of an earlier one. One of the most important finds near the temple is the Lion and Lioness (or a dog) stela, currently in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, which depicts the two playing. During the three hundred years of rule by the New Kingdom of Egypt, the population of Beit She'an appears to have been primarily Egyptian administrative officials and military personnel. The town was completely rebuilt, following a new layout, during the 19th dynasty. The Penn Museum excavations uncovered two important stelae from the period of Seti I and a monument of Ramesses II. One of those steles is particularly interesting because, according to William F. Albright, it testifies to the presence of a Hebrew population: the Habiru, which Seti I protected from an Asiatic tribe. Pottery was produced locally, but some was made to mimic Egyptian forms. Other Canaanite goods existed alongside Egyptian imports, or locally made Egyptian-style objects. The 20th Dynasty saw the construction of large administrative buildings in Beit She'an, including ""Building 1500"", a small palace for the Egyptian governor. During the 20th Dynasty, invasions of the ""Sea Peoples"" upset Egypt's control over the Eastern Mediterranean. Though the exact circumstances are unclear, the entire site of Beit She'an was destroyed by fire around 1150 BC. The Egyptians did not attempt to rebuild their administrative center and finally lost control of the region. Over 50 clay anthropoid coffins were found at the site mainly from the 13th and 12th centuries BC. Most are in the typical Egyptian style but some are of a ""grotesque"" type linked to the Aegean which caused earlier archaeologists to suggest they were of the ""sea peoples"" which pharaoh Ramses III claimed to have resettled in the region. === Iron Age === An Iron Age I (1200–1000 BC) Canaanite city was constructed on the site of the Egyptian center shortly after its destruction. According to the Hebrew Bible, around 1000 BC the town became part of the larger Israelite kingdom. 1 Kings (1 Kings 4:12) refers to Beit She'an as part of the kingdom of Solomon, though the historical accuracy of this list is debated. Nevertheless, recent archaeomagnetic dates suggest that the first Israelite urban settlement was established either during the Solomonic period or in the pre-Omride phase of the early kingdom of Israel at the latest, and that it was probably destroyed around 935–900 BC. The Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel under Tiglath-Pileser III (732 BC) brought about the destruction of Beit She'an by fire. Minimal reoccupation occurred until the Hellenistic period. ==== Biblical narrative ==== The Hebrew Bible identifies Beit She'an as where the bodies of King Saul and three of his sons were hung by the Philistines after the Battle of Gilboa. According to the biblical narrative, the battle was fought at Mount Gilboa, around the year 1010 BC. The Philistines prevailed and Saul died in battle together with three of his sons, Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchishua, (1 Samuel and 1 Chronicles, 1 Samuel 31; 1 Chronicles 10). 1 Samuel 31:10 states that ""the victorious Philistines hung the body of King Saul on the walls of Beit She'an"". Later, the people of Jabesh-Gilead took the remnants, carried them into their city, and burned them. No archeological evidence was found of a Philistine occupation of Beit She'an, but it is possible the force only passed there. === Hellenistic period === The Hellenistic period saw the reoccupation of the site of Beit She'an under the new name ""Scythopolis"" (Ancient Greek: Σκυθόπολις), meaning ""City of the Scythians"", possibly named after the Scythian mercenaries who settled there as veterans. Little is known about the Hellenistic city, but during the 3rd century BCE a large temple was constructed on the tell. It is unknown which deity was worshipped there, but the temple continued to be used during Roman times. Graves dating from the Hellenistic period are simple, singular rock-cut tombs. From 301 to 198 BCE the area was under the control of the Ptolemies, and Beit She'an is mentioned in 3rd–2nd century BCE written sources describing the Syrian Wars between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid dynasties. In 198 BCE the Seleucids finally conquered the region. === Roman period === In 63 BCE, Pompey made Judea a part of the Roman Republic. Beit She'an was refounded and rebuilt by Gabinius. The town center shifted from the summit of the mound, or tell, to its slopes. Scythopolis prospered and became the leading city of the Decapolis, the only one west of the Jordan River. The city flourished under the ""Pax Romana"", as evidenced by high-level urban planning and extensive construction, including the best preserved Roman theatre of ancient Samaria, as well as a hippodrome, a cardo and other trademarks of the Roman influence. Mount Gilboa, 7 km (4 mi) away, provided dark basalt blocks, as well as water (via an aqueduct) to the town. Beit She'an is said to have sided with the Romans during the early phase of the First Jewish–Roman War in 66 CE. Excavations have focused less on the Roman period ruins, so not much is known about this period. The Penn. University Museum excavation of the northern cemetery, however, did uncover significant finds. The Roman period tombs are of the loculus type: a rectangular rock-cut spacious chamber with smaller chambers (loculi) cut into its side. Bodies were placed directly in the loculi, or inside sarcophagi which were placed in the loculi. A sarcophagus with an inscription identifying its occupant in Greek as ""Antiochus, the son of Phallion"", may have held the cousin of Herod the Great. One of the most interesting Roman grave finds was a bronze incense shovel with the handle in the form of an animal leg, or hoof, now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum. === Byzantine period === Copious archaeological remains were found dating to the Byzantine Empire (330–636) and were excavated by the Penn Museum from 1921 to 1923. A rotunda church was constructed on top of the tell, and a wall enclosed the entire city. Textual sources mention several other churches in the town. Scythopolis was primarily Christian, as attested to by many churches, but evidence of Jewish habitation and a Samaritan synagogue indicate established communities of these minorities. The pagan temples in the city center went out of use, but the nymphaeum and the thermae were restored, and a Sigma-shaped complex was added. Many of the buildings of Scythopolis were damaged in the 363 Galilee earthquake. In 409, Syria Palaestina was divided and Scythopolis became the capital of the northern region of Palaestina Secunda. and the See of Scythopolis was the Metropolitan archdiocese. Dedicatory inscriptions indicate a preference for donations to religious buildings. Many colourful mosaics were preserved, such as that featuring the zodiac in the Lady Mary's Monastery, or the one with a temple menorah and the phrase shalom in the House of Leontius synagogue. The Samaritan synagogue's mosaic was unique in its aniconic abstention from human or animal images, instead using floral and geometrical motifs. Elaborate decorations were also found in the settlement's many luxurious villas, and in the 6th century especially, the city reached its maximum size of 40,000 and spread beyond its period city walls. The Byzantine-era portion of the northern cemetery was excavated in 1926. The tombs from this period consisted of small rock-cut halls with vaulted graves on three sides. A great variety of objects were found in the tombs, including terracotta figurines possibly depicting the Virgin and Child, many terracotta lamps, glass mirrors, bells, tools, knives, finger rings, iron keys, glass beads, bone hairpins, and many other items. Influential Christian personalities who lived or passed through Scythopolis are Procopius of Scythopolis (died July 7, 303), Cyril of Scythopolis (ca. 525–559), Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310/320–403) and Joseph of Tiberias (c. 285 – c. 356) who met there around the year 355. === Early Muslim period === In 634, Byzantine forces were defeated by the Rashidun army under the Rashid caliph Umar, and the city reverted to its Semitic name, being named Baysan in Arabic. The day of victory came to be known in Arabic as Yawm Baysan ""day of Baysan."" The city was not damaged; newly arrived Muslims lived alongside the Christian population until the 8th century. The town formed one of the districts of Jund al-Urdunn, itself a part of the Bilad al-Sham, until the Crusades. The city declined; structures were built in the streets, narrowing them to mere alleys, and makeshift shops were opened among the colonnades. The city reached a low point in the 8th century, witnessed by the removal of marble for producing lime, the blocking off of the main street, and the conversion of a main plaza into a cemetery. However, some recently discovered counter-evidence may be offered to this picture of decline. In common with state-directed building work carried out in other towns and cities in the region during the 720s, Baysan's commercial infrastructure was refurbished: its main colonnaded market street, once thought to date to the sixth century, is now known—based on a mosaic inscription—to be a redesign dating from the time of the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–43). Al-Bakri of al-Andalus noted that the wine produced there was delicious. On January 18, 749, Umayyad Baysan was devastated by a catastrophic earthquake. A few residential neighborhoods grew among the ruins, probably established by the survivors, but the city never recovered its magnificence. The city center moved to the southern hill, where the Crusaders later built a castle. Jerusalemite historian al-Muqaddasi visited Baysan in 985, during the Abbasid Caliphate and wrote that it was ""on the river, with plentiful palm trees, and water, though somewhat heavy (brackish.)"" He further noted that Baysan was notable for its indigo, rice, dates, and grape syrup known as dibs. Its principal mosque was situated in the center of its marketplace. === Crusader period === In the Crusader period, the Lordship of Bessan was occupied by Tancred, Prince of Galilee in 1099; it was never part of the Principality of Galilee, despite its location, but became a royal domain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1101, probably until around 1120. According to the Lignages d'Outremer, the first Crusader lord of Bessan once it became part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was Adam, a younger son of Robert III de Béthune, peer of Flanders and head of the House of Béthune. His descendants were known by the family name de Bessan. It occasionally passed back under royal control until new lords were created. The town became part of the Belvoir fiefdom. A small Crusader fortress surrounded by a moat was built in the area southeast of the Roman theatre, where the diminished town had relocated after the 749 earthquake. The fortress was destroyed by Saladin in 1183. During the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut, retreating Mongol forces passed near the town, but did not enter it. === Mamluk period === Under Mamluk rule, Beit She'an was the principal town in the district of Damascus and a relay station for the postal service between Damascus and Cairo. It was also the capital of sugar cane processing for the region. Jisr al-Maqtu'a, ""the truncated/cut-off bridge"", a bridge consisting of a single arch spanning 25 ft (7.6 m) and hung 50 ft (15 m) above a stream, was built during that period. === Ottoman period === During this period, the inhabitants of Baysan were mainly Muslim, but there were some Jews. The 14th century topographer Ishtori Haparchi settled there and completed his work ""Bulb and Flower"" (Hebrew: כפתור ופרח, romanized: Kaftor vaFeraḥ) in 1322, the first Hebrew book on the geography of the Land of Israel. During the 400 years of Ottoman rule, Baysan lost its regional importance. During the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II when the Jezreel Valley railway, which was part of the Haifa to Damascus extension of the Hejaz railway was constructed, a limited revival took place. The local peasant population was largely impoverished by the Ottoman feudal land system, which leased tracts of land to tenants and collected taxes from them for their use. The Swiss–German traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt described Beisan in 1812: ""The present village of Bysan contains seventy or eighty houses; its inhabitants are in a miserable condition, from being exposed to the depredations of the Bedouins of the Ghor, to whom they also pay a heavy tribute."" In 1870/1871, an Ottoman census listed the village in the nahiya (sub-district) of Shafa al-Shamali. In the early 20th century, though still a tiny and obscure village, Beisan was known for its plentiful water supply, fertile soil, and producing olives, grapes, figs, almonds, apricots, and apples. === British Mandate period === Under the Mandate, the city was the center of the District of Baysan. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Beit She'an (Baisan) had a population of 1,941, consisting of 1,687 Muslims, 41 Jews and 213 Christians. In 1934, Lawrence of Arabia noted that ""Bisan is now a purely Arab village,"" where ""very fine views of the river can be had from the housetops."" He further noted that ""many nomad and Bedouin encampments, distinguished by their black tents, were scattered about the riverine plain, their flocks and herds grazing round them."" Beisan was home to a mainly Mizrahi Jewish community of 95 until 1936, when the 1936–1939 Arab revolt saw Beisan serve as a center of Arab attacks on Jews in Palestine. In 1938, after learning of the murder of his close friend and Jewish leader Haim Sturmann, Orde Wingate led his men on an offensive in the Arab section of Baysan, the rebels’ suspected base. According to population surveys conducted in British Mandate Palestine, Beisan consisted of 5,080 Muslim Arabs out of a population of 5,540 (92% of the population), with the remainder being listed as Christians. In 1945, the surrounding District of Baysan consisted of 16,660 Muslims (67%), 7,590 Jews (30%), and 680 Christians (3%); and Arabs owned 44% of land, Jews owned 34%, and 22% constituted public lands. The 1947 UN Partition Plan allocated Beisan and most of its district to the proposed Jewish state. === 1948 Palestine war === Jewish forces and local Bedouins first clashed during the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine in February and March 1948, part of Operation Gideon, itself part of Plan Dalet. Joseph Weitz, a leading Yishuv figure, wrote in his diary on May 4, 1948, that, ""The Beit Shean Valley is the gate for our state in the Galilee...[I]ts clearing is the need of the hour."" Beisan, then an Arab village, fell to the Jewish militias three days before the end of the Mandate. After Israel's Declaration of Independence in May 1948, during intense shelling by Syrian border units, followed by the recapture of the valley by the Haganah, the Arab inhabitants fled across the Jordan River. The property and buildings abandoned after the conflict were then held by the State of Israel. Most Arab Christians relocated to Nazareth. Historian Saleh Abdel Jawad claims that Beisan experienced a massacre via aerial bombardment by Israeli forces that was ""entirely without military justification"" and which was used as ""a tool of expulsion"". === State of Israel === A ma'abarah (immigration camp) inhabited mainly by North African Jewish olim (immigrants) was erected in Beit She'an, and it later became a development town. From 1969, Beit She'an was a target for Katyusha rockets and mortar attacks from Jordan. In the 1974 Beit She'an attack, militants of the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, took over an apartment building and murdered a family of four. In 1999, Beit She'an was incorporated as a city. Geographically, it lies in the middle of the Emek HaMaayanot Regional Council, formerly the Beit She'an Valley Regional Council. Beit She'an was the hometown and political power base of David Levy, an Israeli politician. During the Second Intifada, in the 2002 Beit She'an attack, six Israelis were killed and over 30 were injured by two Palestinian militants, who opened fire and threw grenades at a polling station in the center of Bet She'an where party members were voting in the Likud primary. == Seismicity == Beit She'an is located above the Dead Sea Transform (a fault system that forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east) and is one of the cities in Israel most at risk to earthquakes (along with Kiryat Shmona, Safed, Tiberias, and Eilat). Historically, the city was destroyed in the Golan earthquake of 749. == Demographics == According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the population of the municipality was 19,073 at the end of 2022. In 2005, the ethnic makeup of the city was 99.5% Jewish and other non-Arab (97.3% Jewish), with no significant Arab population. See Population groups in Israel. The population breakdown by gender was 8,200 males and 8,100 females. The age distribution was as follows: == Economy == Beit She'an is a center of cotton-growing, and many of residents are employed in the cotton fields of the surrounding kibbutzim. Other local industries include a textile mill and clothing factory. === Tourism === Ancient Beit She'an, one of the most spectacular Roman and Byzantine sites in Israel, is a major tourist attraction. When the ancient city of Beit She'an was opened to the public in the 1990s and turned into a national park, tourism became a major sector of the economy. == Transportation == Beit She'an had a railway station that opened in 1904 on the Jezreel Valley railway which was an extension of the Hejaz railway. This station closed together with the rest of the Jezreel Valley railway in 1948. In 2011–2016 the valley railway was rebuilt and the new Beit She'an railway station, located at the same site as the historical station was opened. Passenger service offered at the station connects the city to Afula, Haifa and destinations in between. In addition to passenger service, the station also includes a freight rail terminal. == Sports == The local football club, Hapoel Beit She'an spent several seasons in the top division in the 1990s, but folded in 2006 after several relegations. Maccabi Beit She'an currently plays in Liga Bet. == Notable people == Naim Ateek Ishtori Haparchi David Levy Jackie Levy Orly Levy, politician (birthplace) == Twin towns – sister cities == Beit She'an is twinned with: Cleveland, United States (Since 2019) == Historic images == == See also == Scythopolis (see), the city's former archbishopric, now a Catholic Metropolitan titular see, aka Scitopoli Cities of the ancient Near East Jordan River Crossing Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem == References == == Bibliography == Barron, J.

645,"('Afoxolaner', 'Afoxolaner [usan:inn]', 'Afoxolaner (usan)', 'Ex-a3267')",Medical,"Afoxolaner (INN) is an insecticide and acaricide that belongs to the isoxazoline chemical compound group. It acts as an antagonist at GABA-receptors (those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid) and other ligand-gated chloride channels. Isoxazolines, among the chloride channel modulators, bind to a distinct and unique target site within the insect GABA-gated chloride channels, thereby blocking pre-and post-synaptic transfer of chloride ions across cell membranes. Prolonged afoxolaner-induced hyperexcitation results in uncontrolled activity of the central nervous system and death of insects and acarines. == Safety == === Toxicity for mammals === According to clinical studies performed prior to marketing: The oral toxicity profile of afoxolaner consists of a diuretic effect (rats only), effects secondary to a reduction in food consumption (rats and rabbits only) and occasional vomiting and/or diarrhea (dogs, 120 and 200 mg/kg bodyweight (bw)) following high oral doses. No treatment-related effects on vomiting or diarrhea were noted following oral doses of up to 31.5 mg/kg bw in the pivotal target animal safety study, nor in the EU field trial. mild gastrointestinal effects (vomiting, diarrhea), pruritus, lethargy, anorexia, and neurological signs (convulsions, ataxia and muscle tremors) have been reported in less than 0.1% of 10,000 animals treated, including isolated reports, most reported adverse reactions being self-limiting and of short duration, (in combination with milbemycin oxime): vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, and pruritus were observed in 0.2 to 1% of 10,000 animals treated and were generally self-limiting and of short duration, In vitro studies reported that afoxolaner can bind to dopamine and norepinephrine cellular transport receptor systems and the CB1 receptor; inhibition of these catecholaminergic systems and certain types of competitive binding at CB1 receptors may mediate pharmacodynamic effects of diuresis, decreased food consumption, and decreased body weight in animals. According to post-marketing safety experience: (in combination with milbemycin oxime): erythema and neurological signs (convulsions, ataxia and muscle tremors) have been reported in less than 0.1% of 10,000 animals treated, including isolated reports, The US Food and Drug Administration FDA reports that some drugs in this class (isoxazolines), including afoxolaner, can have adverse neurologic effects on some dogs, such as muscle tremors, ataxia, and convulsions. Extralabel use of afoxolaner in a pet pig has been described without any adverse effects. Experimental use in commercial pigs also did not result in any adverse effects. === Selectivity in insects over mammalians === In vivo studies (repeat-dose toxicology in laboratory animals, target animal safety, field studies) provided by MERIAL, the company that produces afoxolaner-derivative medicines, did not show evidence of neurological or behavioural effects suggestive of GABA-mediated perturbations in mammals. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) therefore concluded that binding to dog, rat or human GABA receptors is expected to be low for afoxolaner. Selectivity for insect over mammalian GABA-receptors has been demonstrated for other isoxazolines. The selectivity might be explained by the number of pharmacological differences that exist between GABA-gated chloride channels of insects and vertebrates. == Legal status == The marketing authorization was granted by the European Medicines Agency in February 2014, for Nexgard, and in January 2015, for Nexgard Spectra. == Brand names == Afoxolaner is the active ingredient of the veterinary medicinal products Nexgard, Frontpro, and Nexgard Spectra (in combination with milbemycin oxime).

Total 12 impurities at levels ranging from 0.05% to 0.5% were detected by isocratic reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using RI detector. The molecular weights of impurities were determined by LC-MS analysis. Two impurities were starting materials and the remaining impurities were isolated from crude samples/enriched mother liquors using reverse-phase preparative HPLC. Based on the spectral data the structures of these impurities were characterized as, clindamycin palmitate sulphoxides alpha-/beta-isomers (impurity I); clindamycin laurate (impurity II); lincomycin palmitate (impurity III); clindamycin myristate (impurity IV); epiclindamycin palmitate (impurity V); clindamycin palmitate 3-isomer (impurity VI); clindamycin pentadecanoate (impurity VII); clindamycin B-palmitate (impurity VIII); clindamycin heptadecanoate (impurity IX) and clindamycin stearate (impurity X). Structural elucidation of all impurities by spectral data ((1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and IR) and formation of these impurities have been discussed in detail. The aims of the current study were to develop and evaluate clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride (CPH) 3D-printed tablets (printlets) manufactured by selective laser sintering (SLS). Optimization of the formulation was performed by studying the effect of formulation and process factors on critical quality attributes of the printlets. The independent factors studied were laser scanning speed, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), and lactose monohydrate (LMH) concentration. The responses measured were printlets weight, hardness, disintegration time (DT), and dissolution in 30 min. The printlets were characterized for content uniformity, chemical interactions, crystallinity, drug distribution, morphology, and porosity. The laser scanning speed showed statistically significant effects on all the studied dependent responses (p < 0.05). MCC showed statistically significant effects on hardness, DT, and dissolution (p < 0.05), while LMH showed statistically significant effect on hardness and dissolution (p < 0.05). The model was validated by an independent formulation, and empirical values were in close agreement with model-predicted values. X-ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry data suggested a decrease in crystallinity of the LMH in the printlets. X-ray micro-CT scanning showed porous microstructure of the printlets with a porosity 24.4% and 31.1% for the printlets printed at 200 and 300 mm/s laser speed, respectively.

648,"('Cangrelor (tetrasodium)', 'Cangrelor', 'Kengreal', 'Cangrelor free acid', 'Kengrexal')",Medical,"Cangrelor, sold under the brand name Kengreal among others, is a P2Y12 inhibitor FDA approved as of June 2015 as an antiplatelet drug for intravenous application. Some P2Y12 inhibitors are used clinically as effective inhibitors of adenosine diphosphate-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Unlike clopidogrel (Plavix), which is a prodrug, cangrelor is an active drug not requiring metabolic conversion. Poor interim results led to the abandonment of the two CHAMPION clinical trials in mid-2009. The BRIDGE study, for short term use prior to surgery, continues. The CHAMPION PHOENIX trial was a randomized study of over 11,000 patients published in 2013. It found usefulness of cangrelor in patients getting cardiac stents. Compared with clopidogrel given around the time of stenting, intravenous ADP-receptor blockade with cangrelor significantly reduced the rate of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Reviewers have questioned the methodology of the trial. == Medical use == According to phase III randomized trials, a cangrelor–clopidogrel combination is safe and has been found to be more effective than standard clopidogrel treatment at reducing ischemic events in the heart, without increasing major bleeding in the treatment of stenotic coronary arteries. The advantages of this drug combination are most prominent in patients with myocardial infarction. Available antiplatelet drugs have delayed onset and offset of action. Since cangrelor's effects are immediate and quickly reversed, it is a more desirable drug for elective treatment of stenotic coronary arteries, high risk acute coronary syndromes treated with immediate coronary stenting, and for bridging those surgery patients who require P2Y12 inhibition. Evidence regarding cangrelor therapy is limited by the lack studies assessing cangrelor administration in conjunction with either prasugrel or ticagrelor. Cangrelor been approved for adults undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). == Pharmacology == Cangrelor is a high-affinity, reversible inhibitor of P2Y12 receptors that causes almost complete inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregate. It is a modified ATP derivative stable to enzymatic degradation. It does not require metabolic conversion to an active metabolite. This allows cangrelor's immediate effect after infusion, and the therapeutic effects can be maintained with continuous infusion. The pharmacokinetics of cangrelor has allowed it to rapidly achieve steady-state concentrations with a clearance of 50 L/h and a half-life of 2.6 to 3.3 minutes. Cessation of its administration is associated with rapid removal, and normal platelet function is restored within 1 hour. == Adverse effects == Despite fewer bleeding events during cardiac surgery, cangrelor carries the risk of potential autoimmune reactions manifesting as breathlessness. Potential mechanisms for dyspnea following cangrelor treatment include: repeated binding and unbinding cycles, impaired platelet turnover, and lung sequestration or apoptosis of overloaded destructive platelets. The dyspnea risks following cangrelor treatment, suggest a common mechanism linking transfusion-related acute lung injury, dyspnea, and reversible platelet inhibition. The risk of breathlessness after intravenous cangrelor is smaller when compared with other reversible platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, however, it is still significantly higher when compared to irreversible oral antiplatelet drugs or intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors; which do not increase the incidence of breathlessness at all. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === Cangrelor is synthesized starting from 2-thiobarbituric acid and peracetyl-D-ribofuranose. The synthesis starts with the selective S-alkylation of 2-thiobarbituric acid, followed by nitration with nitric acid, leading to the nitrated dihydroxypyrimidine. Treatment with phosphorus oxychloride affords the corresponding dichloropyrimidine. Subsequently, the nitro group is reduced using iron as the reductant, yielding the aniline derivative. This is cyclized to the purine using triethyl orthoformate and hydrochloric acid. N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide is used to protect the anilinic nitrogen, allowing for the selective N9-alkylation of the compound with peracetyl-D-ribofuranose using trimethylsilyl triflate. The 5'-OH is converted to a phosphodichloridate using phosphorus oxychloride in triethyl phosphate as the solvent. This is converted to Cangrelor without isolation by reaction with dichloromethylenebis(phosphonic acid) and tributylamine as the base. == References ==",Kengrexal,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -2.0503786799963564e-05), ('ICAL', -1.0728830375228426e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0005565524916164577)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://kengreal.com/,https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/kengrexal,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB06441 ', [])"

At high nitrile concentrations, the principal species present is RuCl(PP)(RCN)(3)(+)X(-) (X = Cl); the cation can generally be isolated (as the PF(6) salt) by abstraction of the chloride counterion with NH(4)PF(6). Use of 2 equiv of NH(4)PF(6) generates Ru(PP)(RCN)(4)(2+)(PF(6)(-))(2) (PP = dppb). In the absence of a halide-abstracting agent, addition of hexanes or diethyl ether precipitates neutral RuCl(2)(PP)(RCN)(2) species, which undergo further loss of nitrile in the solid state (R = Me) or in solution (R = Me, Ph).

650,"('Chlormethiazole hydrochloride', 'Clomethiazole hydrochloride', 'Clomethiazole', 'Chlormethiazole', 'Distraneurin')",Medical,"Clomethiazole (also called chlormethiazole) is a sedative and hypnotic originally developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1930s. The drug is typically used in treating and preventing symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal, anxiety and as a sedative-hypnotic. It is structurally related to thiamine (vitamin B1), but acts like a sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant, having the same mechanism of action as traditional barbiturates. It is also used for the management of agitation, restlessness, and Parkinson's disease. In the UK, it is sold under the brand Heminevrin (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals). Other brand names include Nevrin in Romania, Distraneurin in Germany and Distraneurine in Spain. The drug is marketed either as a free base in an oily solution containing 192 mg in capsule form, or as clomethiazole edisylate syrup. Due to its high toxicity compared to benzodiazepines it is not recommended as a first-line treatment for any indication and is particularly dangerous to patients with an elevated risk for drug abuse such as those with a personal or familial history of addiction. == Pharmacology == Clomethiazole acts as a positive allosteric modulator at the barbiturate/picrotoxin site of the GABAA receptor. It works to enhance the action of the neurotransmitter GABA at this receptor. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and produces anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and hypnotic effects. Clomethiazole appears to also have another mechanism of action mediating some of its hypothermic and neuroprotective effects. The oxazole homologue is also known providing a little QSAR information. As opposed to barbiturates, clomethiazole doesn't affect the electrophysiological responses to excitatory aminoacids, and additionally, it also directly acts on chloride ion channels. Clomethiazole is a potent CYP2E1 enzyme inhibitor which slows down the metabolism of ethanol, hence its use in alcohol withdrawal. It is also an inhibitor of CYP2B6 and possibly CYP2A6 and thus can affect the plasma clearance of substrates of those enzymes. When clomethiazole is administered via IV in addition to carbamazepine, its clearance is increased by 30%, which results in a proportional reduction in plasma concentration. Therefore, when co-administered with carbamazepine or other potent CYP3A4 inducers via IV, it is necessary to increase the dose of clomethiazole. == Adverse effects == Long term and frequent use of clomethiazole can cause tolerance and physical dependence. Abrupt withdrawal may result in symptoms similar to those of sudden withdrawal of alcohol, short-acting barbiturates or short-acting benzodiazepines. == Overdose == Clomethiazole is particularly toxic and dangerous if overdosed and is potentially fatal. Alcohol multiplies the effect. As the drug can be fatal in high doses, prescribing clomethiazole for the management of alcohol dependence outside of a controlled environment, for example a hospital, is not recommended, especially because there are much less toxic alternatives, such as diazepam. Diazepam is one of many drugs belonging to the benzodiazepine class, with a long half-life (50–100 hours) and a very low risk of a fatal overdose, so long as the patient does not also consume alcohol or certain other types of medication. Due to clomethiazole's action at the barbiturate complex the benzodiazepine antidote flumazenil cannot reverse the effects of overdose; overdose treatment is restricted to the application of a mechanical ventilation apparatus until enough of the drug has been metabolized and/or excreted for the patient to breathe sufficiently without assistance. Drummer Keith Moon of the rock band The Who died of a recreational clomethiazole overdose. The autopsy found that the death was an accidental overdose, as Moon had a history of consuming extremely large quantities of barbiturates and alcohol and did not take all of the clomethiazole capsules or drink all of the alcohol. == See also == Drug of last resort Therapeutic index == References ==",Distraneurin,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.891343557275832e-05), ('ICAL', -1.9073468138230965e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005285575054585934)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0031777136027812958), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

Response evaluation was performed every 6 weeks. The most common and consistent DLT was neutropenia. Other DLTs observed included hypophosphatemia, pulmonary emboli, SVC syndrome, transaminitis, hyponatremia, and hyperbilirubinemia. The MTD of SB-743921 as a 1-h infusion every 21 days was established as 4 mg/m(2). The maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration time curve appeared to increase proportionally to dose. One durable objective response was seen in a patient with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma who was on treatment 11 months and 6 patients had stable disease for over four cycles. The recommended phase II dose of SB-743921 on this specific schedule of a 1-h infusion every 3 weeks is 4 mg/m(2). The promising efficacy and lack of severe toxicities in this study warrant the continued development of SB-743921. This was a phase I study of SB-743921 (SB-921) in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. Previous studies established that neutropenia was the only dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The primary objective was to determine the DLT, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and efficacy of SB-921 with and without granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Sixty-eight patients were enrolled, 42 without G-CSF, 26 with G-CSF. In the cohort without G-CSF, SB-921 doses ranged from 2 to 7 mg/m(2), with 6 mg/m(2) being the MTD. In the cohort with G-CSF support, doses of 6-10 mg/m(2) were administered, with 9 mg/m(2) being the MTD, representing a 50% increase in dose density. Fifty-six patients were evaluable for efficacy. Four of 55 patients experienced a partial response (three in Hodgkin lymphoma and one in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, all at doses ≥ 6 mg/m(2)); 19 patients experienced stable disease, 33 patients developed progression of disease. G-CSF shifted the DLT from neutropenia to thrombocytopenia, allowing for a 50% increase in dose density. Responses were seen at higher doses with G-CSF support.",Sb 743921 [who-dd],PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.7697225252486533e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0006146925734356046), ('ICAL', -3.576278118089249e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001935277134180069)])","('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4160065 ', [])"

It blocks synthesis of pyrimidine based nucleotides in the body and so inhibits cell growth. Brequinar was invented by DuPont Pharmaceuticals in the 1980s. In 2001, Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired DuPont, and in 2017, Clear Creek Bio acquired the rights to brequinar from BMS. Brequinar has been investigated as an immunosuppressant for preventing rejection after organ transplant and also as an anti-cancer drug, but was not accepted for medical use in either application largely due to its narrow therapeutic dose range and severe side effects when dosed inappropriately. It has been researched both as part of a potential combination therapy for some cancers, or alternatively as an antiparasitic, or antiviral drug. Clear Creek Bio is currently developing brequinar as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity by brequinar may represent an efficient approach to the elimination of undifferentiated cells for safe PSC-derived differentiated cells based therapies.

655,"('Trazodone (hydrochloride)', 'Trazodone', 'Trazodon', 'Trazodona', 'Trazodonum')",Medical,"Trazodone is an antidepressant medication used to treat major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and insomnia. It is a phenylpiperazine compound of the serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) class. The medication is taken orally. Common side effects include dry mouth, feeling faint, vomiting, and headache. More serious side effects may include suicide, mania, irregular heart rate, and pathologically prolonged erections. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Trazodone also has sedating effects. Trazodone was approved for medical use in the United States in 1981. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the eighteenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 27 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Depression === The primary use of trazodone is the treatment of unipolar major depression with or without anxiety. Data from open and double-blind trials suggest that the antidepressant efficacy of trazodone is comparable to that of amitriptyline, doxepin, and mianserin. Furthermore, trazodone has shown anxiolytic properties, low cardiotoxicity, and relatively mild side effects. Because trazodone has minimal anticholinergic activity, it was especially welcomed as a treatment for geriatric patients with depression when it first became available. Three double-blind studies reported trazodone had antidepressant efficacy similar to that of other antidepressants in geriatric patients. Unfortunately, a side effect of trazodone, orthostatic hypotension, which may cause dizziness and increase the risk of falling, can have devastating consequences for elderly patients. Therefore, this side effect, along with sedation, often makes trazodone less acceptable for this population compared to newer compounds that share its lack of anticholinergic activity (but not the rest of its side effect profile). Still, trazodone is often helpful for geriatric patients with depression who have severe agitation and insomnia. Trazodone is usually used at a dosage of 150 to 300 mg/day for the treatment of depression. Lower doses have also been used to augment other antidepressants or when initiating therapy. Higher doses, up to 600 mg/day, have been used in more severe cases of depression (in hospitalized patients, for example). Trazodone is usually administered multiple times per day, but once-daily administration may be similarly effective. === Insomnia === Low-dose trazodone is used off-label in the treatment of insomnia and is considered to be effective and safe for this indication. It may also be used to treat antidepressant-related insomnia. Trazodone was the second-most prescribed agent for insomnia in the early 2000s even though most studies of trazodone for the treatment of sleep disturbances have been in depressed individuals. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in the late 2010s, including a Cochrane review, found low-dose trazodone to be an effective medication for short-term treatment of insomnia in both depressed and euthymic people. Trazodone slightly improves subjective sleep quality (SMDTooltip standardized mean difference = –0.34 to –0.41) and reduces the number of nighttime awakenings (MD = –0.31, SMD = –0.51), on average. Conversely, it does not appear to affect sleep onset, total sleep time, time awake after sleep onset, or sleep efficiency. It appears to increase deep sleep—in contrast to certain other hypnotics. The quality of evidence of trazodone for short-term treatment of insomnia was rated as low to moderate. There is no evidence available at present to inform the long-term use of trazodone in the treatment of insomnia. The benefits of trazodone for insomnia must be weighed against potential adverse effects, such as morning grogginess, daytime sleepiness, cognitive and motor impairment, and postural hypotension, among others. Quality safety data on the use of trazodone as a sleep aid are currently lacking. Trazodone is used at low doses in the range of 50 to 150 mg/day for insomnia. Higher doses of 200 to 600 mg/day have also been studied. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of trazodone in the treatment of insomnia due to inadequate evidence and due to harms potentially outweighing benefits. === Other disorders === Trazodone is often used in the treatment of anxiety disorders — such as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder — as well as in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). Trazodone is often used as an alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, use of trazodone in anxiety disorders is off-label and evidence of its effectiveness for these indications is variable and limited. Benefits for OCD appear to be mild. Trazodone has been used to treat sleep disturbances and nightmares in PTSD. === Combination with other antidepressants === Trazodone is often used in combination with other antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in order to augment their antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and to reduce side effects such as sexual dysfunction, anxiety, and insomnia. === Available forms === Trazodone is provided as the hydrochloride salt and is available in the form of 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg oral tablets. In Italy, it is also available as an oral solution (Trittico 60 mg/mL) with a dosing pipette marked at 25 mg and 50 mg. An extended-release oral tablet formulation at doses of 150 mg and 300 mg is also available. == Side effects == Because of its lack of anticholinergic side effects, trazodone is especially useful in situations in which antimuscarinic effects are particularly problematic (e.g., in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, closed-angle glaucoma, or severe constipation). Trazodone's propensity to cause sedation is a dual-edged sword. For many patients, the relief from agitation, anxiety, and insomnia can be rapid; for other patients, including those individuals with considerable psychomotor retardation and feelings of low energy, therapeutic doses of trazodone may not be tolerable because of sedation. Trazodone elicits orthostatic hypotension in some people, probably as a consequence of α1-adrenergic receptor blockade. The unmasking of bipolar disorder may occur with trazodone and other antidepressants. Precautions for trazodone include known hypersensitivity to trazodone and under 18 years and combined with other antidepressant medications, it may increase the possibility of suicidal thoughts or actions. While trazodone is not a true member of the SSRI class of antidepressants, it does still share many properties of SSRIs, especially the possibility of discontinuation syndrome if the medication is stopped too quickly. Thus, care must be taken when coming off the medication, usually by a gradual process of tapering down the dose over time. === Suicide === Antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and young adults. Close monitoring for the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is thus recommended. === Sedation === Since trazodone may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as operating an automobile or machinery, the patient should be cautioned not to engage in such activities while impaired. Compared to the reversible MAOI antidepressant drug moclobemide, more impairment of vigilance occurs with trazodone. Trazodone has been found to impair driving ability. === Cardiac === Case reports have noted cardiac arrhythmias emerging in relation to trazodone treatment, both in patients with pre-existing mitral valve prolapse and in patients with negative personal and family histories of cardiac disease. QT prolongation has been reported with trazodone therapy. Arrhythmia identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, and in two patients short episodes (three to four beats) of ventricular tachycardia. Several post-marketing reports have been made of arrhythmia in trazodone-treated patients who have pre-existing cardiac disease and in some patients who did not have pre-existing cardiac disease. Until the results of prospective studies are available, patients with pre-existing cardiac disease should be closely monitored, particularly for cardiac arrhythmias. Trazodone is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Concomitant administration of drugs that prolong the QT interval or that are inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. === Priapism === A relatively rare side effect associated with trazodone is priapism, likely due to its antagonism at α-adrenergic receptors. More than 200 cases have been reported, and the manufacturer estimated that the incidence of any abnormal erectile function is about one in 6,000 male patients treated with trazodone. The risk for this side effect appears to be greatest during the first month of treatment at low dosages (i.e. <150 mg/day). Early recognition of any abnormal erectile function is important, including prolonged or inappropriate erections, and should prompt discontinuation of trazodone treatment. Spontaneous orgasms have also been reported with trazodone in men. Clinical reports have described trazodone-associated psychosexual side effects in women as well, including increased libido, priapism of the clitoris, and spontaneous orgasms. === Others === Rare cases of liver toxicity have been observed, possibly due to the formation of reactive metabolites. Elevated prolactin concentrations have been observed in people taking trazodone. They appear to be increased by around 1.5- to 2-fold. Studies on trazodone and cognitive function are mixed, with some finding improvement, others finding no change and some finding impairment. Trazodone does not seem to worsen periodic limb movements during sleep. Trazodone is associated with an increased risk of falls in older adults. It has also been associated with increased risk of hip fractures in older adults. === Pregnancy and lactation === Sufficient data in humans are lacking. Use should be justified by the severity of the condition to be treated. == Overdose == There are reported cases of high doses of trazodone precipitating serotonin syndrome. There are also reports of patients taking multiple SSRIs with trazodone and precipitating serotonin syndrome. Trazodone appears to be relatively safer than TCAs, MAOIs, and a few of the other second-generation antidepressants in overdose situations, especially when it is the only agent taken. Fatalities are rare, and uneventful recoveries have been reported after ingestion of doses as high as 6,000–9,200 mg. In one report, 9 of 294 cases of overdose were fatal, and all nine patients had also taken other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. When trazodone overdoses occur, clinicians should carefully monitor for low blood pressure, a potentially serious toxic effect. In a report of a fatal trazodone overdose, torsades de pointes and complete atrioventricular block developed, along with subsequent multiple organ failure, with a trazodone plasma concentration of 25.4 mg/L on admission. == Interactions == === Cytochrome P450 inhibitors and inducers === Trazodone is metabolized by several liver enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2. Its active metabolite meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) is known to be formed by CYP3A4 and metabolized by CYP2D6. Inhibition or induction of the aforementioned enzymes by various other substances may alter the metabolism of trazodone and/or mCPP, leading to increased and/or decreased blood concentrations. The enzymes in question are known to be inhibited and induced by many medications, herbs, and foods, and as such, trazodone may interact with these substances. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, and ritonavir may lead to increased concentrations of trazodone and decreased concentrations of mCPP, while CYP3A4 inducers like carbamazepine, enzalutamide, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and St. John's wort may result in decreased trazodone concentrations and increased mCPP concentrations. CYP2D6 inhibitors may result in increased concentrations of both trazodone and mCPP, while CYP2D6 inducers may decrease their concentrations. Examples of potent CYP2D6 inhibitors include bupropion, cannabidiol, duloxetine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, and ritonavir, while CYP2D6 inducers include dexamethasone, glutethimide, and haloperidol. CYP1A2 inhibitors may increase trazodone concentrations, while CYP1A2 inducers may decrease trazodone concentrations. Examples of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors include ethinylestradiol (found in hormonal birth control), fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), fluvoxamine, and St. John's wort, while potent CYP1A2 inducers include phenytoin, rifampin, ritonavir, and tobacco. A study found that ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor and moderate CYP1A2 inducer, increased trazodone peak levels by 1.4-fold, trazodone area-under-the-curve levels by 2.4-fold, and decreased trazodone clearance by 50%. This was associated with adverse effects such as nausea, hypotension, and syncope. Another study found that the strong CYP3A4 inducer carbamazepine reduced concentrations of trazodone by 60 to 74%. The strong CYP2D6 inhibitor thioridazine has been reported to increase trazodone levels by 1.4-fold and concentrations of mCPP by 1.5-fold. Fluoxetine, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a weak or moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, has been reported to increase levels of trazodone by 1.3- to 1.7-fold and of mCPP by 3.0- to 3.4-fold. Conversely, CYP2D6 genotype has not been found to predict trazodone or mCPP concentrations with trazodone therapy, although CYP2D6 genotype did correlate with side effects like dizziness and prolonged corrected QT interval. Smokers have lower levels of trazodone and higher ratios of mCPP to trazodone. Trazodone levels were 30% lower in smokers and mCPP to trazodone ratio was 1.3-fold higher in smokers, whereas mCPP concentrations were not different between smokers and non-smokers. Smoking is known to induce CYP1A2, and this may be involved in these findings. === Serotonergic agents and serotonin syndrome === Combination of trazodone with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) has a theoretical risk of serotonin syndrome. However, trazodone has been studied in combination with SSRIs and seemed to be safe in this context. On the other hand, cases of excessive sedation and serotonin syndrome have been reported with a combination of trazodone and fluoxetine or paroxetine. This may be due to the combined potentiation of the serotonin system. On the other hand, it may be related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes by fluoxetine and paroxetine and consequently increased trazodone and mCPP levels. === Antagonism of serotonergic psychedelics === Serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin are thought to mediate their halucinogenic effects by activating serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. By displacing them from the 5-HT2A receptor, serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists can block the hallucinogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics. Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists like ketanserin and risperidone have been found to fully block or dose-dependently reduce the subjective effects of LSD and psilocybin in clinical studies. Trazodone is a potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and may have similar effects. Studies have estimated that trazodone occupies 90 to 97% of 5-HT2A receptors at doses of 50 to 200 mg/day. Trazodone is less studied in blocking the effects of serotonergic psychedelics than other serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonists like ketanserin and risperidone, but was reported to reduce the effects of LSD in one published case report. Specifically, a woman on trazodone 200 mg/day who received a ""moderate"" dose of LSD was reported to have had reduced LSD-related hallucinogenic and physiological effects. Additionally, trazodone has been used and discussed extensively online as a so-called ""trip killer"" by recreational psychedelic users. It was recommended on the social media website Reddit for such purposes 77 times by 2024 with a suggested dose range of 50 to 150 mg. Trazodone was one of the most commonly recommended drugs for such purposes, exceeded only by alprazolam, benzodiazepines generally, and quetiapine. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Trazodone is a mixed agonist and antagonist of various serotonin receptors, antagonist of adrenergic receptors, weak histamine H1 receptor antagonist, and weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor. More specifically, it is an antagonist of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors, a partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor, and an antagonist of the α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors. It is also a ligand of the 5-HT2C receptor with lower affinity than for the 5-HT2A receptor. However, it is unknown whether trazodone acts as a full agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist of the 5-HT2C receptor. Trazodone is a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist similarly to buspirone and tandospirone but with comparatively greater intrinsic activity. A range of weak affinities (Ki) have been reported for trazodone at the human histamine H1 receptor, including 220 nM, 350 nM, 500 nM, and 1,100 nM. Trazodone has a minor active metabolite known as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and this metabolite may contribute to some degree to the pharmacological properties of trazodone. In contrast to trazodone, mCPP is an agonist of various serotonin receptors. It has relatively low affinity for α1-adrenergic receptors unlike trazodone, but does have high affinity for α2-adrenergic receptors and weak affinity for the H1 receptor. In addition to direct interactions with serotonin receptors, mCPP is a serotonin releasing agent similarly to agents like fenfluramine and MDMA. In contrast to these serotonin releasing agents however, mCPP does not appear to cause long-term serotonin depletion (a property thought to be related to serotonergic neurotoxicity). Trazodone's 5-HT2A receptor antagonism and weak serotonin reuptake inhibition form the basis of its common label as an antidepressant of the serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) type. ==== Target occupancy studies ==== Studies have estimated occupancy of target sites by trazodone based on trazodone concentrations in blood and brain and on the affinities of trazodone for the human targets in question. Roughly half of brain 5-HT2A receptors are blocked by 1 mg of trazodone and essentially all 5-HT2A receptors are saturated at 10 mg of trazodone, but the clinically effective hypnotic doses of trazodone are in the 25–100 mg range. The occupancy of the serotonin transporter (SERT) by trazodone is estimated to be 86% at 100 mg/day and 90% at 150 mg/day. Trazodone may almost completely occupy the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors at doses of 100 to 150 mg/day. Significant occupancy of a number of other sites may also occur. However, another study estimated much lower occupancy of the SERT and 5-HT2A receptors by trazodone. ==== Effects in preclinical studies ==== Trazodone shows antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in animals. However, it shows differences from certain other antidepressants, like the tricyclic antidepressants, in animals. For example, it does not reverse the behavioral effects of the monoamine depleting agent reserpine and does not potentiate the effects of amphetamine or levodopa. Similarly to antipsychotics, trazodone reduces spontaneous motor activity, spontaneous and elicited aggressive behavior, and exploratory behavior, among other effects. In addition, trazodone diminishes amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity, although it does not inhibit apomorphine- or amphetamine-induced stereotypy. On the other hand, unlike antipsychotics, trazodone does not produce catalepsy, although it can do so at sufficiently high doses. Activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor enhances striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission, while stimulation of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor inhibits striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Trazodone is both a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, but has about 15-fold greater potency as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor relative to the 5-HT2C receptor. In addition, at higher doses, trazodone acts as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist in animals. As a result of the preceding actions, trazodone may inhibit striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission. This may underlie exacerbation of parkinsonism seen in marmosets and in human case reports. ==== Correspondence to clinical effects ==== Trazodone may act predominantly as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist to mediate its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression. Its inhibitory effects on serotonin reuptake and 5-HT2C receptors are comparatively weak. In relation to these properties, trazodone does not have similar properties to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is not particularly associated with increased appetite and weight gain – unlike other 5-HT2C antagonists like mirtazapine. Moderate 5-HT1A partial agonism may contribute to trazodone's antidepressant and anxiolytic actions to some extent as well. The combined actions of 5-HT2A and 5HT2C receptor antagonism with serotonin reuptake inhibition only occur at moderate to high doses of trazodone. Doses of trazodone lower than those effective for antidepressant action are frequently used for the effective treatment of insomnia. Low doses exploit trazodone's potent actions as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and its properties as an antagonist of H1 and α1-adrenergic receptors, but do not adequately exploit its SERT or 5-HT2C inhibition properties, which are weaker. Since insomnia is one of the most frequent residual symptoms of depression after treatment with an SSRI, a hypnotic is often necessary for patients with a major depressive episode. Not only can a hypnotic potentially relieve the insomnia itself, but treating insomnia in patients with major depression may also increase remission rates due to the improvement of other symptoms such as loss of energy and depressed mood. Thus, the ability of low doses of trazodone to improve sleep in depressed patients may be an important mechanism whereby trazodone can augment the efficacy of other antidepressants. Trazodone's potent α1-adrenergic blockade may cause some side effects like orthostatic hypotension and sedation. Conversely, along with 5-HT2A and H1 receptor antagonism, it may contribute to its efficacy as a hypnotic. Trazodone lacks any affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, so does not produce anticholinergic side effects. mCPP, a non-selective serotonin receptor modulator and serotonin releasing agent, is an active metabolite of trazodone and has been suggested to possibly play a role in its therapeutic benefits. However, research has not supported this hypothesis and mCPP might actually antagonize the efficacy of trazodone as well as produce additional side effects. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Trazodone is well-absorbed after oral administration. Its bioavailability is 65 to 80%. Peak blood levels of trazodone occur 1 to 2 hours after ingestion and peak levels of the metabolite mCPP occur after 2 to 4 hours. Absorption is somewhat delayed and enhanced by food. ==== Distribution ==== Trazodone is not sequestered into any tissue. The medication is 89 to 95% protein-bound. The volume of distribution of trazodone is 0.8 to 1.5 L/kg. Trazodone is highly lipophilic. ==== Metabolism ==== The metabolic pathways involved in the metabolism are not well-characterized. In any case, the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 may all be involved to varying extents. Trazodone is known to be extensively metabolized by the liver via hydroxylation, N-oxidation, and N-dealkylation. Several metabolites of trazodone have been identified, including a dihydrodiol metabolite (via hydroxylation), a metabolite hydroxylated at the para position of the meta-chlorophenyl ring (via CYP2D6), oxotriazolepyridinepropionic acid (TPA) and mCPP (both via N-dealkylation of the piperazinyl nitrogen mediated by CYP3A4), and a metabolite formed by N-oxidation of the piperazinyl nitrogen. CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 genotypes all do not seem to predict concentrations of trazodone or mCPP. In any case, there are large interindividual variations in the metabolism of trazodone. In addition, poor metabolizers of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 substrate, eliminate mCPP more slowly and have higher concentrations of mCPP than extensive metabolizers. mCPP is formed from trazodone by CYP3A4 and is metabolized via hydroxylation by CYP2D6 (to a para-hydroxylated metabolite). It may contribute to the pharmacological actions of trazodone. mCPP levels are only 10% of those of trazodone during therapy with trazodone, but is nonetheless present at concentrations known to produce psychic and physical effects in humans when mCPP has been administered alone. In any case, the actions of trazodone, such as its serotonin antagonism, might partially overwhelm those of mCPP. As a consequence of the production of mCPP as a metabolite, patients administered trazodone may test positive on EMIT II urine tests for the presence of MDMA (""ecstasy""). ==== Elimination ==== The elimination of trazodone is biphasic: the first phase's half-life (distribution) is 3 to 6 hours, and the following phase's half-life (elimination) is 4.1 to 14.6 hours. The elimination half-life of extended-release trazodone is 9.1 to 13.2 hours. The elimination half-life of mCPP is 2.6 to 16.0 hours and is longer than that of trazodone. Metabolites are conjugated to gluconic acid or glutathione and around 70 to 75% of 14C-labelled trazodone was found to be excreted in the urine within 72 hours. The remaining drug and its metabolites are excreted in the faeces via biliary elimination. Less than 1% of the drug is excreted in its unchanged form. After an oral dose of trazodone, it was found to be excreted 20% in the urine as TPA and conjugates, 9% as the dihydrodiol metabolite, and less than 1% as unconjugated mCPP. mCPP is glucuronidated and sulfated similarly to other trazodone metabolites. == Chemistry == Trazodone is a triazolopyridine derivative and a phenylpiperazine that is structurally related to nefazodone and etoperidone, each of which is a derivative of it. == History == Trazodone was developed in Italy, in the 1960s, by Angelini Research Laboratories as a second-generation antidepressant. It was developed according to the mental pain hypothesis, which was postulated from studying patients and which proposes that major depression is associated with a decreased pain threshold. In sharp contrast to most other antidepressants available at the time of its development, trazodone showed minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Trazodone was patented and marketed in many countries all over the world. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981 and was the first non-tricyclic or MAOI antidepressant approved in the US. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Trazodone is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while trazodone hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. === Brand names === Trazodone has been marketed under a large number of brand names throughout the world. Major brand names include Desyrel (worldwide), Donaren (Brazil), Molipaxin (Ireland, United Kingdom), Oleptro (United States), Trazorel (Canada), and Trittico (worldwide). == Research == Trazodone may be effective in the treatment of sexual dysfunction, for instance female sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction. A 2003 systematic review and meta-analysis found some indication that trazodone may be useful in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Besides trazodone alone, a combination of trazodone and bupropion (developmental code names and tentative brand names S1P-104, S1P-205, Lorexys, and Orexa) is under development for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction. As of September 2021, it is in phase 2 clinical trials for these indications. It has been in this stage of clinical development since at least February 2015. Trazodone may be useful in the treatment of certain symptoms like sleep disturbances in alcohol withdrawal and recovery. However, reviews have recommended against use of trazodone for alcohol withdrawal due to inadequate evidence. Very limited evidence suggests that trazodone might be useful in the treatment of certain symptoms in cocaine use disorder. Trazodone has been reported to be effective in the treatment of sleep apnea. Cochrane reviews found that trazodone was not effective in the treatment of agitation in dementia. Another Cochrane review found that trazodone might be useful in the treatment of sleep disturbances in dementia. Further systematic reviews have found that trazodone may be effective for behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementias such as frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Trazodone has been studied as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia. It has been reported to decrease negative symptoms without worsening positive symptoms although improvement in negative symptoms was modest. Trazodone has also been reported to be effective in treating antipsychotic-related extrapyramidal symptoms such as akathisia. Trazodone has been studied and reported to be effective in the treatment of bulimia, but there is limited evidence to support this use. It might be useful in the treatment of night eating disorder as well. Trazodone might be effective in the treatment of adjustment disorder. It may also be effective in the treatment of bruxism in children and adolescents. Trazodone may be useful in the treatment of certain chronic pain disorders. There is limited but conflicting evidence to support the use of trazodone in the treatment of headaches and migraines in children. Trazodone may be useful in the treatment of fibromyalgia as well as diabetic neuropathy. It may also be useful in the treatment of burning mouth syndrome. A 2004 narrative review claimed that trazodone could be used in the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome. Trazodone may also be effective in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. It may be effective in the treatment of non-cardiac chest pain as well. Trazodone may be useful in promoting motor recovery after stroke. Trazodone is sometimes prescribed to treat premature ejaculation but clomipramine and paroxetine may be more effective. == Veterinary use == Trazodone has been used to reduce anxiety and stress, to improve sleep, and to produce sedation in dogs and cats in veterinary medicine. == See also == List of antidepressants == References == == External links == Media related to Trazodone at Wikimedia Commons",Trazodon,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.373566141817719e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.00034481301554478705)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.842555426876061e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"
656,"('Ticlopidine (hydrochloride)', 'Ticlopidine', 'Ticlid', 'Ticlopidinum', 'Ticlopidina')",Medical,"Ticlopidine, sold under the brand name Ticlid, is a medication used to reduce the risk of thrombotic strokes. It is an antiplatelet drug in the thienopyridine family which is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor. Research initially showed that it was useful for preventing strokes and coronary stent occlusions. However, because of its rare but serious side effects of neutropenia and thrombotic microangiopathy it was primarily used in patients in whom aspirin was not tolerated, or in whom dual antiplatelet therapy was desirable. With the advent of newer and safer antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel and ticagrelor, its use remained limited. It was patented in 1973 and approved for medical use in 1978. == Medical uses == Ticlopidine is indicated for the prevention of strokes and when combined with aspirin, for people with a new coronary stent to prevent closure. === Stroke === Ticlopidine is considered a second-line option for the prevention of thrombotic strokes among patients who have previously had a stroke or TIA. Studies have shown that it is superior to aspirin in the prevention of death or future strokes. However, it also has more frequent and serious side effects compared to aspirin, so it is reserved for those patients that cannot take aspirin. === Heart disease === When a patient needs to have a stent placed in one of the vessels around their heart, it is important that that stent stay open to keep blood flowing to the heart. Therefore, patients with stents must take medications after the procedure to help maintain that blood flow. Ticlopidine, taken together with aspirin, is FDA approved for this purpose, and in studies it has been shown to work better than aspirin alone or aspirin with an anticoagulant. However, ticlopidine’s serious side effects make it less useful than its cousin, clopidogrel. Current recommendations no longer recommend ticlopidine’s use. == Contraindications == The use of ticlopidine is contraindicated in anyone with: Increased risk of bleeding (i.e. frequent falls, gastrointestinal bleeds) History of hematological disease Severe liver disease History of allergic reaction to ticlopidine or any thienopyridine drug such as clopidogrel Because of the increased risk of bleeding, patients taking ticlopidine should discontinue the medication 10–14 days before surgery. == Adverse effects == The most serious side effects associated with ticlopidine are those that affect the blood cells, although these life-threatening complications are relatively rare. The most common side effects include: Diarrhea Nausea Dyspepsia Rash Abdominal pain Ticlopidine may also cause an increase in cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes, and bleeding. === Hematological === Use of ticlopidine has been associated with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and aplastic anemia. Because of this risk, patients who are started on ticlopidine are typically monitored with blood tests to test their cell counts every two weeks for the first three months. === Pregnancy and lactation === Ticlopidine is a FDA pregnancy risk category B. There have been no studies done in humans. Studies in rats show that high drug levels could cause toxicity in both mother and fetus, but there are no known birth defects associated with its use. There have been no studies to test whether ticlopidine goes into breast milk. Studies in rats have shown that it is passed in rats’ milk. == Interactions == Ticlopidine interacts with several classes of medications. It increases the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs. Taking ticlopidine at the same time as antacids decreases the absorption of ticlopidine. Ticlopidine inhibits liver CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 and thus can affect blood levels of medications metabolized by these systems. == Mechanism of action == Ticlopidine is a tetrahydro-thienopyridine which, when metabolized by the body, irreversibly blocks the P2Y12 component of the ADP receptor on the surface of platelets. Without ADP, fibrinogen does not bind to the platelet surface, preventing platelets from sticking to each other. By interfering with platelet function, ticlopidine prevents clots from forming on the inside of blood vessels. Anti-platelet effects start within 2 days and reach their maximum by 6 days of therapy. Ticlopidine’s effects persist for 3 days after discontinuing ticlopidine although it may take 1–2 weeks for platelet function to return to normal, as the medication affects platelets irreversibly. Therefore, new platelets must be formed before platelet function normalizes. == Pharmacokinetics == Ticlopidine is ingested orally with 80% bioavailability with rapid absorption. Even higher absorption can occur if ticlopidine is taken with food. It is metabolized by the liver with both renal and fecal elimination. Clearance is nonlinear and varies with repeated dosing. After the first dose the half life is 12.6 hours, but with repeated dosing the maximum half life is 4–5 days. Clearance is also slower in the elderly. The drug is 98% reversibly bound to proteins. == Chemical properties == Ticlopidine's systemic name is 5-[(2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine. Its molecular weight is 263.786 g/mol. It is a white crystalline solid. It is soluble in water and methanol and somewhat soluble in methylene chloride, ethanol, and acetone. It self-buffers in water to a pH of 3.6. == History == Ticlopidine was discovered in the 1970s in France by a team led by Fernand Eloy and including Jean-Pierre Maffrand at Castaigne SA that was trying to discover a new anti-inflammatory medication. Pharmacology developers noted that this new compound had strong anti-platelet properties. Castaigne was acquired by Sanofi in 1973. Starting in 1978 the drug was marketed in France under the brand name Ticlid for people at high risk for thrombotic events, who had just come out of heart surgery, were undergoing hemodialysis, had peripheral vascular disease, or who were otherwise at risk for strokes and ischemic heart disease. Ticlopidine was brought to market in the US by Syntex, which got the drug approved in 1991. Syntex was acquired by the Roche group in 1994. The first generic ticlopidine hydrochloride was FDA approved in 1999. As of April 2015, Roche, Caraco, Sandoz, Par, Major, Apotex, and Teva had discontinued generic ticlopidine and no ticlopidine preparations were available in the US. == Research == Soon after its release, studies regarding ticlopidine found it had the potential to be helpful for other diseases including peripheral vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, and sickle cell disease. However, none had enough evidence for FDA approval. Due to the blood cell side effects associated with ticlopidine, researchers for treatments for these conditions have turned to other avenues. == References == == External links == ""Ticlopidine"".

It was marketed as Thelin by Encysive Pharmaceuticals until Pfizer purchased Encysive in February 2008. In 2010, Pfizer voluntarily removed sitaxentan from the market due to concerns about liver toxicity. == Mechanism of action == Sitaxentan is a small molecule that blocks the action of endothelin (ET) on the endothelin-A (ETA) receptor selectively (by a factor of 6000 compared with the ETB). It is a sulfonamide class endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and is undergoing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for treating pulmonary hypertension. The rationale for benefit compared with bosentan, a nonselective ET blocker, is negligible inhibition of the beneficial effects of ETB stimulation, such as nitric oxide production and clearance of ET from circulation. In clinical trials, the efficacy of sitaxentan has been much the same as bosentan, but the hepatotoxicity of sitaxentan outweighs its benefits. Dosing is once daily, as opposed to twice daily for bosentan. == Regulatory status == On December 10, 2010 Pfizer announced it would be withdrawing sitaxentan worldwide (both from marketing and from all clinical study use), citing that it is a cause of fatal liver damage. Sitaxentan was approved for marketing in the European Union in 2006, in Canada in 2006 and in Australia in 2007. By February 2008 it had been launched commercially in Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain and Italy. In March 2006, the FDA recommended an approvable status to sitaxentan but said it would not yet approve the product. In July 2006, sitaxentan received a second approvable letter stating that efficacy outcome issues raised in the context of the STRIDE-2 study were still unresolved. In July 2007, Encysive commenced a formal dispute resolution process in a preliminary meeting with the FDA. In September 2007 the company announced that it was making preparations for another phase III clinical trial (intended to be named STRIDE-5) to overcome the FDA's concerns. The takeover by Pfizer resulted in a reconfiguration and extension of these plans, to include combination therapy with sildenafil. The Sitaxentan Efficacy and Safety Trial With a Randomized Prospective Assessment of Adding Sildenafil (SR-PAAS) was an ongoing program of three clinical trials conducted in the United States (ClinicalTtrials.gov identifiers: NCT00795639, NCT00796666 and NCT00796510) with anticipated completion dates between June 2010 and January 2014. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects observed with sitaxentan are class effects of endothelin receptor antagonists, and include : liver enzyme abnormalities (increased ALT and AST) headache edema constipation nasal congestion upper respiratory tract infection dizziness insomnia flushing Because sitaxentan inhibits metabolism of warfarin, a decreased dose of warfarin is needed when co-administered with sitaxentan. This is because warfarin acts to prevent blood from clotting, and if it remains unmetabolized, it can continue to thin the blood. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Encysive Announces PDUFA Date for Thelin New Drug Application in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension"".

658,"('Ponatinib', 'Ponatinib (ap24534)', 'Ap 24534', 'Ponatinib [usan:inn]', 'Ponatinibum')",Medical,"Ponatinib, sold under the brand name Iclusig, is a medication used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It was developed by Ariad Pharmaceuticals. It is a multi-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. Some forms of chronic myeloid leukemia, those that have the T315I mutation, are resistant to current therapies such as imatinib. Ponatinib has been designed to be effective against these types of tumors. Ponatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2012, and in the European Union in July 2013. == Medical uses == Ponatinib in indicated for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. In March 2024, the FDA expanded the indication to include the treatment, with chemotherapy, for adults with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. == Adverse effects == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a partial clinical hold on new trial enrollment for ponatinib in October 2013, due to an increased number of blood clots observed in patients taking the drug. The EPIC trial was later canceled in October 2013. Subsequent studies of 449 patients treated during 4 years with ponatinib for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia found the following adverse reactions. 150 Patients experienced cardiac vascular (21% of patients), peripheral vascular (12%), and cerebrovascular (9%) arterial occlusive events. Venous thromboembolic events occurred in 6% of patients. The most common all-grade adverse events included hypertension (69%), rash (63%), abdominal pain (48%), fatigue (47%), headache (43%), arterial ischemia (42%), dry skin (42%), constipation (41%), arthralgia (32%), nausea (28%), pyrexia (26%), peripheral neuropathy (24%), myalgia (24%), pain in extremity (23%), back pain (21%), and diarrhea (20%). In addition, there have been reported cases of the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Recently, an analogue of ponatinib was developed that retained anti-tumor efficacy but had reduced cardiovascular toxicity in experimental models. == Clinical trials == In 2010, Ariad announced result from a phase I study of ponatinib in patients with resistant and refractory chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). The study demonstrated that in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with ponatinib, 66 percent of patients in the trial achieved a major cytogenetic response, including 100 percent of patients who also had a T315I mutation. The PACE (Ponatinib Ph+ ALL and chronic myeloid leukemia Evaluation) pivotal phase II trial started enrolling patients in September 2010 and is designed to provide definitive clinical data for regulatory approval in this setting. Good results were reported in December 2012. The EPIC (Evaluation of Ponatinib versus Imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia) phase-III trial began in June 2012 and was halted on October 18, 2013. == Mechanism of action == The primary target for ponatinib is BCR-ABL, an abnormal tyrosine kinase that is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia is characterized by an excessive and unregulated production of white blood cells by the bone marrow due to a genetic abnormality that produces the BCR-ABL protein. After a chronic phase of production of too many white blood cells, chronic myeloid leukemia typically evolves to more aggressive phases such as accelerated or blast crisis. Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia that carries the Ph+ chromosome that produces BCR-ABL. It has a more aggressive course than chronic myeloid leukemia and is often treated with a combination of chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Because both of these diseases express the BCR-ABL protein, this would render them potentially susceptible to treatment with ponatinib. BCR-ABL is detected in 95% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. == Society and culture == == Legal status == Ponatinib was approved by the US FDA in December 2012, for people with resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, based on results of the PACE phase II trial. Based on additional studies, the FDA granted full approval in 2016, and updated the label to include people with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia for whom no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is indicated. Approval was also granted for T315I-positive and T315I-positive Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. === Economics === The medication costs $138,000 per year. As of 2015, ponatinib is available in England for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (chronic phase, accelerated phase or blast phase) and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients with documented T315I mutation under the Cancer Drugs Fund, and has not been appraised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who noted the small expected patient population. NICE estimated that ponatinib would cost approximately £61,000 per year, but the price paid under the Cancer Drugs Fund is confidential and may be different. == References ==",Ponatinib,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.933898824470816e-06), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -3.707340147229843e-05)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/ponatinibhydrochloride,https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-ponatinib-chemotherapy-newly-diagnosed-philadelphia-chromosome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponatinib ', [])"

FGFR-1 has been shown to be associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, and clonal eosinophilias. == Gene == The FGFR1 gene is located on human chromosome 8 at position p11.23 (i.e. 8p11.23), has 24 exons, and codes for a Precursor mRNA that is alternatively spliced at exons 8A or 8B thereby generating two mRNAs coding for two FGFR1 isoforms, FGFR1-IIIb (also termed FGFR1b) and FGFR1-IIIc (also termed FGFR1c), respectively. Although these two isoforms have different tissue distributions and FGF-binding affinities, FGFR1-IIIc appears responsible for most of functions of the FGFR1 gene while FGFR1-IIIb appears to have only a minor, somewhat redundant functional role. There are four other members of the FGFR1 gene family: FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, and Fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1 (FGFRL1). The FGFR1 gene, similar to the FGFR2-4 genes are commonly activated in human cancers as a result of their duplication, fusion with other genes, and point mutation; they are therefore classified as proto-oncogenes. == Protein == === Receptor === FGFR1 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, which in addition to FGFR1, includes FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, and FGFRL1. FGFR1-4 are cell surface membrane receptors that possess tyrosine kinase activity. A full-length representative of these four receptors consists of an extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains which bind their proper ligands, the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), a single hydrophobic stretch which passes through the cell's surface membrane, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. When bonded to FGFs, these receptors form dimers with any one of the four other FGFRs and then cross-phosphorylate key tyrosine residues on their dimer partners. These newly phosphorylated sites bind cytosolic docking proteins such as FRS2, PRKCG and GRB2 which proceed to activate cell signaling pathways that lead to cellular differentiation, growth, proliferation, prolonged survival, migration, and other functions. FGFRL1 lacks a prominent intracellular domain and tyrosine kinase activity; it may serve as a decoy receptor by binding with and thereby diluting the action of FGFs. There are 18 known FGFs that bind to and activate one or more of the FGFRs: FGF1 to FGF10 and FGF16 to FGF23. Fourteen of these, FGF1 to FGF6, FGF8, FGF10, FGF17, and FGF19 to FGF23 bind and activate FGFR1. FGFs binding to FGFR1 is promoted by their interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans and, with respect to FGF19, FGF20, and FGR23, the transmembrane protein Klotho. === Cell activation === FGFR1, when bound to a proper FGF, elicits cellular responses by activating signaling pathways that include the: a) Phospholipase C/PI3K/AKT, b) Ras subfamily/ERK, c) Protein kinase C, d) IP3-induced raising of cytosolic Ca2+, and e) Ca2+/calmodulin-activated elements and pathways. The exact pathways and elements activated depend on the cell type being stimulated plus other factors such as the stimulated cells microenvironment and previous as well as concurrent history of stimulation Activation of the gamma isoforms of phospholipase C (PLCγ) (see PLCG1 and PLCG2 illustrates one mechanism by which FGFR1 activates cell stimulating pathways. Following its binding of a proper FGF and subsequent pairing with another FGFR, FGFR1 becomes phosphorylated by its partner FGFR on a highly conserved tyrosine residue (Y766) at its C-terminal. This creates a binding or ""docking"" site to recruit PLCγ via PLCγ tandem nSH2 and cSH2 domains and then phosphorylate PLCγ. By being phosphorylated PLCγ is relieved of its auto-inhibition structure and becomes active in metabolizing nearby Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to two secondary messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyglycerol (DAG). These secondary messengers proceed to mobilize other cell-signaling and cell-activating agents: IP3 elevates cytosolic Ca2+ and thereby various Ca2+-sensitive elements while DAG activates various protein kinase C isoforms. Recent publication on the 2.5 Å crystal structure of PLCγ in complex with FGFR1 kinase (PDB: 3GQI) provides new insights in understanding the molecular mechanism of FGFR1's recruitment of PLCγ by its SH2 domains. Figure 1 on the extreme right shows the PLCγ-FGFR1 kinase complex with the c-SH2 domain colored in red, n-SH2 domain colored in blue, and the interdomain linker colored in yellow. The structure contains typical SH2 domain, with two α-helices and three antiparallel β-strands in each SH2 domain. In this complex, the phosphorylated tyrosine (pY766) on the C-terminal tail of FGFR1 kinase binds preferentially to the nSH2 domain of PLCγ. The phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 766 on FGFR1 kinase forms hydrogen bonds with the n-SH2 to stabilize the complex. Hydrogen bonds in the binding pocket help to stabilize the PLCγ-FGFR1 kinase complex. The water molecule as shown mediates the interaction of asparagine 647 (N647) and aspartate 768 (D768) to further increase the binding affinity of the n-SH2 and FGFR1 kinase complex. (Figure 2). The phosphorylation of tyrosine 653 and tyrosine 654 in the active kinase conformation causes a large conformation change in the activation segment of FGFR1 kinase. Threonine 658 is moved by 24Å from the inactive form (Figure 3.) to the activated form of FGFR1 kinase (Figure 4.). The movement causes the closed conformation in the inactive form to open to enable substrate binding. It also allows the open conformation to coordinate Mg2+ with AMP-PCP (analog of ATP). In addition, pY653 and pY654 in the active form helps to maintain the open conformation of the SH2 and FGFR1 kinase complex. However, the mechanism by which the phosphorylation at Y653 and Y654 helps to recruit the SH2 domain to its C-terminal tail upon phosphorylation of Y766 remains elusive. Figure 5 shows the overlay structure of active and inactive forms of FGFR1 kinase. Figure 6 shows the dots and contacts on phosphorylated tyrosine residues 653 and 654. Green dots show highly favorable contacts between pY653 and pY654 with surrounding residues. Red spikes show unfavorable contacts in the activation segment. The figure is generated through Molprobity extension on Pymol. The tyrosine kinase region of FGFR1 binds to the N-SH2 domain of PLCγ primarily through charged amino acids. Arginine residue (R609) on the N-SH2 domain forms a salt bridge to aspartate 755 (D755) on the FGFR1 domain. The acid base pairs located in the middle of the interface are nearly parallel to each other, indicating a highly favorable interaction. The N-SH2 domain makes an additional polar contact through water-mediated interaction that takes place between the N-SH2 domain and the FGFR1 kinase region. The arginine residue 609 (R609) on the FGFR1 kinase also forms a salt bridge to the aspartate residue (D594) on the N-SH2 domain. The acid-base pair interacts with each other carry out a reduction–oxidation reaction that stabilizes the complex (Figure 7). Previous studies have done to elucidate the binding affinity of the n-SH2 domain with the FGFR1 kinase complex by mutating these phenylalanine or valine amino acids. The results from isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that the binding affinity of the complex decreased by 3 to 6-fold, without affecting the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues. === Cell inhibition === FGF-induced activation of FGFR1 also stimulates the activation of sprouty proteins SPRY1, SPRY2, SPRY3, and/or SPRY4 which in turn interact with GRB2, SOS1, and/or c-Raf to reduce or inhibit further cell stimulation by activated FGFR1 as well as other tyrosine kinase receptors such as the Epidermal growth factor receptor. These interactions serve as negative feedback loops to limit the extent of cellular activation. == Function == Mice genetically engineered to lack a functional Fgfr1 gene (ortholog of the human FGFR1 gene) die in utero before 10.5 days of gestation. Embryos exhibit extensive deficiencies in the development and organization of mesoderm-derived tissues and the musculoskeletal system. The Fgfr1 gene appears critical for the truncation of embryonic structures and formation of muscle and bone tissues and thereby the normal formation of limbs, skull, outer, middle, and inner ear, neural tube, tail, and lower spine as well as normal hearing. == Clinical significance == === Congenital diseases === Hereditary mutations in the FGFR1 gene are associated with various congenital malformations of the musculoskeletal system. Interstitial deletions at human chromosome 8p12-p11, arginine to a stop nonsense mutation at FGFR1 amino acid 622 (annotated as R622X), and numerous other autosomal dominant inactivating mutations in FGFR1 are responsible for ~10% of the cases of Kallmann syndrome. This syndrome is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism associated in a varying percentage of cases with anosmia or hyposmia; cleft palate and other craniofacial defects; and scoliosis and other musculoskeletal malformations. An activating mutation in FGFR1 viz., P232R (proline-to-arginine substitution in the protein's 232nd amino acid), is responsible for the Type 1 or classic form of Pfeiffer syndrome, a disease characterized by craniosynostosis and mid-face deformities. A tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution mutation in the 372nd amino acid of FGFR1 (Y372C) is responsible for some cases of Osteoglophonic dysplasia. This mutation results in craniosynostosis, mandibular prognathism, hypertelorism, brachydactyly, and inter-phalangeal joint fusion. Other inherited defects associated with 'FGFR1 mutations likewise involve musculoskeletal malformations: these include the Jackson–Weiss syndrome (proline to arg substitution at amino acid 252), Antley-Bixler syndrome (isoleucine-to-threonine at amino acid 300 (I300T), and trigonocephaly (mutation the same as the one for the Antley-Bixler syndrome viz., I300T). === Cancers === Somatic mutations and epigenetic changes in the expression of the FGFR1 gene occur in and are thought to contribute to various types of lung, breast, hematological, and other types of cancers. ==== Lung cancers ==== Amplification of the FGFR1 gene (four or more copies) is present in 9 to 22% of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). FGFR1 amplification was highly correlated with a history of tobacco smoking and proved to be the single largest prognostic factor in a cohort of patients suffering this disease. About 1% of patients with other types of lung cancer show amplifications in FGFR1. ==== Breast cancers ==== Amplification of FGFR1 also occurs in ~10% of estrogen receptor positive breast cancers, particularly of the luminal subtype B form of breast cancer. The presence of FGFR1 amplification has been correlated with resistance to hormone blocking therapy and found to be a poor prognostic factor in the disease. ==== Hematological cancers ==== In certain rare hematological cancers, the fusion of FGFR1 with various other genes due to Chromosomal translocations or Interstitial deletions create genes that encode chimeric FGFR1 Fusion proteins. These proteins have continuously active FGFR1-derived tyrosine kinase and thereby continuously stimulated the cell growth and proliferation. These mutations occur in the early stages of myeloid and/or lymphoid cell lines and are the cause of or contribute to the development and progression of certain types of hematological malignancies that have increased numbers of circulating blood eosinophils, increased numbers of bone marrow eosinophils, and/or the infiltration of eosinophils into tissues. These neoplasms were initially regarded as eosinophilias, hypereosinophilias, Myeloid leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasms, myeloid sarcomas, lymphoid leukemias, or non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Based on their association with eosinophils, unique genetic mutations, and known or potential sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, they are now being classified together as clonal eosinophilias. These mutations are described by connecting the chromosome site for the FGFR1 gene, 8p11 (i.e. human chromosome 8's short arm [i.e. p] at position 11) with another gene such as the MYO18A whose site is 17q11 (i.e human chromosome 17's long arm [i.e. q] at position 11) to yield the fusion gene annotated as t(8;17)(p11;q11). These FGFR1 mutations along with the chromosomal location of FGFR1A's partner gene and the annotation of the fused gene are given in the following table. These cancers are sometimes termed 8p11 myeloproliferative syndromes based on the chromosomal location of the FGFR1 gene. Translocations involving ZMYM2, CNTRL, and FGFR1OP2 are the most common forms of these 8p11 syndromes. In general, patients with any of these diseases have an average age of 44 and present with fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fever, lymphadenopathy, and enlarged liver and/or spleen. They typically evidence hematological features of the myeloproliferative syndrome with moderate to greatly elevated levels of blood and bone marrow eosinophils. However, patients bearing: a) ZMYM2-FGFR1 fusion genes often present as T-cell lymphomas with spreading to non-lymphoid tissue; b) FGFR1-BCR fusion genes usually present as chronic myelogenous leukemias; c) CEP110 fusion genes may present as a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with involvement of tonsil; and d) FGFR1-BCR or FGFR1-MYST3 fusion genes often present with little or no eosinophilia. Diagnosis requires conventional cytogenetics using Fluorescence in situ hybridization#Variations on probes and analysis for FGFR1. Unlike many other myeloid neoplasms with eosinophil such as those caused by Platelet-derived growth factor receptor A or platelet-derived growth factor receptor B fusion genes, the myelodysplasia syndromes caused by FGFR1 fusion genes in general do not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are aggressive and rapidly progressive, and require treatment with chemotherapy agents followed by bone marrow transplantion in order to improve survival. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor Ponatinib has been used as mono-therapy and subsequently used in combination with intensive chemotherapy to treat the myelodysplasia caused by the FGFR1-BCR fusion gene. ==== Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor ==== Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors is characterized by a hypervascular proliferation of apparently non-malignant spindled cells associated with a variable amount of ‘smudgy’ calcified matrix but a small subset of these tumors exhibit malignant histological features and may behave in a clinically malignant fashion. In a series of 15 patients with this disease, 9 were found to have tumors that bore fusions between the FGFR1 gene and the FN1 gene located on human chromosome 2 at position q35. The FGFR1-FN1 fusion gene was again identified in 16 of 39 (41%) patients with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors. The role of the(2;8)(35;11) FGFR1-FN1 fusion gene in this disease is not known. ==== Rhabdomyosarcoma ==== Elevated expression of FGFR1 protein was detected in 10 of 10 human Rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and 4 of 4 human cell lines derived from rhabdomyocarcoma. The tumor cases included 6 cases of Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, 2 cases of Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and 2 cases of pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a highly malignant form of cancer that develops from immature skeletal muscle cell precursors viz., myoblastss that have failed to fully differentiate. FGFR1 activation causes myoblast to proliferate while inhibiting their differentiation, dual effects that may lead to the assumption of a malignant phenotype by these cells. The 10 human rhabdomyosarcoma tumor exhibited decreased levels of methylation of CpG islands upstream of the first FGFR1 exon. CpG islands commonly function to silence expression of adjacent genes while their methylation inhibits this silencing. Hypomethylation of CpG islands upstream of FGFR1 is hypothesized to be at least in part responsible for the over-expression of FGFR1 by and malignant behavior of these rhabdomyosarcoma tumors. In addition, a single case of rhabdomyosarcoma tumor was found express co-amplified FOXO1 gene at 13q14 and FGFR1 gene at 8p11, i.e. t(8;13)(p11;q14), suggesting the formation, amplification, and malignant activity of a chimerical FOXO1-FGFR1 fusion gene by this tumor. ==== Other types of cancers ==== Acquired abnormalities if the FGFR1 gene are found in: ~14% of urinary bladder Transitional cell carcinomas (almost all are amplifications); ~10% of squamous cell Head and neck cancers (~80% amplifications, 20% other mutations); ~7% of endometrial cancers (half amplifications, half other types of mutations); ~6% of prostate cancers (half amplifications, half other mutations); ~5% of ovarian Papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma (almost all amplifications); ~5% of colorectal cancers (~60 amplifications, 40% other mutations); ~4% of sarcomas (mostly amplifications); <3% of Glioblastomas (Fusion of FGFR1 and TACC1 (8p11) gene); <3% of Salivary gland cancer (all amplifications); and <2% in certain other cancers. === FGFR inhibitors === FGFR-targeted drugs exert direct as well as indirect anticancer effects, due to the fact that FGFRs on cancer cells and endothelial cells are involved in tumorigenesis and vasculogenesis, respectively. FGFR therapeutics are active as FGF affects numerous features of cancers, such as invasiveness, stemness and cellular survival. Primary among such drugs are antagonists. Small molecules that fit between the ATP binding pockets of the tyrosine kinase domains of the receptors. For FGFR1, numerous such small molecules have been approved for targeting the TKI ATP pocket. These include dovitinib and brivanib. The table below provides the IC50 (nanomolar) of small-molecule compounds targeting FGFRs. FGFR1 mutation in breast and lung cancer as a result of genetic over-amplification is effectively targeted using dovitinib and ponatinib, respectively. Drug resistance is a highly relevant topic in the field of drug development for FGFR targets. FGFR inhibitors allow for the increase of tumor sensitivity to cytotoxic anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel, and etoposide in human cancer cells, thereby decreasing antiapoptotic potential based on faulty FGFR activation. Since FGF signaling inhibition dramatically reduces revascularization, it interferes with one of the hallmarks of cancers, angiogenesis. It also reduces tumor burden in human tumors that depend on autocrine FGF signaling, based on FGF2 upregulation following the common VEGFR-2 therapy for breast cancer. Thus, FGFR1 can act synergistically with therapies to cut off cancer clonal resurgence by eliminating potential pathways of future relapse. Moreover, FGF signaling inhibition dramatically reduces revascularization. FGFR inhibitors have been predicted to be effective on relapsed tumors because of the clonal evolution of an FGFR-activated minor subpopulation after therapy targeted to EGFRs or VEGFRs. Because there are multiple mechanisms of action for FGFR inhibitors to overcome drug resistance in human cancer, FGFR-targeted therapy might be a promising strategy for the treatment of refractory cancer. AZD4547 has undergone a phase II clinical trial in gastric cancer and reported some results. Lucitanib is an inhibitor of FGFR1 and FGFR2 and has undergone clinical trials for advanced solid tumors. Dovitinib (TKI258), an inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, has had a clinical trial on FGFR-amplified breast cancers. == Interactions == Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 has been shown to interact with: FGF1, FRS2, Klotho, GRB14, and SHB. == See also == Cluster of differentiation == References == == Further reading == == External links == GeneReviews/NIH/NCBI/UW entry on FGFR-Related Craniosynostosis Syndromes GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Kallmann syndrome FGFR1+protein,+human at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 on the Atlas of Genetics and Oncology FGFR1 human gene location in the UCSC Genome Browser.

Based on high-resolution mass spectrometry and in vitro and in vivo models, we adopted integrated genomics, proteomics, and immunopeptidomics strategies to study the mechanism underlying the regulation of tumor immunity by Birinapant from the perspective of antigen presentation. Firstly, in HT29 and MCF7 cells, Birinapant increased the number and abundance of immunopeptides and source proteins. Secondly, a greater number of cancer/testis antigen peptides with increased abundance and more neoantigens were identified following Birinapant treatment. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence and immunogenicity of a neoantigen derived from insertion/deletion mutation. Thirdly, in HT29 cell-derived xenograft models, Birinapant administration also reshaped the immunopeptidome, and the tumor exhibited better immunogenicity. These data suggest that Birinapant can reshape the tumor immunopeptidome with respect to quality and quantity, which improves the presentation of CTA peptides and neoantigens, thus enhancing the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Such changes may be vital to the effectiveness of combination therapy, which can be further transferred to the clinic or aid in the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies to improve the anti-tumor immune response. The second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic birinapant attenuated liver injury by inhibited the degradation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in liver macrophage, but its role in LPS induced acute lung injury (ALI) is not understood. The present study was to investigate the effects of birinapant on ALI and its possible mechanism. A dose of birinapant (30 mg/kg) or a vehicle was administered intravenously 24 hours before LPS (100 μg) stimulation in mice. The levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured by ELISA. The infiltrated macrophages and expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was determined by immunohistochemistry staining in the lung tissues. The JNK and p38 MAPK activation, protein expression and K48-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3 were determined in alveolar macrophage cell line (MH-S cells) after 1μg/ml LPS stimulation. The results showed that the birinapant down-regulated the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β in the BALF. In addition, birinapant markedly inhibited macrophages infiltration and MCP-1 protein expression in lung tissues. At last, birinapant suppressed the MAPKsignaling pathway and K48-linked ubiquitinated degradation of TRAF3 in MH-S cells after LPS administration. In conclusion, the results proved that birinapant protected against LPS-induced ALI through inhibiting MAPK activation and K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 in alveolar macrophages. This study investigates the effects of birinapant, a novel compound, on psoriasis-like symptoms induced by imiquimod in Balb/c mice. Male Balb/c mice were treated with imiquimod (IMQ) to induce psoriasis-like symptoms. The clinical characteristics of psoriasis were assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, as well as back skin thickness, skin length and mass, and body weight alterations. The treatment groups included those receiving birinapant, with the assessment on the levels of interleukin-17 and tumor necrosis factor -α, two key cytokines involved in the inflammatory process of psoriasis. The study found that birinapant significantly reduced the levels of these cytokines, providing reassurance about its potential to combat psoriasis. Additionally, the study evaluated the effect of birinapant on oxidative stress levels to determine its role in maintaining skin homeostasis. The findings from this study revealed that mice subjected to IMQ-induced psoriasis exhibited positive responses to 21 days of treatment with birinapant (50 mg/kg). The levels of interleukin-17 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, in the skin of IMQ-treated mice significantly decreased, indicating its effectiveness in reducing inflammation associated with psoriasis. Furthermore, Birinapant positively affected oxidative stress maintenance, suggesting its potential role in promoting skin health and homeostasis. By demonstrating birinapant's efficacy, this research paves the way for further studies that could lead to the development of more effective therapies for psoriasis.",Birinapant,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0007744412287138402), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.005244189407676458)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26333381/?utm_source=openai), [medivir.com](https://www.medivir.com/our-projects/partnerships/birinapantigm-9427?utm_source=openai), [acs.org](https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/b/birinapant.html?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=9, title='A Phase I Study of the SMAC-Mimetic Birinapant in Adults with Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphoma', type='url_citation', url='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26333381/?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=9, title='', type='url_citation', url='https://www.medivir.com/our-projects/partnerships/birinapantigm-9427?utm_source=openai'), AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=297, start_index=9, title='Birinapant - American Chemical Society', type='url_citation', url='https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/b/birinapant.html?utm_source=openai')])"

It is a potent and selective 5-HT1A receptor full agonist. == Pharmacology == In recombinant cell lines expressing human 5-HT1A receptors, befiradol exhibits high agonist efficacy for a variety of signal transduction read-outs, including ERK phosphorylation, G-protein activation, receptor internalization and adenylyl cyclase inhibition. In rat hippocampal membranes it preferentially activates GalphaO proteins. In neurochemical experiments, befiradol activated 5-HT1A autoreceptors in rat dorsal Raphe nucleus as well as 5-HT1A heteroreceptors on pyramidal neurons in the frontal cortex. In rat models, it has powerful analgesic and antiallodynic effects comparable to those of high doses of opioid painkillers, but with fewer and less prominent side effects, as well as little or no development of tolerance with repeated use. A structure–activity relationship (SAR) study revealed that replacement of the dihalophenyl moiety by 3-benzothienyl increases maximal efficacy from 84% to 124% (Ki=2.7 nM). == History == Befiradol was discovered and developed by Pierre Fabre Médicament, a French pharmaceuticals company who initially developed it as a treatment for chronic pain. In September 2013, befiradol was out-licensed to Neurolixis, a US-based biotechnology company. Neurolixis announced that it intended to re-purpose befiradol for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. In support of this indication, Neurolixis received several research grants from the Michael J. Fox Foundation and preclinical data was published describing the activity of befiradol in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Studies published in 2020 using non-human primate models of Parkinson's disease, (MPTP-treated marmosets and MPTP-treated macaques), found that befiradol potently reduced Levodopa-induced dyskinesia at oral doses as low as 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg. In January 2018, the British charity Parkinson's UK announced that it had awarded Neurolixis a grant to advance development of befiradol up to clinical phase in Parkinson's disease patients. == Clinical Ph2A Trial for dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease == In March 2019, Neurolixis announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave a positive response to Neurolixis' Investigational New Drug (IND) application for NLX-112 to be tested in a Phase 2 clinical study in Parkinson's disease patients with troublesome levodopa-induced dyskinesia. On 22 November 2020, The Sunday Times reported that the two charities, Parkinson's UK and Michael J. Fox Foundation, were jointly investing $2 million to support a clinical trial on befiradol in Parkinson's disease patients with troublesome Levodopa-induced dyskinesia, a potentially ""life changing"" drug. On 23 November 2020, Parkinson's UK and Michael J. Fox Foundation, confirmed their funding in an official announcement. Neurolixis announced on 30 November 2021 the start of patient recruitment in the clinical trial. The trial is listed on the U.S. National Library of Medicine clinical trials register. On 20 March 2023, a joint press release from Neurolixis, Parkinson's UK and Michael J. Fox Foundation announced that the clinical trial had met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability, and also the secondary endpoint of efficacy in reducing Levodopa-induced dyskinesia in the patients. Moreover, a later announcement (7 July 2023) disclosed that the clinical trial had also found that befiradol reduced parkinsonism symptoms (such as slowness of movement, tremor and rigidity), as well as Levodopa-induced dyskinesia, raising the prospect of developing a ""dual-efficacy therapy"" for Parkinson's disease. == 18F-Befiradol as an agonist PET radiotracer for brain imaging == As well as studies on befiradol for treatment of movement disorders, other researchers have investigated it as a novel radiotracer for brain imaging studies by positron emission tomography. Thus befiradol labeled with [18F] (also known as 18F-F13640) has been used to study the distribution of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors in rat, cat, macaque and human.

Importantly, we investigate the efficacy of tipifarnib, a recently identified exosome biogenesis inhibitor that targets the critical proteins (Rab27a [Ras associated binding protein 27a], nSMase2 [neutral sphingomyelinase 2], and Alix [ALG-2-interacting protein X]) involved in exosome biogenesis for this mouse model of HF. In this study, 10-week-old male mice underwent TAC surgery were randomly assigned to groups with and without tipifarnib treatment (10 mg/kg 3 times/wk) and monitored for 8 weeks, and a comprehensive assessment was conducted through performed echocardiographic, histological, and biochemical studies. TAC significantly elevated circulating plasma exosomes and markedly increased cardiac left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Furthermore, injection of plasma exosomes from TAC mice induced left ventricular dysfunction and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in uninjured mice without TAC. On the contrary, treatment of tipifarnib in TAC mice reduced circulating exosomes to baseline and remarkably improved left ventricular functions, hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Tipifarnib treatment also drastically altered the miRNA profile of circulating post-TAC exosomes, including miR 331-5p, which was highly downregulated both in TAC circulating exosomes and in TAC cardiac tissue. Mechanistically, miR 331-5p is crucial for inhibiting the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition by targeting HOXC8, a critical regulator of fibrosis. Tipifarnib treatment in TAC mice upregulated the expression of miR 331-5p that acts as a potent repressor for one of the fibrotic mechanisms mediated by HOXC8. Our study underscores the pathological role of exosomes in HF and fibrosis in response to pressure overload. Tipifarnib-mediated inhibition of exosome biogenesis and cargo sorting may serve as a viable strategy to prevent progressive cardiac remodeling in HF. A phase 2, international, open-label, nonrandomized, single-arm trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tipifarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, as monotherapy for relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and to evaluate tumor mutation profile as a biomarker of response. Adults with relapsed/refractory PTCL received tipifarnib 300 mg orally twice daily for 21 days in a 28-day cycle. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR); secondary end points included ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and adverse events (AEs) in specific subtypes. Sixty-five patients with PTCL were enrolled: n = 38 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), n = 25 PTCL not otherwise specified, and n = 2 other T-cell lymphomas. The ORR was 39.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.1-52.5) in all patients and 56.3% (95% CI, 39.3-71.8) for AITL. Median PFS was 3.5 months overall (954% CI, 2.1-4.4), and 3.6 months (95% CI, 1.9-8.3) for AITL. Median DOR was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.0-15.3), and greatest in patients with AITL (7.8 months; 95% CI, 2.0-16.3). The median overall survival was 32.8 months (95% CI, 14.4 to not applicable). Tipifarnib-related hematologic AEs were manageable and included neutropenia (43.1%), thrombocytopenia (36.9%), and anemia (30.8%); other tipifarnib-related AEs included nausea (29.2%) and diarrhea (27.7%). One treatment-related death occurred. Mutations in RhoA, DNMT3A, and IDH2 were seen in 60%, 33%, and 27%, respectively, in the AITL tipifarnib responder group vs 36%, 9%, and 9% in the nonresponder group. Tipifarnib monotherapy demonstrated encouraging clinical activity in heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory PTCL, especially in AITL, with a manageable safety profile.

Purvalanol A (Pur) is a novel cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in various cancer cells. The present study investigated the effect of the combination treatment of Pur and DDP, and the potential anticancer mechanisms in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells in vitro and in vivo . We found that Pur enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of cisplatin in EOC cells. The combination of Pur and DDP had more significant effects on apoptosis induction in EOC cells compared with the individual-treatment groups and the control group. We further demonstrated that the combination of Pur and DDP may trigger apoptosis and autophagy in EOC cells by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). And the ROS/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway as a potential mechanism for the initiation of autophagy induced by combination therapy. Similar results were observed in vivo . These results demonstrated that Pur sensitized the response of EOC cells to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo , reversing the resistance to cisplatin in ovarian cancer. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Src is frequently over-expressed or hyperactivated in various human cancers and contributes to cancer progression in cooperation with up-regulated growth factor receptors. However, Src-selective anticancer drugs are still in clinical trials. To identify more effective inhibitors of c-Src-mediated cancer progression, we developed a new screening platform using Csk-deficient cells that can be transformed by c-Src. We found that purvalanol A, developed as a CDK inhibitor, potently suppressed the anchorage-independent growth of c-Src-transformed cells, indicating that the activation of CDKs contributes to the c-Src transformation. We also found that purvalanol A suppressed the c-Src activity as effectively as the Src-selective inhibitor PP2, and that it reverted the transformed morphology to a nearly normal shape with less cytotoxicity than PP2. Purvalanol A induced a strong G2-M arrest, whereas PP2 weakly acted on the G1-S transition. Furthermore, when compared with PP2, purvalanol A more effectively suppressed the growth of human colon cancer HT29 and SW480 cells, in which Src family kinases and CDKs are activated. These findings demonstrate that the coordinated inhibition of cell cycle progression and tyrosine kinase signaling by the multi-selective purvalanol A is effective in suppressing cancer progression associated with c-Src up-regulation. Purvalanol A is a specific CDK inhibitor which triggers apoptosis by causing cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. Although it has strong apoptotic potential, the mechanistic action of Purvalanol A on significant cell signaling targets has not been clarified yet. Polyamines are crucial metabolic regulators affected by CDK inhibition because of their role in cell cycle progress as well. In addition, malignant cells possess impaired polyamine homeostasis with high level of intracellular polyamines. Especially induction of polyamine catabolic enzymes spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), polyamine oxidase (PAO) and spermine oxidase (SMO) induced toxic by-products in correlation with the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. In this study, we showed that Purvalanol A induced apoptosis in caspase- dependent manner in MCF-7 ER(+) cells, while MDA-MB-231 (ER-) cells were less sensitive against drug. In addition Bcl-2 is a critical target for Purvalanol A, since Bcl-2 overexpressed cells are more resistant to Purvalanol A-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, exposure of MCF-7 cells to Purvalanol A triggered SSAT and PAO upregulation and the presence of PAO/SMO inhibitor, MDL 72,527 prevented Purvalanol A-induced apoptosis.",Purvalanol a,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004307884373702109), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.006798943970352411), ('ICAL', -2.3841830625315197e-06), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.01818063110113144)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.048587486147880554)])","('INFO; ', [])"
666,"('Paliperidone', 'Invega', 'R 76477', 'Paliperidone [usan:inn:ban:jan]', 'Invega (tn)')",Medical,"Paliperidone, sold under the brand name Invega among others, is an atypical antipsychotic. It is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. It is marketed by J&J Innovative Medicine. Paliperidone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia in December 2006, and in the European Union in June 2007. Paliperidone palmitate is a long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone palmitoyl ester. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Paliperidone is available as a generic medication. == Medical use == In the US, paliperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder as monotherapy and as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants. In the EU, paliperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents fifteen years of age and older and for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in adults. Paliperidone is used for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. == Adverse effects == The most frequent side effects include headache, insomnia, sleepiness, parkinsonism (effects similar to Parkinson's disease such as shaking, muscle stiffness and slow movement), dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions), tremor (shaking), dizziness, akathisia (restlessness), agitation, anxiety, depression, increased weight, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia (heartburn), diarrhea, dry mouth, tiredness, toothache, muscle and bone pain, back pain, asthenia (weakness), tachycardia (increased heart rate), high blood pressure, prolonged QT interval (an alteration of the electrical activity of the heart), upper respiratory tract infection (nose and throat infections) and cough. Palperidone can also rarely cause priapism or sexual dysfunction related to hyperprolactinemia. A 2023 study found that paliperidone may worsen verbal learning and memory compared to placebo in the early months of psychosis treatment. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. === Deaths === In April 2014, it was reported that 21 Japanese people who had received shots of the long-acting injectable paliperidone palmitate had died, out of 10,700 individuals prescribed the drug. == Pharmacology == Paliperidone is the primary active metabolite of the older antipsychotic risperidone. While its specific mechanism of action is unknown, it is believed paliperidone and risperidone act via similar, if not identical, pathways. Its efficacy is believed to result from central dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonism except paliperidone, like its parent compound risperidone, functions as an inverse agonist at 5-HT2A 15. Paliperidone also acts as an antagonist of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors as well as H1 histaminergic receptors. Food is known to increase the absorption of Invega type ER OROS prolonged-release tablets. Food increased exposure of paliperidone by up to 50-60%; however, half-life was not significantly affected. The effect was probably due to a delay in the transit of the ER OROS formulation in the upper part of the GI tract, resulting in increased absorption. Risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone are reduced in efficacy by P-glycoprotein inducers such as St John's wort Values are Ki (nM). The smaller the value, the more strongly the drug binds to the site. == History == Paliperidone (as Invega) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia in 2006. Paliperidone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in 2009. The long-acting injectable form of paliperidone, marketed as Invega Sustenna in the US, and Xeplion in the EU, was approved by the FDA in July 2009. It was initially approved in the European Union in 2007, for schizophrenia, the extended release form and use for schizoaffective disorder were approved in the EU in 2010, and extension to use in adolescents older than 15 years old was approved in 2014. == Society and culture == === Brand names === In May 2015, a formulation of paliperidone palmitate was approved by the FDA under the brand name Invega Trinza. A similar prolonged release suspension was approved in 2016 by the European Medicines Agency originally under the brand name Paliperidone Janssen, later renamed to Trevicta.

667,"('Silodosin', 'Rapaflo', 'Urief', 'Silodyx', 'Urorec')",Medical,"Silodosin, sold under the brand name Urief among others, is a medication used for the symptomatic treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It acts as an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist. The most common side effect is a reduction in the amount of semen released during ejaculation. == Medical uses == Silodosin is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. == Contraindications == Silodosin is contraindicated for people with kidney impairment or severe liver impairment. According to European labels, silodosin has no contraindications apart from known hypersensitivity. Another source names recurring urinary retention, recurring urinary infections, uncontrolled macrohematuria, bladder stones, hydronephrosis, combination with other α1-antagonists or dopamine agonists, and severe renal or hepatic impairment as contraindications. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), silodosin is contraindicated with paxlovid, a drug used in treating COVID-19. == Side effects == The most common adverse effect is loss of seminal emission. This seems to be caused by silodosin's high selectivity for α1A receptors. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome occurs in some people taking alpha adrenoreceptor antagonists and may lead to complications during cataract surgery. Other common adverse effects (in more than 1% of patients) are dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhea, and clogged nose. Less common (0.1–1%) are tachycardia (fast heartbeat), dry mouth, nausea, skin reactions, and erectile dysfunction. Hypersensitivity reactions occur in fewer than 0.01% of patients. There have been reports about intraoperative floppy iris syndrome during cataract extractions. == Interactions == Combining silodosin with strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, significantly increases its concentrations in the blood plasma and its area under the curve (area under the curve (AUC)). Less potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem have a less pronounced effect on this parameters, which is not considered clinically significant. Inhibitors and inducers of the enzyme UGT2B7, alcohol dehydrogenases, and aldehyde dehydrogenases, as well as the transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), may also influence silodosin concentrations in the body. Digoxin, which is transported by P-gp, is not affected by silodosin; this means that silodosin does not significantly inhibit or induce P-gp. No relevant interactions with antihypertensive drugs or with PDE5 inhibitors have been found in studies; although combination with other α1-antagonists is not well studied. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Silodosin is an alpha adrenoreceptor antagonist. It works by blocking receptors called alpha-1A adrenoreceptors in the prostate gland, the bladder and the urethra (the tube that leads from the bladder to the outside of the body). When these receptors are activated, they cause the muscles controlling the flow of urine to contract. By blocking these receptors, silodosin allows these muscles to relax, making it easier to pass urine and relieving the symptoms of BPH. Silodosin has high affinity for the alpha1A-adrenergic receptor in the prostate, the bladder, and the prostatic urethra. By this mechanism, it relaxes the smooth muscles in these organs, easing urinary flow and other symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. === Pharmacokinetics === The absolute bioavailability after oral intake is 32%. Food has little effect on the area under the curve. When in the bloodstream, 96,6% of the substance are bound to blood plasma proteins. Its main metabolite is silodosin glucuronide, which inhibits the α1A receptor with 1/8 of the affinity of the parent substance. 91% of the glucuronide are bound to plasma proteins. The enzyme mainly responsible for the formation of the glucuronide is UGT2B7. Other enzymes involved in the metabolism are alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases and CYP3A4. == History == Silodosin received its first marketing approval in Japan in May 2006, under the brand name Urief, which is jointly marketed by Kissei Pharmaceutical and Daiichi Sankyo. Kissei licensed the US, Canadian, and Mexican rights for silodosin to Watson Pharmaceuticals (now Allergan) in 2004. AbbVie absorbed Allergan in 2019. The FDA and Health Canada approved silodosin under the brand name Rapaflo in October 2008, and January 2011, respectively. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Other brand names include Urorec, Niksol, Silorel, Rapilif, Silotrif, Sildoo, Silodal Silofast, Alphacept, Thrupas, and Flopadex. == Research == Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists are being investigated as a means to male birth control due to their ability to inhibit ejaculation but not orgasm. While silodosin was completely efficacious in preventing the release of semen in all subjects, 12 out of the 15 participants reported mild discomfort upon orgasm. The men also reported the psychosexual side effect of being strongly dissatisfied by their lack of ejaculation. == References == == Further reading == Kawabe K, Yoshida M, Homma Y (November 2006).

Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, was developed in 2004 by Novartis Pharma, AG, and is manufactured by Eisai. Rufinamide was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2008, as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children four years and older and adults.

(Palladio), a subsidiary of Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc. As of December 2021, lixivaptan is in Phase III clinical development for the treatment of Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common form of polycystic kidney disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to lixivaptan for the treatment of ADPKD. == Mechanism of action == Lixivaptan is a potent, non-peptide, selective vasopressin receptor antagonist. It is a member of the vaptan class of drugs. === Hyponatremia === V2 receptor antagonists inhibit the binding of arginine vasopressin to vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R) in kidney tubular epithelial cells, thereby having a net effect of aquaresis, or electrolyte free water excretion. This property of vaptans explains their use as therapies to treat euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. === ADPKD === V2 receptor antagonists may have utility as therapies for ADPKD. Genetic mutations associated with ADPKD cause an increase in intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which results in increased cellular proliferation and cyst formation and expansion in the kidney. Cyst growth displaces and destroys normal kidney tissue, leading to a decreased number and function of nephrons. Because intracellular cAMP is a secondary messenger for vasopressin acting at V2R (vasopressin receptor 2), V2 receptor antagonists can restore normal levels of intracellular cAMP, thereby delaying cyst growth. Treatment with specific V2 receptor antagonists have shown a reduction in kidney size and cyst volume in animal models of PKD. In particular, lixivaptan has demonstrated beneficial effects on cystic disease progression in rat and mouse models of ADPKD. == Research == === V2 Receptor Antagonists in ADPKD === Proof of efficacy for V2 receptor antagonists to treat ADPKD has been demonstrated by clinical trials with tolvaptan, a vasopressin antagonist in the same drug class as lixivaptan. In clinical studies, tolvaptan showed a significant decrease in the rate of disease progression in patients with ADPKD, which led to regulatory approvals for tolvaptan as a treatment of ADPKD in many countries, including the U.S., the EU, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Korea, among others. However, tolvaptan therapy is associated with potentially life-threatening liver toxicity in patients with ADPKD. Because of the risk of liver toxicity, in the US, tolvaptan is only available for ADPKD under a restricted distribution program (a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS program). The FDA-approved prescribing information for tolvaptan for ADPKD includes a boxed warning for the risk of serious liver toxicity. === Clinical studies === ==== Hyponatremia ==== Lixivaptan was previously administered to more than 1600 subjects across 36 clinical studies as part of a prior clinical development program for the treatment of hyponatremia sponsored by Cardiokine, Inc. Across these studies, lixivaptan showed prolonged inhibition of the vasopressin V2 receptor, as measured by changes in pharmacodynamic markers such as urine osmolality, plasma copeptin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Development of lixivaptan for hyponatremia indications is no longer ongoing. ==== ADPKD ==== Palladio conducted the ELiSA Phase II study with lixivaptan in 31 ADPKD patients. In this study, the proportion of study subjects who showed a urine osmolality response consistent with full vasopressin V2 receptor inhibition was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the published effect seen in clinical studies conducted with tolvaptan. A Phase III study by Palladio to investigate whether it is safe and effective for the treatment of ADPKD was commenced in October 2021. The Phase III program with lixivaptan consists of two ongoing clinical trials: the ACTION and ALERT studies. ==== The ACTION study ==== The ACTION study is a pivotal registration-enabling Phase III clinical trial of lixivaptan in patients with ADPKD. It is projected to enroll 1350 patients in more than 20 countries worldwide. If the ACTION study is successful, it will provide the main clinical evidence supporting the potential safety and efficacy of lixivaptan for the treatment of ADPKD. The ACTION trial consists of two main parts. In Part 1 of the study, after completing the screening, run-in and titration periods, study subjects will enter a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized period during which they will receive lixivaptan or placebo for 12 months. This part of the trial will compare the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements between the two groups to investigate the efficacy of lixivaptan in slowing the decline in kidney function. This is followed by Part 2 of the study, during which all study participants who complete Part 1 will receive lixivaptan in a single-arm, open-label phase for an additional 12 months. Part 2 will investigate whether lixivaptan's effect on kidney function continues to accrue over time. Altogether, including the titration periods, participants in the ACTION study will be taking study drug for more than two years, including lixivaptan for at least one year. It is expected that Part 1 will be completed for all participants by February 2025; Part 2 is projected to run until April 2026. ==== The ALERT study ==== The second Phase III study with lixivaptan is the ALERT study. The goal of this study is to investigate whether lixivaptan can be safely used in patients with ADPKD who were previously treated with tolvaptan, but who had to permanently discontinue tolvaptan therapy due to liver toxicity. In the study, following titration to an optimal dose, up to 50 patients with ADPKD will be enrolled and treated with lixivaptan for 52 weeks. They will be monitored frequently for signs of liver toxicity for as long as they are taking lixivaptan. At the completion of the 52 weeks maintenance period, patients will be eligible to continue to receive lixivaptan in an open label extension study. === DILIsym simulations === Tolvaptan was studied in DILIsym®, a state of the art, multiscale computational model that uses non-clinical and clinical drug data to predict whether a drug could cause idiosyncratic liver toxicity. DILIsym® replicated accurately the liver toxicity observed with tolvaptan in clinical studies. Conversely, results from the DILIsym® study with lixivaptan suggest that lixivaptan may be less likely to cause idiosyncratic liver toxicity within this modeling system. Whether this result reliably predicts a lower risk of liver injury for lixivaptan will require more clinical safety data, which will be collected as part of the two ongoing Phase III clinical studies. == References ==",Lixivaptan,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -3.802703940891661e-05), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0009189196862280369)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19379124/,https://www.drugs.com/history/lixivaptan.html,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21046526/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lixivaptan ', [])"
671,"('Flibanserin', 'Bimt 17', 'Addyi', 'Girosa', 'Filbanserin.')",Medical,"Flibanserin, sold under the brand name Addyi, is a medication approved for the treatment of pre-menopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). The medication improves sexual desire, increases the number of satisfying sexual events, and decreases the distress associated with low sexual desire. The most common side effects are dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep and dry mouth. Development by Boehringer Ingelheim was halted in October 2010, following a negative evaluation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The rights to the drug were then transferred to Sprout Pharmaceuticals, which achieved approval of the drug by the US FDA in August 2015. Addyi is approved for medical use in the US for premenopausal women with HSDD and in Canada for premenopausal and postmenopausal women with HSDD. HSDD was recognized as a distinct sexual function disorder for more than 30 years, but was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013, and replaced with a new diagnosis called female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD). == Medical uses == Flibanserin is used for hypoactive sexual desire disorder among women. The onset of the flibanserin effect was seen from the first timepoint measured after 4 weeks of treatment and maintained throughout the treatment period. The effectiveness of flibanserin was evaluated in three phase 3 clinical trials. Each of the three trials had two co-primary endpoints, one for satisfying sexual events (SSEs) and the other for sexual desire. Each of the 3 trials also had a secondary endpoint that measured distress related to sexual desire. All three trials showed that flibanserin produced an increase in the number of SSEs and reduced distress related to sexual desire. The first two trials used an electronic diary to measure sexual desire, and did not find an increase. These two trials also measured sexual desire using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) as a secondary endpoint, and an increase was observed using this latter measure. The FSFI was used as the co-primary endpoint for sexual desire in the third trial, and again showed a statistically significant increase. Supportive analyses based on the patient's perspective of her symptoms at the end of the study showed that improvements in symptoms of HSDD were not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful to women. == Side effects == The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly reported adverse events included dizziness, nausea, feeling tired, sleepiness, and trouble sleeping. Drinking alcohol while on flibanserin may increase the risk of severe low blood pressure. The Addyi Prescribing Information was updated in 2019 following the FDA's review of three postmarketing alcohol interaction studies which led to increased understanding of this drug interaction. This new data led to a removal of the contraindication with alcohol and new recommendations on how to safely consume alcohol while receiving Addyi therapy. Current recommendations are to wait at least two hours after consuming one or two standard alcoholic drinks before taking ADDYI at bedtime or to skip their ADDYI dose if they have consumed three or more standard alcoholic drinks that evening. == Mechanism of action == === Activity profile === Flibanserin acts as a full agonist in the frontal cortex and the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus, but only as a partial agonist in the CA3 region of the hippocampus of the 5-HT1A receptor (serotonin receptor) (Ki = 1 nM in CHO cells, but only 15–50 nM in cortex, hippocampus and dorsal raphe) and, with lower affinity, as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor (Ki = 49 nM) and antagonist or very weak partial agonist of the D4 receptor (Ki = 4–24 nM, Ki = 8–650 nM ). Despite the much greater affinity of flibanserin for the 5-HT1A receptor, and for reasons that are unknown (although it might be caused by the competition with endogenous serotonin), flibanserin occupies the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in vivo with similar percentages. Flibanserin also has low affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor (Ki = 89.3 nM) and the 5-HT2C receptor (Ki = 88.3 nM), both of which it behaves as an antagonist of. Flibanserin preferentially activates 5-HT1A receptors in the prefrontal cortex, demonstrating regional selectivity, and has been found to increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels and decrease serotonin levels in the rat prefrontal cortex, actions that were determined to be mediated by activation of the 5-HT1A receptor. As such, flibanserin has been described as a norepinephrine–dopamine disinhibitor (NDDI). The proposed mechanism of action refers to the Kinsey dual control model of sexual response. Various neurotransmitters, sex steroids, and other hormones have important excitatory or inhibitory effects on the sexual response. Among neurotransmitters, excitatory activity is driven by dopamine and norepinephrine, while inhibitory activity is driven by serotonin. The balance between these systems is of significance for a normal sexual response. By modulating serotonin and dopamine activity in certain parts of the brain, flibanserin may improve the balance between these neurotransmitter systems in the regulation of sexual response. == Society and culture == Flibanserin was originally developed as an antidepressant, but was found to have pro-sexual effects and was later repurposed for the treatment of HSDD. === Names === The brand name is Addyi. === Approval process and advocacy === In June 2010, a federal advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unanimously voted against recommending approval of flibanserin, citing an inadequate risk-benefit ratio. The Committee acknowledged the validity of hypoactive sexual desire as a diagnosis, but expressed concern with the drug's side effects and insufficient evidence for efficacy, especially the drug's failure to show a statistically significant effect on the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire. Earlier in the week, a FDA staff report also recommended non-approval of the drug. Ahead of the votes, Boehringer Ingelheim had mounted a publicity campaign to promote the controversial disorder of ""hypoactive sexual desire"". In 2010 the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, stating that the New Drug Application could not be approved in its current form. The letter cited several concerns, including the failure to demonstrate a statistical effect on the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire and overly restrictive entry criteria for the two Phase 3 trials. The Agency recommended performing a new Phase 3 trial with less restrictive entry criteria. On 8 October 2010, Boehringer announced that it would discontinue its development of flibanserin in light of the FDA's decision. Sprout responded to the FDA's cited deficiencies and refiled the NDA in 2013. The submission included data from a new Phase 3 trial and several Phase 1 drug-drug interaction studies. The FDA again refused the application, citing an uncertain risk/benefit ratio. In December 2013, a Formal Dispute Resolution was filed, which contained the requirements of the FDA for further studies. These include two studies in healthy subjects to determine if flibanserin impairs their ability to drive, and to determine if it interferes with other biochemical pathways. The Agency agreed to call a new Advisory Committee meeting to consider whether the risk-benefit ratio of flibanserin was favorable after this additional data was obtained. Sprout expected to resubmit the New Drug Application (NDA) in the 3rd quarter of 2014. In June 2015, the US FDA Advisory Committee, which includes the Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee (BRUDAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (DSRM), recommended approval of the drug by 18–6, with the proviso that measures be taken to inform women of the drug's side effects. On 18 August 2015, the FDA approved Addyi (Flibanserin) for the treatment of premenopausal women with low sexual desire that causes personal distress or relationship difficulties. The approval specified that flibanserin should not be used to treat low sexual desire caused by co-existing psychiatric or medical problems; low sexual desire caused by problems in the relationship; or low sexual desire due to medication side effects. As of 21 August 2015, The Pharmaceutical Journal reported that Sprout Pharmaceuticals had not yet made an application to the European Medicines Agency for a marketing authorisation. === Advocacy groups === Even the Score, a coalition of women's groups brought together by a Sprout consultant, actively campaigned for the approval of flibanserin. The campaign emphasized that several approved treatments for male sexual dysfunction exist, while no such treatment for women was available. The group successfully obtained letters of support from the President of the National Organization for Women, the editor of the Journal of Sexual Medicine, and several members of Congress. Other organizations supporting the approval of flibanserin included the National Council of Women's Organizations, the Black Women's Health Imperative, the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, National Consumers League, and the American Sexual Health Association. The approval was opposed by the National Women's Health Network, the National Center for Health Research and Our Bodies Ourselves. A representative of PharmedOut said ""To approve this drug will set the worst kind of precedent — that companies that spend enough money can force the FDA to approve useless or dangerous drugs."" An editorial in JAMA noted that, ""Although flibanserin is not the first product to be supported by a consumer advocacy group in turn supported by pharmaceutical manufacturers, claims of gender bias regarding the FDA's regulation have been particularly noteworthy, as have the extent of advocacy efforts ranging from social media campaigns to letters from members of Congress"". The Even the Score campaign was managed by Blue Engine Message & Media, a public relations firm, and received funding from Sprout. === Acquisition by Valeant Pharmaceuticals === In August 2015, Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Sprout Pharmaceuticals announced that Valeant will acquire Sprout, on a debt-free basis, for approximately $1 billion in cash, plus a share of future profits based upon the achievement of certain milestones. == Reception == The initial response since the 2015 introduction of flibanserin to the U.S. market was slow with 227 prescriptions written during the first three weeks. The slow response may be related to a number of factors: physicians require about 10 minutes of online training to get certified; the medication has to be taken daily and costs about US$400 per month; and questions about the drug's efficacy and need. Prescriptions for the drug continue to be few with less than 4,000 being made as of February 2016. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""FDA orders important safety labeling changes for Addyi"".

It is a small-molecule, orally active, selective neurokinin-3 (NK3) receptor antagonist which is under development for the treatment of sex hormone-related disorders. It is taken by mouth. It was developed by Astellas Pharma which acquired it from Ogeda (formerly Euroscreen) in April 2017. The most common side effects include abdominal pain, diarrhea, insomnia, back pain, hot flush and elevated hepatic transaminases. Fezolinetant was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2023, and in the European Union in December 2023. Fezolinetant is the first neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonist approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat moderate to severe hot flashes from menopause. The FDA considers it to be a first-in-class medication. == Medical uses == Fezolinetant is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. == Adverse effects == In September 2024, the US FDA added a warning to the prescribing label that fezolinetant can cause rare but serious liver injury. == History == In May 2017, fezolinetant had completed phase I and phase IIa clinical trials for hot flashes in postmenopausal females. Phase IIa trials in polycystic ovary syndrome patients are ongoing. In March 2023, results from SKYLIGHT 1, a Phase III clinical study of the treatment of moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause, were published in The Lancet. Fezolinetant shows high affinity for and potent inhibition of the NK3 receptor in vitro (Ki = 25 nM, IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 20 nM). Loss-of-function mutations in TACR and TACR3, the genes respectively encoding neurokinin B and its receptor, the NK3 receptor, have been found in patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In accordance, NK3 receptor antagonists like fezolinetant have been found to dose-dependently suppress luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, though not that of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and consequently to dose-dependently decrease estradiol and progesterone levels in females and testosterone levels in males. As such, they are similar to GnRH modulators, and present as a potential clinical alternative to them for use in the same kinds of indications. However, the inhibition of sex hormone production by NK3 receptor inactivation tends to be less complete and ""non-castrating"" relative to that of GnRH modulators, and so they may have a reduced incidence of menopausal-like side effects such as loss of bone mineral density. Unlike GnRH modulators, but similarly to estrogens, NK3 receptor antagonists including fezolinetant and MLE-4901 (also known as AZD-4901, formerly AZD-2624) have been found to alleviate hot flashes in menopausal females. This would seem to be independent of their actions on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and hence on sex hormone production. NK3 receptor antagonists are anticipated as a useful clinical alternative to estrogens for management of hot flashes, but with potentially reduced risks and side effects. The effectiveness of Veozah to treat moderate to severe hot flashes was demonstrated in each of the first 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind portions of two phase III clinical trials. In both trials, after the first 12 weeks, the females on placebo were then re-randomized to Veozah for a 40-week extension study to evaluate safety. Each trial ran a total of 52 weeks. The average age of the trial participants was 54 years old. The FDA granted the application for fezolinetant priority review designation. The approval of Veozah was granted to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In October 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Veoza, intended for the treatment of hot flushes (vasomotor symptoms) associated with menopause. The applicant for this medicinal product is Astellas Pharma Europe B.V. Fezolinetant was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2023, and in the European Union in December 2023. === Brand names === Fezolinetant is the international nonproprietary name.

Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl is formulated with the safener isoxadifen-ethyl for Echinochloa crus-galli control in rice. Safeners act on crops by increasing herbicide metabolism, but this effect may also occur in weeds. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the safener isoxadifen-ethyl on the resistance to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl in a biotype of E. crus-galli. A screening of 52 biotypes identified lack of control in the biotype SANTPAT-R treated with the recommended dose of 69 g ha The safener isoxadifen-ethyl present in the commercial herbicide formulation of fenoxaprop-p-ethyl is associated with resistance in the E. crus-galli SANTPAT-R biotype. This resistance is related with herbicide metabolization mediated by GST pathways. This is the first field-selected weed biotype with herbicide resistance due to safener presence in the sprayed formulation. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry. Alopecurus japonicus is a serious grass weed species in wheat fields in eastern Asia, and has evolved strong resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibiting herbicides. Although target-site resistance (TSR) to ACCase inhibitors in A. japonicus has been reported, non-target site resistance (NTSR) has not. This study investigated both TSR and NTSR in a fenoxaprop-P-ethyl-resistant A. japonicus population (AHFD-3), which was collected in Feidong County, Anhui Province, China. We found that AHFD-3 exhibited high resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and low resistance to flucarbazone-sodium. The sensitivity of AHFD-3 to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl increased significantly after treatment with cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibitors; however, such synergies between P450 inhibitors and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl were not found in two control populations. Sequences of the entire carboxyltransferase domain of A. japonicus ACCase were obtained, and AHFD-3 plants showed an Asp-2078-Gly substitution in the ACCase. With the derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) method, we found that 85.4% of the plants of AHFD-3 carried this mutation. The P450 content in AHFD-3 plants was significantly higher than those of the two control populations after treatment with fenoxaprop-P-ethyl. Ten partial sequences of P450 genes in A. japonicus were cloned. Three P450 genes were up-regulated 12 h after fenoxaprop-P-ethyl treatment, which were all from the P450 subfamily CYP72A. Moreover, a P450 gene from the P450 family CYP81 was up-regulated after fenoxaprop-P-ethyl treatment in all populations studied. Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl resistance in AHFD-3 plants was conferred by up-regulation of cytochrome P450s in the CYP72A subfamily and target site mutation of the ACCase gene. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. The dissipation kinetics of fenoxaprop-p-ethyl and its metabolite (fenoxaprop acid) at two application rates under wheat field conditions for two seasons was investigated. Herbicides were extracted by solid liquid extraction, cleaned up, and analyzed by a liquid chromatography-UV detector. Dissipation followed first-order kinetics; in soil, fenoxaprop-p-ethyl dissipated rapidly with an average half-life of 1.45 to 2.30 days, while fenoxaprop acid persisted for more than 30 days. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, linearity, specificity, and precision. Linearity was in the range of 5 to 5,000 ng, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2 and 1 ng for fenoxaprop-p-ethyl and fenoxaprop acid, respectively.

Dual targeting of glucose and glutamine metabolism by the mTOR inhibitor everolimus plus the oral glutaminase inhibitor telaglenastat showed preclinical synergistic anticancer effects, which translated to encouraging safety and efficacy findings in a phase I trial of 2L+ renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study evaluated telaglenastat plus everolimus (TelaE) versus placebo plus everolimus (PboE) in patients with advanced/metastatic RCC (mRCC) in the 3L+ setting (NCT03163667). Eligible patients with mRCC, previously treated with at least two prior lines of therapy [including ≥1 VEGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)] were randomized 2:1 to receive E, plus Tela or Pbo, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS; one-sided α <0.2). Sixty-nine patients were randomized (46 TelaE, 23 PboE). Patients had a median three prior lines of therapy, including TKIs (100%) and checkpoint inhibitors (88%). At median follow-up of 7.5 months, median PFS was 3.8 months for TelaE versus 1.9 months for PboE [HR, 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34-1.20; one-sided P = 0.079]. One TelaE patient had a partial response and 26 had stable disease (SD). Eleven patients on PboE had SD. Treatment-emergent adverse events included fatigue, anemia, cough, dyspnea, elevated serum creatinine, and diarrhea; grade 3 to 4 events occurred in 74% TelaE patients versus 61% PboE. TelaE was well tolerated and improved PFS versus PboE in patients with mRCC previously treated with TKIs and checkpoint inhibitors. Dual inhibition of glucose and glutamine metabolism results in synergistic anticancer effects in solid tumor models. Telaglenastat, an investigational, small-molecule, glutaminase inhibitor, exhibits modest single-agent activity in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. This phase Ib trial evaluated telaglenastat plus cabozantinib or everolimus, agents known to impair glucose metabolism in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC). mRCC patients received escalating doses of telaglenastat [400-800 mg per os (p.o.) twice daily] in a 3 + 3 design, plus either everolimus (10 mg daily p.o.; TelaE) or cabozantinib (60 mg daily p.o.; TelaC). Tumor response (RECISTv1.1) was assessed every 8 weeks. Endpoints included safety (primary) and antitumor activity. Twenty-seven patients received TelaE, 13 received TelaC, with median 2 and 3 prior therapies, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events were mostly grades 1 to 2, most common including decreased appetite, anemia, elevated transaminases, and diarrhea with TelaE, and diarrhea, decreased appetite, elevated transaminases, and fatigue with TelaC. One dose-limiting toxicity occurred per cohort: grade 3 pruritic rash with TelaE and thrombocytopenia with TelaC. No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached for either combination, leading to a recommended phase II dose of 800-mg telaglenastat twice daily with standard doses of E or C. TelaE disease control rate (DCR; response rate + stable disease) was 95.2% [20/21, including 1 partial response (PR)] among 21 patients with clear cell histology and 66.7% (2/3) for papillary. TelaC DCR was 100% (12/12) for both histologies [5/10 PRs as best response (3 confirmed) in clear cell]. TelaE and TelaC showed encouraging clinical activity and tolerability in heavily pretreated mRCC patients. Dysregulated metabolism is a hallmark of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Glutaminase is a key enzyme that fuels tumor growth by converting glutamine to glutamate. Telaglenastat is an investigational, first-in-class, selective, oral glutaminase inhibitor that blocks glutamine utilization and downstream pathways. Preclinically, telaglenastat synergized with cabozantinib, a VEGFR2/MET/AXL inhibitor, in RCC models. To compare the efficacy and safety of telaglenastat plus cabozantinib (Tela + Cabo) vs placebo plus cabozantinib (Pbo + Cabo). CANTATA was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pivotal trial conducted at sites in the US, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Eligible patients had metastatic clear-cell RCC following progression on 1 to 2 prior lines of therapy, including 1 or more antiangiogenic therapies or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The data cutoff date was August 31, 2020. Data analysis was performed from December 2020 to February 2021. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cabozantinib (60 mg daily) with either telaglenastat (800 mg twice daily) or placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) assessed by blinded independent radiology review. A total of 444 patients were randomized: 221 to Tela + Cabo (median [range] age, 61 [21-81] years; 47 [21%] women and 174 [79%] men) and 223 to Pbo + Cabo (median [range] age, 62 [29-83] years; 68 [30%] women and 155 [70%] men). A total of 276 (62%) patients had received prior immune checkpoint inhibitors, including 128 with prior nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 93 of whom had not received prior antiangiogenic therapy. Median progression-free survival was 9.2 months for Tela + Cabo vs 9.3 months for Pbo + Cabo (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.74-1.21; P = .65). Overall response rates were 31% (69 of 221) with Tela + Cabo vs 28% (62 of 223) with Pbo + Cabo. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates were similar between arms.

675,"('Losartan', 'Dup-753', 'Lortaan', 'Cozaar', 'Hyzaar')",Medical,"Losartan/hydrochlorothiazide, sold under the brand name Hyzaar among others, is a fixed-dose combination medication used to treat high blood pressure when losartan is not sufficient. It consists of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker; and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dizziness, back pain, and upper respiratory tract infections. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, kidney problems, allergic reactions, and electrolyte problems. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. Losartan works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II while hydrochlorothiazide works by decreasing the ability of the kidneys to absorb electrolytes. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 75th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == The combination is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure; and for the reduction of the risk of stroke in people with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. == Side Effects == Common side effects include dizziness, headache, back pain, rash, fever, diarrhea, cough, and upper respiratory tract infections. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure, kidney problems, allergic reactions, and electrolyte problems. == Drug interactions == Drug interactions include lithium, agents increasing serum levels of potassium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidiabetic drugs, cholestyramine, and colestipol. == Mechanisms == Losartan works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II by preventing it from binding to the angiotensin I receptor while hydrochlorothiazide works by decreasing the ability of the kidneys to absorb electrolytes. The effects of hydrochlorothiazide indirectly lower the levels of serum potassium. However, with coadministration of losartan which is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, the low levels of potassium are reversed. == Society and culture == === Brand names === The losartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination preparation is marketed by Merck under the brand name Hyzaar and by Xeno Pharmaceuticals under the name Anzaplus.

676,"('Cladribine', 'Cldado', 'Leustatin', 'Chlorodeoxyadenosine', 'Litak')",Medical,"Cladribine, sold under the brand name Leustatin, among others, is a medication used to treat hairy cell leukemia (formally named leukemic reticuloendotheliosis) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cladribine, sold under the brand name Mavenclad, is used for the treatment of adults with highly active forms of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Cladribine is a purine analogue that selectively targets and suppresses lymphocytes implicated in the underlying pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and B-cell leukaemia. Chemically, it mimics the nucleoside deoxyadenosine. However, unlike deoxyadenosine, it is relatively resistant to breakdown by the enzyme adenosine deaminase, which causes it to accumulate in targeted cells and interfere with the cell's ability to process DNA. Cladribine is taken up by cells via transporter proteins. Once inside a cell, cladribine undergoes phosphorylation by the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) to produce mononucleotide 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine 5’monophosphate (2-CdAMP), which is subsequently phosphorylated to the triphosphorylated active compound 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine 5’triphosphate (2-CdATP). Activated cladribine is incorporated into cellular DNA, which triggers apoptosis. Accumulation of cladribine into cells is dependent on the ratio of DCK and 5'-nucleotidase (5’-NT), which breaks down and inactivates the compound. This ratio differs between cell types, with high levels in T and B lymphocytes, resulting in selective targeting of these cells. In contrast, DCK:5'NT is relatively low in other cell types, thus sparing numerous non-haematological cells. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Cladribine is used as a first- and second-line treatment for symptomatic hairy cell leukemia and for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and is administered by intravenous or subcutaneous infusion. Some investigators have used the parenteral formulation orally to treat patients with hairy cell leukemia. About 37–51% of oral cladribine is bioavailable orally. It is used, often in combination with other cytotoxic agents, to treat various kinds of histiocytosis, including Erdheim–Chester disease and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Following EMA approval of cladribine tablets for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in 2017, as of July 2020, cladribine tablets have gained marketing authorisation in over 75 countries. In 2019, cladribine tablets were approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, to include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease, in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Cladribine may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is listed by the FDA as pregnancy category D; safety and efficacy in children has not been established. === Multiple sclerosis === As per the EU label, cladribine tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis as defined by clinical or imaging features: (i) patients with a relapse in the previous year and at least one T1 Gd+ lesion or 9 or more T2 lesions, while on another disease-modifying therapies or (ii) patients with two or more relapses in the previous year, whether on disease-modifying treatment or not. Two main approaches to multiple sclerosis treatment maintenance therapy are used – immunomodulation and immunosuppression and alternatively, immune reconstitution therapy. Classified as the latter, cladribine tablets are administered intermittently as a short treatment course without continuous immunosuppression. In contrast to maintenance therapies, clinical efficacy extends beyond the dosing period. Cladribine tablets are administered as 2 courses separated by 1 year (a maximum of 20 days of treatment). The recommended cumulative dose is 3.5 mg/kg weight over 2 years, administered as 1 treatment course of 1.75 mg/kg per year. Each treatment course consists of 2 treatment weeks, one at the beginning of the first month and one at the beginning of the second month of the respective treatment year. Each treatment week consists of 4 or 5 days on which a patient receives 10 mg or 20 mg (1 or 2 tablets) as a single daily dose based on body weight. Before initiating treatment with cladribine tablets, blood tests, MRI and infection screening must be performed. Due to an increased risk of herpes zoster with cladribine tablets, patients who are antibody-negative for varicella zoster virus are recommended to be vaccinated before starting treatment. Treatment should not be initiated within 4 to 6 weeks of receiving a live or attenuated live vaccine because of a risk of active infection. Vaccination with live or attenuated live vaccines should also be avoided during and after treatment, but can be considered when lymphocyte counts have recovered to ≥1000 cells/mm3. Following completion of the two treatment courses, no further treatment or additional monitoring is required. The use of cladribine tablets is contraindicated in pregnant women, and women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy during treatment and 6 months after receiving the last dose. == Side effects == === In hairy cell leukemia === Injectable cladribine suppresses the body's ability to make new lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and neutrophils (called myelosuppression); data from hairy cell leukemia studies showed that about 70% of people taking the drug developed dangerously low levels of white blood cells and about 30% developed infections and some of those progressed to septic shock; about 40% of people taking the drug had fewer red blood cells and became severely anaemic; and about 10% of people had too few platelets. At the dosage used to treat hairy cell leukemia in two clinical trials, 16% of people had rashes and 22% had nausea, the nausea generally did not lead to vomiting. === In multiple sclerosis === Cladribine tablets target the cells of the adaptive immune system with minimal impact on innate immune cells. Although the exact mechanism by which cladribine exerts its therapeutic effect is not fully elucidated, it is proposed to have a transient effect on B and T lymphocyte depletion, interrupting the cascade of immune events central to multiple sclerosis. As a result, a reduction in lymphocyte count (lymphopenia) may be reported following treatment. In clinical trials, lymphocyte levels above Grade 0 (≥1000 cells/mm3) and Grade 1 (<1000–800 cells/mm3) were maintained in most patients, with levels continuing to improve after the 2-year dosing period. Less than 1% of patients developed Grade 4 lymphopenia (<200 cells/mm3). It is important that patients with lymphocyte counts below 500 cells/mm3 should be actively monitored for signs suggestive of infection and that anti-infective treatments are given to at-risk patients. Despite the initial reduction in lymphocyte counts following treatment, studies showed the overall risk of infection in patients receiving cladribine tablets was comparable to those who received placebo, except for herpes zoster infection. Due to this increased risk, it is recommended that patients are screened for varicella zoster virus and antibody-negative patients are vaccinated prior to receiving treatment. In an analysis of post-approval data, as of 2020, no new infection safety signals were observed in over 18,000 patients. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has been reported in patients with hairy cell leukemia treated with parenteral cladribine. However, in up to 10 years of follow-up of patients receiving cladribine tablets for multiple sclerosis, no cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy have been observed; baseline MRI must be performed prior to initiating treatment. In clinical trials, malignancies were observed more frequently in patients treated with cladribine tablets compared with patients who received placebo. Compared with a matched reference population from the Global Cancer Observatory database, cladribine tablets had no increased risk of malignancy in long-term real-world evidence data. == Mechanism of action == As a purine analogue, cladribine is taken up into rapidly proliferating cells, including B and T lymphocytes, to be incorporated into DNA synthesis. Chemically, it mimics nucleoside adenosine; however, unlike adenosine, cladribine has a chlorine molecule at position 2, which renders it partially resistant to breakdown by adenosine deaminase. This causes it to accumulate in cells and interfere with the targeted cell's ability to process DNA. Cladribine is taken up by specific nucleoside transporter proteins. Once inside a cell, cladribine undergoes phosphorylation by the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) to produce mononucleotide 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine 5’monophosphate (2-CdAMP), which is subsequently phosphorylated to the triphosphorylated active compound, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine 5’triphosphate (2-CdATP). Activated cladribine is incorporated into the DNA synthesis pathway, where it disrupts DNA repair and synthesis, resulting in an accumulation of DNA strand breaks This is followed by the activation of transcription factor p53, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and eventual programmed cell death (apoptosis). This process occurs over approximately 2 months, with a peak level of cell depletion 4–8 weeks after treatment. Another family of enzymes, the 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) family, is also capable of dephosphorylating cladribine, making it inactive. The most important subtypes of this group appear to be cytosolic 5'-NT, c-5NCT1A and c-NT1B, which are cytosolically active and specific for purine analogues. Accumulation of cladribine into cells is dependent on the ratio of DCK and 5'-NT. This ratio differs between cell types, with high levels in T and B lymphocytes, making them particularly susceptible to cell death. The cells with the highest ratios are B cells, especially germinal centre and naïve B cells. This helps to explain which B cells are more vulnerable to cladribine-mediated apoptosis. DCK is the rate-limiting enzyme for conversion of the cladribine prodrug into its active triphosphate form, leading to the selective depletion of dividing and non-dividing T and B lymphocytes. In contrast, the DCK:5'-NT ratio is relatively low in other cell types, thus sparing numerous non-hematologic cells. In multiple sclerosis, cladribine's effectiveness may be due to depletion of B cells, in particular memory B cells. In the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial of oral cladribine in multiple sclerosis, CLARITY, cladribine selectively depleted 80% of peripheral B cells, compared to only 40–45% of CD4+ T cells and 15‒30% CD8+ T cells. More recently, cladribine has been shown to induce long term, selective suppression of certain subtypes of B cells, especially memory B cells. Although cladribine is selective for B cells, the long-term suppression of memory B cells, which may contribute to its effect in multiple sclerosis, is not explained by gene or protein expression. Instead, cladribine appears to deplete the entire B cell department, but while naïve B cells rapidly move from lymphoid organs, the memory B cell pool repopulates slowly from the bone marrow. Both hairy cell leukemia and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are types of B cell blood cancers. == History == === Hairy cell leukemia === Ernest Beutler and Dennis A. Carson had studied adenosine deaminase deficiency and recognised that because the lack of adenosine deaminase led to the destruction of B cell lymphocytes, a drug designed to inhibit adenosine deaminase might be useful in lymphomas. Carson then synthesised cladribine, and through clinical research at Scripps starting in the 1980s, Beutler tested it as intravenous infusion and found it was especially useful to treat hairy cell leukemia. No pharmaceutical companies were interested in selling the drug because hairy cell leukemia was an orphan disease, so Beutler's lab synthesised and packaged it and supplied it to the hospital pharmacy; the laboratory also developed a test to monitor blood levels. This was the first treatment that led to prolonged remission of hairy cell leukemia, which was previously untreatable.: 14–15 In February 1991, Scripps began a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson to bring intravenous cladribine to market, and by December of that year, Johnson & Johnson had filed a new drug application; cladribine was approved by the FDA in 1993 for hairy cell leukemia as an orphan drug, and was approved in Europe later that year.: 2 The subcutaneous formulation was developed in Switzerland in the early 1990s and it was commercialised by Lipomed GmbH in the 2000s.: 2 === Multiple sclerosis === In the mid-1990s, Beutler, in collaboration with Jack Sipe, a neurologist at Scripps Institute, ran several clinical trials exploring the utility of cladribine in multiple sclerosis, based on the drug's immunosuppressive effects. Sipe's insight into multiple sclerosis, and Beutler's interest in multiple sclerosis due to his sister having the disease, initiated a very productive collaboration. Ortho-Clinical, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, filed a new drug application for cladribine for multiple sclerosis in 1997 but withdrew it in the late 1990s after discussion with the FDA proved that more clinical data would be needed. Ivax acquired the rights for oral administration of cladribine to treat multiple sclerosis from Scripps in 2000, and partnered with Serono in 2002. Ivax was acquired by Teva in 2006, and Merck KGaA acquired control of Serono's drug business in 2006. An oral formulation of the drug with cyclodextrin was developed: 16 by Ivax and Serono, and then Merck KGaA conducted clinical trials. Merck KGaA submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency in 2009, which was rejected in 2010, and an appeal was denied in 2011.: 4–5 Likewise Merck KGaA's new drug application with the FDA rejected in 2011. The ratio of benefit to harm was not clear to regulators, and further studies were requested to address concerns related to severe lymphopenia and cancer cases observed during pivotal trials.: 54–55 Clinical studies of multiple sclerosis were still ongoing at the time of the rejections, and Merck KGaA committed to completing them. A meta-analysis of data from clinical trials comparing the risk of cancer and other disease-modifying therapies showed that cladribine tablets did not increase the risk of cancer at the doses used in the initial clinical trials. Based on the supporting data from the completed clinical trials that confirmed no increased risk of cancer, Merck announced it would again seek regulatory approval. In 2016, the EMA accepted its application for review. On 22 June 2017, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Cladribine tablets were later approved in Europe, in August 2017, for highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, and has since been approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in the US. == Research == Cladribine has been studied as part of a multidrug chemotherapy regimen for drug-resistant T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia. == References ==",Litak,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -8.689979586051777e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011853104224428535)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL; ([lipomed.com](https://www.lipomed.com/litak_en?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=76, start_index=9, title='Lipomed AG | Litak® (cladribine) | Services to health by LIPOMED', type='url_citation', url='https://www.lipomed.com/litak_en?utm_source=openai')])"

679,"('Carprofen', 'Rimadyl', 'Imadyl', 'Ridamyl', 'Carprofeno')",Medical,"Carprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the carbazole and propionic acid class that was previously for use in humans and animals but is now only available to veterinarians for prescribing as a supportive treatment for various conditions in animals. Carprofen reduces inflammation by inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2; its specificity for COX-2 varies from species to species. Marketed under many brand names worldwide, carprofen is used as a treatment for inflammation and pain, including joint pain and postoperative pain. == Human use == Carprofen was used in humans for almost ten years, starting in 1988, for the same conditions as in dogs; namely, joint pain and inflammation. Side effects tended to be mild, usually consisting of nausea or gastrointestinal pain and diarrhoea. It was available by prescription in 150 mg to 600 mg doses. Dosages over 250 mg were reserved for pain caused by severe trauma, such as postoperative inflammation; 150 mg doses were commonly used to relieve arthritis pain, while 200 mg doses were commonly prescribed for severe arthritis or inflammatory pain. The drug was taken orally. Pfizer voluntarily removed the medication from the market for human use on commercial grounds. == Society and culture == === Legal status === In November 2024, the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the veterinary medicinal product Carprofen Orion, Chewable tablet; Solution for injection, intended for Cat and Dog. The applicant for this veterinary medicinal product is Orion Corporation. Carprofen Orion is a generic of Rimadyl vet, which has been authorized in the EU since January 2003. == Veterinary medicine == === Canine use === Carprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved for use in dogs. It aids in the relief of inflammation, pain, and fever. Carprofen can be administered in pill, chewable tablet, or injection form. Carprofen can be used for long-term pain management of such conditions as osteoarthritis, which is common in canine patients, or after surgical procedures for relief of acute pain and inflammation. In animals suffering from pain, carprofen has been shown to improve energy, activity level, comfort, and general well-being. ==== Adverse effects ==== Most dogs respond well to carprofen use, but like all NSAIDs, it can cause gastrointestinal, liver, and kidney problems. In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received more than six thousand anecdotal reports of sudden animal death after usage of Pfizer's Rimadyl brand of carprofen. In response, the FDA requested that Pfizer advise consumers in their advertising that death is a possible side effect; Pfizer refused and pulled their advertising, later including death as a possible side effect on the drug label. Adverse effects can include: Loss of appetite Vomiting Diarrhea Increase in thirst Increase in urination Fatigue and/or lethargy (drowsiness) Loss of coordination Seizures Liver dysfunction: jaundice (yellowing of eyes) Blood or dark tarry material in urine or stools Lethargy Staggering, stumbling, weakness or partial paralysis, full paralysis Change in skin (redness, scabs, or scratching) Change in behavior (such as decreased or increased activity level, seizure or aggression) In rare situations, death has been associated with some of the adverse reactions listed above. Effects of overdose include gastritis and ulcer formation. In healthy dogs given carprofen, no perioperative adverse effects on the cardiovascular system have been reported at recommended dosages. Perioperative administration of carprofen to cats did not affect postoperative respiratory rate nor heart rate. Carprofen should not be administered concurrently with steroids, as this can cause ulcers in the stomach. Dogs should be taken off carprofen for three full days before ingesting a steroid (such as prednisolone). Carprofen should not be given at the same time with other types of medications, such as other NSAIDs (aspirin, etodolac, deracoxib, meloxicam, tepoxalin), or steroids such as dexamethasone, triamcinolone, cortisone, or prednisone. Carprofen must be used with caution within the supervision of a veterinarian in dogs with liver or kidney disease, dehydration, bleeding deficits, or other health problems. It is not recommended for use in dogs with bleeding disorders (such as Von Willebrand's disease), as safety has not been established in dogs with these disorders. It has not been established whether carprofen can be safely used in pregnant dogs, dogs used for breeding purposes, or in lactating dogs. Several laboratory studies and clinical trials have been conducted to establish the safety of using carprofen. Clinical studies were conducted in nearly 300 dogs of different breeds. The dogs were treated with Rimadyl at the recommended dose for two weeks. According to these studies, the drug was clinically well tolerated, and the treated dogs did not have a greater incidence of adverse reactions when compared to the control group. A number of factors may contribute to the high incidence of adverse reports received for carprofen by the Center for Veterinary Medicine in the late 1990s. These include: The type of drug; Wide use; Duration of use. Long-term use can result in a higher risk for adverse reactions. It is recommended that blood tests for liver and kidney function are performed both prior to starting and regularly while on NSAIDs to monitor the patient’s tolerance; Senior dog use. Older dogs are generally more prone to side effects caused by carprofen. === Equine use === Carprofen may be administered intravenously to horses. A single dose has been shown to reduce prostaglandin E2 production and inflammatory exudate for up to 15 hours, although there was less effect on eicosanoid production when compared to the effects produced by NSAIDs such as phenylbutazone or flunixin. Prostaglandin E2 and inflammatory exudate are also reduced and leukotriene B4 is inhibited. Carprofen can also be given orally, but intramuscular use may produce muscle damage. === Other animal use === Carprofen is used as an analgesic for mouse surgical procedures. Carprofen may also be used on adult fish. === Brands and dosage forms for veterinary use === It is marketed under many brand names including: Acticarp, Artriofin, Austiofen, Bomazeal, Canidryl, Carporal, Carprieve, Carprocow, Carprodolor, Carprodyl, Carprofelican, Carprofen, Carprofène, Carprofeno, Carprofenum, Carprogesic, Carprosol, Carprotab, Carprox, Comforion, Dolagis, Dolocarp, Dolox, Eurofen, Kelaprofen, Librevia, Norocarp, Norodyl, Novocox, Ostifen, Prolet, Quellin, Reproval, Rimadyl, Rimifin, Rofeniflex, Rovera, Rycarfa, Scanodyl, Tergive, Vetprofen, and Xelcor.

681,"('Prulifloxacin', 'Pruvel', 'Nm 441', 'Prulifloxacin (hydrochloride)', 'Quisnon')",Medical,"Prulifloxacin is an older synthetic antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone class undergoing clinical trials prior to a possible NDA (New Drug Application) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is a prodrug which is metabolized in the body to the active compound ulifloxacin. It was developed over two decades ago by Nippon Shinyaku Co. and was patented in Japan in 1987 and in the United States in 1989. It has been approved for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections, community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Italy and gastroenteritis, including infectious diarrheas, in Japan. Prulifloxacin has not been approved for use in the United States. == History == In 1987 a European patent for prulifloxacin was issued to the Japanese-based pharmaceutical company, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd (Nippon). Ten years after the issuance of the European patent, marketing approval was applied for and granted in Japan (March 1997). Subsequent to being approved by the Japanese authorities in 1997 prulifloxacin was co-marketed and jointly developed in Japan with Meiji Seika as licensee (Sword). In more recent times, Angelini ACRAF SpA, under license from Nippon Shinyaku, has fully developed prulifloxacin, for the European market. Angelini is the licensee for the product in Italy. Following its launch in Italy, Angelini launched prulifloxacin in Portugal (January 2007) and it has been stated that further approvals will be sought in other European countries. Prulifloxacin is marketed in Japan and Italy as Quisnon (Nippon Shinyaku); Sword (Meiji); Unidrox (Angelini); Prixina (Angelini) and Glimbax (ITF Hellas) in Greece and generic as Pruquin. In 1989 and 1992 United States patents (US 5086049) were issued to Nippon Shinyaku for prulifloxacin. It was not until June 2004, when Optimer Pharmaceuticals acquired exclusive rights to discover, develop and commercialize prulifloxacin (Pruvel) in the U.S. from Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd., that there were any attempts to seek FDA approval to market the drug in the United States. Optimer Pharmaceuticals expects to file an NDA (new drug application) for prulifloxacin some time in 2010. As the patent for prulifloxacin has already expired, Optimer Pharmaceuticals has stated that this may have an effect on the commercial prospects of prulifloxacin within the United States market. == Licensed uses == Prulifloxacin has been approved in Italy, Japan, China, India and Greece (as indicated), for treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria, in the following conditions: Italy Acute uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (simple cystitis) Complicated lower urinary tract infections Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis Japan Gastroenteritis, including infectious diarrheas Other countries Prulifloxacin has not been approved for use in the United States, but may have been approved in other Countries, other than that which is indicated above. == Availability == Prulifloxacin is available as: Tablets (250 mg, 450 mg or 600 mg) In most countries, all formulations require a prescription. == Mechanism of action == Like other fluoroquinolones, Prulifloxacin prevents bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair and recombination through inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase. Quinolones and fluoroquinolones are bactericidal drugs, eradicating bacteria by interfering with DNA replication. Quinolones are synthetic agents that have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity as well as a unique mechanism of action, resulting in inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Quinolones inhibit the bacterial DNA gyrase or the topoisomerase IV enzyme, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. For many gram-negative bacteria, DNA gyrase is the target, whereas topoisomerase IV is the target for many gram-positive bacteria. It is believed that eukaryotic cells do not contain DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV. == Contraindications == There are only four contraindications found within the package insert: ""Avoid using Prulifloxacin in elderly population (Risk of Tendon damage)."" ""Prulifloxacin is contraindicated in patients with anamnesis of tendon diseases related to the administration of quinolones."" ""Prulifloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to Prulifloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, or any of the product components."" ""Prulifloxacin is contraindicated in subjects with celiac disease.""' ""Prulifloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, and in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders."" == Special populations == === Pregnancy === The fluoroquinolones rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and are extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother’s milk and are passed on to the nursing child. === Pediatric population === Fluoroquinolones are not licensed by the U.S. FDA for use in children due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions. However, the fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK. == Special precautions == ""As with other quinolones, exposure to the sun or ultra-violet rays may cause phototoxicity reactions in patients treated with prulifloxacin."" ""When treated with antibacterial agents of the quinolone group, patients with latent or known deficiencies for the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity are predisposed to hemolytic reactions."" == Adverse Events == Within one review prulifloxacin was stated to have a similar tolerability profile to that of ciprofloxacin. Within another study it was found that prulifloxacin patients experienced a similar number of adverse reactions compared to those in the ciprofloxacin group (15.4% vs 12.7%). There were four serious adverse events in each treatment arm, including 1 death in the prulifloxacin arm. None were considered treatment related by the investigator. If approved in the U.S., prulifloxacin will likely carry a black box warning for tendon damage, as the FDA has determined that this is a class effect of fluoroquinolones. Prulifloxacin has a reduced effect on the QTc interval compared to other fluoroquinolones and may be a safer choice for patients with pre-existing risk factors for arrhythmia. == Interactions == Probenecid: Prulifloxacin urinary excretion decreases when concomitantly administered with probenecid. Fenbufen: The concomitant administration of fenbufen can cause increased risk of convulsions. Hypoglycemic agents: May cause hypoglycemia in diabetic patients under treatment with hypoglycemic agents. Theophylline: May cause a decreased theophylline clearance. Warfarin: May enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin and its derivatives. Nicardipine: May potentiate the phototoxicity of prulifloxacin. == Overdose == In the event of acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage; the patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. == Pharmacokinetics == Prulifloxacin 600 mg achieves peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of ulifloxacin (1.6μg/mL) in a median time to Cmax (tmax) of 1 hour. Ulifloxacin is ≈45% bound to serum proteins in vivo. It is extensively distributed throughout tissues and shows good penetration into many body tissues. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of ulifloxacin after single-dose prulifloxacin 300–600 mg ranged from 10.6 to 12.1 hours. After absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, prulifloxacin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism (hydrolysis by esterases, mainly paraoxonase to form ulifloxacin, the active metabolite). Unchanged ulifloxacin is predominantly eliminated by renal excretion. Quoting from the available package insert. == See also == Quinolone == References == == Bibliography == ""Annual Report 2008"".

682,"('Lamotrigine', 'Lamictal', 'Lamictal cd', 'Lamictal xr', 'Lamotrigina')",Medical,"Lamotrigine, sold under the brand name Lamictal among others, is a medication used to treat epilepsy and stabilize mood in bipolar disorder. For epilepsy, this includes focal seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In bipolar disorder, lamotrigine has not been shown to reliably treat acute depression in any groups except for the severely depressed; but for patients with bipolar disorder who are not currently symptomatic, it appears to reduce the risk of future episodes of depression. Lamotrigine is also used off label for unipolar depression (major depressive disorder) and depersonalization-derealization disorder. Common side effects include nausea, sleepiness, headache, vomiting, trouble with coordination, and rash. Serious side effects include excessive breakdown of red blood cells, increased risk of suicide, severe skin reaction (Stevens–Johnson syndrome), and allergic reactions, which can be fatal. Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine, making it chemically different from other anticonvulsants. Its mechanism of action is not clear, but it appears to inhibit release of excitatory neurotransmitters via voltage-sensitive sodium channels and voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons. Lamotrigine was first marketed in Ireland in 1991, and approved for use in the United States in 1994. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the most commonly prescribed mood stabilizer and 58th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 11 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Epilepsy === Lamotrigine is considered a first-line drug for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (includes simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures such as focal-onset tonic-clonic seizures). It is also used as an alternative or adjuvant medication for partial seizures, such as absence seizure, myoclonic seizure, and atonic seizures. The evidence supporting the use of lamotrigine as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant generalized tonic-clonic seizures is not clear enough to inform clinical practice. Although low-certainty evidence suggests that it reduces generalized tonic-clonic seizures by 50% the level of uncertainty indicates that the actual findings could be significantly different. Evidence supporting the use of lamotrigine as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy found that it is likely effective for reducing seizure frequency and is generally well tolerated. Lamotrigine has some side effects including a risk of dizziness, nausea, ataxia, or visual disturbances such as diplopia. The long-term effects of lamotrigine have not been investigated. ==== Lennox–Gastaut syndrome ==== Lamotrigine is one of a small number of FDA-approved therapies for the form of epilepsy known as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. It reduces the frequency of LGS seizures, and is one of two medications known to decrease the severity of drop attacks. Combination with valproate is common, but this increases the risk of lamotrigine-induced severe skin reaction Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and necessitates reduced dosing due to the interaction of these drugs. === Bipolar disorder === Lamotrigine is approved in the US for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly antimanics, lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy only in preventing or reducing the risk of recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The drug seems ineffective in the treatment of current rapid-cycling, acute mania, or acute depression in bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine has been shown to be as effective as lithium, the standard treatment for bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine has not demonstrated clear efficacy in treating acute mood episodes, either mania or depression. It has not demonstrated effectiveness in treating acute mania, and there is controversy regarding the drug's effectiveness in treating acute bipolar depression. A paper written in 2008 by Nassir et al. reviewed evidence from trials that were unpublished and not referenced in the 2002 APA guidelines, and it concludes that lamotrigine has ""very limited, if any, efficacy in the treatment of acute bipolar depression"". A 2008 paper by Calabrese et al. examined much of the same data, and found that in five placebo-controlled studies, lamotrigine did not significantly differ from placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression. However, in a meta-analysis of these studies conducted in 2008, Geddes, Calabrese, and Goodwin found that lamotrigine was effective in individuals with bipolar depression, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 11, or 7 in severe depression. A 2013 review concluded that lamotrigine is recommended in bipolar maintenance when depression is prominent and that more research is needed regarding its role in the treatment of acute bipolar depression and unipolar depression. No information to recommend its use in other psychiatric disorders was found. === Schizophrenia === Lamotrigine, as a monotherapy, is not substantially effective against schizophrenia. However, various publications and textbooks have expressed that lamotrigine could be added to clozapine as augmentation therapy against partial or non-responding patients with schizophrenia. Patients had statistically significant improvements in positive, negative and affective symptoms. Lamotrigine does not have a statistically significant effect with antipsychotics other than clozapine, such as: olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, zuclopenthixol, etc. === Other uses === Off-label uses include the treatment of major depressive disorder, peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headaches, migraines, visual snow, and reducing neuropathic pain from any cause, although a systematic review conducted in 2013 concluded that well-designed clinical trials have shown no benefit for lamotrigine in neuropathic pain. Off-label psychiatric usage includes the treatment of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, depersonalization derealization disorder, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and borderline personality disorder. It has not been shown to be useful in post-traumatic stress disorder. GlaxoSmithKline investigated lamotrigine for the treatment of ADHD with inconclusive results. No detrimental effects on cognitive function were observed; however, the only statistical improvement in core ADHD symptoms was an improvement on a Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test that measures auditory processing speed and calculation ability. Another study reported that lamotrigine might be a safe and effective treatment option for adult ADHD comorbid with bipolar and recurrent depression. == Side effects == Side effects such as rash, fever, and fatigue are very serious, as they may indicate incipient SJS, TEN, DRESS syndrome, or aseptic meningitis. Lamotrigine prescribing information has a black box warning about life-threatening skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), DRESS syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The manufacturer states that nearly all cases appear in the first two to eight weeks of therapy. Patients should seek medical attention for any unexpected skin rash, as its presence is an indication of a possible serious or even deadly side effect of the drug. Not all rashes that occur while taking lamotrigine progress to SJS or TEN. Between 5 and 10% of patients will develop a rash, but only one in a thousand patients will develop a serious rash. Rash and other skin reactions are more common in children, so this medication is often reserved for adults. For patients whose lamotrigine has been stopped after the development of a rash, rechallenge with lamotrigine is also a viable option. Usually, rechallenge is done by reinstating lamotrigine at a smaller dose (5mg/day). However, it does not apply to very serious cases. The incidence of these eruptions increases in patients who are currently on, or recently discontinued a valproate-type anticonvulsant drug, as these medications interact in such a way that the clearance of both is decreased and the effective dose of lamotrigine is increased. In 2018, the FDA required a new warning for the risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This serious reaction can occur between days to weeks after starting the treatment. Other side effects include alopecia (hair loss), loss of balance or coordination, double vision, crossed eyes, pupil constriction, blurred vision, dizziness and lack of coordination, drowsiness, insomnia, anxiety, vivid dreams or nightmares, dry mouth, mouth ulcers, memory problems, mood changes, itchiness, runny nose, cough, nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, weight loss, missed or painful menstrual periods, and vaginitis. The side-effects profile varies for different patient populations. Overall adverse effects in treatment are similar between men, women, geriatric, pediatric, and racial groups. Lamotrigine has been associated with a decrease in white blood cell count (leukopenia). Lamotrigine does not prolong QT/QTc in TQT studies in healthy subjects. In people taking antipsychotics, cases of lamotrigine-precipitated neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported. === Women === Women are more likely than men to have side effects. Some evidence shows interactions between lamotrigine and female hormones, which can be of particular concern for women on estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives. Ethinylestradiol, an ingredient of such contraceptives, has been shown to decrease serum levels of lamotrigine. Women starting an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive may need to increase the dosage of lamotrigine to maintain its level of efficacy. Likewise, women may experience an increase in lamotrigine side effects upon discontinuation of birth control pills. This may include the ""pill-free"" week where lamotrigine serum levels have been shown to increase twofold. Many studies have found no association between lamotrigine exposure in utero and birth defects, while those that have found an association have found only slight associations with minor malformations such as cleft palates. Review studies have found that overall rates of congenital malformations in infants exposed to lamotrigine in utero are relatively low (1–4%), which is similar to the rate of malformations in the general population. It is known that lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors such as methotrexate are known to be teratogenic. Lamotrigine is expressed in breast milk; the manufacturer recommends carefully weighing the benefits and risks of taking lamotrigine while breastfeeding. However, some studies suggest that lamotrigine is safe to use while breastfeeding. A frequently updated review of scientific literature rates lamotrigine as L3: moderately safe. === Other types of effects === Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues such as the iris of the eye or melanin-rich skin. The long-term consequences of this are unknown. Lamotrigine is known to affect sleep. Studies with small numbers of patients (10–15) reported that lamotrigine increases the duration of REM sleep, decreases the number of phase shifts, and decreases the duration of slow-wave sleep, and that there was no effect on vigilance, daytime somnolence and cognitive function. However, a retrospective study of 109 patients' medical records found that 6.7% of patients experienced an ""alerting effect"" resulting in intolerable insomnia, for which the treatment had to be discontinued. Lamotrigine can induce a type of seizure known as a myoclonic jerk, which tends to happen soon after the use of the medication. When used in the treatment of myoclonic epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, lower doses (and lower plasma levels) are usually needed, as even moderate doses of this drug can induce seizures, including tonic-clonic seizures, which can develop into status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency. It can also cause myoclonic status epilepticus. In overdose, lamotrigine can cause uncontrolled seizures in most people. Reported results in overdoses involving up to 15 g include increased seizures, coma, and death. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Lamotrigine is a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs. This may suppress the release of glutamate and aspartate, two dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. It is generally accepted to be a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, but it could have additional actions, since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel-blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its sigma receptor activity. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasizes its unique properties. It is a triazine derivate that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, leading to stabilization of neuronal membranes. It also blocks L-, N-, and P-type calcium channels and weakly inhibits the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. These actions are thought to inhibit release of glutamate at cortical projections in the ventral striatum limbic areas, and its neuroprotective and antiglutamatergic effects have been pointed out as promising contributors to its mood stabilizing activity. Observations that lamotrigine reduced GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in rat amygdala suggest that a GABAergic mechanism may also be involved. It appears that lamotrigine does not increase GABA blood levels in humans. Lamotrigine does not have pronounced effects on any of the usual neurotransmitter receptors that anticonvulsants affect (adrenergic, dopamine D1 and D2, muscarinic, GABA, histaminergic H1, serotonin 5-HT2, and N-methyl-D-aspartate). Inhibitory effects on 5-HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters are weak. According to the article, the IC50 values are 240μM (5-HT, human platelets), 474 μM (5-HT, rat brain synaptosomes), 239 μM (norepinephrine) and 322 μM (dopamine). Lamotrigine blocks NMDA receptor-initiated arachidonic acid signalling in rat brain. Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, but whether this effect is sufficient to contribute to a mechanism of action or increases risk to the fetus during pregnancy is not known. Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices in vitro. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent sodium channels, lamotrigine thereby inhibits the release of glutamate and aspartate, which is evoked by the sodium-channel activator veratrine and was less effective in the inhibition of acetylcholine or GABA release. At high concentrations, it did not affect spontaneous or potassium-evoked amino acid release. These studies suggested that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies have investigated the effects of lamotrigine on voltage-gated sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant in the treatment of human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These and a variety of other results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognized to be protective against generalized absence epilepsy and other generalized epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The basis for this broader spectrum of activity of lamotrigine is unknown but could relate to actions of the drug on voltage-gated calcium channels. Lamotrigine blocks T-type calcium channels weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high voltage-gated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine's broader clinical spectrum of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined. It antagonizes these receptors with the following IC50 values: 5-HT3, IC50 = 18 μM σ receptors, IC50 = 145 μM === Pharmacokinetics === The pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine follow first-order kinetics, with a half-life of 29 hours and volume of distribution of 1.36 L/kg. Lamotrigine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Its absolute bioavailability is 98% and its plasma Cmax occurs from 1.4 to 4.8 hours. Available data indicate that its bioavailability is not affected by food. Estimate of the mean apparent volume of distribution of lamotrigine following oral administration ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. This is independent of dose and is similar to following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers. Lamotrigine is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver. Lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation. Its major metabolite is an inactive 2-n-glucuronide conjugate. Lamotrigine has fewer drug interactions than many anticonvulsant drugs, although pharmacokinetic interactions with carbamazepine, phenytoin and other hepatic enzyme-inducing medications may shorten half-life. Dose adjustments should be made on clinical response, but monitoring may be of benefit in assessing compliance. The capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences of melanin binding is unknown. Clinical trials excluded subtle effects and optimal duration of treatment. There are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring. Lamotrigine binds to the eye and melanin-containing tissues which can accumulate over time and may cause toxicity. Prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects and base treatment on clinical response. Patient compliance should be periodically reassessed with lab and medical testing of liver and kidney function to monitor progress or side effects. == Chemistry == The first synthesis of lamotrigine was disclosed in a patent file by the Wellcome Foundation in 1980. 2,3-Dichlorobenzoyl chloride is treated with cuprous cyanide to form an acyl cyanide. This is then reacted with the nitrate salt of aminoguanidine to give an intermediate which is cyclised to the diamino triazine of the drug product. == History == 1980 — initial patent filings are made by the Wellcome Foundation. 1990 — lamotrigine is approved for use in Ireland to treat epilepsy. 1991 — lamotrigine is used in the United Kingdom as an anticonvulsant medication December 1994 — lamotrigine was approved for use in the United States for the treatment of partial seizures. August 1998 — for use as adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in pediatric and adult patients, new dosage form: chewable dispersible tablets. December 1998 — for use as monotherapy for the treatment of partial seizures in adult patients when converting from a single enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug. January 2003 — for use as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in pediatric patients as young as two years of age. June 2003 — approved for maintenance treatment of bipolar II disorder; the first such medication since lithium. January 2004 — for use as monotherapy for the treatment of partial seizures in adult patients when converting from the anti-epileptic drug valproate (including valproic acid) == Society and culture == === Brand names === Lamotrigine is sold under the original brand name Lamictal and it is available in generic form under many brand names worldwide. == Regulatory advisory in 2021 == In March 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the potential for cardiac arrhythmias in people with pre-existing structural or conduction heart defects. The warning provoked consternation and controversy within the professional community. An in vitro study conducted in 2011 predicted Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutic concentrations of lamotrigine, due to its sodium channel-blocking activity. Thus, lamotrigine use in at-risk populations could prolong the QRS interval on the electrocardiogram, and increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. No references to human studies or postmarket data in at-risk populations (i.e., people with structural heart disease) were cited to support the warning. A study in dogs is mentioned in the prescribing information brochure by the manufacturer. A rapid systematic review concluded that ""there is insufficient evidence to support or refute that lamotrigine is associated with sudden death or electrocardiogram changes..."" The FDA has recommended that further studies are conducted with lamotrigine and other sodium-channel blocking antiseizure medications. In March 2023, an FDA Adverse Event Reporting System analysis demonstrated signals of cardiac arrest, but not of tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia nor their clinical manifestation as fainting in lamotrigine. The study stratified the epileptic and psychiatric indications, explaining that the nature of the signal for cardiac arrest seems to be confounded by the psychiatric indication, which included 2.5 times more concomitant medications with cardiac adverse events, such as QT-prolonging drugs. Additionally, a 1.5-fold greater reports on overdose and suicide attempts was recorded in the psychiatric reports. Although lamotrigine blocks the cardiac sodium channels at therapeutically relevant concentrations, owing to its short-fast kinetics at the channel level, this blockage did not translate into a disproportional signal in this study. == Research == Though lamotrigine has been used to treat seizures in infants, as of 2023, its effectiveness in this age group has been evaluated in only one study. Adverse effects were rarely severe enough for the medication to be discontinued in this age group, however, its effectiveness in reducing seizures was inconclusive. == References ==",Lamictal cd,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8000440832111053e-05), ('ICAL', -1.1920928244535389e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.001176023157313466)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -6.2729995988775045e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

In the present study, we aimed to find a promising anti-glioma compound and investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. Glioma cells were subjected to the 50 candidate compounds at a final concentration of 10 μM for 72 h, and CCK-8 was used to evaluate their cytotoxicity. NPS-2143, an antagonist of calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), was selected for further study due to its potent cytotoxicity to glioma cells. Our results showed that NPS-2143 could inhibit the proliferation of glioma cells and induce G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Meanwhile, NPS-2143 could induce glioma cell apoptosis by increasing the caspase-3/6/9 activity. NPS-2143 impaired the immigration and invasion ability of glioma cells by regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Mechanically, NPS-2143 could inhibit autophagy by mediating the AKT-mTOR pathway. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the prognosis of glioma patients with low expression of CASR mRNA was better than those with high expression of CASR mRNA. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that CASR was associated with cell adhesion molecules and lysosomes in glioma. The nude mice xenograft model showed NPS-2143 could suppress glioma growth in vivo. In conclusion, NPS-2143 can suppress the glioma progression by inhibiting autophagy. NPS 2143, a novel and selective antagonist of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory activity. In the present study, we examined the protective effect of NPS 2143 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). NPS 2143 pretreatment significantly inhibited the influx of inflammatory cells and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the lung of mice with LPS-induced ALI. NPS 2143 decreased the levels of neutrophil elastase (NE) and protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). NPS 2143 also reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the BALF and serum. In addition, NPS 2143 attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and increased the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the lung. NPS 2143 also downregulated the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in the lung. In LPS-stimulated H292 airway epithelial cells, NPS 2143 attenuated the releases of IL-6 and MCP-1. Furthermore, NPS 2143 upregulated the activation of AMPK and downregulated the activation of NF-κB. These results suggest that NPS 2143 could be potential agent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases including ALI. NPS-2143 is a calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) antagonist that has been demonstrated to possess anticancer activity. To date, the effects of NPS-2143 on gastric cancer (GC) cell growth, motility, and apoptosis have not been investigated. In the present study, we firstly investigated the expression of CaSR in GC tissues using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Then Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays were conducted to explore the effect of the NPS-2143 on the proliferation of GC cell line AGS. Transwell invasion and migration assays were performed to test the effect of NPS-2143 on AGS cell motility. We determined the percentage of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry and explored the changes of apoptosis-related protein by western blotting. Furthermore, we constructed a CaSR knockdown AGS cell line to determine whether NPS-2143 acted via inhibition of CaSR. We found that the protein expression level of CaSR was higher in GC tissues compared with the paired adjacent normal tissues. In addition, NPS-2143 treatment caused an inhibitory effect on the proliferation, invasion, and migration of AGS cells and a promoting effect on AGS apoptosis. The expression of Bcl-2 was decreased while the levels of Bax and active caspase 3 were enhanced in AGS cells after NPS-2143 treatment. Mechanistically, NPS-2143 lead to a significant decrease in the expression of phosphorylated (p)-AKT, phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), p70, and cyclin D1. Knockdown of CaSR also suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and promoted cell apoptosis. No significant difference was observed between CaSR-silenced AGS cells with and without NPS-2143 treatment. These results confirmed that NPS-2143 has an inhibitory influence on AGS cell growth via inhibiting CaSR, which then suppresses the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",Nps-2143,PUBMED,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0004307884373702109), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.16235622763633728), ('ICAL', -8.344646857949556e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.12694485485553741)])","('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3869786262512207)])","('INFO; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26052899/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35401594/,https://www.apexbt.com/nps-2143.html ', [])"

Infigratinib targets the fibroblast growth factor receptors FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. Infigratinib was originally approved at a higher dose for medical use in the United States in May 2021 for cholangiocarcinoma, but is no longer marketed for that indication due to difficulties commercializing in the indication. == Medical uses == Infigratinib is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of children with achondroplasia. Infigratinib is now in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Infigratinib was originally developed at a higher dose for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. == History == The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved infigratinib based on evidence from one clinical trial (NCT02150967) of 108 participants with bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma). The CBGJ398X2204 trial was a multicenter open-label single-arm trial that enrolled 108 participants with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement as determined by local or central testing. The trials were conducted at 18 sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The trial enrolled adult participants with bile duct cancer who had been treated previously with chemotherapy for their advanced cancer and whose tumors had a certain type of abnormality in the FGFR2 gene. Participants received infigratinib once daily by mouth for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off therapy. This 28-day cycle was administered until disease progression or the side effects became too toxic. The trial measured the percentage of participants who achieved partial or complete shrinkage of their cancer and how long that shrinkage lasted (duration of response or DoR). Infigratinib has since been developed at a lower dose (0.25 mg/kg) for children with achondroplasia, a condition caused by variants in the FGFR3 gene. Preliminary Phase 2 results showed that children treated with infigratinib showed a mean change from baseline in annualized height velocity of +2.51 cm/yr at 12 months, with no serious adverse events. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Infigratinib was designated an orphan drug by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency in 2021. It was approved for medical use under the FDA's accelerated approval program in May 2021. Infigratinib has since been withdrawn from commercialization due to the sponsor's difficulties distributing the drug and enrolling a confirmatory clinical trial. == References == == External links == Clinical trial number NCT02150967 for ""A Phase II, Single Arm Study of BGJ398 in Patients With Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma"" at ClinicalTrials.gov",Truseltiq,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.0013081812066957355), ('ICAL', -9.536738616588991e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0032043324317783117)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ', [])"

The ATR inhibitors (ATRi) berzosertib and gartisertib are both in clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors as monotherapy or in combination with genotoxic agents. We carried out quantitative phospho-proteomic screening for ATR biomarkers that are highly sensitive to berzosertib and gartisertib, using an optimized mass spectrometry pipeline. Screening identified a range of novel ATR-dependent phosphorylation events, which were grouped into three broad classes: (i) targets whose phosphorylation is highly sensitive to ATRi and which could be the next generation of ATR biomarkers; (ii) proteins with known genome maintenance roles not previously known to be regulated by ATR; (iii) novel targets whose cellular roles are unclear. Class iii targets represent candidate DNA damage response proteins and, with this in mind, proteins in this class were subjected to secondary screening for recruitment to DNA damage sites. We show that one of the proteins recruited, SCAF1, interacts with RNAPII in a phospho-dependent manner and recruitment requires PARP activity and interaction with RNAPII. We also show that SCAF1 deficiency partly rescues RAD51 loading in cells lacking the BRCA1 tumor suppressor. Taken together these data reveal potential new ATR biomarkers and new genome maintenance factors. Gartisertib is an oral inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), a key kinase of the DNA damage response. We aimed to determine the safety and tolerability of gartisertib ± carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours. This phase I open-label, multicenter, first-in-human study comprised four gartisertib cohorts: A (dose escalation [DE]; Q2W); A2 (DE; QD/BID); B1 (DE+carboplatin); and C (biomarker-selected patients). Overall, 97 patients were enroled into cohorts A (n = 42), A2 (n = 26), B1 (n = 16) and C (n = 13). The maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) were not declared for cohorts A or B1. In cohort A2, the RP2D for gartisertib was determined as 250 mg QD. Gartisertib was generally well-tolerated; however, unexpected increased blood bilirubin in all study cohorts precluded further DE. Investigations showed that gartisertib and its metabolite M26 inhibit UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin glucuronidation in human but not dog or rat liver microsomes. Prolonged partial response (n = 1 [cohort B1]) and stable disease >6 months (n = 3) did not appear to be associated with biomarker status. Exposure generally increased dose-dependently without accumulation. Gartisertib was generally well-tolerated at lower doses; however, unexpected liver toxicity prevented further DE, potentially limiting antitumour activity. Gartisertib development was subsequently discontinued. GOV: NCT02278250. Glioblastoma cells can restrict the DNA-damaging effects of temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (RT) using the DNA damage response (DDR) mechanism which activates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair pathways. Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-Related protein (ATR) plays a pivotal role in the recognition of DNA damage induced by chemotherapy and radiation causing downstream DDR activation. Here, we investigated the activity of gartisertib, a potent ATR inhibitor, alone and in combination with TMZ and/or RT in 12 patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines. We showed that gartisertib alone potently reduced the cell viability of glioblastoma cell lines, where sensitivity was associated with the frequency of DDR mutations and higher expression of the G2 cell cycle pathway. ATR inhibition significantly enhanced cell death in combination with TMZ and RT and was shown to have higher synergy than TMZ+RT treatment.

It is neurotoxic in large doses. It is a member of a family of drugs called hydroxyquinolines which inhibit certain enzymes related to DNA replication. The drugs have been found to have activity against both viral and protozoal infections. == Antiprotozoal use == A 1964 report described the use of clioquinol in both the treatment and prevention of shigella infection and Entamoeba histolytica infection in institutionalized individuals at Sonoma State Hospital in California. The report indicates 4000 individuals were treated over a 4-year period with few side effects. Several recently reported journal articles describing its use as an antiprotozoal include: A 2005 reference to its use in treating a Dutch family for Entamoeba histolytica infection. A 2004 reference to its use in the Netherlands in the treatment of Dientamoeba fragilis infection. A 1979 reference to the use in Zaire in the treatment of Entamoeba histolytica infection. == Subacute myelo-optic neuropathy == Clioquinol's use as an antiprotozoal drug has been restricted or discontinued in some countries due to an event in Japan where over 10,000 people developed subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) between 1957 and 1970. The drug was used widely in many countries before and after the SMON event without similar reports. As yet, no explanation exists as to why it produced this reaction, and some researchers have questioned whether clioquinol was the causative agent in the disease, noting that the drug had been used for 20 years prior to the epidemic without incident, and that the SMON cases began to reduce in number prior to the discontinuation of the drug. Theories suggested have included improper dosing, the permitted use of the drug for extended periods of time, and dosing which did not consider the smaller average stature of Japanese; however a dose dependent relationship between SMON development and clioquinol use was never found, suggesting the interaction of another compound. Researchers have also suggested the SMON epidemic could have been due to a viral infection with an Inoue-Melnick virus. == Topical use == Clioquinol is a constituent of the prescription medicine Vioform, which is a topical antifungal treatment. It is also used in the form of a cream (and in combination with betamethasone or fluocinolone) in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders. == Potential use as a preventive or treatment in prostate cancer == It has long been recognized that normal prostate cells have high zinc content through ZIP1 mediated uptake, and have low respiration (OXPHOS ATP generation is diverted to citrate export for sperm energetics). Prostate cancer cells have downregulated ZIP1 transporters which leads to greater ATP generation which is diverted to cancer proliferation, an example of a normal-like metabolic phenotype instead being malignant. The zinc ionophore clioquinol was shown in mice to restore zinc levels and stop the growth of prostate tumors. == Use in neurodegenerative diseases == Research at UCSF indicates that clioquinol appears to block the genetic action of Huntington's disease in mice and in cell culture. Recent animal studies have shown that clioquinol can reverse the progression of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. According to Siegfried Hekimi and colleagues at McGill's Department of Biology, clioquinol acts directly on a protein called Clk-1, often informally called “clock-1,” and might slow down the aging process. They theorize that this may explain the apparent ability of the drug to be effective in the above conditions, but warn against individuals experimenting with this drug. In addition, a study performed in Drosophila demonstrates that clioquinol can slow the pathogenesis of tauopathy model by removing the excessive zinc in the cell. == Continued use and manufacture around the world == == See also == PBT2, a related 8-hydroxyquinoline Ionophore, other ionophores == References ==",Chinoform,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00022420754248742014), ('ICAL', -2.3841855067985307e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.07895243167877197)])","('MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -4.024604277219623e-05), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.2519293427467346), (' INDUSTR', -9.639096970204264e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL;https://www.1mg.com/generics/chinoform-209562,https://www.felleskatalogen.no/medisin/pasienter/pil-synalar-med-chinoform-bioglan-564338,https://pro.medicin.dk/medicin/praeparater/366 ', [])"

Tedizolid phosphate is a phosphate ester prodrug of the active compound tedizolid. It was developed by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, following acquisition of Trius Therapeutics (originator: Dong-A Pharmaceuticals), and is marketed for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (also known as complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs)). The most common side effects include nausea (feeling sick), headache, diarrhoea and vomiting. These side effects were generally of mild or moderate severity. Tedizolid was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2014, and for medical use in the European Union in March 2015. == Medical uses == Tedizolid was approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 20, 2014, with the indication for the treatment of acute bacterial Skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by certain susceptible bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains, MRSA, and methicillin-susceptible strains), various Streptococcus species (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. anginosus group including S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus), and Enterococcus faecalis. Tedizolid is a second-generation oxazolidinone derivative that is 4-to-16-fold more potent against staphylococci and enterococci compared to linezolid. The recommended dosage for treatment is 200 mg once daily for a total duration of six days, either orally (with or without food) or through an intravenous injection (if patient is older than 18 years old). In the European Union tedizolid is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults. == Mechanism of action == Tedizolid phosphate (TR-701) is a prodrug activated by plasma or intestinal phosphatases to tedizolid (TR-700) following administration of the drug either orally or intravenously. Once activated, tedizolid exerts its bacteriostatic microbial activity through inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit (on the acceptor site) of the bacteria. == Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties == Tedizolid tablets have an oral bioavailability >90%. Tedizolid has higher binding to plasma proteins (80%), longer half-life, and a larger volume of distribution compared to linezolid. It is primarily metabolized by the liver as an inactive sulphate conjugate (phase II reaction), with no metabolism by cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Less than 20% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Tedizolid bactericidal activity on VRE and MRSA is time dependent. Correlations are closest between fAUC24/MIC and the tedizolid PK/PD index against MRSA and VRE. To achieve 1 log10 kill, tedizolid fAUC24/MIC in neutropenic mouse models with a thigh infection with VRE and MRSA should be 14.2 and 138.5, respectively. The post-antibiotic effects of tedizolid against VRE and MRSA are 2.39 and 0.99 h, respectively. == Clinical trials == Tedizolid proved its noninferiority to linezolid in two phase-III trials, known as the ESTABLISH trials. Tedizolid is the second treatment approved by the FDA under the new federal law Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (known as the GAIN Act). New antibiotics manufactured under this new act will be designed as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP), allowing an expedited review by the FDA and an additional five years of market exclusivity. == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effects found in the clinical trials were nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and dizziness. Tedizolid has also been found to have hematologic (blood) effects, as shown in Phase-I studies in which subjects exposed to doses longer than 6 days showed a possible dose and duration effect on hematologic parameters. Its safety in patients with decreased levels of white blood cells has not been established.

Efficacy of ranirestat was evaluated by nerve conduction studies, the modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (mTCNS), and quantitative sensory tests (QSTs). == See also == Tolrestat, also an aldose reductase inhibitor, which was withdrawn from market in 1997 due to the risk of severe liver toxicity == References ==",Ranirestat,WIKIPEDIA,"('MEDICAL', [('MED', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -7.152301259338856e-05), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.0011820956133306026)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranirestat?utm_source=openai)) ', [AnnotationURLCitation(end_index=86, start_index=6, title='Ranirestat', type='url_citation', url='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranirestat?utm_source=openai')])"
691,"('Vorasidenib', 'Vorasidenib [inn]', 'Vorasidenib [usan]', 'Vorasidenib (ag881)', 'Vorasidenib (ag-881)')",Medical,"Vorasidenib, sold under the brand name Voranigo, is an anti-cancer medication used for the treatment of certain forms of glioma. Vorasidenib is a dual mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (mIDH1/2) inhibitor. The most common adverse reactions include fatigue, headache, increased risk of COVID-19 infection, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and seizures. Vorasidenib was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2024. It is the first approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of a systemic therapy for people with grade 2 astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 or isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 mutation. == Medical uses == Vorasidenib is indicated for the treatment of people aged twelve years of age and older with grade 2 astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 or isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 mutation, following surgery including biopsy, sub-total resection, or gross total resection. == Side effects == The most common adverse reactions include fatigue, headache, increased risk of COVID-19 infection, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and seizures. The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities include increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, GGT increased, and decreased neutrophils. == Pharmacology == Agios Pharmaceuticals previously developed the mIDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib and mIDH2 inhibitor enasidenib for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with susceptible IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, respectively. However, ivosidenib and enasidenib have low brain exposure, precluding their use in gliomas. Moreover, isoform switching between IDH1 and IDH2 has been observed as a mechanism of resistance to mIDH inhibitor therapy. Vorasidenib was thus developed to improve blood-brain barrier penetration and inhibit both mIDH1/2. == History == Efficacy was evaluated in 331 participants with grade 2 astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 or isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 mutation following surgery enrolled in INDIGO (NCT04164901), a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive vorasidenib 40 mg orally once daily or placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 or isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 mutation status was prospectively determined by the Life Technologies Corporation Oncomine Dx Target Test. Participants randomized to placebo were allowed to cross over to vorasidenib after documented radiographic disease progression. Participants who received prior anti-cancer treatment, including chemotherapy or radiation therapy, were excluded. == Society and culture == === Legal status === Vorasidenib was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2024.

A Phase II/III clinical trial in 607 people, comparing it to the established vitamin K antagonist warfarin, found no difference in quality of anticoagulation or side effects between the two drugs in the overall population. Among patients taking CYP2C9 interacting drugs however, the tecarfarin patients’ TTR was 72.2% (n=92) vs 69.9% (n=87) for warfarin patients (pint=0.16); among patients who had both a CYP2C9 variant allele and taking a CYP2C9 interacting drug, TTR was 76.5% and 69.5% for the tecarfarin (n=24) and warfarin (n=31) groups, respectively (pint=0.24). This study included in 84 (14%) patients with a mechanical heart valve as an indication for anticoagulation therapy. No thrombotic or embolic events were observed in the tecarfarin treated subjects. In contrast to warfarin, tecarfarin is not affected by the cytochrome P450 inhibiting drug fluconazole, indicating a lower potential for interactions with other drugs. A randomized, pharmacokinetic study in which healthy volunteer subjects and patients with severe chronic kidney disease received single-dose warfarin or tecarfarin in a crossover design was performed. This showed that mean plasma concentrations of (S)-warfarin and (R,S)-warfarin were higher (44 and 27%, respectively) in the subjects with CKD than in the healthy subjects. Both of these values fell outside of the 90% confidence interval of equivalence. For tecarfarin, the difference was less than 15% higher. Elimination half-life (t1/2) increased by 20% for (S)-warfarin and by 8% for (R,S)-warfarin and decreased by 8% for tecarfarin.

Despite its promising antibiotic activity, the clinical development of clinafloxacin has been hampered by its risk for inducing serious side effects. == Medical uses == Clinafloxacin has not been approved for any indication. The investigational new drug application was withdrawn by the manufacturer in 1999, citing safety concerns. === Available forms === Clinafloxacin is available in both oral and intravenous formulations. === Specific populations === There is a warning against using clinafloxacin in pregnant patients, due to possible damage to the developing fetus. == Adverse effects == The use of clinafloxacin is associated with drug-induced light sensitivity (phototoxicity) and low blood sugar. Diarrhea has also been reported. The phototoxicity with clinafloxacin has been more associated with oral dosing as compared to intravenous dosing, though the studies that described this were subject to confounding by study site (that is, patients that received intravenous clinafloxacin were less mobile, and thereby received less sunlight exposure). The mechanism for clinafloxacin's phototoxicity involves the chlorine atom at position 8. In the presence of ultraviolet light, the chemical structure of clinafloxacin is degraded, resulting in the formation of toxic, reactive oxygen species that can damage cellular structures—including DNA. For this reason clinafloxacin can also be classified as a photocarcinogen (a chemical that can cause light-induced cancer), though the risk of developing cancer in humans taking the medication is small. The mechanism for clinafloxacin's effect on blood glucose is thought to involve stimulation of the pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin (a hormone that lowers blood glucose levels). The symptoms of clinafloxacin overdose are unknown. == Interactions == === Drug-drug interactions === Clinafloxacin inhibits multiple CYP450 drug metabolizing enzymes, especially CYP1A2. Clinafloxacin has induced the accumulation of CYP1A2 substrates, including theophylline, at therapeutic doses. This can also affect the metabolism of caffeine, another CYP1A2 substrate. Caffeine consumption must be limited while taking clinafloxacin to prevent caffeine accumulation and overdose. There is also a known interaction of clinafloxacin with phenytoin, resulting in a decrease in the clearance of phenytoin from the body. The increase in INR seen in patients taking both clinafloxacin and the anticoagulant warfarin has yet to be fully elucidated. === Food-drug interactions === There are no known food-drug interactions with clinafloxacin. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Clinafloxacin's antibiotic mechanism of action, like other fluoroquinolones is derived from its activity against type II topoisomerases DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Clinafloxacin has been described as a broad-spectrum antibiotic due to its activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, clinafloxacin has antibiotic activity against anaerobic bacteria, including the facultative anaerobe Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clinafloxacin's activity against anaerobic bacteria is higher than that of most other fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. === Pharmacokinetics === The time that it takes for serum concentrations of clinafloxacin to reach the maximum concentration (Cmax) in healthy volunteers after taking a dose by mouth is 0.7 hours. The elimination half-life in humans is 6.1 hours. Steady state levels of clinafloxacin are achieved in 3 days of twice daily dosing by mouth in healthy volunteers. About half of an administered clinafloxacin dose is found unchanged in the urine, meaning that the drug is cleared from the blood stream roughly equally by hepatic metabolism (liver-induced degradation) and renal elimination (kidney-mediated removal). == Chemistry == Clinafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone, structurally related to other fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin. It is soluble in methanol (about 2 mg/mL at 25 °C) and water. == History == In the 1990s, clinafloxacin showed promise as a novel, broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic. However, further clinical trials raised serious concerns regarding its safety in humans, citing dangerously low blood sugar, drug-induced light sensitivity, and multiple drug-drug interactions. == Research == Clinical trials have been done to assess its efficacy in sepsis and other serious and potentially life-threatening infections. == See also == Adverse effects of fluoroquinolones == References ==",Clinafloxacin,WIKIPEDIA,"('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0028822608292102814)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.00997321866452694), ('ICAL', -4.768370445162873e-07), ('<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>', -0.062039658427238464)])","('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])","('INFO; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinafloxacin,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4704148/,https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB14025 ', [])"
